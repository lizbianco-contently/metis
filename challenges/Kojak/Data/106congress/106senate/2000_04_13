Mr. President, I rise to speak about the issue of how we \nare fighting drugs in this country--specifically, the President's \ninitiative relative to the country of Colombia in relation to our own \ninitiatives on the southern border of our country.\n  I have the privilege to chair the committee that funds the INS, which \nincludes the Border Patrol, DEA, the department of drug enforcement; \nand the judiciary. All three agencies, of course, of our Government \nhave a significant role in the issue of drug enforcement and especially \nas it affects our southern border.\n  The President has asked for $1.6 billion of new money--he has asked \nfor it in an emergency format--to be sent to the country of Colombia, \nin order for Colombia to fight drugs and the production of drugs. That \nmay well be a reasonable request. I have reservations on its substance, \nbut I also have serious reservations as to its appropriateness in the \ncontext of the drug war that we as a Nation face. The reason is simple. \nWhen the President sent a budget up to address the agencies that are \nresponsible in our Government to fight drugs, he did not fully fund \ntheir needs. He underfunded the needs of the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, DEA; he underfunded the needs of the INS and Border \nPatrol; he underfunded the needs of the judiciary, which enforces the \nlaw.\n  I have made a little chart here that reflects a comparison. The \nunfunded capital--I am talking about capital needs, one-time items, \nwhich involve the construction or technology and needs of these \ndifferent agencies, the INS, DEA, and the judiciary. The unfunded \nrequests of these agencies represented about $1.8 billion--a little bit \nmore than $1.8 billion. Compare that with the fact that the President \nis willing to fund almost $800 million--million, not billion--of \ncapital needs for Colombia.\n  Let's do a little review of this because I think it is important for \npeople to understand what happened. Essentially, what the President is \nsaying is that the capital needs of Colombia are more important than \nthe needs of our own drug enforcement agencies here in the United \nStates. For example, the President has requested 15 Huey helicopters \nfor Colombia and 30 Blackhawk helicopters. They are the most advanced \nhelicopters we have in our fleet. Thirty Blackhawk helicopters will \ncost approximately $388 million. Let me tell you, those 30 helicopters, \nalong with the 15 Hueys, are going to go to Colombia.\n  Let me tell you what the Drug Enforcement Administration and the \nBorder Patrol have to fly on our borders in order to interdict drugs. \nThey fly old Vietnam-era helicopters. They aren't safe. In fact, many \nof them have been grounded. The Army, in fact, grounded almost all of \nits Hueys. But that is what we are left with.\n  DEA and INS have both requested aircraft in order to patrol the \nborders. Those requests were not funded by this administration. Yet the \nadministration turns around and is willing to give 30 Blackhawk \nhelicopters to Colombia. Who knows what will happen to those \nhelicopters. Who knows how they will be used. But I can assure you that \nthe first call, I believe, on new helicopters for the purposes of the \ndrug war should have gone to the departments which fight the drug war \nin the United States and which need them.\n  Another example: Night vision goggles. We are going to send $2 \nmillion to Colombia to buy night vision goggles. Yet here in the United \nStates, the Border Patrol and DEA are short on those materials. In \nfact, the Border Patrol is woefully short on night vision goggles, on \npocket scopes, on fiber-optic scopes, on hand-held searchlights--all of \nthese items the Border Patrol asked for and were not funded in this \nbudget by the President.\n  Yet the President has been willing to find the money, or suggested \nthat we should find the money, to send not only night vision goggles \nbut ground-based radar systems, secure communications systems, signal \nintelligence gathering systems, computers, and installation of sensor \nsights for aircraft. All of these items they have suggested we send to \nColombia.\n  In addition, they have suggested that we actually construct \nfacilities for Colombia to the tune of approximately $49 million--\nphysical buildings.\n  Let me tell you, both the INS and the DEA need physical facilities. \nIn fact, the Border Patrol is functioning out of extraordinarily \ncrowded facilities. Many of the Border Patrol stations are grossly \novercrowded. There is one site which is designed for 5 people with 125 \npeople working out of it. There is another site where the Border Patrol \nis working out of an old Tastee Freeze building. I guess you can use an \nold Tastee Freeze building. It is sort of hard to handcuff a drug \ndealer to a Tastee Freeze machine.\n  The fact is we do not have the facilities which we need in order to \nadequately enforce our laws relative to drug dealers coming across the \nborders and drugs coming across the borders. We don't have the \nfacilities to detain those people.\n  There is a detention need of approximately $406 million. In other \nwords, we need $406 million of construction in order to meet the \npotential detention needs for people illegally coming across the \nborder, many of them drug dealers.\n  The judiciary has the same problem. There is a massive increase in \nthe amount of caseload which the judiciary along the southern border \nhas to handle. Five district courts on the southwest border now handle \n26 percent of all the Federal criminal activity--26 percent of all the \nFederal criminal activity--and a great deal of that is drug related.\n  To put that in perspective, the remainder of the criminal activity in \nthis country is handled by 89 other district courts. Five are handling \n26 percent and 89 handle the rest. You can see how overworked those \nfive courts are.\n  The border courts' basic caseload is four times that of the national \naverage. Yet did the administration put money in to try to increase the \ncapacity of those court systems to handle this wave of crime that is \ncoming across the border, much of it drug-related? Absolutely not. \nThere are no physical facilities in that area.\n  I put up another chart which is a little more stark explanation of \nsome specific accounts.\n\n  For example, the aircraft needs along the southwest border, this is \nwhat was unfunded. This bar chart shows the unfunded needs for aircraft \nalong our southwest border. This shows how much the administration is \nwilling to spend for aircraft for Colombia. They are willing to spend \nthree times what it would take in order to adequately monitor our own \nborder with aircraft. They are willing to spend it in Colombia.\n  I have to say that I really doubt that aircraft in Colombia is going \nto end up doing the job. I do not know how it is going to be used. But \nI strongly suspect it is not going to be used very effectively if we \nlook at the history of what has happened with our efforts outside this \ncountry in the area of crime enforcement. I suspect what we will end up \nwith is some company in America making a heck of a lot of money because \nsomebody will buy 30 Blackhawk helicopters and ship them to Colombia. \nThat will be the end of it. That will be the last we hear of them.\n  But if the administration is willing to pay for the aircraft along \nthe border, the use of those aircraft would be accountable to the \nAmerican people. We would know whether those aircraft were being used \ncorrectly in law enforcement and drug enforcement. I can assure you \nthat my experience with the Border Patrol and the DEA is they would be \nused correctly, and we would get a return for the dollars that are \nbeing spent.\n  It is not only in the capital areas that this administration has \nacted, in my opinion, with gross irresponsibility in their obligations \nto fight the drug war here in the United States, by funding the \nColombian request but not\n\n[[Page S2649]]\n\nfunding the American needs, but more importantly, in the area of \npersonnel and initiatives, it is really unbelievable. This \nadministration is willing to spend $1.6 billion in Colombia, but they \nspent absolutely nothing in their budget on the methamphetamine \ninitiative of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Nothing. The \nmethamphetamine initiatives of DEA have been some of the most \nsuccessful initiatives they have undertaken.\n  Talk to people in Colorado, Missouri, Minnesota, and all along the \nsouthwest border. They will tell you methamphetamine is the drug that \nis growing most rampantly. It is growing at the most dramatic rate. Its \nproduction is growing at the most dramatic rate.\n  Two years ago, the Congress set up 10 initiatives in the area of \nmethamphetamine. They have been successful. Yet this administration has \nzeroed out for all intents and purposes any new initiative in \nmethamphetamine, even though the DEA specifically requested of OMB--\npart of the administration--and said they needed 10 more initiatives in \nthe area of methamphetamine. I think it was 10. But that was zeroed out \nby the White House while at the same time they are willing to spend \n$1.6 billion to buy planes for Colombia. It makes no sense.\n  We know that 85 percent of the methamphetamine that is being sold in \nMinnesota is smuggled in from Mexico. We know that. We know, if we are \ngoing to stop that smuggling, that we are going to have to have a \nborder enforcement capability that can identify it, track it, arrest \nit, and then prosecute it. But you can't do that if you are going to \nunderfund the DEA, the INS, and the judiciary to such dramatic levels. \nBut the White House has done exactly that. But who have they been \nwilling to fund for initiatives in Colombia? That is not the only \ninstance.\n  The Border Patrol was supposed to receive an increase of 1,000 people \na year for 3 years. That is what the Congress asked this administration \nto do. That is what we actually funded--1,000 people for 3 years. This \nadministration has refused to fill those slots. The administration has \nbasically refused to fulfill its obligation to fill those slots. So the \nBorder Patrol goes undermanned and in many instances underpaid. As I \nhave already pointed out, the facilities and equipment it has are \nwoefully inadequate.\n  The Border Patrol, obviously, does things other than just drug \nenforcement, but because the Mexican border is the primary vehicle and \nthe Mexican cartels are the primary force behind the drug flow into the \nUnited States, the Border Patrol is constantly being drawn into the \ndrug fight. Therefore, adequately funding the Border Patrol is critical \nto having an adequate drug enforcement policy in this country.\n  My point is simple and obvious. Before we send $1.6 billion to \nColombia, before we send this money down there so they can have more \nplanes, goggles, and radar sensors, how about funding the American \nneeds in the area of drug enforcement? How about funding our own law \nenforcement community and our Judiciary so we can act adequately, \ninterdict and fight drugs in the United States.\n  I believe this administration's priorities are skewed. I think this \nCongress has an obligation to take a hard look at the Colombian drug \nproposal when it comes here. In my opinion, we should reallocate \nsignificant amounts of those funds so we can appropriately fund and \nsupport DEA, INS, and the Judiciary.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, I want to pick up on a \ncouple of points I made last night regarding Elian Gonzalez.\n  My colleagues need to understand today this young boy is going to be \nyanked from the arms of his family, literally, at the direction of \nJanet Reno, and placed on an airplane and taken God knows where--we are \nhearing maybe to Bethesda--where he meets with Juan Gonzalez in the \nconfines of the Cuban control which is where this Cuban diplomat lives, \nor perhaps ultimately on an airplane and headed for Cuba. There are no \nrestrictions. We don't know.\n  The speech I made on the floor last night I thought was very \ncompelling regarding this situation. There is talk about how this young \nman is going to go back to his father. I will repeat briefly what I \nsaid last night. He is not going to go back to his father, if we let \nthis young boy go back to Cuba. The Cuban diplomats have already said \nthis young man is controlled by Cuba. He is a child of the state. He is \na child of Cuba. He is not a child of Juan Gonzalez--only biologically. \nBeyond that, he is not the son of Juan Gonzalez; he is the son of Cuba.\n  We have a 6-year-old little boy who survived a terrible incident at \nsea, watching his mother drown. Her dying words literally were: Please \nget Elian to the shores of America. The two survivors told me that \nthemselves because they saw her die, as did Elian.\n  Later they were separated and Elian floated for 3 days in an inner \ntube. When he was picked up by two fishermen, he was surrounded by \ndolphins. We know dolphins are a protection because sharks do not \ninterfere with dolphins. He was being protected by the dolphins. He had \nno sunburn after 3 days at sea. He told me he saw the Virgin Mary while \nhe was floating in this inner tube.\n  This is a very special little boy who had never been inside a church \nuntil he came to America. We now have said, the Justice Department has \nsaid, Janet Reno has said, this boy has no rights under the law. She is \nwrong. She has discretion under the law to send him back, but there is \nno law that says he must go back. I want to make that very clear.\n  I think the Senate should go on record, as tough as it is, and take a \nvote one way or the other, binding or nonbinding, but take a vote. \nEvery Senator should let the American people know how they feel about \nthis because Elian went through an awful lot--a lot more than most of \nus go through in our lifetimes. His mother died trying to get him to \nAmerica, and we have now taken her rights away. She has no voice \nbecause she can't speak for herself. Perhaps ultimately in the custody \ncourt without the Justice Department would be the right way to resolve \nit. However, the Attorney General has chosen to be confrontational, as \nshe did at Waco, and said he will be taken. She has made this statement \nover and over in the past several days.\n  I read the polls that say 61 percent of the American people say Elian \nGonzalez should go back to his father. This is not about polling. There \nwere no polls out there when Elian was floating around in the ocean in \nrough seas for 3 days.\n  I have met Elian Gonzalez and until yesterday I don't think Janet \nReno had. He is a special boy. He is going to be Castro's main \nobjective when he gets back to Cuba. This boy cannot succeed in saying \ngood things about America to his classmates. This boy will go into a \nCommunist education camp. He will be taken away from his father most of \nthe time, probably 11 months out of 12, and he will be ``reeducated.'' \nFidel Castro himself has\n\n[[Page S2650]]\n\nsaid this boy will be reeducated. He will be reeducated all right. Ask \nsome of the Vietnamese who came out of Vietnam what a reeducation camp \nis and ask some of the Cuban American community today what it is like \nin Cuba and why thousands have come here and thousands more have died \ntrying to get here.\n  Now because little Elian's mother drowned, he has no rights. I \nthought this was America. But I guess it isn't anymore.\n  I want everybody to understand what happens to Elian Gonzalez. We \nhear about Fidel Castro. You would think he loved this little boy and \nwould want to get the little boy back to his father. ``That is all I \nwant,'' says Fidel.\n  I will close on this point: On July 13, 1994, 72 Cuban men, women, \nand children boarded a tugboat called the 13 de Marzo and they set \nsail, hopefully, they thought, to freedom in the United States. Three \nhours later, 32 of them would be forced back to Cuba and imprisoned and \nanother 40--23 children among them--would be killed by the Cuban goon \nsquads of Fidel Castro.\n  Do you know how it happened? I will tell you how it happened. We got \nthis firsthand from the survivors: Two Government firefighting boats \npummeled the helpless passengers, who were unarmed, with water from \nhigh-pressure firehoses 7 miles off the coast of Cuba. The passengers \nrepeatedly attempted to surrender to Government officials, going so far \nas to hold their children in their arms up like this, saying: Please, \nthese are my children, stop, stop.\n  But the Cuban Coast Guard was relentless. The firehoses were \nenormous. Survivors said children were sprayed from the arms of their \nmothers into the ocean waters. Other children were simply swept off the \ndeck by the firehoses and drowned in the sea. Desperate to protect \ntheir children, some of the mothers went down below deck with their \nchildren. What did they get for that? The Cuban Coast Guard rammed \ntheir vessel again and again and sank it with these people in the hold.\n  Here is a picture of a little girl, Caridad Leyva Tacoronte, 4 years \nold. She was one of those children.\n  If Castro's goons could have caught that boat, they would have done \nthe same thing to Elian Gonzalez.\n  So I don't want to hear any more of this talk about how this is going \nto be the nicest thing for Elian, to go back to his wonderful little \nhome in Cuba and live happily ever after with his dad because that is a \nbunch of pure, unadulterated garbage. Let's face reality. If the Senate \ndoes not have the courage to stand up and vote and be on record against \nthat, then what do we stand for? What do we stand for?\n  Here is another one, Angel Rene Abreu Ruiz, 3 years old, sprayed from \nthe arms of her mother by a high-pressure firehose and drowned in the \nocean before her mother's eyes.\n  Elian did not get caught, so Castro did not kill him. He made it to \nthe ocean. The ocean, though, took the lives of his fellow passengers, \nall but two. One other couple and Elian survived. His mother died.\n  So rather than send this to a custody court--I am not asking anybody \nto make a decision on where Elian should go. All my resolution does, \nthat I have been trying to get a vote on now for a month and a half, is \nit gives permanent residency status to Elian, to his father, to his \nfather's current wife, and to his child, to Elian's two grandmothers \nand grandfather--all the family. It lets them come here free of Castro, \nsit down as a family, talk with the Miami relatives, and decide how \nlittle Elian's fate should be resolved. That is all I am asking.\n  But, oh, no, we cannot do that because Janet Reno and Fidel Castro \nhave decided the kid has to go back to Cuba. I want everybody in \nAmerica to know what is going to happen. I promise you, this is the \nkind of stuff that happens in Cuba. He is going to go into a little \nreeducation camp, and he is going to learn all about communism, and we \nare going to make mighty sure, in Cuba, that he does not tell his \nclassmates about Disney World or anything else nice that happened here \nin America. He is not going to let that happen. So he is a special \nlittle boy, all right, to Fidel Castro.\n  When I hear all this stuff about this nice little happy relationship \nwith Juan Gonzalez, his father--where has his father been for 4 months? \nHas anybody stopped him from going to Miami and sitting down with the \nfamily and talking this out? Yes. Fidel Castro has stopped him.\n  Do you know where Mr. Gonzalez' mother is right now? She is under \nhouse arrest in Cuba so she cannot move freely. Let's get real here. \nThat is where she is. He is afraid to say anything because he fears for \nhis mother's life. He has his wife and child here but he doesn't have \nhis mother here.\n  What a tragedy this is, that this little boy, who survived all of \nthis, is now going to be forced back and he has nothing to say about \nit. I am never going to forget, as long as I live, no matter what \nhappens, that little boy looking me in the eye about 2 months ago, 3 \nmonths ago, and saying: Senor, ayudame, por favor--help me, please. I \ndon't want to go back to Cuba.\n  I asked him: Elian, don't you want to see your father?\n  He said: Si, senor--yes, but I want my father to come here to America \nbecause that is what my mother wanted.\n  Frankly, that is what his father wanted, too, but he can't say it. \nHis father knew Elian was coming. He spoke to the hospital the night \nElian was rescued and he was in the hospital. The father spoke to the \ndoctors and to the family and thanked the family and the doctors for \ntaking care of him and said, ``I'll see you soon.'' But, oh, no. Then \ncomes the Attorney General blundering into this thing: Oh, no, this is \nan immigration matter.\n  Do you think he came in here by yacht?\n  Once again, I plead with my colleagues, whoever the powers that be \nare around here: Bring this thing to a vote today before 2 o'clock. \nDon't block it. Bring it to the floor and allow us to be recorded so \nthe American people will know where we stood on a matter as important \nas this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2650-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2650-S2653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         VOLUNTARY MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would like to talk a bit \nabout The Voluntary Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Act of 2000--S. \n2319.\n  This bill allows seniors to enroll in a new program under Medicare \nwhich will provide for prescription drug coverage without increasing \nMedicare premiums or costing the Federal Government one penny.\n  This is an issue about which, as you know, many seniors are very \nconcerned.\n  The Senate unanimously approved a sense-of-the-Senate amendment on \nthe budget resolution offered by myself, Senator Allard, and Senator \nDomenici.\n  This sense-of-the-Senate is very simple. First of all, under the plan \nthe Senate Democrats are committed to passing this year, there are six \nbasic principles.\n  I agree with them all.\n  No. 1, it is voluntary.\n  I agree with this. If the senior doesn't want it, he or she should \nnot have to take it.\n  No. 2, it is accessible to all Medicare beneficiaries.\n  I agree with that. A hallmark of Medicare is that all beneficiaries, \neven those in rural or underserved communities, have access to \ndependable health care. It should be accessible to everybody. The \nSmith-Allard plan is fully accessible for all beneficiaries.\n  No. 3, it is designed to provide meaningful protection and bargaining \npower for Medicare beneficiaries in obtaining prescription drugs.\n  A Medicare drug benefit should assist seniors with the high cost of \ndrugs and protect them against excessive, out-of-pocket expenses. I \nagree with that.\n  No. 4, it is affordable for all Medicare beneficiaries and for the \nMedicare program.\n  It should be affordable to all beneficiaries, and it should be \naffordable to the Medicare program itself. The Smith-Allard bill is \nfree. Free to all beneficiaries, free to the trust fund. If free \nqualifies as affordable, I think we are there.\n  No. 5, it is administered using private sector entities and \ncompetitive purchasing techniques.\n  The management of the prescription drug benefit should mirror the \npractices employed by private insurers. Discounts should be achieved \nthrough competition, not through price controls or regulation.\n\n[[Page S2651]]\n\n  We are five for five.\n  No. 6, it is consistent with broader Medicare reform.\n  None of the plans that I know of are consistent with this principle \nbecause they all cost the taxpayers of America in the upwards of $40 \nbillion dollars. And that's just to start. The President's plan is \nlooking at an additional $203 billion.\n  Medicare will face the same demographic strain as Social Security \nwhen the baby boomer generation retires. We need to save Medicare, not \nadd more of a financial burden to it.\n  So, these six principles I have listed are principles I totally \nsupport. They are principles that the Smith-Allard plan meets.\n  But we added three new principles: The plan should be revenue \nneutral; not increase Medicare beneficiary premiums; and provide full \ncoverage in 2001.\n  These three principles enhance and strengthen those put forth by my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  Let me briefly explain how my new legislation works:\n  Medicare part A--under the old system, the current system--has a $776 \ndeductible.\n  Medicare part B has a $100 deductible. In other words, if you go to \nthe doctor, the first $100 you pay for; if you go to the hospital, the \nfirst $776 you pay for; the rest, Medicare pays. That is total of $876 \nyou will have to pay.\n  My new plan would create one new deductible, combining those two \ndeductibles of part A and part B into one deductible of $675, which \nwould apply to all hospital costs, all doctor visits, and prescription \ndrugs--50 cents on the dollar up to $5,000.\n  And the prescription drug costs apply to the deductible, so every \ndollar you pay for a prescription moves you forward to meet the \ndeductible.\n  Once the $675 deductible is met by the Medicare recipient, Medicare \nthen will pay 50 percent of the cost toward the first $5,000 worth of \ndrugs the senior purchases.\n  However, the senior could not purchase a Medigap plan that would pay \nfor the $675 deductible. This must be paid for by the senior. But if \nyou have a Medigap plan now as a senior, you will not need it.\n  As a result, seniors would save about $550 under Medigap plans if \nthey traded their current Medigap plan for my new prescription drug \nplan.\n  Again, it is their option. It is voluntary. Seniors could even use \ntheir $550 in savings to pay the $675 deductible.\n  If you are a senior out there, and you have part A, part B, and you \nare paying $675 toward the deductible, and you have Medigap insurance \nof $550, you now can put the $550 toward the $675 to meet your \ndeductible. So you are going to have $550 in savings. You can put that \ntoward the $675, and you are already two-thirds of the way there.\n  But how do you get the cost savings?\n  As my colleagues are aware, according to the National Bipartisan \nCommission on the Future of Medicare, the Federal Government pays about \n$1,400 more per senior if the senior owns a Medigap plan that covers \ntheir part A and part B deductible.\n  The savings result because Medicare will not have to pay this $1,400 \nper person per year out of the trust fund.\n  As I mentioned, all hospital, physician, and prescription drug costs \nwould count toward this $675 deductible. Once it was met, the senior \nwould receive regular, above-the-deductible Medicare coverage, just as \nyou get now. Or if you worked out the numbers and decided against my \nplan, then you would not have to select it; it is your choice.\n  I have spoken to senior groups and health care providers, both in \nWashington as well as in my State over the past several weeks, about \nthis proposal. The response has been very enthusiastic.\n  Seniors want a prescription drug benefit. Doctors and nurses \nunderstand the importance of providing coverage for seniors because of \nthe expense of prescription drugs in this country.\n  It would be a victory for seniors and for health care in this country \nif we could provide this coverage to them.\n  In a recent press conference, President Clinton and Senator Daschle \noutlined their goals for prescription drug coverage.\n  Leaving the politics aside, the fact that elected leaders from both \nparties are looking at this issue of prescription drug coverage is good \nnews for the senior citizens of America.\n  I have talked with several of my Republican colleagues, and it is \nclear to me there is overwhelming support for allowing seniors to have \nthis choice. The only question among us all is how we can responsibly \nstructure such a program.\n  I heave heard from seniors in my State about what they are looking \nfor in a prescription drug plan.\n  First, they are concerned about the solvency of the Medicare program. \nThey want a program that does not add some huge financial burden to the \ntrust fund which will be passed on to their grandchildren.\n  Second, they do not want to increase the national debt, either. Yes, \nseniors are concerned about the national debt. Ask them the next time \nyou speak to a seniors group.\n  Third, seniors do not want new premiums. My plan requires no premium \nhike for seniors--zero.\n  As I have previously stated, the guiding principles of this plan, \nwhich may come as a shock to some of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle, are the same principles as those of the President and the \ndistinguished minority leader for any prescription drug plan.\n  I believe the vast majority of seniors will benefit from this plan. \nIn fact, every senior with a Medigap plan will definitely benefit.\n  Any senior with a prescription drug expenditure of more than $15 a \nmonth will benefit. Today, the Medicare part A and part B deductible \ntotals $876, which most seniors cover by an average $1,611 Medigap \ninsurance premium.\n  Let me go through some charts that will help explain how the plan \nworks.\n  First, it is budget neutral.\n  It is ironic to see the direction in which the Medicare reform debate \nis headed.\n  Do my colleagues remember what started these discussions about \nMedicare reform?\n  It was the fact that the program was going broke.\n  So why would we support reforms that cost the program billions more \nin spending and further increase its insolvency?\n  I want to support Medicare reform that preserves the integrity of the \nprogram, not some sham reform that adds new financial burdens we will \nnot be able to sustain.\n  For those of you who are skeptical that these numbers can work, let \nme say right off that I am not an actuary. I know budgets, but these \nare vast actuarial calculations we are talking about.\n  So, I wrote a letter to someone who I feel is in a unique position to \nmake an unbiased assessment of this plan. His name is Guy King, and he \nwas the Chief Actuary at the Health Care Financing Administration\n  Here is the letter he sent me.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter and a letter from Mark \nLitow, an actuary from the firm of Milliman and Robertson, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              King Associates,\n\n                                    Annapolis, MD, March 28, 2000.\n     Hon. Bob Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: This is in response to your letter of \n     March 9, 2000 asking for my analysis of legislation you \n     intend to introduce in the Senate. The proposed legislation \n     establishes a voluntary prescription drug benefit, the \n     Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, under the Medicare program.\n       Under the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, the current Part \n     A and Part B deductibles would be replaced by a single \n     deductible of $675 which would also be applicable to the new \n     prescription drug benefit. The Medicare program would pay \n     fifty percent of the cost of prescription drugs, up to a \n     maximum of $2,500 after satisfaction of the deductible. A \n     beneficiary who chooses the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan \n     would not be allowed to purchase a Medicare supplement policy \n     that fills in the $675 deductible, so special Medicare \n     supplement policies for those who choose the option would be \n     allowed.\n       The Medicare Prescription Drug Plan would be available, on \n     a voluntary basis, to any Medicare beneficiary not also \n     covered by Medicaid. The possibility of anti-selection is an \n     important consideration for a plan that is available to all \n     Medicare beneficiaries as an option. I believe that the \n     design features of the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, as \n     outlined in your legislation, minimize the impact of anti-\n     selection.\n\n[[Page S2652]]\n\n       As you requested, I performed an analysis of the proposed \n     legislation. This analysis is based on Medicare and \n     prescription drug data that I obtained from the Health Care \n     Financing Administration (HCFA). My analysis indicates that \n     the Medicare prescription Drug Plan, as described above, \n     would be cost-neutral to the Medicare program if it were made \n     available on a voluntary basis to all beneficiaries except \n     those also covered by Medicaid.\n       If you should have any questions regarding my analysis, \n     please don't hesitate to call.\n           Sincerely,\n     Roland E. (Guy) King, F.S.A., M.A.A.A.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Milliman & Robertson, Inc.,\n\n                                   Brookfield, WI, March 29, 2000.\n     Hon. Senator Robert C. Smith,\n     Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n     Re: Medicare Alternative Including Prescription Drug \n         Coverage.\n       Dear Senator Smith: At your request, we have analyzed the \n     impact of creating a new option for the Medicare population \n     that would provide coverage for prescription drugs. This \n     option would allow most non-Medicaid aged and disabled \n     Medicare beneficiaries, including those who are \n     institutionalized but not covered under Medicaid and those \n     with end stage renal disease (ESRD), a choice between \n     traditional Medicare coverage and a new form of Medicare \n     coverage referred to as the Prescription Plan. If the \n     individual chooses the prescription plan, the deductible \n     applies across all benefits (Part A, Part B, and drugs). \n     Coinsurance still remains as currently exists under Parts A \n     and B after deductibles, although the Part A extended benefit \n     is available as an option, and prescription drugs have their \n     own coinsurance levels as specified. If the individual \n     chooses to remain under traditional Medicare, no prescription \n     drug coverage is available.\n       The key components of the Prescription Plan option are:\n       The Prescription Plan has an aggregate deductible of $675 \n     for the year 2000 across all benefits. Coinsurance for Parts \n     A and B above the deductible are consistent with Medicare \n     today, except as noted in the following bullet. Coinsurance \n     for drugs is 50/50 on the next $5,000 above the deductible, \n     with no coverage thereafter, so that the plan's maximum \n     prescription drug benefit is $2,500.\n       Individuals have the option to pay an additional premium to \n     Medicare under the Prescription Plan of $21 per year ($1.75 \n     per month) that would provide full coverage of hospital \n     claims for days 61 to 90 plus Lifetime Reserve Days. \n     Currently, Medicare only covers a portion of the cost for \n     days 61 to 90 and Lifetime Reserve Days.\n       People can purchase a new Medicare Supplement plan to cover \n     their out-of-pocket costs above the deductible. Under this \n     scenario, premiums for the current Plan F (which exclude \n     prescription drugs) are expected to decrease by roughly $550 \n     per year on average. Coverage below the aggregate deductible \n     is not permitted.\n       People choosing to be covered under traditional Medicare \n     will have exactly the same benefits they have today under \n     Medicare. We believe the choice of current Medicare versus \n     the Prescription Plan is reasonably balanced so that a \n     relatively equal mix of healthy and less healthy individuals \n     will select current Medicare and the Prescription Plan. \n     Therefore, we do not anticipate significant amounts of \n     adverse selection with this choice.\n       The offering of Prescription Plan along side traditional \n     Medicare is estimated to be revenue neutral to Medicare. In \n     other words, the Prescription Plan allows individuals access \n     to prescription drug coverage at no additional cost to the \n     Federal Government. Election of the option results in no \n     change to the Part A and/or Part B premium, as applicable.\n       This system allows individuals two opportunities to change \n     options. The first is at their initial time of eligibility \n     for this program. The second is at the beginning of any year \n     that is at least four years after their initial option. In \n     both cases, the move can be made without evidence of \n     insurability.\n       Estimates of the aggregate deductible are based on our best \n     set of assumptions. A wide range of reasonable assumptions \n     exist that could either increase or decrease these values.\n       A number of data sources and assumptions have been used in \n     our analysis. These include:\n       The benefit design is applicable to the non-Medicaid aged, \n     disabled, and ESRD populations. The only population not \n     covered under this plan is that covered by Medicaid.\n       We estimate the Prescription Plan will result in an \n     aggregate decrease in utilization of approximately 5%. \n     However, we expect that the utilization savings will occur if \n     and only if the aggregate deductible cannot be covered under \n     any supplemental insurance plan.\n       We have assumed no price discounts on prescription drugs.\n       We have assumed that the choice between current Medicare \n     and the Prescription Plan is fairly equal. The reason is that \n     the higher deductible for Part B services will attract \n     healthier people under the Prescription Plan, while the drug \n     benefit will attract less healthy individuals. Given the \n     magnitude of the Part B benefit and the drug benefit included \n     in the Prescription Plan, we are unable to discern a tendency \n     for people in a certain health status to have a greater \n     inclination for current Medicare or the Prescription Plan \n     than would people in a different health status.\n       All estimates above are based on calendar year 2000 levels, \n     and should be properly adjusted for healthcare inflation in \n     years beyond 2000. We have not made any adjustments for the \n     new Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System which is \n     expected to take effect in early calendar year 2000. Our \n     analysis is based on the current Medicare payment system in \n     Part B services. Since Part B services and prescription drugs \n     would now be included, the trend rate applied to the \n     deductible in future years is critical to controlling the \n     cost of Medicare.\n       Cost and distributions of costs are based on the 1999 \n     Milliman & Robertson, Inc. Health Cost Guidelines Ages 65 and \n     Over. These Guidelines are based on an extensive analysis of \n     various data sets, including Medicare data.\n       The following caveats apply to our estimates:\n       1. The values included are estimates only. Actual results \n     may be better or worse than anticipated and could vary from \n     anticipated results. Thus, actual experience should be \n     monitored closely and revisions made as necessary to maintain \n     revenue neutrality and other objectives.\n       2. This letter assumes the reader is familiar with the \n     Medicare program and should be reviewed in its entirety. \n     Since our conclusions reflect assumptions specific to the \n     Medicare program, they may not be appropriate from other \n     situations. This letter is intended for distribution for all \n     who request, and therefore should be used in its entirety. \n     The results and assumptions may be misinterpreted if taken \n     out of context. As such, portions of this letter should not \n     be excerpted.\n       3. The opinions in this letter are those of the author and \n     do not necessarily reflect the options of others in Milliman \n     & Robertson, Inc. (M). M does not take any position on \n     specific health care reform proposals. There is uncertainty \n     associated with some assumption underlying this analysis. \n     Changes in the assumptions may have a material impact on this \n     proposal. Actual experience may vary from the results \n     projected in this letter.\n       This letter is a revision of an earlier letter dated \n     September 22, 1999. The assumptions supporting that document \n     were tested independently by Guy King of King Associates. The \n     changes made to that analysis are relatively modest, but we \n     have not as yet asked Guy King for his comments on these \n     changes. A copy of Mr. King's work to date was attached to \n     our September 22, 1999 letter.\n       If you have any questions or need additional information, \n     please call.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Mark E. Litow, F.S.A,\n                                               Consulting Actuary.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. There it is, folks. It's revenue neutral.\n  Let me talk about the premium issue, because this I believe is the \nmost explosive political side of this.\n  Seniors watch their budgets closely. If you try to sock them with a \nnew premium, they will not be happy.\n  Let me remind my colleagues what happened the last time we tried to \nslap new premiums on seniors.\n  This picture is an incident that occurred when seniors who were angry \nwith the enactment of the so-called Catastrophic Act assaulted \nCongressman Rostenkowski's car.\n  Congressman Rostenkowski wrote the legislation which increased \npremiums on certain seniors.\n  It would be a grave mistake to interpret seniors' desire for \nprescription drug coverage as a call for new higher premiums.\n  It would also be a huge mistake to think that there is any need for \nsuch premiums.\n  Let me show you how my plan compares with the Administration's plan \nas far as premiums and benefits.\n  This chart shows that the Clinton plan's benefits do not even start \nuntil 2003, and the benefits are not fully effective until 2009.\n  These premiums are just the new added government premiums. They do \nnot count other premiums such as Medigap.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this chart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Monthly premiums   Maximum annual\n                                     ------------------  benefits (50%)\n                Year                                   -----------------\n                                      Clinton   Smith-            Smith-\n                                                Allard  Clinton   Allard\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2001................................        0        0        0   $5,000\n2002................................        0        0        0    5,000\n2003................................      $26        0   $2,000    5,000\n2004................................       30        0    2,500    5,000\n2005................................       34        0    3,000    5,000\n2006................................       38        0    3,500    5,000\n2007................................       42        0    4,000    5,000\n2008................................       46        0    4,500    5,000\n2009................................       51        0    5,000    5,000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. This chart shows all the premiums seniors\n\n[[Page S2653]]\n\nwould pay. As you can see the drug premium is nothing. If a senior has \nMedigap, premiums substantially decrease from current law under Smith-\nAllard. Under the administration plan, they stay the same--averaging \n$230.75 per month. So, if you compare all premiums, a senior would save \nan average of $96.83 per month.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this chart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            MONTHLY PREMIUMS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Smith-\n                                                    Clinton     Allard\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDrugs...........................................      $51.00           0\nPart B..........................................       45.50       45.50\nMedigap.........................................      134.25       88.42\n                                                 -----------------------\n      Total.....................................      230.75      133.92\n                                                 =======================\nSmith-Allard Premium Savings....................  ..........       96.83\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Some might say this is not much money. \nBut let's take a look.\n  What could a senior do with $96.83 each month?\n  You can see that this is a lot of money when you think of how it \nwould impact other expenses seniors have.\n  These numbers come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer \nExpenditure Surveys.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we will look at annual deductibles.\n  Smith-Allard combines the hospital, medical, and drug benefits into a \nsingle deductible.\n  Because seniors spend an average of $670 per year, they would just \nabout reach the full hospital and medical deductible with just drug \nexpenses.\n  Under the Clinton plan, drugs don't count toward the deductible, so \neven though seniors would have a 50 percent drug benefit, they would \nnot be paying down their deductible.\n  I have talked about this plan with seniors, and they understand this \nconcept. They love it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these charts be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Smith-Allard\n\n       Saves seniors $96.83 in monthly premiums.\n       What could a senior do with $96.83 each month?\n\n\n                           prescription drugs\n\n       Seniors average $55 per month on drugs.\n       The premium savings alone would pay for all their drugs \n     twice.\n\n\n                                  food\n\n       Seniors spend $235 per month on groceries.

Let me just conclude speaking on this \nbill by saying that the benefits in this plan are delivered by private \ncompanies and regional entities, such as pharmaceutical benefit \nmanagers. These entities would negotiate with large drug companies and \nprovide the drugs to Medicare seniors.\n  In addition, according to the actuaries who reviewed the legislation, \nthere will be no adverse selection. Both the healthy and the sick will \nhave an incentive to choose this plan. Everybody is in.\n  There are many different methods of providing prescription drug \ncoverage for seniors, but I urge my colleagues--I plead with my \ncolleagues--to look to the revenue-neutral methods that fund this \nbenefit by the elimination of waste in the present system. I urge my \ncolleagues to resist the temptation to raise Medicare premiums on the \npeople who can least afford it.\n  I have vivid memories of seniors rocking Mr. Rostenkowski's car a few \nyears ago when he decided to raise Medicare premiums. Let's look at it \nmore specifically. The House's fiscal year 2001 budget--this is \nimportant--sets $40 billion aside for prescription drugs.\n  In the Senate, we are expected to do a budget that is going to set \naside $20 billion now for prescription drugs, and $20 billion later.\n  We don't need either under my plan. We don't need any more money. We \ndon't need $20 billion. We don't need $40 billion. We don't need $2 \nbillion.\n  Let's use the money for debt reduction or tax credits for the \nuninsured rather than providing for prescription drugs. Let's use my \nrevenue-neutral prescription plan instead.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at this approach. It provides \nprescription drugs in a way that will meet seniors' needs without \nhiking their premiums or adding more burden to the Federal treasury.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Reid, is recognized to speak for up to 20 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2653-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2653-S2655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INDEPENDENT COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this past Tuesday, the Washington Post \ncarried a story reporting that Independent Counsel Robert Ray, a lawyer \nwho was trained in prosecutorial ethics by Rudolph Giuliani and who \ntook over the special prosecutor duties from Ken Starr, is planning on \ncontinuing and even expanding his investigation of President Clinton. \nMr. Ray has hired six new prosecutors and another investigator and \nplans to increase spending over the next 6 months by $3.5 million. \nUnder this plan, he is seriously considering indicting the President \nafter he leaves office for a number of things. He includes perjury, \nobstruction of justice, making false statements, and even conspiracy.\n  When I read this story, to say the least, I was surprised. One year \nago, I stood in this Chamber at this same seat during the impeachment \ntrial of the President of the United States and compared what was \nhappening then to literature. I can no longer make that comparison \nbecause what is happening here is too outlandish and unbelievable to \nqualify anymore as literature. Every great story has an ending. Every \nplay has a denouement.\n  This investigation has already lasted 6 years. It has cost Nevada \ntaxpayers and the taxpayers of this country more than $52 million, not \ncounting the money this new prosecutor wants to spend in the next 6 \nmonths.\n  More than the length of this proceeding, more than the cost of this \nproceeding, this story has crossed the line from Kafka to ``The \nTwilight Zone.'' It has drifted from prosecutorial intemperance to the \nbrink of lunacy.\n  A number of years ago, the very articulate, brilliant Supreme Court \nJustice Antonin Scalia criticized the independent counsel statute. He \npointed out that with the typical criminal case, the prosecutor starts \nwith a crime and then looks for the perpetrator.\n  But with an independent counsel, the prosecutor starts with a suspect \nand searches to find a crime--any crime--to charge him or her with. \nOnce placed in office, the prosecutor has built-in pressure to bring a \ncharge rather than exonerate his target in order to justify his very \nexistence; and in this instance, the tens of millions of dollars \nalready spent. There is no more perfect example to what Justice Scalia \nwas talking about than this so-called case.\n  Let's trace the confused and wandering thread of this narrative. This \nall began with the 20-year-old land deal called Whitewater--an Arkansas \nland deal 1,500 miles from here. The special prosecutor spent millions \nof dollars. Nothing turned up. But he kept going. He put a woman by the \nname of Susan McDougal in jail for 2 years, even though she had \ncommitted no crime. There is no debate about that. And she had never \nbeen convicted in a court of law. There is no debate about that.\n  Why? He wanted her to change her testimony and implicate the \nPresident and the people at the White House.\n  She would not do that. She went to jail. Eventually, after an \ninnocent person, who had never been accused of a crime, had languished \nin jail for years, he gave up on Whitewater. He, the prosecutor, gave \nup on Whitewater, but he did not give up on looking for something on \nthe White House.\n  First, he investigated the unfortunate death of Vince Foster and \nreached\n\n[[Page S2654]]\n\nthe same conclusion other investigators had already reached. It was a \nsuicide.\n  I am personally resentful of what the prosecutor did in this \ninstance. What he put the Foster family through is untoward, unfair, \nand immoral. My father committed suicide. It is very difficult for a \nfamily to go through a suicide.\n  Vince Foster was a good man. No one ever disputed that. He was \ndespondent. He killed himself. That should have ended it. But no, what \nStarr wanted to do was to bring in all these conspiratorial theories \nthat the President had had him killed.\n  Can you imagine that? One of the President's best friends, and he not \nonly drags the President through this, but he also drags the Foster \nfamily through this.\n  This not only was immoral, in my opinion, but it cost millions of \ndollars. What did he get to show for it? Nothing. Then this \nprosecutor--persecutor, some would call him--took a look at the 1993 \nfirings at the White House Travel Office, and reached the same \nconclusion that other investigators had reached. There was nothing \nthere. Millions of dollars more, and nothing to show for it.\n  Then he took a look at a deposition in a civil suit brought by Paula \nJones. That suit was dismissed by a Federal judge. But no matter, the \nprosecutor hired to look at a land deal had struck gold with a lie \nabout a sex act in a case that was dismissed. He latched on to it, and \nrefused to let go.\n  It did not matter that he did not have jurisdiction over this issue. \nHe created jurisdiction by filing a statement with the Attorney General \nof the United States asserting the case had fallen into his lap by \naccident, when in fact there was credible evidence, sound evidence, \nthat his staff had been in close contact with Paula Jones' lawyers from \nthe very beginning and had worked with them and fed them information.\n  This is supposedly an unbiased prosecutor. He was obviously so \nexcited about what he had found that he began leaking information to \nthe press in violation of Federal law and Justice Department \nregulations. The court appointed an investigator to investigate the \ninvestigator. But no matter, he had found something that he could use \nto justify the millions of dollars he was spending, and he was not \nabout to give it up.\n\n  His investigators questioned Monica Lewinsky alone in a hotel room. \nCan you imagine the audacity of this young woman asking for a lawyer? \nShe asked for a lawyer. They denied her request. They would not let \nlegal niceties get in their way.\n  A first-year law student knows a person being investigated for a \ncrime is entitled to a lawyer. But not Ken Starr's minions.\n  The main evidence he had in this case were the tapes, the \nsurreptitious tapes made by one Linda Tripp, who has been charged \ncriminally by a Maryland grand jury for wiretapping. It did not matter \nthat the tapes were made illegally. He was going to use them anyway. He \nkept on going. Still not enough.\n  When Monica Lewinsky would not cooperate with his probe, he dragged \nher parents before the grand jury. He subpoenaed bookstores to find out \nwhat kind of books they were buying and reading. The public was \nappalled. I was appalled. But he was still going to go ahead. Still not \nenough.\n  After investigating for a year, the independent counsel released a \nreport to Congress that was embarrassing in its sexual explicitness and \neven more embarrassing in its biased reporting of the facts.\n  Monica Lewinsky said she had never been asked to lie and was never \npromised a job. But Prosecutor Starr never mentioned this once in the \nhundreds of pages of his report. It was so biased and so one sided that \nthis, among other things, turned the public against the independent \ncounsel and his unethical practices and unethical tactics. But no \nmatter, he kept on going. Still not enough.\n  The House of Representatives voted to impeach on a straight party-\nline vote. This body, the Senate of the United States, voted on a \nbipartisan basis not to convict the President on any charge. Democrats \nand Republicans, listening to the evidence, voted not to convict.\n  The Congress of the United States then decided not to renew this \nawful law that authorized the independent counsel. I always opposed it. \nThe law died last summer. And rightfully so. For 200 years, the Justice \nDepartment has done a good job. Over time, with the independent counsel \nwe have had some real travesties. During the Reagan administration, \nwhat was done to that President by the independent counsel was wrong. \nWe could go through other examples.\n  But even though the law died last summer, and it should have stopped \nthere, it did not. Still, Starr had not had enough.\n  After failing to convict the President, in one last, desperate grab \nat the glory that he thought had escaped him, Starr focused the power \nof his office on a story told by a person by the name of Kathleen \nWilley--a story of an alleged touch that was completely irrelevant to \nhis mandate.\n  Remember--Whitewater, Arkansas, 1,500 miles away.\n  When a friend of Ms. Willey, named Julie Hyatt Steele, dared to \ncontradict the story, in effect, saying that Kathleen Willey was \nlying--how could she dare do such a thing?--Starr indicted her for \nperjury. And not only that--she could probably handle the perjury \ncharge, which was so baseless--he threatened to have her children taken \naway from her. Who are these children? This good woman adopted orphans \nfrom Romania; and he threatened to send them back to Romania. What a \nguy--an innocent woman and her orphan-adopted children. These are the \ntrophies that special prosecutor Ken Starr had to show for all of his \nefforts and all the pain he had caused. But, no, still not enough.\n\n  Our weary Nation was thankful when Starr began scaling down his \ninvestigation and, in October, finally resigned.\n  I thought that was the end of the story. Most Americans thought that \nwas the end of the story. But surprisingly, apparently, shockingly, it \nis not the end. Still not enough.\n  The lynch mob, though, now has a new leader, one who is willing to \nprejudge the facts and unbalance the law in the spirit of his mentor, \nRudy Giuliani, and, of course, his predecessor, Ken Starr. The new mob \nleader is Robert Ray. Apparently, he is not going to let the acquittal \nby this body, or the resignation of his predecessor, or the expiration \nof the statute under which he supposedly is acting, stand in his way. \nStill not enough.\n  This is a long, sad, and sordid story that should have ended long \nago. The Office of the Independent Counsel has repeatedly stepped over \nthe line of decency in its quest to find something--anything--on the \nPresident.\n  Now, the new special prosecutor says he is considering indicting the \nPresident after he leaves office next year. I say, enough is enough.\n  The President has been tried in this body. He has been acquitted. He \nsuffered. His family suffered. His legacy is forever tarnished. He is \ndeeply in debt to his lawyers. The Arkansas bar is considering \nwithdrawing his license to practice law. He has not gone unpunished. \nApparently, that is not enough for Mr. Ray; still, not enough.\n  In primitive legal systems, such as those of Communist countries and \nother totalitarian dictatorships, every minor technical violation of \nthe law is met with the full force and fury of the government. Police \nare to be feared. But the greatness of our legal system is that it \nrecognizes that because human beings are frail and fall short of \nperfection, mercy must season justice. At its heart, criminal law and \nthe prosecutors charged with enforcing it exist to serve and protect \nthe public. Our legal system contemplates discretion. Not every \nviolation of the law should be pursued to the fullest extent because \nnot every crime is the same. The decision not to prosecute or not to \nbring certain charges is as much of a prosecutor's job as a decision to \nbring charges.\n  When the impeachment hearings began, I cosponsored a censure \nresolution that in lieu of impeachment proceedings would have \nspecifically provided the President remain subject to criminal actions \nin a court of law, such as any other citizen. That resolution was \nopposed in this body by Senators who instead voted to go down the \nimpeachment road.\n  I was a trial lawyer before I came here. I understand there are \noffers of\n\n[[Page S2655]]\n\nsettlement made and withdrawn. That was an offer of settlement that \nattempted to expedite things and not have the spectacle that took place \nin the Senate. But once it was decided that the proper legal course of \naction was to pursue the constitutional impeachment proceeding, the \ndecision should have been final and binding. It was still not enough.\n  Even Ken Starr, the original prosecutor, is quoted in published \nreports as holding the belief that once the Senate acts on an \nimpeachment vote, further criminal actions are totally inappropriate.\n\n  There is a concept in our system of justice known as double jeopardy. \nIt applies here. That doctrine holds that there is a limit to what a \nGovernment prosecutor can do to a United States citizen. It recognizes \nthat there comes a point where continued investigation crosses the line \ninto inappropriate Government harassment. An investigation into the \ntruth should not be allowed to become a vendetta against an individual. \nIt does recognize that enough is enough.\n  Many of his critics suggest that the President does not have greater \nrights under the law than any other citizen of this country. I agree. \nThat is true. But equally true is the fact that the President should \nnot have fewer rights than any other citizen. What the President did \nshould not be lightly or easily forgiven, but it should not be blown \nout of proportion either by an unrelenting, unfair, trophy-seeking \nprosecutor with an unlimited budget in search of a conviction that \nwon't serve the cause of justice. This case has gone on far too long. \nTens of millions of dollars, tragedy, embarrassment, double jeopardy--\nenough is enough.\n  It can best be summed up, Mr. President, by syndicated columnist \nRichard Cohen in today's Washington Post, printed in newspapers all \nover America, entitled, ``Independent Counsel Overkill'', which ends by \nsaying:\n\n       Give it up, Bob. Your best way of serving the country is to \n     close down your office, lock the door and put Clinton behind \n     you.\n       The country already has.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield whatever time I have remaining to the Senator \nfrom South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I anticipate the arrival of several other \ncolleagues who may wish to speak on the same subject matter.\n  Yesterday, members of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and \nother interested Members of this body, had the opportunity to meet with \nthe President of Colombia, His Excellency Andres Pastrana, during his \nvisit to Washington. It was an extremely informative meeting. It was \nalso apparent to all of us there that President Pastrana was terribly \ndisappointed that the Senate of the United States had not approved, or \neven scheduled, early consideration of President Clinton's emergency \nsupplemental request for Colombia to fight the narcotrafficking problem \nin that nation, which contributes significantly to the deaths and \nhardships in our own nation.\n  It is no hidden fact that some 50,000 people die in this country \nevery year from drug-related incidents. Ninety percent of the cocaine \nand a significant amount of the heroin that is consumed in this country \ncomes from Colombia.\n  Colombia has been devastated over the years by narcotraffickers. They \nare committed to trying to win this conflict. The European Community \nstands ready to help. They have asked the United States--the largest \nconsuming nation of the products grown in their country--to be a part \nof this effort.\n  The leadership in this body has seen fit to delay this action until \nthe normal appropriations process. I am disappointed by that, Mr. \nPresident. This is no small issue. It is a scourge in our streets. \nClearly, we need to do as much as we can here at home, but this battle \nneeds to be waged on all fronts, including in the production and \ntransportation of nations such as Colombia.\n  Colombia's civil society has been ripped apart for decades by the \nviolence and corruption that has swirled around their illicit \ninternational drug production and trafficking industry. High-profile \nassassinations of prominent Colombian officials who were trying to put \nan end to Colombia's drug cartels began nearly 20 years ago with the \n1984 murder of Colombia's Minister of Justice, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla.\n  In 1985, narcoterrorists stormed the Palace of Justice in Bogota and \nmurdered 11 Supreme Court Justices in that nation who had supported the \nextradition of drug kingpins and traffickers to the United States. In \n1986, another Supreme Court Justice was murdered by drug traffickers, \nas were a well-known police captain and prominent Colombian journalist \nwho had spoken out against these cartels. These narcoterrorists then \ncommenced a bombing campaign throughout the year, in shopping malls, \nhotels, and neighborhood parks, killing scores of innocent people and \nterrorizing the general population.\n  Before drug kingpin Pablo Escobar was captured and killed by the \npolice in 1993, he had been directly responsible for the murder of more \nthan 4,000 Colombians. In 1994, it became clear that drug money had \npenetrated the highest levels of Colombian society and called into \nquestion the legitimacy of the Presidential elections of Ernesto \nSamper. Even today, fear of kidnapping and targeted killings by members \nof Colombia's drug organizations has Colombia's citizens living in fear \nfor their very lives.\n  At this juncture, I ask unanimous consent that a column written by \nThomas Friedman, which appeared last week in the New York Times, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 11, 2000]\n\n                            Saving Colombia\n\n                          (By Thomas Friedman)\n\n       Bogota, Colombia.--I had a chat in Bogota the other day \n     with a group of government officials and businessmen, and I \n     asked them all one question: When you go outside, how many \n     security guards to you take with you? The answers were: 20, \n     6, 1, 8, 10, 2, 3, 8 and 5. No surprise. Some 3,000 people \n     were kidnapped here last year by guerrillas, and many judges \n     and journalists threatened with chilling messages, such as \n     having funeral wreaths sent to their homes--with their names \n     on them.\n       This is the terrifying context we have to keep in mind as \n     we consider whether the U.S. Senate should approve the $1.7 \n     billion plan to strengthen Colombia's ability to fight drug \n     traffickers and forge a peace with the guerrillas. There are \n     two ways to think about ``Plan Colombia,'' One way is to get \n     wrapped up in the details--the helicopters, the training. The \n     other way--the right way--is to step back and ask yourself \n     what kind of courage it takes to stay in Colombia right now \n     and be a judge who puts drug lords in jail or a politician \n     who fights for the rule of law--knowing the criminals have \n     millions in drug money and would kill your kids in a second.\n       It takes real courage, and that's why the people trying to \n     hold this place together deserve our support. Sure, the \n     democratic government of President Andres Pastrana isn't \n     perfect. But it has a core of decent officials who every day \n     risk their lives by just going to work. Ask yourself it you \n     would have the same courage.\n       I asked Mr. Pastrana why he stays. ``This is our country, \n     it's the only country we have to leave to our children,'' \n     shrugged the president, who was once kidnapped while running \n     for Bogota mayor. ``I believe in this country so much that \n     even after being kidnapped, and even after having my wife's \n     father killed by kidnappers, my wife and I had another baby--\n     a girl. Look, we've sacrificed the best policemen, the best \n     judges, the best journalists in this country. Whatever you \n     want to write about us, don't write that we are not on the \n     front line in the war on drugs.''\n       I asked the head of Colombia's navy, Adm. Sergio Garcia, \n     what it was like to be an officer here. He said it was sort \n     of like being a movie star, with people always trying to get \n     at you, only they don't want your autograph,\n\n[[Page S2656]]\n\n     they want to kill you--``so even your friends don't want to \n     be in a restaurant with you, and they don't want their kids \n     near your kids.''\n       Colombians tell this joke: After god created Colombia, an \n     angel asked God why he gave all the beauty to one country--\n     rain forests, mountains, oceans, savanna--and God answered: \n     ``Ha! Wait till you see what kind of people I put there!''\n       For years, Colombia's mafia processed cocaine grown from \n     coca in Peru. But as Peru drove the coca growers out, they \n     migrated to the rain forest in Southern Colombia--one of the \n     largest unbroken expanses of rain forest left on earth, but \n     also a region without much government. The drug mafia is now \n     chopping down the rain forest--thousands of acres each \n     month--then laying down herbicides, planting coca, processing \n     it into cocaine in rain forest labs, throwing the chemicals \n     in the rivers, and then flying the drugs out from grass \n     airstrips.\n       Underlying Colombia's drug war is a real 40-year-old social \n     struggle between Marxist guerrillas and rightwing vigilantes \n     (32,000 killings last year). But let's cut the nonsense: \n     Colombia's guerrillas may have started as a romantic movement \n     against an unjust oligarchy--they may have started as a \n     movement that ate to fight. But today, these guerrillas are \n     fighting to eat--fighting the government because they make \n     tons of money protecting drug operations in the rain forest. \n     In between the guerrillas and the vigilantes (who also profit \n     from drugs), Colombia's silent majority is held hostage.\n       Yes, Colombians are at fault for having been too tolerant \n     of the early drug lords. And Americans are at fault for their \n     insatiable appetite for cocaine. But here's the bottom line: \n     If we give the Colombian majority the aid it needs to fight \n     the drug Mafia there is a chance--and it's no sure thing--\n     that it will be able to forge a domestic peace. If we don't--\n     and this is a sure thing--the problem will only get worse, it \n     will spew instability across this region, and the only rain \n     forest your kids will ever see is the Rainforest Cafe.\n\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, the Colombian society is being ripped \napart by this problem. It is estimated that there are a million \ndisplaced people in Colombia and that 100,000 a year leave Colombia \nbecause of fear for their lives over what these narcotraffickers and \ndrug cartels have done to this country.\n  We often worry about political difficulties here. We get negative \nletters or nasty phone calls, and we think we are putting up with a \nlot.\n  In Colombia, if you take on the drug cartels, you and your family \nrisk your lives. Journalists, judges, police officials, if they have \nthe courage to stand up to these people, put their lives in jeopardy. \nThis drug cartel would not exist but for the fact that Americans \nconsume the products grown in this country.\n  I think we bear responsibility to work with a courageous government \nand a courageous people who are paying a terrible price because of our \nhabits and our consumption.\n  For those reasons, I am disappointed we can't find the time to bring \nup this supplemental bill, deal with this issue, and offer help to the \npeople of Colombia and to the government of Andres Pastrana, who has \nshown remarkable courage. This President was kidnapped by these very \npeople. He is not just intellectually committed to this; he knows what \nit is like to be terrorized by these people. He is committed to doing \neverything he can. He can ask us for our help, but we cannot seem to \nfind the time to bring up this issue.\n  When people wonder why we are not dealing more effectively with the \ndrug problems of this country, you can point to this. We spend days \ndiscussing insignificant issues, in my view, by comparison to this. Yet \nwe are told by leadership we don't have time to bring up an issue. At \nleast debate it, and vote it down, if you want, but give us a chance to \nvote on whether or not we think providing $1.3 billion over the next \nseveral years to the people of Colombia to fight back is worthy of this \ninstitution's time. I think it is.\n  The President has asked for it. The House of Representatives, to \ntheir credit, has done so. Yet this body refuses to bring up this \nmatter, even to discuss it on the floor of the Senate.\n\n  The legacy in Colombia is a legacy that President Pastrana confronted \nwhen he assumed office in 1988. He inherited the reins of government. \nSince then, he has demonstrated, in my view, leadership and a firm \ncommitment to address the myriad of challenges facing his nation--drug \nproducts and trafficking, civil conflict and economic recession.\n  I have enormous respect for the manner in which President Pastrana \nhas so quickly and aggressively taken steps to entice Colombia's \nlargest guerrilla organization--the so-called FARC --to come to the \nnegotiating table following on the heels of his election to office. The \nagenda for those ongoing talks covers the waterfront of economic and \nsocial issues that must be addressed if four decades of civil conflict \nare to be brought to a close.\n  President Pastrana has evidenced similar courage and a vision in \ntackling Colombia's illicit coca and poppy cultivation and processing \nindustry. He authorized the extradition of a number of Colombia's most \nnotorious drug traffickers to the United States, an extremely \ncontroversial decision in his country. He has also crafted a national \nplan--the so-called Plan Colombia--to address these intertwined \nproblems in a comprehensive fashion.\n  President Pastrana has made it clear to us that the Government of \nColombia is prepared to do its part in making available its own \nresources--billions of dollars--to fund the various elements of that \nplan for alternative development programs, for protection of human \nrights, for working for the resettlement of displaced persons, and for \njudicial reform, as well as assistance and training for Colombia's \nmilitary police, the counternarcotics forces.\n  During our meeting yesterday, President Pastrana made it clear as \nwell that he needs to seek and intends to ask for international \ncooperation if his plan is to succeed. In fact, he left last evening \nfor London to meet with members of the European Community and has \nalready received favorable indication that the Pacific rim will be a \npart of this international effort.\n  Colombia is currently the world's leading supplier of cocaine and one \nof the major sources of heroin. We are the largest consumer of these \nproducts. But this isn't only President Pastrana's problem; it is \nobviously ours as well.\n  All of the enormous demands in the United States and Europe for \nillicit products grown in Colombia are clearly an important part of the \nequation in keeping drug traffickers in business.\n  Moreover, despite billions of dollars spent here at home on law \nenforcement and drug education designed to reduce the U.S. demand, \nillicit drugs and consumption continue to pose a threat to the safety \nof our streets and to the health of the next generation of adults.\n  I know earlier today my good friend and colleague from New Hampshire, \nSenator Gregg, spoke about the fact that he is concerned that not \nenough money is being spent on domestic-related programs and programs \nto protect our borders against the onslaught of foreign drugs. If one \nlooks at the full picture of our counternarcotics efforts, only a \nmodest amount is currently being spent on the supply and reduction of \nthe source.\n  Assuming Colombia's supplemental is approved, only slightly more than \n15 percent of the total counternarcotics budget is being spent on \nprograms off our shores where the products are grown: $2.9 billion out \nof a total of $18.5 billion is what the Colombian program has adopted, \nwhich would be roughly half of what is being spent overseas; $1.3 \nbillion is being requested. A little more than $1 billion right now is \nbeing spent off our shores. More than $2 billion currently is being \nspent on border programs alone in this fiscal year.\n\n  If we do nothing to stem the supply at the very source, where it \ncomes from, then I don't see how a border program alone can prevent the \nexploding supply of drugs from reaching America's streets and \ncommunities--rural and urban.\n  I am all for adding more money to programs--as the Senator from New \nHampshire talked about--in the Drug Enforcement Administration and the \nCoast Guard. But I think we are kidding ourselves when we believe \nborder programs alone will shut out illegal drugs. We need to attack \nthis problem also at its source. There is not one place where this \nbattle is going to be won.\n  We need to do everything we can to make our borders more secure. We \nneed to make sure our police departments have the tools necessary at \nthe local level. We need training programs and rehabilitation programs \nto get people permanently off these substances.\n  But we also need to attack the problem at its source. That also is \npart of the answer. It is also why it makes\n\n[[Page S2657]]\n\nsense for Congress, in my view, to act expeditiously on President \nClinton's and President Pastrana's request to us, so we can attack the \ndrug problem as vigorously as possible at all these sources but \nparticularly in Colombia.\n  It is in our interest to provide Colombian authorities the \nwherewithal to gain access to areas in southern Colombia and elsewhere \nwhere coca and poppy cultivation has exploded in recent years but where \nguerrilla organizations and right-wing paramilitary units have made \ninterdiction efforts extremely difficult to conduct safely.\n  President Clinton has decided that Plan Colombia is worthy of U.S. \nsupport. The House leadership has also decided that it is in our \nnational interest to do so.\n  Fifty-two thousand Americans are dying every year in drug-related \ndeaths. That is almost as many as died in the entire Vietnam conflict. \nEvery year, we lose that many in drug-related deaths. If that is not a \nU.S. interest to which to try to respond, I don't know what is. As much \nas we need to fight this at home, we also need to fight it at its \nsource.\n  There is clearly bipartisan support for this program. It is not \nperfect. It is not a program I would even necessarily write, nor maybe \nthe Presiding Officer, nor would my colleague from California, whom I \nsee on the floor. But let's not fly-speck and nickel-and-dime this \nissue. Let's at least get it to the floor, debate it, discuss it, amend \nit, and modify it. But don't deny us a chance to even vote on this \nissue as we now enter another recess this year. For another 10 days, we \nwill not be here. The House is out, I am told, maybe another week after \nthat. Then it is May, June, and July. How many more deaths will there \nbe on our streets? How many more Colombians have to die because of U.S. \nconsumption and addiction?\n  They have a democratic government, the oldest democracy in Latin \nAmerica, whose very sovereignty is at stake. This country is being \nripped apart. They are asking for our help, for the cooperation of \nEurope and other nations to fight back against these people and this \nmultibillion-dollar operation.\n  We don't even have the time to debate or discuss it.\n  I promise you that over this Easter break, there will be a lot of \nspeeches given about the problems of drugs in our streets and our \nnarcotics efforts. Yet another day will go by when we cast one vote \nhere, or two votes here--maybe--and no effort is made to bring this \nmatter to the attention of the American public and to debate it on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Despite this bipartisan support, the measure is currently stalled. In \nthe Senate, the majority leader suggested the clock has run out on an \nemergency supplemental. That has not been the history or experience of \nthe Senate. We have dealt with many supplementals after April. I hope \nmaybe we can do so in this case as well.\n\n  We asked President Clinton during our meeting for his assessment of \nthe likelihood that Plan Colombia will work in the absence of U.S. \nassistance being forthcoming in the near future. We also asked about \nthe prospects for other governments contributing resources to this \neffort in the absence of U.S. moneys being forthcoming. President \nClinton stressed unequivocally that the support of the United States is \nthe linchpin to getting additional international support and for the \nultimate success of this plan.\n  Time is running out for the people of Colombia. Madam President, \n100,000 are leaving every year. A million are displaced. Thousands die \nevery year. We need to act now and provide the necessary funding so \nthat Plan Colombia can be fully implemented. It is the only way I know \nto protect the democratic institutions of that country and throughout \nthe region from falling prey to the criminal assaults of illegal drug \ncartels. Moreover, it is in our self-interest to do so. It is the only \nway to ensure that our children will be free from the threat of drug \npeddlers as they walk to and from school every day, that communities \nare safe from drug-related crimes which have taken the lives of too \nmany innocent victims.\n  There is still time to act and I hope we do so. I think it is tragic \nwe have not. I note the presence of my colleague from California, who \nhas been one of the stalwarts for years on this issue, and I am pleased \nshe is here to talk on this subject as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I begin by thanking the Senator from \nConnecticut. I don't think there is anyone else in the Senate who has \nthe kind of expertise about South America as has Senator Dodd of \nConnecticut. He speaks the language. He has studied. He has traveled in \nthe country widely. He has been to Colombia.\n  On how many occasions has the Senator been to Colombia?\n  Mr. DODD. I just came back. I was there a couple of months ago and \nspent time with President Clinton and others involved in this effort. \nThe most recent visit was just a few weeks ago.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I think the Senator has stated the case about as well \nas it can be stated. I have never been to Colombia. I come at this a \nlittle differently, as one who has watched the development of major \nnarcotics trafficking over a long period of time. My State is very much \ninfluenced and affected by this kind of narcotrafficking.\n  I have worked with Senator Coverdell of Georgia in the certification \nof Mexico. I have watched the development of the big transportation \ncartels because Colombia is the source country of most of the cocaine. \nI have watched the big transportation cartels develop in Mexico. I have \nwatched them interface with gangs in our country. I have watched \nCalifornia become the export State of gangs. The Crips and Bloods \nstarted in Los Angeles and are now in 118 American cities. I have \nwatched the gang deaths in America over drugs.\n  It is a huge problem. I have watched the debate over supply versus \ndemand. We spend dollars on demand. In fact, local jurisdictions are \nthe ones that mount the demand programs, the prevention, the \ncounseling, the drug abuse programs. The one area in which the Federal \nGovernment has total responsibility is interdiction at our borders; it \nis international narcotics, trafficking, and control. These big amount \nof drugs come from outside of the United States; therefore, what we do \naffects our role.\n  I did not know President Pastrana. The chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, on which I am fortunate to sit, had a meeting with him in \nthe appropriations room during his last trip. I met this young \nPresident for the first time. Prior to that, I had been visited by the \nhead of the military under the former government who pointed out with \ngreat alarm what he thought was happening and even said he didn't think \nPastrana was being strong enough in the drug area.\n  The former head of the military pointed out to me that a third of the \ncountry at that time was under control of narcoterrorists. That is a \ncountry the size of Switzerland. That is how large the geographic area \nis. He pointed out that a million and a half citizens were refugees \nwithin their own country; 300,000 had fled. He believed that 60,000 had \ntried to come into this country illegally, people who were devastated \nby this, running in fear for their lives because of it.\n  We do have a role to play. He pointed out to me there were 3,000 \ncitizens held hostage by narcoterrorists, 250 of them local police, 250 \nof them soldiers. Nobody knows what happens to these people.\n  I met President Pastrana. He was a very sincere leader, a leader who \nhad been sobered by this, a leader determined to do something about it, \na leader pleading for backup and help by the United States.\n  Is it in our national interests to help? I believe it is. All of \nthese drugs come to our country, all of these cartels interface with \nAmerican gangs, all of these cartels are brutal. They kill anyone who \nstands in their way--even a Catholic cardinal in Mexico. They kill \nnewspaper heads who write against them. They kill anyone who stands up \nand says no.\n  The question that Tom Friedman mentioned so eloquently in his New \nYork Times column--and I ask this of the Senator from Connecticut--if \nsomeone comes to you and says: here is half a million in an envelope, \nhere is a picture of your wife and where she has her hair done, and a \npicture of your children and the schools they go to, which will you \ntake?\n  I ask the Senator from Connecticut what kind of courage does it take \nto stand against that kind of entreaty?\n\n[[Page S2658]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from California has answered her own question \nby raising it. It takes a remarkable amount of courage.\n  I noted earlier and introduced as part of the Record the article by \nTom Friedman because they so clearly made the point, of the courage of \nthese people. I mentioned 11 members of the Supreme Court in Colombia \nwere gunned down in 1985. Literally thousands of people are kidnapped \nand executed every year; journalists, just by being there and speaking \nout or saying anything against these narcotraffickers.\n  This is a business that collects $60 billion a year from this country \nalone. President Pastrana tells me that in Colombia $100 million is \nused just to bribe local police officers and functionaries who in some \ncases earn less than $100 or $200 a month to raise their families. Then \nsomeone shows up and offers them an envelope of thousands of dollars to \nturn the other way, look the other way, don't examine the truck.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have seen it impact our border areas in the United \nStates. I go down to Otay Mesa where trucks are lined up by the \nthousands and you have Customs agents who maybe earn $45,000 or $50,000 \na year--we know some trucks are loaded with tons of cocaine, with \nstreet values of millions of dollars--taking a bribe, maybe half a \nmillion dollars just to turn their head and let that truck go through.\n  This is where the corruption becomes so evil and where it is not just \nconfined to jungle areas of Colombia or outposts in Mexico or anywhere \nelse in the Andean region but comes right into the United States as \nwell.\n  Mr. DODD. If the Senator will yield further, it is this corrosive \ncorruption that spreads. It begins in a small hamlet or borough in \nColombia, and once it gets through there, then it reaches up into the \nhigher elevations of Government there and then spills across the \nborders. Before you know it, as the Senator from California has pointed \nout, it spreads. If you do not stand up to these people early on and \nfight back, then you, in a sense, become an accomplice to the results, \nto what occurs.\n  We have been asked, as the Senator from California has pointed out, \nby the good and decent Government of President Pastrana, that our \nNation step up and help--not do it all, not take on the entire \nresponsibility, but to help him regain the sovereignty of his own \nnation, to eliminate the corruption, and give the people of Colombia a \nchance for a decent future.\n  Our inability to bring up this supplemental to at least debate and \ndiscuss this issue is deplorable and sad, deeply sad--that we do not \nhave the time, apparently, to discuss this kind of issue which can make \nsuch a difference in the lives of the people of Colombia and, more \nimportantly, in some ways, to the citizens of this country who lose \ntheir children every day to these drug cartels, these gangs terrorizing \nthe streets of this country because of drugs. Mr. President, 52,000 a \nyear die on average in drug-related deaths. If that is not enough of a \nU.S. interest to respond to it, I don't know what is.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Connecticut. I \nthink the point is well taken. I, for one, was delighted--because I \ntend to read all of Tom Friedman's articles in the New York Times--he \nspent time in Colombia. I was so pleased that he saw what was the \ncentral point in all of this debate. I want to quote him. I know the \nSenator did earlier, and I hope this is not redundant.\n  He said there are two ways to look at Plan Colombia. One is to get \nwrapped up in the details--the helicopters, the training, why we might \nor might not like it. The other way, and he suggests the right way, is \nto step back and ask yourself: What kind of courage does it take?\n  That is what we are talking about here, what kind of courage it takes \nto stay in Colombia right now--to be a judge who puts drug lords in \njail or be a politician such as the President of the country, or the \nAttorney General, or the generals of the army, or local public \nofficials who fight for the rule of law, knowing that criminals have \nmillions of dollars in drug money and would kill their kids in a \nsecond. That is not an esoteric concept. The numbers of children of \nfamilies who have been killed in drug wars are legion.\n  These people do not care for anybody who stands in their way. The \ndebilitating part about it is the ability to corrupt to get your way. \nHow many people can actually stand up to that? We see over and over and \nover again where a respected public official, a police officer, a \njudge, a prosecutor gives in to this kind of tyranny. The Ariano Felix \nCartel in Mexico is notorious for this. They will kill anybody standing \nin their way. Their cocaine comes right out of Colombia. There you have \nthe narcoterrorists controlling a third of their country and everybody \nand everything within that third.\n\n  So the real courage, as Mr. Friedman points out, is that the people \nwho are trying to do the right thing deserve our support. This is our \nhemisphere; it is not another hemisphere. The results of drug \ntrafficking, the results of narcoterrorism, only spread. They do not \ncontain themselves; they spread. The spread is northerly into our \ncountry.\n  So I make this point again and again and again: This supplemental \nappropriation, an appropriation in our budget, is in our national \ninterest. It is in the American national interest to stand tall against \nthe cartels, to stand tall against this kind of terrorism, to support \npublic officials who are willing to do the same thing. That support \nshould be for the Attorney General of Mexico, the President of Mexico, \nthe President of Colombia, the Attorney General of Colombia, the Judges \nof Colombia, the people who have been able to come back from M-11 and \nwhat was done in their country to try to institute a democracy. These \nare the people who recognize that, yes, there are problems but they are \ntrying to make the changes. The people who plead to this country say: \nHelp us. Don't do the whole thing; just do a part of it. Put your \nimprimatur of leadership on it so other nations will follow and so we \nwill have the ability to control something which, if we do not, will \nspread through the whole Andean region and, I contend, to Mexico and to \nthe United States as well.\n  I think you have, essentially, a major battle in this area of South \nAmerica that will effectively determine the future of these countries--\nColombia, the Andean region, Mexico--and to a degree our own country.\n  I very much hope people will reconsider and really look at how \nimportant it is to stop this trafficking. I remember the day--and it \nwas in the 1980s--we in the cities of America never saw an arrest \ninvolving a ton of cocaine or a ton of any other substances, hundreds \nof pounds of drugs at one time. Now the arrests are being made, and \nthey are finding 5 tons, 6 tons, 4 tons.\n  The business that is inherent in this, the corruption that comes with \nit, is so enormous it is beyond anything we can possibly conceive. The \ncomplicity by transportation companies is one of the reasons Senator \nCoverdell and I worked together on this drug kingpin bill, to apply the \nRICO statutes to companies doing business with the cartels who simply \nturn their heads when there are 5 tons of cocaine on a train coming \ninto this country or in a container as part of a fleet of trucks that \ncome across the border every day. People have to open their eyes. They \nhave to see what is happening. We have to begin to support the leaders \nwho will stand tall.\n  I will be very candid with the Senator from Connecticut and our \ndistinguished Presiding Officer from the great State of Maine. If \nsomebody came to me with a picture of my daughter or my granddaughter, \nI don't know what I would do. I don't know. I believe I would tell them \nwhere to get off, but I don't really know. It is like the person who \njumps in the river to save someone who is drowning. You don't really \nknow until you are in that situation.\n  The fact is, thousands of people in Colombia are in that situation on \na daily basis. What they are saying is: Help, United States. Use your \nleadership. Give us the resources because we need helicopters that can \nfly at a certain altitude and have a certain range. The Huey cannot do \nit; it is the Black Hawk. We need a certain altitude for certain areas. \nThe Huey can't do it; give us the Black Hawk. Help us with some of this \nother equipment we need and stand by us as we make the battle real.\n\n[[Page S2659]]\n\n  If we are to put our money where our mouth is, it has to be to fight \nthe major trafficker. It has to be to fight the narcoterrorist. It has \nto be to stand up for the political leaders who are willing to stand \nagainst them.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, if my distinguished colleague will yield \none more time, I commend her immensely for her heartfelt statement and \nuse this as another appeal. We are leaving for another week now. There \nare only two of us here, but I suspect our sentiments are shared by a \nmajority of our colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats. We make an \nappeal to the majority leader to reconsider this decision on bringing \nup a supplemental, a boiled-down one if necessary, to focus on this \nissue and a couple of others that legitimately fall into the category \nof emergency.\n  I say this because I think the last statement made by our \ndistinguished colleague from California is an important one. What we \nsay here does not go unnoticed. What we do here or not do here does not \ngo unnoticed. The greatest fear the narcotraffickers have is that there \nwill be a united front to take them on.\n  That is their greatest fear. They worry about a government in \nColombia that is not afraid to extradite. They do not want to be \nextradited because they know we are not afraid to lock them up forever, \nif necessary. They are frightened about a European Community and other \nLatin American countries joining in a common effort. As every one of \nthese leaders will tell you, they know what happens in Colombia can \nhappen in Venezuela, in Ecuador, and happened in Peru. It is happening \nin Bolivia. These are better financed operations than any insurgency we \nhave seen before with millions of dollars.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Can I ask the Senator a question? I believe the \nSenator was in the Senate when President Bush gave the order to send \nAmerican troops to Panama because so many heavy narcotics were coming \nthrough Panama, much of it under the control of one person, a general \nby the name of Manuel Noriega. They picked up this general and brought \nhim back to the United States for trial. To this day, he is in Federal \nprison in the United States, and the problem has been remedied in \nPanama. This was the kind of direct recognition of a problem and a \nresponse that has solved the problem. Does the Senator agree?\n  Mr. DODD. I do. I say to my friend and colleague from California, I \nremember it very well. In fact, the decision to go in was made late at \nnight. There was talk about it ahead of time. I received a call, as I \nthink other Members of the Senate did, in the wee hours of the morning \ninforming us that the effort was about to be undertaken.\n  I recall early that morning going on a couple national television \nprograms to discuss it. I expressed my strong support for what \nPresident Bush was doing in Panama. I thought it was important he have \nbipartisan support in the effort in Panama.\n\n  The Senator from California is absolutely correct, General Noriega \nwas removed. While the problem has not been eliminated entirely in \nPanama, that action certainly made a huge difference. It is a good case \nto point out.\n  We need that kind of leadership in the Senate on this issue, in my \nview. The narcotraffickers in Bogota, Colombia, in the flatlands, the \nllanos, as they call them, of southern Colombia know what we are not \ndoing in the Senate. They know President Pastrana has asked for our \nhelp. They are watching, and they see a Senate of the United States \nthat says it does not have time to bring this up or does not think it \nis that important to bring up. I can tell my colleague firsthand there \nis no more encouraging sign to these people than our apparent \ndisinterest in the subject matter.\n  Every day we wait and do not respond, their grip grows stronger. I am \nnot exaggerating when I tell the Senator that the sovereignty of this \ncountry of Colombia is at stake.\n  The Senator from California has pointed out a third of the country \nhas already been lost to them. The oldest democracy in Latin America \ncan be lost. Mark my words. This is a well-heeled and well-financed \noperation. Millions of dollars every day pour into the coffers of these \ninsurgency groups through the narcotrafficking efforts. If we wait \nanother week or another month, we make it that much more difficult to \naddress this issue. We have a courageous President and a courageous \ncountry in Colombia and other nations willing to step up.\n  We are the largest consuming country. We are the addicted nation. The \nreason these campesinos and farmers grow the poppy seeds and grow the \nheroin is because there are people here who consume it.\n  The journalists, the politicians, the judges, and the police officers \nare willing to fight back. They want to know whether or not we are \ngoing to join with them in that fight. That is all we are asking: Stand \nup and join them in that fight.\n  I am hopeful, again, before too many more weeks go by that we will \nrespond. The admiration I have for the House for having done so is \ntremendous. My admiration for the President for calling on us to do it \nis tremendous.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Can I bring up another subject? One of the criticisms \nI have heard is we spend too much on this kind of activity already, and \nwe need to spend more on demand. In fact, as we both know, there are \nprovisions in this bill to meet the demand needs in our own country.\n  Mr. DODD. Right.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I was interested in finding out how much of our \nentire drug control budget is devoted to international drug control \nefforts. Does the Senator have an idea what that amount is?\n  Mr. DODD. I do. The total amount we spend--my colleague can correct \nme--is about $18.5 billion total--domestic and foreign, all the \nefforts. Of the $18.5 billion, if one excludes the Colombian plan \nmoney, it is about $1.5 billion out of the--three my colleague is about \nto say?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No, it is 3 percent.\n  Mr. DODD. Three percent.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Only 3 percent of that entire drug budget, which the \nSenator just accurately stated, goes to international narcotics \ncontrol. Yet we know the drugs are coming in in 5-ton lots. We know the \none area of responsibility we have is to control the borders in \ninternational drug control. No local government can do that, most \ncertainly, and yet only 3 percent of the budget goes for that.\n\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague says we spend about $2 billion on our borders, \nas she points out, and on the drug abuse programs, the efforts of local \nauthorities, but it is a fraction. I am not suggesting and I do not \nthink my colleague from California is suggesting we spend all of the \nmoney there or even a half of the money there. This is a multifaceted \neffort.\n  We have to spend it locally. We have to fight it at the local level. \nWe have to have rehabilitation efforts, drug abuse efforts. We have to \nbe fighting it at the borders of this country, but we also need to go \nto the source, and we are not going to the source.\n  Here is a country willing to fight back. Many times we find it \ndifficult to get cooperation from governments. Here is the President of \nColombia who was kidnaped and knows firsthand what it is to live under \nthis kind of system, who is coming to us and saying: Look, we are going \nto put $4 billion of our own money into this effort. The Europeans are \nwilling to step up. Can you help? The addicted nation, can you help?\n  Up to this point, this Chamber has said no.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will conclude with one additional comment. Colombia \nis the source country for 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in this \nNation. It is the source country of 70 percent of the heroin consumed \nin this Nation. It is a country under siege. It is a country where one-\nthird of the geographic area is controlled by narcoterrorists, and it \nhappens to have a government that is willing to stand up and say: We \nwant to do something about it. United States, help us in a multilateral \neffort do something about it.\n  This Senate is saying it does not have time to consider the request. \nIt is in our national interest to consider the request. It is in our \nnational interest to have debate on the request. It is in our national \ninterest to appropriate the dollars for this request.\n  I end by summarizing something Mr. Friedman said in the New York \nTimes:\n\n       If we give the Colombian majority the aid it needs to fight \n     the drug Mafia, there is a chance--and it's no sure thing --\n     that it will\n\n[[Page S2660]]\n\n     be able to forge a domestic peace. If we don't --and this is \n     a sure thing--the problem will only get worse, it will spew \n     instability across this region, and the only rain forest your \n     kids will ever see is the Rainforest Cafe.\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business until 2 \no'clock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2660-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2660-S2661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE WEALTH GAP\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, in the debate over tax cuts our attention \nis understandably drawn to the question of who pays those taxes and \nfrom this a debate commonly ensues over who should get the benefits of \ntax reductions. This argument leads us to consider the disparities of \nincome and the need to make certain that our tax laws are not written \nso as to increase income inequality and hopefully to write our tax laws \nin order to give a boost to those whose wages are lower.\n  Today, I rise to talk about a problem facing Americans that is \nrelated to but different from the income inequality. The problem I will \naddress today is the growing gap between the richest Americans and the \npoorest.\n  The latest Statistics of Income Bulletin from the IRS shows that the \ncombined net worth of the top 4.4 million Americans was $6.7 trillion \nin 1995. In other words, the top 2.5 percent of our population held \n27.4 percent of the Nation's wealth in the mid-1990s. No doubt this \ngroup of wealthy Americans feels very financially secure.\n  But what about the other 97.5 percent of Americans? Is the security \nof wealth spread in a reasonably equitable way across all American \nhouseholds? The answer in my view, is a tragic and emphatic no.\n  Although there is a perception that the recent rapid growth in the \nstock market has produced widespread economic gains among all income \ngroups, a majority of households still do not own stock-based assets \nand, thus, have not participated in the growth of the 1990s economy. A \ncomplete picture is presented in the United States Federal Reserve's \nSurvey on Consumer Finances. This report provides us with the following \nstatistics:\n  Since 1989, the share of net worth owned by the top 1 percent of \nAmerican households has grown from 37.4 percent to 39.1 percent, while \nthe share of net worth held by the bottom 40 percent of households has \ndropped from .9 percent to a statistically near insignificant .2 \npercent.\n  Nearly 60 percent of the wealth held by families in the lowest 90 \npercent of the population is in the family home--not liquid assets that \ncan be used as a source of income and security at retirement. Families \nin the lowest 90 percent of the population had only 3 percent of their \nassets in stocks and bonds.\n  While an increasing number of Americans are purchasing stock-based \nequities--49 percent in 1999 vs. 40 percent in 1995--only 29 percent of \nhouseholds own stock worth more than $5,000, and the top 10 percent of \nhouseholds in the distribution hold 88.4 percent of the value of all \nstocks and mutual funds. In fact, the top 1 percent holds 51.4 percent \nof the value of all stocks and mutual funds--while the bottom 90 \npercent hold just 11.6 percent of the total value.\n  These statistics show that the gains of the great 1990s stock market \nrunup have not benefitted a majority of Americans. The gains have not \nnarrowed the gap between the wealthiest in America and the poorest in \nAmerica. In fact, the data analyzed in a study done by the preeminent \nwealth statistician, Mr. Ed Wolff, reveals that the wealthiest 10 \npercent of households enjoyed 85 percent of the stock market gains from \n1989 until 1998.\n  Why should we be so concerned about the growing wealth gap? I believe \nthe answer is that the ownership of wealth brings security to people's \nlives and because the ownership of wealth opens up new opportunities \nand because the ownership of wealth transforms the way people view \ntheir futures.\n  An individual with no financial assets--and no means to accumulate \nfinancial assets--cannot count on a secure retirement, cannot ensure \nthat his or her future health care needs will be met, and cannot save \neffectively for important life milestones, such as the purchase of a \nfirst home or the funding of a child's college education.\n  Americans clearly understand and desire the freedom and security that \ncomes with wealth. We can point to the ongoing increase in \nparticipation rates in 401(k) plans as evidence that people are \nconcerned about amassing wealth for a secure retirement. We can even \npoint to the continued growing popularity of lotteries and game shows \nlike ``Who Wants to Be A Millionaire'' as evidence that people value \nthe security of wealth--especially wealth that is acquired quickly.\n  The virtues of savings and wealth accumulation are clear. But if the \nvirtues are so clear, why aren't more Americans voluntarily increasing \ntheir savings? Not a TV show goes by without an advertisement from a \nfinancial services company offering investment advice and investment \nproducts. Not a week goes by without a front page story about the \nSocial Security funding ``crisis''--implicitly warning people to save \nfor their own retirements. So why aren't more Americans saving?\n  I have identified barriers that I believe continue to prevent a \nsubstantial portion of the American population from being able to save, \nto invest, and to accumulate wealth.\n  Barrier No. 1 is education.\n  No single factor is a greater predictor of income and wealth than \neducation. Property educated and trained individuals can command a \npremium salary because they are in high demand and in short supply. \nOnly one-third of households are headed by someone with a college \ndegree. These households have a median before-tax income of $55,000 and \na median net worth of $146,400. Households headed by a person with no \nhigh school diploma have a median income of $15,500 and a net worth of \n$20,000.\n\n  In addition to disparate levels of educational attainment, there is a \nhuge problem in America with a specific lack of investor education. \nEconomics and Finance are not required courses in most school districts \nacross the United States. As a result, too few people understand the \nmagic of compounding interest rates and, as a consequence, wait too \nlong to begin saving for their retirement.\n  The second barrier is income.\n  Of course, one of the fundamental rules of wealth accumulation is \nthat you must have income that you can set aside in order to create \nsubstantial wealth. A quarter of families in the United States are \nbringing home between $10,000 and $25,000 a year. Forty percent of \nAmerican households are bringing in less than $31,000 per year. After \nFICA taxes of $2,372 and $2,600 in Federal and State income taxes, a \ntypical family of four has little left over for savings.\n  Not only have low and moderate income Americans not shared in the \ngrowth of a booming stock market, but they have also not shared in the \ngrowth of weekly paychecks. According to the most recent Survey on \nConsumer Finances by the Federal Reserve Board, mean income grew \nbetween 1995 and 1998 only for families headed by individuals with at \nleast some college education--mean incomes for all education groups in \n1998 were lower than they had been in 1989. Median income only rose \nappreciably between 1989 and 1998 for those with a college degree.\n  When you look at two of the lowest income groups, the story of income \nstagnation is quite grim. Nearly 13 percent of families earned less \nthan $10,000 in 1998. The median salary of this group was $6,200--a \nreal decline of 6 percent since 1989. Nearly one-quarter of families \nearned between $10,000 and $25,000 in 1998. Of these families, the \nmedian salary was $16,900--a real increase of only 2.4 percent since \n1989. Clearly, the capacity of this group to save on its own is very \nlimited.\n  Barrier No. 3 is payroll taxes.\n  The payroll tax may not seem like much of a barrier to Americans with\n\n[[Page S2661]]\n\nincome over $100,000, who only have to pay taxes on the first $76,200 \nof income, but to American families earning less than $25,000--40 \npercent of all households--it is a tremendous bite. The total payroll \ntax paid by an individual earning $25,000 per year and his employer is \n$3,825. This is several times greater than their income tax bill. For \nthose who propose spending the Social Security tax surplus to enhance \nSocial Security or Medicare benefits, it is worth noting that the \nlowest 40 percent of American earners pay more than 40 percent of the \nbenefits for both Social Security and Part A Medicare. And those are \nthe individuals must apt to be uninsured.\n  Barrier No. 4 is the burden of debt.\n  Consumer debt has a major impact on a household's ability to save. \nAccording to the latest SCF, households earning less than $25,000 \nannually bear the most significant burden of debt compared to their \nincome. The median ratio of debt payments to income among those earning \nless than $10,000 is 20.3 percent; among those earning $10,000 to \n$25,000, the ratio is 17.8 percent. In fact, 32 percent of those making \nless than $10,000 pay more than 40 percent of their income in debt \npayments, an increase of 16 percent since 1995. About 20 percent of \nthose making between $10,000 and $25,000 devote more than 40 percent of \ntheir income to debt payments. Finally, 15.1 percent of households with \nless than $10,000 of income had debt payments 60 days past due--a \ndoubling since 1995--which not only reflects an inability to keep up \nwith debt payments but also contributes to bad credit and an inability \nto purchase a future home, etc.\n  The Federal Government's publicly-held debt also has an indirect \nimpact on the ability of workers to save. As a major borrower, the \nFederal Government increases interest rates. Higher interest rates \nlower private capital formation, which in turn hampers growth in \nproductivity and living standards. In addition, higher interest rates \non government debt translate into higher interest rates on mortgages, \nstudent loans, and credit card debt. When individuals pay higher \ninterest rates, fewer resources are available for saving and investing.\n  With all of these barriers to wealth accumulation, what can we, as \nlawmakers, do to eliminate these barriers? I believe the answer is \ntwofold. We must create new savings incentives for low and moderate \nincome workers and we must create a mandatory savings mechanism for all \nworkers.\n  A number of legislation initiatives have been offered to help low and \nincome workers save. For years, Senator Lieberman has championed an \neffort to expand Individual Development Accounts beyond a pilot \nprogram. IDAs are a way to encourage lower income folks to save for the \npurchase of a home, the establishment of a business, or education.\n  President Clinton has offered an interesting plan to get low and \nmoderate income families to participate in employer pension plans \nthrough a government savings match program. While Senators Graham and \nGrassley and Representatives Portman and Cardin have offered \ncomprehensive pension reform proposals designed to expand pension \ncoverage among low income workers.\n  I, along with a bipartisan group of Senate and House Members, have \nintroduced a Social Security reform plan that allows workers to put a \nportion of their FICA tax dollars into individual savings accounts. Our \nplan also calls for an additional government savings match program for \nlow income workers. In addition, our plan calls for opening mandatory \nsavings accounts at birth through the KidSave program.\n  What would this plan do? Fifty years from now we would have a much \ndifferent wealth distribution situation in America. Men and women who \ntoday have no chance of accumulating real wealth would accumulate the \nkind of wealth that provides them with meaningful financial security. A \nnew generation of Americans would be heading toward their retirement \nyears less dependent on government transfers for health or income. If \nthis plan were enacted, it would immediately change Americans' attitude \ntowards saving on account of informing tens of millions of the power of \ncompounding interest rates.\n  Sadly, critics of this proposal to help low income workers acquire \nassets and share in the growth of the American economy too often \nmisdescribe the impact. The key line that is used in opposition is: ``I \nam against privatization of Social Security.'' This line will usually \nproduce a round of applause with senior groups who would not be \naffected by any of the proposals. Even sadder, these critics are also \nthe same ones who prefer to merely offer solutions that include \ntransferring more income and thereby increasing dependency on the \nGovernment. I do not believe proposals that merely transfer more income \nwill solve the problem of inequitable distribution of wealth.\n  Ownership of wealth is a much more reliable way of becoming \nfinancially secure in old age than promises by politicians to tax and \ntransfer income. Ownership of wealth produces greater independence and \nhappiness. The mal-distribution of wealth, the rich getting richer and \nthe poor getting poorer, is not healthy for a liberal democracy and a \nfree market economy such as ours. The costs of financing health and \nretirement income needs of the baby boom generation exceeds the tax \npaying capacity of the generations that follow them.\n  So, Mr. President, after we have spent time debating the need to \nsolve the problem of income inequality we need to turn to the matter of \nwealth inequality. And when we do we will quickly learn that we will \nnot solve the problem of the rich getting richer and the poor getting \npoorer by beating up on the rich. We will solve the problem by lifting \nthe poor out of poverty with programs that enable them to accumulate \nwealth in a variety of ways including modernizing and improving the \nSocial Security program so that it becomes a means of saving money and \na mechanism for transferring income.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity, at the start of \ndebate on this important bill to reduce taxes for married couples by \neliminating the marriage tax penalty, to give some reaction to comments \nmade from the other side of the aisle yesterday. My reaction probably \nshould have been given last night, but the environment at that time was \nsuch that other Members wanted to speak on issues other than the \nmarriage tax penalty, so I did not take advantage of the opportunity. \nIt would have been more appropriate for me to respond to the Senate \nminority leader and other Members\n\n[[Page S2662]]\n\nof the other side of the aisle last night so it would be more in \ncontext.\n  These comments are in regard to our efforts to repeal the marriage \ntax penalty and also to clear up some of the inaccurate and misleading \nstatements made by the other side of the Senate.\n  We heard the charge made yesterday by the minority leader that, in \npassing this bill, we are going to be dipping into the Social Security \nsurplus. Of course, that is going to be the Democratic mantra from now \non, even though it is not the truth. Our own budget document is \nevidence of it not being our intent. Knowing the other side is \nsalivating at trying to make this bogus political charge stick, we have \nbeen very careful in making sure we stay within the $150 billion in tax \nrelief authorized in the budget resolution that will be before us later \ntoday in the form of the conference committee report on the budget for \nthe year 2001.\n  By carefully staying within these limits, we aren't touching one cent \nof Social Security money. That is important because people know the \nirresponsibility of Congress from 1969 until the Republican majority of \nCongress, the first Republican majority in both Houses of Congress in \n40 years, finally got the job done of balancing the budget with \ndecisions made in 1997. For the first time in 43 years, we are paying \ndown on the national debt 3 years in a row. The budget we are going to \nadopt this afternoon for the year 2001 will be the fourth year, and we \nwill be paying down $177 billion on that off the debt in the budget \nyear 2001.\n  Regardless of what the members of the other side of the aisle say, \nthis marriage tax penalty bill we are going to pass to reduce taxes for \nthe average married couple by $1,400, because they will no longer get \nhit with the marriage penalty, fits into the budget and doesn't use one \ncent of Social Security money to accomplish our goal of justice for \nmiddle-class married families in America.\n  Now, we also heard the misleading charge yesterday that we in the \nmajority are trying to dictate what amendments the Democrats could \noffer. All we have been trying to do is to bring some order to this \nprocess so we can get this bill, which even the President of the United \nStates says ought to pass. In his State of the Union Message, he asked \nus to pass a bill eliminating the marriage tax penalty. So, yesterday, \nthey said we were trying to dictate amendments. Well, during that \ndiscussion, we asked if second-degree amendments could be in order to \nthe Democrats' first-degree amendments. We were told absolutely not. So \nthe Democratic side is doing as much dictating as anyone. If we can be \naccused of complaining about the amendments they want to offer and \nobjecting to it, then they have no right to deny us the opportunity to \noffer second-degree amendments to their amendments.\n  In fact, the assistant minority leader stated that his caucus was in \nlockstep behind the minority leader. Well, that is simply part of the \nproblem. The other side does walk in lockstep against reform in an \nattempt to paint this Congress as a do-nothing Congress. Funny, isn't \nit, how when Democrats brag about being in lockstep and unanimity \nbehind their leader, somehow that isn't being partisan. But if \nRepublicans were to vote in lockstep behind our leader, they would say \nwe are being very partisan.\n  So, again, it seems as if we have a double standard that is not quite \njustified. Maybe my accusations should be directed more toward the \npress and media than the other side of the aisle and their statements. \nBut it seems so often if Republicans are together, we are being \npartisan. But if Democrats are together, they aren't being partisan. As \nI have followed the stories on this in the press for the last 2 days, I \nhaven't seen any charge of partisanship by the media toward the other \nside of the aisle. But, boy, I bet we Republicans would be painted as \npartisan.\n  Unfortunately, for the other side, this Congress has already made \nsubstantial progress and will continue to do so, and they will never be \nable to label us as a do-nothing Congress. I wish, though, that we had \na few independent thinkers on the other side of the aisle, as we do on \nour side of the aisle, and not the lockstep following of leaders to the \nextent which it is. All I have to do as a Republican is proudly point \nout the independence of Senator McCain on this side of the aisle to \nshow that there are Republicans who are independent and do not always \nfollow in lockstep. It would be nice if there were a few ``Senator \nMcCains'' on the other side of the aisle who were willing to break \nranks and be very independent.\n  A couple of the amendments the Democrats want to offer deal with \nprescription drugs. Of course, these are political amendments. We \nRepublicans have already set aside $40 billion in our budget to deal \nwith Medicare and prescription drugs. All we need to do is have people \non that side of the aisle--as there are bipartisan Medicare reform \nproposals with prescription drug provisions in them--get behind some of \nthese bipartisan approaches and get the White House behind them. We \nwill be glad to move on those within the $40 billion we have set aside \nin our budget to deal with Medicare reform and prescription drugs \nbecause we all know this problem has to be solved. We know that some \nseniors can't afford prescription drugs. Some seniors have to choose \nbetween food and drugs. That is not a choice they should have to make. \nAnd we have, consequently, taken the initiative in our budget and have \n$40 billion for that. Now all we need is a little bit of cooperation \nfrom the other side of the aisle, following on what one or two on the \nother side of the aisle have attempted to do with Republicans, to move \na bill along in this effort. But the White House happens to be dragging \nits feet.\n\n  Now, I think the insinuation is, from the amendments being offered on \nprescription drugs, that we don't see this as a problem and that we \ndon't want to solve this problem. They aren't telling the truth.\n  Another amendment they have asked us to look at deals with the \ntaxation of Conservation Reserve Program payments to farmers. The \nInternal Revenue Service--as they so often do in their infinite wisdom \nbut lack of common sense--is trying to impose Social Security taxes on \nthese payments. Of course, this is the Clinton-Gore administration that \nis doing this to the farmers of the United States. These taxes hadn't \nbeen opposed until the Clinton-Gore administration started imposing \nthem through the IRS. And now we have a Democrat amendment to overturn \nwhat the Clinton-Gore administration is doing to the farmers on the CRP \npayments. So why don't the people on the other side of the aisle just \ncall up President Clinton and Vice President Gore and ask them to order \ntheir own IRS to drop this silly new interpretation of the law because \nright now we have the Vice President going around the country saying \nhow much he is willing to help the farmers of the United States and, \nLord only knows, they need help with prices at 25-year lows.\n  Well, I guess help came after he invented the Internet because I \nhaven't seen any help in this area since this has been in the courts in \nthe United States. Now we have the Clinton-Gore IRS beating up on \nfarmers with this new tax. Now, there is nothing wrong with the tax \nbeing offered from the other side of the aisle, trying to correct this; \nbut it seems to me that there are other ways this could be handled.\n  Yesterday, we also heard what was really a political attack, that \nthis tax relief is somehow a ``risky tax cut scheme.'' How come from \nthe other side of the aisle all we ever hear about is ``risky tax cut \nschemes''? We don't hear about the risky spending schemes that are \noffered by the White House or by the other side of the aisle. All you \nhave to do is go back to State of the Union Address on January 2000 and \nlisten to the President of the United States propose 77 new spending \nprograms--77 new spending programs. Somehow, there is shock on the \nother side that we want to let the people of this country keep their \nhard-earned money rather than running it through the Treasury in \nWashington, DC.\n  Now, there is a certain amount of good economic freedom argument you \ncan give that is very philosophical about why the working men and women \nof America ought to spend more of their own money and send less of it \nto Washington just so they can have the economic freedom to do with the \nfruits of their labor and their minds what they want to do. But there \nis also a pretty good economic argument for not running any more money \nthan is absolutely needed through Washington,\n\n[[Page S2663]]\n\nDC. That is because money spent through the Federal budget does less \neconomic good--in other words, it turns over less times for the \neconomy--than money spent by individual taxpayers and working men and \nwomen of America. All one has to do is look at the defense budget. The \ndefense budget produces a lot of expensive items. But once they are \nmade, those items are not used for producing wealth. They serve a good \npurpose for our national defense. But they don't turn over any more \nmoney in our economy.\n\n  We come to these risky spending schemes of this administration with \n77 new programs, and we have tax cuts before Congress. Being at the \nhighest level of taxation in the history of our country, at about 21 \npercent of gross domestic product, if we allow the President, through \nthose 77 risky spending schemes, to build up to that level of \nexpenditure at 21 percent, then when we have a downturn in the economy, \nthe spending is going to stay up here and the income is down here. Then \nyou have another budget deficit; whereas, if we continue the pattern of \nthe last 50 years of taxing at about 18.5 to 19 percent of the gross \ndomestic product, then over the historical average there will be less \nchance of a deficit.\n  We want to let the working men and women keep more of their money and \nkeep our historical level of taxation at about 18.5 to 19 percent. We \ndo not want the extra money that is now coming into the Treasury to be \neaten up by these 77 risky spending schemes of this administration.\n  I feel compelled to correct a statement made by my democratic \ncolleague from Illinois. My colleague stated that the Republican \nmarriage penalty bill would require 5 million more taxpayers to pay \nhigher taxes. My colleague stated:\n\n       Here's the kicker. They don't want to talk about they have \n     drawn their bill up so that five million Americans will \n     actually pay higher taxes. . . . Take a look around the \n     corner--five million Americans end up paying higher taxes \n     under the alternative minimum tax. So now isn't that \n     something?\n\n  This is simply incorrect. According to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation there would be no increase in any taxpayer's overall tax \nliability as a result of this bill.\n  In fact, the bill attempts to correct an AMT problem for millions of \ntaxpayers. According to Joint Tax, in the year 2010, 9.2 million tax \nreturns will benefit from the AMT provision in the bill--this includes \n6.5 million joint returns and 2.7 million other individual returns \nbenefiting from this bill. This is a worthy goal, and we should do what \nis right.\n  According to Joint Tax, in 2010 approximately 1.5 million joint \nreturns benefiting from the AMT credit extension will become AMT payers \nunder the bill. However, as I just mentioned, Joint Tax estimates that \nthe bill would not increase any taxpayer's overall tax liability.\n  The record must be set straight--no one will pay higher taxes as a \nresult of this bill.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle have rejected a request we \nmade yesterday to allow a debate solely on the marriage tax penalty \nrelief. The Senate leader has offered 10 relevant amendments, including \ntheir alternative marriage tax penalty proposal. The other side has \nrejected this offer. The other side claims they want to debate other \nissues--talk about issues other than tax relief.\n  Either way you slice it--by what the Senate minority has done or by \nwhat they claim--they evidently don't care about marriage tax penalty \nrelief itself.\n  Senate Democrats could live with a focused debate when it applied to \nthe education savings accounts a month ago, March 2, and ending the \nSocial Security earnings limit for seniors over 65, which only a few \nweeks ago, on March 22, was passed by the Senate.\n  However, now when it comes down to marriage tax penalty relief, our \ncolleagues and friends on the other side of the aisle say no. Why? What \nhas changed compared to these other two tax bills? Why were those other \nitems only a few weeks ago so much more important than this bill that \nwould help over 40 million families? The bill before the Senate will \nhelp 40 million families. They want to debate other issues, so they are \nholding up the marriage tax penalty bill.\n  Imagine the hue and cry Democrats would raise if the shoe were on the \nother foot--if we were debating these other issues and we demanded to \noffer marriage tax penalty amendments.\n  The House has acted. The Finance Committee has acted. The Senate \nshould now act. However, it can't because the Democrats are obstructing \nthis legislation like in-laws on a honeymoon.\n  We have been more than fair. We have said this is a debate on \nmarriage tax penalty relief--offer any amendment you want that related \nto this bill and we will give you a debate and a vote on it. Any \namendment--up to ten of them.\n  How many relevant amendments did the Democrats offer yesterday? Less \nthen half of their ten addressed this issue. By my generous calculation \nthat means that they only half care about marriage tax penalty relief.\n  In the House, it was not this way. Forty-eight Democrats across the \nRotunda voted for marriage tax penalty relief. It was bipartisan over \nthere. Why can't it be bipartisan here? Democrats here are seeking to \nmake this a highly partisan Senate.\n  So the Senate must wait and over 40 million American families will \nhave to wait. Every couple who suffers under this marriage tax penalty, \nwhich has existed for 31 years, must wait further. In a sense, everyone \nis going to have to wait while the other side of the aisle obstructs \nthis tax relief effort.\n  This is tax week across America. America's families are hunkered down \nover their kitchen tables figuring out their tax forms. Isn't it time \nthese taxpayers get a break from the most unfair part of this process, \nthe provisions that tax them at a higher rate just because they are \ndoing what is right and are married?\n  I want to give them that break. My colleagues want to give them that \nbreak. However, my Democrat colleagues don't want to give them that \nbreak. In fact, they don't want to even give them a debate or a vote on \nthis very important issue.\n  I urge the Senate to go to the final debate on this and pass it \nbefore we adjourn this week. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I listened to my colleague, I thought \nsome things said required a response.\n  As we look back at how we achieved balance in our budget and how we \nturned massive deficits into massive surpluses, let me explain how it \nwas done. This chart covers 1980 through 1999. The blue line is the \noutlays or expenditures of the Federal Government; the red line is the \nrevenue line. We had massive deficits when we were following the \nRepublican economic prescription for the country, which was trickle-\ndown economics, because the outlays far exceeded revenues. The result \nwas massive deficits and massive growth of the debt.\n  In 1993, we got a new administration and a new economic plan. We \npassed a proposal without a single vote from the other side that \nreduced spending as a percentage of our national economy and raised \nrevenue. That is how we balanced the budget. That is how we stopped the \nraid on Social Security. That is how we stopped the economic decline \nthe country was experiencing under their plan, under their proposal.\n  In fact, at the time we passed the new budget plan in 1993, which was \na 5-year plan reducing the deficits each and every year as we brought \nspending down, we brought revenues up until the two lines crossed and \nwe moved into surplus. Our friends on the other side of the aisle said \nit was a huge mistake. They said it would increase the deficit. They \nsaid it would increase unemployment. They said it would increase \ninflation. They were wrong on every count. They were not just a little \nbit wrong, they were completely wrong.\n  Now they come with a new economic prescription to go back to the bad \nold days--back to debt, back to deficits, back to decline. Are we going \nto take that path? Haven't we learned anything about what works? \nHaven't we learned the best course is one of fiscal discipline? Haven't \nwe learned the best course is to stay on this plan that has turned \nmassive deficits into massive surpluses, that has led to the longest\n\n[[Page S2664]]\n\neconomic expansion in our country, that has led to the lowest \nunemployment in more than 30 years, the lowest inflation in more than \n30 years? Are we going to jeopardize this with a risky tax scheme that \nour friends on the other side propose?\n  My friend from Iowa says we have the highest tax rates ever. No, we \ndon't have the highest taxes ever. This chart shows the revenue line, \nand indeed it came up; that is absolutely correct. It was that \ncombination of reduced spending and increased revenue that led to this \nresult. However, that does not translate into higher tax rates on the \nAmerican people. A key reason we have higher revenues is because we got \nthe economy moving again. This extraordinary economic expansion--again, \nthe longest economic expansion in our history--has generated more \nrevenue. That is what helped balance the budget, coupled with reduced \nspending.\n  The question of what has happened to individual taxes is quite a \ndifferent story. This was a story on the front page of the Washington \nPost: ``Federal Tax Level Falls for Most. Studies Show Burden Now Less \nThan 10 Percent.''\n  The story tells the truth.\n\n       For all but the wealthiest Americans, the Federal income \n     tax burden has shrunk to the lowest level in four decades.\n\n  We don't have the highest taxes on individual American taxpayers that \nwe have ever had, as the Senator from Iowa asserted. That is just not \nthe case.\n\n       For all but the wealthiest Americans, the Federal income \n     tax burden has shrunk to the lowest level in four decades.\n\n  That is the truth according to a series of studies by both liberal \nand conservative tax experts. Each of the studies shows the bottom line \nis the same. Most Americans this year will have to fork over less than \n10 percent of their income to the Federal Government. The Congressional \nBudget Office estimates the middle fifth of American families with an \naverage income of $39,000 paid 5.4 percent income tax in 1999, compared \nwith 8.3 percent in 1981. Their taxes have gone down. That is the \nmiddle-income people in America.\n  The Treasury Department estimates that a four-person family, with a \nmedian income of $54,900, paid 7.46 percent of that in income tax, the \nlowest since 1965. And the median two-earner family making $68,000 paid \n8.8 percent in 1998, about the same as 1955.\n  If we are going to have a debate, let's have a debate on facts and \nnot make up things.\n  The fundamental problem with the legislation offered by our \ncolleagues: They have more of a tax cut than there is non-Social \nSecurity surplus available for a tax cut. It is a question of \npriorities. What do we want to do with the surpluses available? \nRemember, these are projected surpluses. We can take the money and use \nit all for a tax cut that disproportionately goes to the wealthiest. \nThat is what the Republicans want to do.\n  Our side believes we ought to reserve every penny of the Social \nSecurity surplus for Social Security. Republicans agree with that. On \nthe non-Social Security surplus, the Republicans want to use it all for \na tax cut that disproportionately goes to the wealthiest; 60 percent \ngoes to the wealthiest 10 percent.\n\n  Our side thinks the highest priority should be further paying down of \nthe debt because that is what every economist has said is in the \nhighest interests of this country. This is what will most assure our \neconomic future.\n  Second, we believe we ought to provide for tax relief; 29 percent of \nthe non-Social Security surplus under our proposal goes for tax relief. \nPart of that goes to address the marriage tax penalty. However, we are \naddressing those who suffer the marriage tax penalty.\n  Our friends on the other side want to give a big tax cut to folks who \ndo not have the marriage tax penalty. In fact, for people receiving the \nmarriage bonus--they pay lower taxes as a result of being married than \nif they were filing individually--they want to give them a tax cut, \ntoo.\n  When they say we are limited to 10 amendments on our side, the \nunderlying legislation deals with many more issues than just the \nmarriage tax penalty. They want to restrict our right to offer \nalternatives. That is not fair. That is not the way the Senate was \ndesigned to operate. Not surprisingly, we don't intend to go along with \nthat. That is not the way the Senate is designed to work.\n  We offered legislation in the Senate Finance Committee to give people \na choice. They file as married couples; they file as individuals; file \nthe way that helps the most, that gives families the least tax \nliability. That is what Democrats are proposing. We do it in a way to \nnot use all of the non-Social Security surplus for a tax cut that goes \npredominantly to the wealthiest. Instead, we put the highest priority \non reducing the debt; the second highest priority on tax relief; the \nthird highest priority on using money for high priority domestic needs \nsuch as defense, education, and agriculture, which are in very deep \ntrouble.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \nmarriage tax relief bill. You could characterize it as tax relief or \nyou could characterize it, I suppose, as a tax cut. But the true \ncharacterization is one that Senator Hutchison has over and over \nemphasized: This is tax correction. The bill is intended to correct the \nTax Code. The code needs correction because it is an assault on the \nvery values of our culture.\n  There is a fundamental unfairness when the Tax Code is at war with \nour values and penalizes a basic social institution such as the \ninstitution of marriage. The American people know this. They understand \nit is not right to have a Tax Code that penalizes marriage. The vast \nmajority of the Members of this body understand this. This last week, \nduring consideration of the budget resolution, the Senate voted 99-1 on \nthe Hutchison amendment to support marriage tax relief. In other words, \nlet's abandon the policy of punishing married people who pay higher \ntaxes in the Tax Code.\n  Despite this overwhelming vote less than 10 days ago, some of my \ncolleagues are now trying to stop or to delay the marriage tax relief \nmeasure by demanding nonrelevant amendments. Yesterday, several \nSenators from the other side of the aisle spoke on the floor and agreed \nthere is unfairness in the Tax Code and that it is fundamentally unfair \nto tax people only because they marry. However, these same Senators \nthen said the Finance Committee bill gives tax cuts to people who do \nnot need them. That seems an arrogant statement to me, to suppose \nGovernment knows best how to spend the people's money. In addition, one \nSenator opposed the finance bill, asking, how many of these tax cuts \ncan we afford to give away?\n  I submit, the real question is, how much of the hard-earned money can \nfamilies afford to have taken away by an unfair system which penalizes \nmen and women, a schoolteacher, a fireman, for getting married and \nbeginning a family? How much longer will we continue to allow married \ncouples to be penalized just for getting married?\n  We are here to correct that fundamental unfairness. It is something \nthat has grown up in the code. It is like a weed which is taking over \nthe garden. Good things are prevented by its presence. We ought to pull \nit out and make sure we have a Tax Code that does not make it harder \nfor young people to be married and have a family.\n  Are we for correcting this unfairness? Are we against it? Or are we \njust saying that we are? One cannot say they oppose this penalty and \nthen fight to take the relief away that is provided in the bill. Our \ncolleagues in the House\n\n[[Page S2665]]\n\nhave already demonstrated dramatically that they back a correction for \nthis injustice.\n  In February, the House passed the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of \n2000. Thanks to the good work of the Senate Finance Committee, under \nthe direction of Senator Roth, we have a measure which will help \nsubstantially lessen the burden of this penalty that has been laid upon \nthe families of America.\n  This bill makes great strides in providing relief and correcting this \ninjustice. Twenty-five million American couples pay an average of \n$1,400 a year extra simply because they are married. Ending the penalty \nwill give couples the freedom to make the choices they ought to make: \nThe choice to be married and have a durable, lasting relationship of \nmarriage as the foundation for the family unit.\n  The marriage tax penalty forces some Americans to make compromises \ninstead of real choices. Mothers and fathers should be able to choose \nwhether both parents will be employed outside the home based on what is \nin the family's best interest, or whether there should be a nonworking \nspouse who stays in the home. The Senate bill respects the value of the \ncontribution of the spouse who stays home, and that is very important. \nOur Tax Code should respect the value that is added to the equation by \na stay-at-home spouse who makes the family a stronger unit and builds \nfor this country the kind of integrity that strong families provide.\n  In conclusion, no one has ever devised or developed or even dreamed \nof a better department of education, social services, a better \ndepartment of health, education, and welfare than the family, and it is \ntime for our Tax Code.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in listening to my colleagues I am \npleased to detect broad support for ending the so-called marriage \npenalty. I know that no one in this body believes that there should be \na price to pay to the government for matrimony. However, we should work \nfor a fair and reasonable solution that will not expand the marriage \nbonus and shift tax unfairness from one group in this country to \nanother. The fact is that expanding marriage bonuses is not fair to \nsingle Americans just like doing nothing is unfair to married couples.\n  The ironic thing about the marriage penalty is that it was actually \nborn out of fairness. According to a June 22, 1999 document prepared by \nthe staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, before 1948, there was \nonly one income tax schedule, and all individuals were liable for tax \nas separate filing units. Under this tax structure, there was neither a \nmarriage penalty nor a marriage bonus.\n  However, this structure created an incentive to split incomes \nbecause, with a progressive income tax rate structure, a married couple \nwith only one spouse earning income could reduce their combined tax \nliability if they could split the income and assign half to each \nspouse. Under this system a disparity between the citizens of community \nand separate property states arose after a handful of Supreme Court \ncases upheld the denial of contractual attempts to split income, but \nruled that in states with community property laws, income splitting was \nrequired for community income. This led Senator John McClellan, of my \nhome state of Arkansas, to ask Senator William Knowland of California, \n``why is it that just because you live in California and I live in \nArkansas, you pay $646 less every year than I pay?''\n  The Revenue Act of 1948 provided the benefit of income splitting to \nall married couples by establishing a separate tax schedule for joint \nreturns. That schedule was designed so that married couples would pay \ntwice the tax of a single taxpayer having one-half the couple's taxable \nincome. While this new schedule equalized treatment between married \ncouples in states with community property laws and those in states with \nseparate property laws, it introduced a marriage bonus into the tax law \nfor couples in states with separate property laws. As a result of this \nbasic rate structure, by 1969, an individual with the same income as a \nmarried couple could have had a tax liability up to 40 percent higher \nthan that of the married couple.\n  To address this inequity, which was at the time labeled a ``singles \npenalty,'' a special rate schedule was introduced for single taxpayers, \nleaving the old schedule solely for married individuals filing separate \nreturns. This schedule created the infrastructure for the so-called \nmarriage penalty that we seek to end today.\n  At the time more than thirty years ago when the current single and \nmarried filing categories were established, our society looked \ndifferent, and very few people were affected by the flaws in our tax \ncode that imposed a penalty on marriage. As we all know, Mr. President, \nthe general rule is that married couples whose incomes are split more \nevenly than 30-70 suffer a marriage penalty. However, the fact still \nremains, that married couples whose incomes are attributable largely to \none spouse generally receive a marriage bonus.\n\n  As the income levels between men and women have rightly narrowed and \nas more married women have moved into the work force, the so-called \nmarriage penalty has begun to affect more and more families.\n  Today we are debating a bill offered by the Senate Finance Committee \nthat seeks to address the problem of the so called Marriage Penalty, \nand I applaud my colleagues for bringing this to the floor. As I said \nbefore, I believe we all want to tell our constituents that we have \nended the marriage penalty, however, the underlying bill will not allow \nus to do that.\n  There are 65 provisions in the tax code that contribute to a possible \nmarriage penalty for taxpayers. The bill offered by the Majority only \neliminates one of those provisions and softens the bite of two others. \nThe fact still remains that 62 other provisions could rise up to affect \nmarried couples on tax day. If we are going to end the marriage \npenalty, Mr. President, we should just end it.\n  Another problem with the Majority bill is that it expands the \nmarriage bonus. We should not bring back the unfairness we had before \n1969. We should learn from the history of this debate and we should \ncome up with a better solution. I believe in the sanctity of marriage, \nas do all of my colleagues. I don't believe in penalizing it. But I \nalso recognize the rights and fairness that our single constituents \ndemand. We should not shift tax unfairness from one group to another, \nwe should work to eliminate the unfairness for all Americans.\n  The Majority bill would also expand the roles of the Alternative \nMinimum Tax. Talk about unfair! I think a lot of Americans would almost \nrather pay the marriage penalty than have to deal with the Alternative \nMinimum Tax. The Majority bill would expand, by 5 million, the number \nof people who have to fill out an AMT tax form and pay higher rates. \nNot only is it inexcusable,\n\n[[Page S2666]]\n\nit goes against what we stand for and what we are trying to achieve\n  We should be working to lessen the effects of the AMT on middle class \nfamilies not expand them. I am aware that the Majority bill includes a \nprovision to permanently exempt the non-refundable personal tax credits \nfrom AMT determination. That is good policy. In fact, Mr. President, I \nam the author of the bill, S. 506, that is essentially attached to the \nMajority bill. This provision, however, will not do enough to lessen \nthe effects that doubling the standard deduction will have on the AMT \nroles. The good policy of S. 506 is drowned by the bad policy to which \nit is attached; drowned in the squeals of 5 million voters. I remind my \ncolleagues that the AMT equals higher taxes and confusing forms. No one \nwants that for their constituents.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, this majority bill can hardly be labeled a \n``Marriage Penalty Relief Bill'' at all. It doesn't completely \neliminate the marriage penalty and less than half the cost of the bill \ngoes to reducing it. 60 percent of the cost of the Majority bill goes \nto singles and to expanding the marriage bonus. I believe we should be \nhonest with the American taxpayer and quit trying to aggregate tax cuts \nunder popular headings like ``Marriage Penalty Relief'' and ram them \nthrough the process with cloture votes.\n  If my colleagues truly believe in fairness, as I think they do, then, \nMr. President, let us work to truly end the marriage penalty, not to \njust put it on hold. Let's work together, Mr. President, to end the \nmarriage penalty. Lets put an end to it now and forever. That means \neliminating all 65 marriage penalties. Not just one and a fraction. \nThat also means avoiding a new singles penalty. We have a record to \nlook upon, Mr. President. We have a history. If we approach the \nmarriage penalty in the way the Majority proposes, the unfairness will \ncontinue, the debate will continue, and sadly, the marriage penalty \nwill continue as well.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do not like the marriage penalty. I think \nit is poor public policy. However, I am forced to vote against cloture \ntoday because the majority has refused to allow the minority to offer \namendments to improve this seriously flawed legislation.\n  The majority has presented us with a bill that not only fails to \ncompletely remedy the marriage penalty, but also provides large tax \ncuts to individuals and married couples who currently experience a \nmarriage bonus. Less than 40% of the benefits of this bill would \nactually go to couples earning under $100,000. This is not a marriage \npenalty bill; this is a fiscally irresponsible tax cut bill for the \nwealthy. Hard working married couples in Vermont deserve an honest, \ntargeted measure to eliminate the marriage penalty, not the proposal \nthat is before us today.\n  I had looked forward to debating amendments to strengthen this bill \nand I am disappointed that the majority is cutting off the debate with \na motion to invoke cloture. The integrity of the Senate is threatened \nwhen the majority refuses to permit the minority to debate amendments. \nThe Senate should be the conscience of the nation because of the \ndistinguishing feature of this body for any Senator to offer amendments \nand thoroughly debate the merits of legislation.\n  I support an end to the marriage penalty. I will continue to work \nwith other Senators to pass legislation that is targeted at eliminating \nall of the marriage penalties that are embedded in our tax code. \nVermonters deserve nothing less.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on two cloture \nmotions, the first, to end debate on the Finance Committee's substitute \namendment to H.R. 6, the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act, and, the \nsecond, to end debate on the underlying bill.\n  First, I am, as are others, deeply concerned with that anomaly in the \ntax code known as the ``marriage penalty.'' I can think of no rational \nreason why two individuals who have vowed a lifelong commitment to each \nother through the sacred institution of marriage should, in certain \ncases, have their combined income taxed at a higher rate than that of \ntwo unmarried persons. At a time of declining social values, it simply \ndoes not make sense for the Congress to sanction policies which clearly \nwork to the detriment of family stability.\n  Throughout the annals of human experience, in dozens of civilizations \nand cultures of varying value systems, humanity has discovered that the \npermanent relationship between men and women is a keystone to the \nstability, strength, and health of human society. The purpose of this \nkind of union between human beings is primarily for the establishment \nof a home atmosphere in which a man and a woman pledge themselves \nexclusively to one another and who bring into being children for the \nfulfillment of their love for one another and for the greater good of \nthe human community at large. Indeed, I doubt that any Senator would \nrefute the assertion that the promotion of marriage and family \nstability is in the best interest of the nation as a whole.\n  The question then is how to utilize the nation's tax code to move \ntowards this goal. Marriage neutrality, for reasons that I will leave \nto the distinguished Finance Committee Chairman, the Senator from \nDelaware, and, the Finance Committee ranking member, the Senator from \nNew York, to explain, is seemingly incompatible with a progressive \nincome tax system that allows for married couples to file jointly. That \nis, if this body believes that higher-income households should pay \nhigher taxes than lower-income households, and that married couples \nshould be allowed to file joint returns, marriage neutrality can be a \ndifficult goal to achieve. While I applaud the efforts of the Senator \nfrom Delaware and the Senator from New York in their attempts to \nbalance these seemingly incompatible goals, I remain hesitant about \njumping on any bandwagon at this time without first raising some \nconcerns.\n  My primary concern, which I would presume is a concern of all \nSenators, is the cost associated with each of these proposals. The \nRepublican plan, upon which the majority leader has filed a cloture \nmotion, would cost approximately $248 billion over 10 years, and would \nexplode after the first 10 years, costing the Federal Government $39 \nbillion per year thereafter. This cost would be paid for through the \nnon-Social Security surpluses that are projected by the Congressional \nBudget Office over the next 10 years. The so-called Democratic \nalternative, on the other hand, is not much better. The proposal would \ncost $150 billion over 10 years, but once fully phased in, is expected \nto cost about $48 billion per year thereafter. The basis upon which \nthese tax cuts are being proposed is the presumption that the \nCongressional Budget Office's projections of non-Social Security \nsurpluses will come to pass and will be large enough to cover tax cuts \nof this magnitude without causing the Federal budget to revert back \ninto the kind of annual triple-digit billion dollar budget deficits we \nsuffered over the last two decades. Never mind the fact that these non-\nSocial Security surpluses are not yet in the hands of the Treasury. \nNever mind the fact that this Senate has not yet ensured that our \ndomestic spending needs will be met in the coming years. Never mind the \nfact that such enormous tax cuts, once enacted, would be very difficult \nto reverse.\n\n  To its credit, however, the Democratic alternative is a substantively \nbetter proposal. Not only would it eliminate all sixty-five marriage \npenalties in the tax code, compared to the Republican proposal which \nwould eliminate only three of the penalties, but it would also limit \ntax relief to those who actually suffer marriage penalties. \nNevertheless, the Senate stands ready to shut down debate on these \nmeasures, and to effectively prohibit the Democratic alternative from \nbeing offered. Moreover, amendments that could possibly improve these \nproposals, or, at least, ensure that these proposals are enacted in the \nmost cost efficient way possible, would also be limited--perhaps not to \nbe allowed to be called up at all.\n  Another concern of mine is that both proposals are distributionally \nskewed away from lower- and middle-income families. Senators should be \nencouraged to offer amendments so that these proposals better target \nfamilies who most need tax relief. Instead, Senators are discouraged \nfrom offering amendments to improve the measure. Watching the debate \nyesterday, I noted Senators suggesting that amendments\n\n[[Page S2667]]\n\nshould be limited to only five or six so that the Senate could finish \nits work tonight and recess for the Easter break. As far as this \nSenator from West Virginia is concerned, if this legislation is as \nimportant as most Senators seem to think it is, we should stay in \ntomorrow, perhaps Saturday, and for as long as it takes to provide the \nbest targeted, most cost-efficient tax package possible. This \nlegislation should not be railroaded through this Chamber in order to \naccommodate a political deadline or to avoid debate on controversial \namendments.\n  I, for one, will not support shutting down debate on these measures \nwithout first having these concerns addressed. I refuse to allow myself \nto be backed into a position where I must support limiting debate on a \nso-called marriage penalty relief bill simply to avoid political \nattacks that I do not support marriage penalty relief. My constituents \nunderstand my position on this matter. I have been married, now, almost \n63 years, so I know about the marriage penalty. It has not changed over \nthe years. I will oppose cloture on this bill, not because I am opposed \nto marriage penalty relief, but because I am opposed to this kind of \nlegislating.\n\n  Putting aside the policy implications of these votes for a moment, I \nam growing increasingly concerned about how this body is seemingly \nincapable of considering any legislation without, first, limiting \namendments that may be offered, and, second, limiting the ability of \nSenators to debate the legislation. These marriage penalty proposals \nare only the most recent example of this new style of legislating. \nEducation savings accounts, the Social Security earnings limit, and \nbankruptcy reform have all been debated in this fashion. The stock \noptions bill that was brought to the floor was limited to one hour of \ndebate with no amendments or motions in order. Presumably, this \nagreement was reached to prevent minimum wage amendments from being \noffered. Indeed, time after time, day after day cloture motions to end \ndebate are being filed before debate even has a chance to get under \nway.\n  The rationale behind today's cloture vote is that a majority of \nconstituents and legislators support marriage penalty relief, so this \nlegislation should be passed without delay. Ironically, this is exactly \nwhy the Senate was established as the body of majority rule but \nminority right. When James Madison arrived in Philadelphia in 1787 to \ncorrect the ``injustices'' of the Articles of Confederation, he had \nderived a general theory of politics based on his experiences in the \nVirginia state legislature. His focus was on the majoritarian premises \nof popular government. While Madison pondered that legislators would \nprimarily respond to the passions and interests of their constituents, \nhe realized that minority rights were not so much to protect the people \nfrom government as to protect the people from popular majorities acting \nthrough government. In recent months, however, and, I say this not as a \nDemocrat, but as a member of the minority, minority rights have been \npushed aside in order to accommodate political expediency. The \nDemocrats, as I observe them, are standing up for their rights as a \nminority, not attempting, as has been stated several times in the past, \nto dictate the Senate's schedule. This Democrat is certainly not trying \nto dictate the schedule. I do, however, have an interest in the Senate. \nAnd, I think that the Senate has gone downhill in recent years. I think \nthat it is too partisan. I have seen bills called up, and cloture \nimmediately filed upon them to end debate on them when there had been \nno debate. I, when I was majority leader, filed cloture motions in \nsimilar situations, but I never did it time after time and day after \nday, I did it very seldom.\n  Senators do have the right to offer amendments, they do have the \nright to debate those amendments, and they have the right to a roll \ncall vote on those amendments if they want it. Similarly, this Senator, \nalong with every other Senator in this body, has the right to debate \namendments offered by other Senators and to a roll call vote on those \namendments. This was the message that I was hoping to convey last \nFriday during the debate on the budget resolution. When I objected to \nthe unanimous consent request regarding the inclusion of some fifty \namendments to the budget resolution, my goal was not to prevent the \nconsideration of those amendments.\n  In fact, I was suggesting that the Senate spend the extra time on \nSaturday and on Monday to debate and to vote on those amendments. It \nwas my desire to hear debate and to vote on those amendments, not to \nmove on to final passage.\n  The Senator who offers the amendment, of course, has a right to have \ndebate on it and a right to ask for a vote. But any other Senator also \nhas a right to hear the debate and also has a right to ask for a vote \nif he wants it. So it is not just the Senator who offers the amendment \nwhose case is put in jeopardy because he is denied a vote. The whole \nSenate and the people I represent, the people the Senator from Rhode \nIsland represents, are entitled to a debate also on the amendment.\n  As I have said before, I will not support the erosion of minority \nrights in the Senate simply to advance a politically popular \ninitiative. I hope that my colleagues will take a moment to consider \ntheir votes in this context, rather than in the context of what is \npolitically popular and expedient.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, last week, I offered an amendment to the \nSenate budget resolution that would have required Congress to enact a \nnew Medicare prescription drug benefit before considering any massive \ntax cuts. While a procedural hurdle prevented my amendment from \npassing, fifty-one senators voted to waive the budget point of order, \nindicating they favored it, sending the American people a strong signal \nthat a majority of the U.S. Senate thought we should put the needs of \nour nation's seniors before excessive tax cuts.\n  Yet only a week after this vote, Mr. President, we are considering a \nmassive tax cut that will spend $248 billion of the surplus over 10 \nyears, without doing anything to modernize Medicare. Under the guise of \neliminating the ``marriage penalty,'' the majority has brought a bill \nto the floor that would devote over half of its benefits to people who \neither aren't married, or who are actually receiving right now a tax \nbenefit, or ``bonus,'' for being married. This takes a lot of chutzpah.\n  I believe we ought to eliminate the marriage penalty for those who \nactually suffer the marriage penalty and need the relief most. With all \nthe rhetoric from the other side about eliminating the marriage \npenalty, one might think that they would share my view and want to pass \na bill that would actually focus on the penalty.\n  But a close examination of the Republican bill reveals that it is not \nquite what it is described to be. In fact, there are 65 provisions in \nthe Tax Code that have a marriage penalty, including Social Security. \nTheir bill takes care of one provision entirely and two others \npartially, and leaves the other 63 marriage penalties exactly the way \nthey are. The Democratic bill addresses all 65 provisions, and takes \ncare of the entire penalty for nearly everybody. The Democratic bill \naccomplishes all this but costs half as much.\n  It is time that we set our priorities straight. We ought not to be \ndevoting $140 billion of the surplus over 10 years to individuals who \ncurrently have no marriage penalty when we have done nothing to help \nthose who suffer from the ``senior citizens' drug penalty'' the high \nprices our Nation's seniors are forced to pay for prescription drugs.\n  I intend to offer a motion to recommit this bloated bill to the \nFinance Committee, with instructions to report out a new bill by June 1 \nthat focuses its dollars on taxpayers who actually face a marriage \npenalty, and that devotes $40 billion over the next 5 years to a new \nprescription drug benefit. This motion will not prevent Congress from \nenacting marriage penalty relief this year, it will just ensure that we \ndo not backtrack from last week's vote to enact a prescription drug \nbenefit before we do major tax cuts.\n  I want to share again a letter I received from a woman in St. \nStephens Church, VA which illustrates why the prescription drug \namendment is so important. She writes:\n\n       My husband and I are both retirees and rely on Social \n     Security and Medicare. Recently, we both had to go to our \n     family doctor, and the drugs that were prescribed for us \n     would cost us out of pocket approximately $300 per month. Due \n     to the cost of the two prescriptions, we are forced to choose \n     not to take the medication and live with the illness.\n\n\n[[Page S2668]]\n\n\n  Another woman from Scottsville, VA writes:\n\n       My husband's income consists of his Social Security and a \n     small pension from his former employer. We spend over twice \n     as much for prescriptions as we do for groceries, and it's \n     getting harder and harder to stretch our income 'til our \n     checks arrive.\n\n  These Virginians are not alone in their troubles. The average senior \ncitizen will spend $1,100 on prescription drugs this year. Most of them \nwill not have adequate prescription drug coverage to help them cover \nthese crushing costs. The numbers of those who do have coverage are \ndropping rapidly.\n  Despite the suggestions of some of my colleagues, this problem is not \nlimited solely to the poor. One in four Medicare beneficiaries with a \nhigh income--defined as $45,000 a year for a couple--has no coverage \nfor prescription drugs. And while some seniors do have coverage, nearly \nhalf of them lack coverage for the entire year, making them extremely \nvulnerable to catastrophic drug costs.\n  Complicating this matter for the elderly is the ``senior citizens' \ndrug penalty'' that seniors without drug coverage are forced to pay. \nMost working Americans who are insured through the private sector pay \nless than the full retail price for prescription drugs. This is because \ninsurers generally contract with Pharmaceutical Benefit Managers--or \nPBMs--that negotiate better prices for drugs and pass on the power of \ngroup purchasing to their customers.\n  Seniors lack this option, however, and must still pay full price for \ntheir drugs. A study released earlier this week showed that seniors \nwithout drug coverage typically pay 15 percent more than people with \ncoverage. And the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries without drug \ncoverage who report not being able to afford a needed drug is about 5 \ntimes higher than those with coverage.\n  This ``senior citizens' drug penalty,'' in my view, is \nunconscionable. Senior citizens rely more on drugs, and have higher \ndrug costs, than any other segment of the population. They deserve to \nhave the same bargaining power that benefits other Americans.\n  Last week the other side spoke against my amendment, claiming that \nthere was already adequate language in the Republican budget resolution \nto ensure that we pass a prescription drug benefit this year. At the \ntime, they pointed to the $40 billion reserve fund which was included \nin the budget resolution the Committee reported, arguing that this \nwould provide ample money to enact a prescription drug benefit and \noffer tax relief.\n  Republicans asked, in essence, that we trust them that the Senate \nwill not squander the surplus on tax cuts before we have helped our \nnation's seniors. Let me say that I do trust my good friends on the \nother side of the aisle. To borrow a line from Ronald Reagan, I believe \nwe should trust--but verify. That is what my amendment last week did. \nIt required deeds as well as words.\n  Seeing what happened in the budget resolution conference committee, \nit has become clearer than ever why we need to verify the promises that \nthe other side gives us. Because despite both chambers setting aside a \n$40 billion reserve fund for a prescription drug benefit, one of the \nfirst things that the conferees did was cut this fund in half, to $20 \nbillion--a number far too low to enact any sort of universal benefit \nfor our nation's seniors. The conferees then took this other $20 \nbillion, which is vitally needed to fund a universal prescription drug \nbenefit, and said that it should be used for other Medicare reforms, \nsuch as another round of adjustments to the payment rates for Medicare \nproviders that were hit hard by the cuts in the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997. But after touting this reserve fund as the key to a prescription \ndrug benefit, they have essentially neutered themselves.\n  Even worse, the conferees removed the one provision that would have \nhelped push a prescription drug benefit forward. The Senate budget \nresolution set a date of September 1 for the Finance Committee to \nreport out a prescription drug bill. This deadline would have \nguaranteed that the Senate would at least consider prescription drug \nlegislation this year. But the conferees stripped this deadline out of \nthe bill. They have basically said: it is not important for the Senate \nto pass a bill to eliminate the ``senior citizens' drug penalty.''\n  I am by no means opposed to taking another look at the decisions we \nmade in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I worked very hard last year \nin the Finance Committee on the Balanced Budget Refinement Act. And \nthere ought to be room, in the context of a balanced budget, to provide \nfurther relief to health care providers who were hit hard by the cuts \nin the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  We ought not to be limiting our Medicare reform efforts to $40 \nbillion, however, simply to free up additional funds for tax cuts. With \nthis new limit, Republicans have essentially pitted a prescription drug \nbenefit for seniors against additional relief for doctors, hospitals, \nnursing homes, and other health care providers. Republicans have \ndecided that two important priorities must square off, so that we can \nprovide billions of dollars in so-called ``marriage penalty'' tax \nrelief to individuals who do not even incur a marriage tax penalty on \ntheir taxes.\n  Our nation's seniors deserve better than this. Last week, at least \nfifty-one Senators felt the same way. I urge every one of them, as well \nas Senators who opposed my amendment last week because they thought the \n$40 billion reserve fund would guarantee a prescription drug benefit, \nto support my motion to recommit this bill. With its passage, we will \nbe able to eliminate both the true marriage tax penalty and the \n``senior citizens' drug penalty.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2668-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 6\n\n  Mr. ROBB.

Mr. President, I thank my friend from Iowa.\n  This has been an interesting debate on this part of the Tax Code, and \nI have been listening to this debate with a lot of interest. If there \never was something that needed fixing, it is unfairness in the tax \ncode. I am not going to talk about a disincentive for folks to get \nmarried. I look at it from a standpoint of fairness.\n  Young couples who are starting out and trying to save a little money \nfor the education of their children, or trying to pay for a home, these \ncouples are penalized. They have dreams of participating in American \nopportunities, and they are kept from this by an unfair tax code. In \nMontana, 90,000 couples are penalized to the tune of $51.5 million \nevery year in extra taxes simply because they are Mr. and Mrs.\n  We made it pretty clear on this side of the aisle that tax reform is \nneeded.\n\n[[Page S2669]]\n\n If we have to do it one step at a time or one inch at a time, then \nthat is the way we will do it. That makes it very slow and very \npainful. Yet it has to be done.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, almost half of married \ncouples pay higher taxes due to their married status. The marriage tax \npenalty increases taxes on affected couples $29 billion per year. \nCurrently, this marriage tax penalty imposes an average additional tax \nof $1,400 a year on 21 million married couples nationwide.\n  I, along with my Republican colleagues, have made it clear that \ncontinued tax reform and tax relief is necessary, and I can think of no \nother tax that has such a dramatic impact on so many people. To some \npeople, $1,400 may not sound like a lot of money, but to a lot of \nAmericans $1,400 does mean a lot of money. Especially when it can be \nused for things like saving for education, or supporting young \nfamilies, or a long list of things that need to be fixed around the \nhouse.\n  The marriage tax penalty can have significant negative economic \nimplications for the country as a whole since the tax code can \ndiscourage some people from entering the workforce altogether.\n  Additionally, this is a good time for us to restore fairness for \nmarried people. No. 1, I think what we have seen this week in the stock \nmarket, what we have seen in the high-tech stocks, shows that we may \nnot be in the real booming economy now that everybody thinks we are. \nNo. 2, if you live in farm country, we know we are not in a booming \neconomy. Look at our small towns around my State of Montana and all \nthrough farm country. We know what tough times are. And then to be \npenalized in your taxes just because you are married seems a little \nunfair.\n  I support this particular piece of legislation. I want the American \npeople to know that we will take this one step at a time. After all, we \ndid not get into this situation overnight. Maybe it will take one step \njust to get us out of this kind of a situation.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I rise in support of legislation currently \non the floor that will put an end to the marriage tax penalty. We have \nbeen fighting this tax inequity for several years now. The people of \nMontana have spoken to me either through letters or conversation--they \nthink this tax is unfair.\n  Last year, I met with a couple in Billings, MT, to determine the \nimpact of this tax on them. Joshua and Jody Hayes paid $971 more in \ntaxes because they were married than they would have paid if they \nremained single.\n  In Montana, it is estimated that nearly 90,000 couples are penalized \nby this tax to the tune of $51.5 million--solely for being married.\n  I along with my Republican colleagues have made it clear that \ncontinued tax reform and tax relief is necessary, but I can think of no \nother tax that has such a dramatic impact on so many people.\n  If ever there was a disincentive to be married, this penalty would be \nit. I believe this, along with the estate tax, is one of the most \nunfair taxes on Americans. It is not right for people to be penalized \nwith higher taxes simply because they choose to get married.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), almost half of \nall married couples pay higher taxes due to their marital status. \nCumulatively, the marriage penalty increases taxes on affected couples \nby $29 billion per year. Currently, this tax penalty imposes an average \nadditional tax of $1400 on 21 million married couples nationwide.\n  The marriage penalty can have significantly negative economic \nimplications for the country as a whole as well. Not only does this \npenalty within the tax system stand as a likely obstacle to marriage, \nit can actually discourage a spouse from entering the workforce.\n  By adding together husband and wife under the rate schedule, tax laws \nboth encourage families to identify a primary and secondary worker and \nthen place an extra burden on the secondary worker because his or her \nwages come on top of the primary earner's wages.\n  As the American family realizes lower income levels, the Nation \nrealizes lower economic output. From a strictly economic perspective, \nthe fact that potential workers would avoid the labor force as a result \nof a tax penalty is a clear sign of a failure to maximize true economic \noutput. As a result, the nation as a whole fails to reach its economic \npotential, which is demonstrated by decreased earnings and \ninternational competitiveness.\n  I am very disappointed the President has indicated he will veto this \nbill as he has in the past. That is not just the veto of a bill--that \nis another signal the administration does not support the union of two \npeople and their impending family.\n  Congress has the momentum to correct this inequity and I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this legislation to repeal the marriage penalty.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have an example of the marriage tax \npenalty printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Example of the Marriage Penalty Tax\n\n       Take a couple in which the husband is a new Billings Police \n     Officer and his wife is a teacher for the Billings School \n     District.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        Husband      Wife       Couple\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdjusted Gross Income...............     $33,500     $28,200     $61,700\n                                     -----------------------------------\nLess Personal Exemption.............       4,150       4,150       6,900\nStandard Deduction..................      +2,650      +2,650      +5,300\n                                     -----------------------------------\n                                           6,800       6,800      12,200\n                                     ===================================\nTaxable Income......................      26,700      21,400      49,500\nTax Liability.......................    4,271.50    3,210.00    8,504.00\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal tax liability when filing jointly is 8,504.\nTotal tax liability for both filing as singles 7,481.50.\nMarriage Penalty 1,022.50.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIowa, who has done a wonderful job in managing this bill, and more \nimportantly for his role in the Finance Committee to make sure that we \nhave a great marriage tax penalty relief bill.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana for talking in straight terms, as he \nalways does, about what our priorities are: Does this money belong to \nthe people who earned it or does it belong to the Federal Government in \nWashington, DC?\n  I think it is very interesting; when people talk about tax cuts, you \ncan tell immediately how Members are going to vote by how they refer to \nthe tax cuts.\n  As the Senator from Missouri said earlier, if you are going to be \nagainst tax cuts, you are going to say: How much will it cost the \nFederal Government to give this tax relief? But if you believe that \npeople who earn the money deserve to keep it, then you are going to \nsay: How much is it going to cost the American family if we do not give \nthem back part of the excess that they have sent to Washington in \nincome tax withholding?\n  I want to make the point again, we are not talking about the Social \nSecurity surplus providing money for tax cuts. We are talking about the \nincome tax surplus. That means that people have sent too much to \nWashington and we are trying to return some of it.\n  I think it was an interesting argument earlier, on the Democratic \nside, where it was shown that Federal taxes have gone down in our \ncountry. We are trying to lower Federal taxes, but, in fact, what has \nhappened is local taxes have gone up. So all of the neutral sources in \nour country today tell us that there is, in fact, a higher tax burden \non the average American family today than ever before in peacetime. \nThat is a big burden on an average family.\n  About 40 percent of the average family's income is taken in taxes. \nThat is a fact. And we are in peacetime. We do have a balanced budget. \nWe do not need that much. We should send it right back to the people \nwho earned it, to put in their pockets for them to make the decisions \nas to how to spend it. That is what we are trying to do today.\n  I think it is interesting when you listen to the debate. The \ndistinguished Democratic leader yesterday said, in the debate: ``I \nthink the Republican bill is a marriage penalty relief bill in name \nonly. It is a Trojan horse for the\n\n[[Page S2670]]\n\nother risky tax schemes that have been proposed so far this year.''\n  I want to go over what we have taken up this year, what we have \nproposed this year, and just say to the American people: I wonder what \nthe risky tax schemes are.\n  Is it a risky tax scheme to let people on Social Security between the \nages of 65 and 70 work without paying a penalty? Is that a risky tax \nscheme? Is the education tax credit that Senator Coverdell passed \nearlier this year to give parents a tax credit to buy education \nenhancements for their children--the computers, the extra books, the \ntutors--a risky tax scheme? Or is it the small business tax relief that \nwe passed to try to give our small businesses an opportunity to grow \nand create new jobs in our country?\n  I am not sure to which ``risky tax scheme'' the Democratic leader \nrefers. But if that is a ``risky tax scheme,'' I am guilty because I do \nbelieve the hard-working people of this country deserve to keep more of \nthe money they earn.\n  This marriage tax penalty relief was provided for in the budget we \npassed last week. We would take only 50 percent of the allocation over \na 5-year period. We think that is quite responsible as stewards of our \ntax dollars.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Republican led Senate is considering \nlegislation that I have long advocated for working families--relief \nfrom the marriage tax penalty.\n  This is not a limited problem. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, almost half of all married couples--21 million--are affected by \nthe marriage penalty. One study showed that over 640,000 couples in \nVirginia are affected.\n  The marriage tax penalty unfairly affects middle class married \nworking couples. For example, a manufacturing plant worker makes \n$30,500 a year in salary. His wife is a tenured elementary school \nteacher, also bringing home $30,500 a year in salary. If they both file \ntheir taxes as singles they would pay 15 percent in income tax. But if \nthey choose to live their lives in holy matrimony and file jointly, \ntheir combined income of $61,000 pushes them into a higher tax bracket \nof 28%. The result is a tax penalty of approximately $1,400.\n  The Republican marriage penalty relief bill would fix this unfairness \nwithout shifting of the tax burden and without the need for a tax \nincrease on any individual. Middle and low income families would \nbenefit as much as earners with higher incomes. The bipartisan support \nfor eliminating the marriage penalty is overwhelming. The House of \nRepresentatives passed the bill with 268 votes.\n  In the Senate, our bill increases the standard deduction for joint \nreturns to twice the amount of the standard deduction for single \nreturns, doubles the size of both the 15% and 28% tax brackets for \njoint returns to twice the size of the corresponding tax rate brackets \nfor single returns, and increases the phase-out income level for the \nEarned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for joint returns by $2,500. \nAdditionally, it makes permanent the current allowance of personal \nnonrefundable tax credits to offset both regular and alternative \nminimum tax liabilities.\n  Critics have claimed that most of the tax relief under our plan would \ngo to wealthy couples. That is simply not true. The Congressional Joint \nCommittee on Taxation's distribution analysis estimates that couples \nmaking under $75,000 annually will be the biggest winners. \nAdditionally, the Joint Tax Committee estimates that couples earning \nbetween $20,000 and $30,000 will receive the biggest percentage \nreduction in their federal taxes out of any income level, with couples \nmaking between $30,000-$40,000 fairing almost as well.\n  Opponents of this measure have argued that some married couples, \nwhere only one spouse works, will receive a so-called ``marriage \nbonus''. Although the word ``bonus'' implies an additional benefit, \nthis is simply not the case. First, this money belongs to the \ntaxpayers. With a surplus of over $2 trillion, not including Social \nSecurity, all taxpayers are entitled to a return of their tax \noverpayment. Second, should the federal government, through tax policy, \ndiscourage either parent from staying at home with children? If a \ncouple chooses to raise their family on just one income, they will need \nall the financial help they can get. The government should not penalize \na family simply because it takes both spouses working outside of the \nhome to make $50,000. Being a stay at home parent should be rewarded--\nnot penalized.\n  This means over $64 billion in tax relief over the next five years. \nCombined with the other tax relief measures adopted by the Senate this \nyear--tax relief for small employers, improved health care access, and \neducation savings accounts--the total tax relief considered by the \nSenate falls well within the $150 billion budgeted for tax cuts in the \nrecently-adopted budget resolution.\n  This is a modest proposal. Eliminating the marriage penalty will \nresult in less tax paid to the federal government. However, the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that taxpayers will send Uncle \nSam almost $2 trillion in additional surplus taxes over the next ten \nyears. That is after Congress has locked up 100% of Social Security \nsurplus and paid down the public debt. Our proposal asks Uncle Sam to \ngive back to middle class families just 10 cents out of every extra \nsurplus dollar they send to Washington. Is that really to much to ask \nto help families? The Federal government should not put a price tag on \nthe sacrament of marriage.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, next Monday is the deadline for all \nAmericans to file their 1999 income tax returns with the Internal \nRevenue Service. This week the Senate has appropriately dedicated its \nattention to the tax burden placed on Americans, particularly the \nunfair marriage tax penalty. Simply, the marriage tax penalty is an \ninjustice in the current Federal income Tax Code that results in a \nmarried couple filing a joint tax return paying more in taxes than if \nthe same couple were not married and filed as individuals.\n  Every week of the year I receive letters from Washington state \nconstituents outraged by the marriage tax penalty, but during tax \nseason my mailbox is deluged with the protests of married couples. Last \nyear, Congress passed a tax relief bill that would have eliminated the \nmarriage penalty, but President Clinton vetoed this needed reform. This \nyear, Democrats have spent this entire week delaying and then blocking \na Senate vote on a bill to end the marriage penalty.\n  Maybe some of my colleagues should hear what I read in the letters I \nreceive asking for action by Congress and the President to eliminate \nthe marriage tax penalty. From an email I received from a constituent \nin Maple Valley, Washington: ``I wanted to express my hope that you and \nthe other members of Congress will be able to eliminate the marriage \npenalty tax * * * Why should I pay more in taxes since I am married?'' \nFrom Bellingham, Washington: ``Fairness! It all comes down to fairness. \nPlease stop penalizing us for being married. We deserve the same as two \nsingle taxpayers.'' From a family farmer in Eastern Washington state: \n``I believe the marriage tax penalty is a mistake that should be \ncorrected. It would establish fairness in our tax system.'' This is \nmerely a sampling of the hundreds of letters I have received, but it is \nan accurate representation of the views of my constituents and the vast \nmajority of Americans.\n  My No. 1 tax legislative priority is complete tax reform. I believe \nthe entire confusing and incomprehensible Tax Code should be scrapped \nand replaced with a system that is fair, simple, uniform and \nconsistent. Until such fundamental reform can take place, I will \ncontinue to work in support of tax reform and relief measures that \ncorrect unfair aspects of the existing tax code mess. The marriage tax \npenalty is absolutely one of the most outrageous and indefensible \ninjustices in the current Tax Code. Efforts to delay and block the \nelimination of the marriage tax penalty are clearly an affront to a \nsense of fairness, the institution of marriage, and they are contrary \nto the desires of an overwhelming majority of Americans. The Senate \nshould vote now to correct the marriage tax penalty.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the marriage penalty is the extra tax a \ncouple pays as a result of being married. When a couple says ``I do'' \nthey\n\n[[Page S2671]]\n\nare really saying ``IRS, we will pay.'' The tax code has 63 provisions \nthat penalize couples for being married. There are more than 20 income \nphase-outs and each is a marriage penalty. The two biggest marriage \npenalizers are the standard deduction and the tax brackets. Fairness \nwould dictate that the standard deduction for a couple should be twice \nwhat it is for a single taxpayer. Fairness would dictate that the tax \nbracket income cut-off points for a married couple should be twice that \nof a single taxpayer. That is not the way the current code is \nstructured. This bill would restore fairness.\n  About 25 million married couples annually are adversely affected by \nthe marriage penalty. Average marriage penalty is $1,400. If we \neliminated the marriage penalty, the typical family would have an extra \n$1,400 to pay the electric bill for nine months, pay for three months \nof day care, pay for a five-day vacation at Disneyland or eat out 35 \ntimes.\n  There wasn't always a marriage penalty. Prior to 1948 the tax code \ntaxed individuals, but today, the marriage penalty has infiltrated the \nentire tax code. It didn't matter when most women stayed at home, but \nnow that so many women work it is indefensible to have the marriage \npenalty in our law. A working wife often works to support the federal \ngovernment, more than she works to help her family, because the first \ndollar she earns is taxed at the highest rate her husband's income is \ntaxed. Some economists call this the ``second earner bias'' because the \nincome of the secondary earner is stacked on top of the primary \nearner's income resulting in a relatively high marginal rate.\n  Of the 27 OECD countries 19 countries taxed husbands and wives \nseparately so there is no marriage penalty. The biggest culprits are \nthe standard deduction and the tax brackets.\n  The standard deduction for two individuals filing single returns is \nnot twice what the standard deduction for a married couple filing a \njoint return is. It isn't but, it should be.\n  Marriage penalty hits low income workers. Eligibility for the earned \nincome credit is the same for single heads of households and married \ncouples. Combining two incomes on a joint return may push a couple into \nthe phase-out range of the EIC and reduce the size of their credit.\n  As I mentioned, a growing number of tax provisions--credits and \ndeductions--are phased-out at certain income ranges. Any tax provision \nthat has an income phase-out contributes to the marriage penalty. Few \nof us probably ever stop to think about the marriage penalty when we \nvote for tax provisions with income phase-outs. Some phase-outs start \nas low as $10,000 of income. The dependent credit, the elderly credit \nand earned income credit have phase out ranges that compound the \nmarriage penalty for the working poor.\n  Several provisions have phase-outs in the $50,000 to $75,000 in \nincome range which add to the marriage penalty of the two income middle \nclass families. The dependent credit, the Hope education credit, the \nelderly credit, adoption credit; the IRA deduction and the Education \nloan interest expense deductions. Itemized deduction threshold, \npersonal exemption, all get ``marriage penalty-ed'' out of existence \nfor many married couples with modest incomes.\n  S. 2346 provides total tax relief to married couples of $64 billion \nover the next five years. Combined with the other tax relief measures \nadopted by the Senate this year--tax relief for small employers (H.R. \n833), improved health care access (H.R. 2990), and education savings \naccounts (S. 1134)--the total relief considered by the Senate \nfalls well within the $150 billion budgeted for tax cuts in the \nrecently-adopted Senate budget resolution.\n\n  Let me describe in particularity the provisions of the bill. Standard \ndeduction: The bill increases the standard deduction for married \ncouples filing jointly to twice the standard deduction for single \ntaxpayers. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, this provision \nprovides tax relief to approximately 25 million couples filing joint \nreturns. It is effective for taxable years after December 31, 2000.\n  Increased brackets: The bill expands, over a six-year period, the 15-\npercent and 28-percent income tax brackets for a married couple filing \na joint return to twice the size of the corresponding brackets for an \nindividual relief to 21 million married couples, including 3 million \nsenior citizens.\n  EIC: The bill increases the beginning and the end of the phase-out of \nthe Earned Income Credit for couples filing a joint return. Currently, \nfor a couple with two or more children, the EIC begins phasing out at \n$12,690 and is eliminated for couples earning more than $31,152. Under \nthis bill, the new range would be $2,500 higher. For these couples \neligible for the EIC, the maximum credit is increased by $526, from \n$3,888 to $4,414. It is effective for taxable years after December 31, \n2000.\n  AMT relief: The bill permanently extends the current temporary \nexemption from the individual alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) for several \nfamily-related tax credits, including the $500 per child tax credit, \nHOPE and Lifetime Learning credits, and dependent care credit. The bill \nalso exempts two refundable credits, the Earned Income Credit and the \nrefundable child credit, from being reduced by the AMT. It is effective \nfor taxable years after December 31, 2000.\n  Mr. President, this bill addresses one of the biggest federal income \ntax injustices and I hope the Congress will enact this legislation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the S. 2346--\nlegislation that would dramatically reduce one of the most insidious \naspects of the tax code: the marriage penalty.\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues are aware, there are several primary \ncauses of the ``marriage penalty\"within the tax code, including \ndifferent tax rate schedules and different standard deductions for \njoint filers versus single filers.\n  In terms of the impact of these differing tax provisions, the \nmarriage penalty is most pronounced for two-earner couples in which the \nhusband and wife have nearly equal incomes. While this may not have \nbeen as noticeable in society 30 or 40 years ago, the demographic \nchanges that have occurred since the 1960s--with more married women \nentering the workforce to help support their families--has led to a \nsignificant increase in the share of couples who suffer from the \nmarriage penalty.\n  Mr. President, make no mistake, the impact of the marriage penalty is \nsevere. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), 42% of \nmarried couples incur marriage penalties that average nearly $1,400.\n  When measured by income category, fully 12% of couples with incomes \nbelow $20,000 incurred a marriage penalty in 1996; 44% of couples with \nincomes of $20,000 to $50,0000; and 55% of couples with incomes above \n$50,000.\n  In addition, according to CBO, empirical evidence suggests that the \nmarriage penalty may affect work patterns, particularly for a couple's \nsecond earner. Specifically, because filing a joint return often \nimposes a substantially higher tax rate on a couple's second earner, \nthe higher rate reduces the second earner's after-tax wage and may \ncause that individual to work fewer hours or not at all. As a result, \neconomic efficiency is harmed in the overall economy.\n  Furthermore, while I would hope that the tax code would not be a \nfactor in a couple's decision to marry or stay single, the simple fact \nis that a couple's tax status could worsen if married and could, \ntherefore, impact a couple's decision to marry. Therefore, we should \neliminate this potential barrier to marriage and ensure that couples \nmake one of life's biggest decisions based on their values and \nbeliefs--not on the federal tax code.\n  Mr. President, as a strong opponent of the marriage penalty, I am an \noriginal cosponsor of S. 15, legislation introduced by Senator \nHutchison that eliminates the marriage penalty through a proposal known \nas ``income splitting.'' Under this approach, a married couple would \nadd up all their income and then split it in half. Each spouse would \nthen file as a single individual and pay taxes on his or her half of \nthe total income, with exemptions, deductions and credits being split \nevenly between the two spouses.\n  Last year, to advance this legislation or any other proposal that \nwould provide marriage penalty relief, I offered an amendment during \nthe markup of the FY 2000 budget resolution that ensured a significant \nreduction in--or the\n\n[[Page S2672]]\n\noutright elimination of--the marriage penalty would be a central \ncomponent of any tax cut package adopted during last year's \nreconciliation process.\n  Later that summer, in accordance with my budget amendment, the $792 \nbillion tax cut reconciliation package that was passed by the Senate \nlast summer included such relief, as did the final House-Senate \nconference report. However, just as President Clinton vetoed the tax \nbill in 1995 that included marriage penalty relief, last year's tax \nbill was vetoed as well.\n\n  In an effort to address this issue outside a broader tax package, the \nHouse of Representatives passed legislation earlier this year--by a \nbipartisan vote of 268 to 158--that would reduce the marriage penalty.\n  Now, in the Senate, we are considering stand-alone legislation that \nwould dramatically reduce the marriage penalty by doubling the standard \ndeduction for married couples relative to single filers; expanding the \n15 percent and 28 percent income tax brackets for married couples to \ntwice the size of the corresponding tax brackets for single filers; \nincreasing the phase-out range of the Earned Income Credit (EIC) for \ncouples filing joint returns; and permanently exempting family tax \ncredits from the individual Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that, by considering this package of \nmarriage penalty relief proposals as a stand-alone bill--and not as \npart of a broader, and potentially controversial, tax cut package--we \nwill not only pass this legislation prior to ``tax day'' on April 17, \nbut ultimately send a bill to the President that he will sign for the \nbenefit of all married couples.\n  The bottom line is that we should not condone or accept a tax code \nthat penalizes married couples or discourages marriage, and this bill \nprovides the Senate with the opportunity to correct this inequity in a \nstraightforward manner.\n  Ultimately, this bill is not simply about providing the American \npeople with a reasonable and rational tax cut--rather, it is about \ncorrecting a gross discrepancy in the tax code that unfairly impacts \nmarried couples. Accordingly, even though individual members of this \nbody disagree on a wide variety of tax cuts policies, I would hope we \nwould all agree that the act of marriage should not be penalized by the \nInternal Revenue Code--and would support the proposal before us \naccordingly.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Roth \nmarriage tax relief plan. The clock is ticking, Mr. President. In less \nthan forty-eight hours, Americans across the country will empty their \npockets to pay the government thousands of dollars in taxes.\n  For approximately 42 American couples, tax day will have an extra \nsting to it, because they will have to pay an average of $1,400 extra \nin taxes to accommodate an outdated and discriminatory tax system.\n  When we first adopted the tax code, women made up only about three \npercent of the work force. But today, women are full time \nentrepreneurs. Some seventy percent of mothers work, only to find their \nincome penalized. Our tax system did not anticipate this dramatic \ngrowth in dual income families. So now an outdated system discriminates \nagainst women and married couples.\n  When Mr. and Mrs. Smith get married, they look forward to a bright \nand prosperous future--to have and to hold, for richer and for poorer. \nBut they soon find that Uncle Sam has moved in and cast his low shadow \nover them. And they are undoubtedly poorer.\n  The marriage penalty cuts two ways--by pushing married couples into a \nhigher tax bracket and by lowering the couple's standard deduction. Two \nmarried income earners, with their combined income, must pay their \nincome tax at a higher rate with a lower deduction than they would if \nthey were two single people.\n  This is not a one time penalty. Under our tax system, marriage is not \na freeway. It is a toll road. For ten years of marriage, couples must \npay an average of $14,000 extra. For twenty years, couples must pay \n$28,000 extra. And they must forgo money that they could have invested \nin a car, a house, or their children's education. Mr. President, we \nmust update the tax system and we must lift this extra burden on the \nbacks of American couples.\n  The Roth plan takes solid steps on the path of tax relief. It \nincreases the standard deduction for a married couple filing a joint \nreturn to twice the basic standard deduction for a single individual \nbeginning in 2001. This standard deduction increase will help 25 \nmillion couples filing joint returns. The Roth plan expands the 15-\npercent and 28-percent tax brackets for a married couple filing a joint \nreturn to twice the size for a single individual. Twenty-one million \ncouples will benefit from these tax bracket expansions. This \nlegislation also expands the Earned Income Credit (EIC) beginning and \nending income levels by $2,500, removing the disadvantage of receiving \na smaller EIC after marriage. Finally, the Roth plan exempts family tax \ncredits from the individual Alternative Minimum Tax.\n  Mr. President, all week I have heard my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle claim their support for marriage penalty relief. Yet they \ninsist on quenching the thirst of American couples with only a raindrop \nrelief. They offer nearly $100 billion less in tax relief for American \ncouples in the next ten years. Fifty percent of the benefits under \ntheir plan do not occur until 2008.\n  We must be serious about tax relief for American couples. If you talk \nto any marriage counselor, he or she will quickly tell you that the \nnumber one cause of problems in marriage is money--specifically, the \nlack of it. If we want to support American families, if we want to \nsupport the future of America, we can start by reducing the money \nproblems of married couples.\n  Mr. President, there are 207,677 couples in my home state of Arkansas \nsuffering from the marriage penalty. They have called for marriage \npenalty relief. I want to give it to them.\n  I hope that when the clock stops ticking on Saturday, the Senate will \nhave lightened the load on the couples and the American family. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the Roth marriage penalty relief plan.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I hope that our colleagues across the aisle \nwill not prevent us from reducing the marriage penalties in the tax \ncode. This bill will provide married couples the relief that President \nClinton denied them last year with his veto of the Taxpayer Refund and \nRelief Act of 1999. President Clinton's action last year increased \ntaxes by close to $800 billion and imposed a marriage penalty on middle \nclass American families.\n  There is no place in the tax code for marriage penalties. Marriage \npenalties are caused by tax laws that treat joint filers relatively \nworse than single filers with half the income. It has of late become \ncommon practice to use the tax code for purposes of social engineering, \ndiscouraging some actions with the stick of tax penalties and \nencouraging others with the carrot of tax preferences. But there is no \nlegitimate policy reason for punishing taxpayers with higher taxes just \nbecause they happen to be married. The marriage penalties in the tax \ncode undermine the family, the institution that is the foundation of \nour society.\n  I view this bill as just a start. Our tax code will not truly be \nfamily-friendly until every single marriage penalty is rooted out and \neliminated, so that married couples with twice the income of single \nindividuals are taxed at the same rates, and are eligible for the same \ntax preferences--including deductions, exemptions, use of IRAs and \nother savings vehicles--as those single filers. This bill is an \nimportant step toward that ultimate goal.\n  The Democrat criticisms of our bill are misplaced. They argue that \nour bill contains complicated phase-ins, in contrast to their simple \napproach. But anyone who reads the bill and their alternative would see \nthat this is false. The Finance Committee bill contains percentages in \nit, sure enough. And it phases in the relief, that is true. But the \npercentages and the phase-ins are instructions to the Treasury and the \nIRS, to make adjustments to the tax brackets. The only people who have \nto make any new calculations under the Finance Committee bill are the \nbureaucrats who make up the tax tables, not the taxpayer.\n  By contrast, the Democrat alternative, in phasing in its relief, \nrequires\n\n[[Page S2673]]\n\ntaxpayers to calculate their taxes as joint filers, then calculate \ntheir taxes as if they were single--a complicated process that requires \nthe allocation of various deductions and credits. Next, the taxpayer \nwould have to determine the difference between these two calculations \nand then reduce this by a certain percentage. That is supposed to be \nsimple? The Democrat substitute adds to the headaches of tax filing and \nthe demand for tax preparers and tax preparation software.\n  The Democrats also complain that the Finance Committee bill does more \nthan address their narrow definition of the marriage penalty. They \ninvoke the so-called ``marriage bonus.'' But the ``marriage bonus'' is \na red herring. What they call a ``marriage bonus'' results from \nadjustment tax brackets for joint filers to reflect the fact that two \nadults are sharing the household income. Under the Democrat approach, \nsingle taxpayers who marry a non-working or low-earning spouse should \npay the same amount of taxes as when they were single, even though this \nincome must be spread over the needs of two adults.\n  This approach is fundamentally flawed. The Democrat approach would \nenshrine in the law a new, ``homemaker penalty.'' The Democrats would \nmake families with one earner and one stay-at-home spouse pay higher \ntaxes than families with the same household income and two earners.\n  But why discriminate against one-earner families? Why would we want a \ntax code that penalized families just because one of the spouses \nchooses the hard work of the household over the role of breadwinner? \nThe Democrat alternative discourages parents from staying home with \ntheir infant children, and penalizes people who sacrifice income in \norder that they can care for their elderly parents. That is just plain \nwrong.\n  The Finance Committee bill reduces the marriage penalty in a rational \nsensible way, by making the standard deduction for joint filers twice \nwhat it is for single filers, and by making the ranges at which income \nis taxed at the 15% and 28% rates twice for joint filers what they are \nfor single filers. This recognizes that marriage is a partnership in \nwhich two adults share the household income. Our approach cuts taxes \nfor all American families. The Democrats call this a ``bonus.'' We calm \nit common sense.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on \nthis side of the aisle?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has just a little less than 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. And if somebody \nelse wants the remaining 2 minutes, I would be glad to yield it.\n  I take this opportunity, just before the cloture votes, to clear up a \ncouple things. First of all, the Senator from North Dakota is a very \ngood friend of mine. I work very closely with him. I do not dispute \nwhat he said. But I do want to clarify his reaction to my saying that \ntaxes are as high as they have ever been in the history of our country.\n  The Senator made the point that taxes have gone down for many \ntaxpayers. Of course, that is true. He concentrated on middle-income \ntaxpayers. But it is mostly true because of the tax credit for children \nthat the Republicans promoted and passed in the 1997 tax bill. For a \nfamily with two kids, for instance, that means $1,000 that Republicans \nprovided, or about $25 billion a year.\n  But despite the protests of the Senator from North Dakota, I still \nstand by my comments that the overall percentage of taxation is at a \nhistorical high of near 21 percent of GDP.\n  Then in response to Senator Robb's comments on the Medicare reserve, \nit is my understanding that $40 billion was reserved for Medicare and \nprescription drugs in the conference report. I hope and think that the \nSenator from Virginia is incorrect.\n  I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair and the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. President, I say to all my colleagues, this is the vote on \nmarriage tax penalty relief. If you support marriage tax penalty \nrelief, vote for cloture so we can consider this bill. We can send a \nclean bill to the President. If you are not for marriage tax penalty \nrelief, do not vote for cloture.\n  This is the vote on whether or not we are going to grant marriage tax \npenalty relief to nearly 25 million American couples. That is what this \nvote is all about now. It is not about a whole bunch of extraneous \namendments. It is about the marriage tax penalty.\n  If you ran on this issue, this is your chance to vote to say: I am \nfor eliminating the marriage tax penalty. If you ran on it, this is the \ntime to stand up and say: I am for eliminating the marriage tax \npenalty.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote for cloture to go to the bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the concurrent \n     resolution (H. Con. Res. 290) establishing the congressional \n     budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2001, \n     revising the congressional budget for the United States \n     Government fiscal year 2000, and setting forth appropriate \n     budgetary levels for each of fiscal years 2002 through 2005, \n     having met\n\n[[Page S2675]]\n\n     have agreed to recommend to their respective Houses this \n     report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nCongressional Record of April 12, 2000.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nhours of debate, as follows: 90 minutes under the control of the \nSenator from New Mexico; 90 minutes under the control of the Senator \nfrom New Jersey; and 1 hour under the control of Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on our side, I do not intend to yield \nback time until Republican Senators have indicated to me they do not \nwant any time. I do not know why we need a full hour and a half on our \nside, and I do not know why they need a full hour and a half plus 1 \nhour, which is 2\\1/2\\ hours on their side.\n  I yield myself time off my hour and a half.\n  I noted a minute ago that present on the floor was Senator Snowe. \nWhile I wish to discuss a number of issues, I want to say to her, and \nto those who supported her, that because of her diligence, this budget \nresolution has a reserve fund of $40 billion to be used for Medicare \nprescription drugs and Medicare reform.\n  Frankly, I note that the House, at least on the majority side, is \nalready discussing what they would do. Clearly, this $40 billion will \ngo to the Finance Committee of the Senate because Senator Snowe, \nSenator Wyden, and Senator Smith in the committee worked very hard to \nget it done. I will say what has changed so I will not, in any way, \noverstate the case as to what Senator Wyden did.\n  But essentially because of Olympia Snowe's dedication, we put $40 \nbillion in a reserve fund. That means the Finance Committee can go to \nwork on a bill, and the money is waiting for them to do a bill that \nmeets the mandates or the qualifications of this reserve fund. We have, \nas she requested, up to $20 billion for prescription drugs and up to \n$20 billion for reforming the system so that it will do a better job \nand a more efficient job while we are adding some new benefits.\n  I think everybody who has looked at it thinks that is what we ought \nthe do.\n  In committee, there was a mandatory date by which this had to be \ndone. In conference with the House, that was refused. So we won half \nthe battle. We got the $20 billion and the $20 billion, as I have \ndescribed, which is $40 billion, but we did not get the mandatory date. \nWe are going to have to rely upon the impetus that will accrue over the \nensuing days because of the House action and the desire of this body to \nhave our Finance Committee produce a bill. I have every confidence that \nthey will.\n  Having said that, I yield myself about 10 minutes to describe where \nwe are.\n  If, in fact, we adopt this budget resolution this evening, I say we \nare getting better all the time at getting our job done. The occupant \nof the Chair will be pleased to know we have had a Budget Act for a \nlong time, since 1974. For all those years, if we produce this budget \ntonight, we will have produced three budget resolutions on time. That \nmeans April 15 had come and gone most years, and we could not get our \njob done because it was so contentious and so difficult. It will mean \nthat 2 years in a row--last year and this year--for the first time in \nhistory, we adopted a budget resolution on time, by April 15.\n  That speaks for itself. It means, however, that we can get started on \nthe work that must be done to implement this work. We can get started \nsooner, earlier. With the hard work that is going to be done \npredominantly by the Appropriations Committees, and the Finance \nCommittee in our body, we may very well get most of our work done in a \nvery timely manner and be able to leave here before our respective \nconventions with the people's business having been accomplished.\n  I think that would be a pretty good achievement. I will agree that it \nhas been a very hard job. I will also indicate openly, it was very \ndifficult for me. This work is about as difficult as any I have done in \ngetting something accomplished. Again, it is partisan. We produced it \nwith Republican votes. That is the way it normally is on a budget \nresolution. Then we will proceed to try to implement it. We will do our \nbest.\n  Let me summarize, so everybody will know what this resolution does. \nThen, in due course, we can hear from the other side as to what they \nthink it does not do and what they would like to do.\n\n  But I say to the Senate, I have seen an atmosphere that indicates the \ntheory which I adopted--starting last year when we had a big surplus--\nthat we better take a little bit of this money and allocate it to the \ntaxpayers is resonating every day, with more and more assurance that if \nwe do not, there will not be any surplus.\n  I know the occupant of the chair is a fiscally responsible person. He \nhas his ideas. I see new bills being proposed because, indeed, we have \na surplus. People have not done anything for 40 or 50 years, and they \nare introducing a bill that would cost anywhere from $2 to $5 billion, \nand all of a sudden it becomes expedient that we do it, and we must do \nit now.\n  We hear about all kinds of new bills that are now big-need items in \nAmerica. Let me suggest, for those who say it is too early to have tax \nrelief, if we do not do it pretty soon, there will be no surplus left \nfor the taxpayer.\n  Our budget resolution says: If you can, Senate and House, produce \nsome tax relief. It says if you cannot, all that money, over 5 years, \ngoes to the debt, I say to my good friend, Senator Gorton.\n  But let me suggest that we are right; we ought to put in money to \nhave some tax relief. I will give you the paramount reason for that. On \nthis floor, immediately prior to the consideration of this budget \nresolution conference report, what were we discussing? We were \ndiscussing the marriage tax penalty reform--meaning married couples in \nAmerica, including the couples married this year, when they file that \nApril 15 tax return early next week, they are going to be penalized, on \naverage, $1,400 because they are married.\n  Why should we wait around for another decade, when there are the kind \nof surpluses we have seen in this budget resolution, to provide tax \nrelief for the American people?\n  The Democrats have been arguing: The Republicans are going to enhance \nthe rich of America with their tax bill. They are going to use this \nrelief and give it all to the rich people.\n  It should come as no surprise that 50 percent of the tax relief we \nare talking about--$64 billion; almost 50 percent--is going to go to \ncure the marriage tax penalty. There may be some who will get up and \nsay that is helping the rich. But I am saying, it is something most \nAmericans do not believe is American law. Most Americans say: Are you \nkidding? Are we punishing two people who are married, who work, who \nfile joint returns? The answer is yes, and we want to fix it.\n  For those who say wait until we fix Social Security, wait until we \nfix Medicare, wait until we fund all these programs we now see as \ndesperately needed, wait until we fund the President's programs--I say \nto Senator Gorton, that is a 14-percent increase in domestic spending--\njust fund it, there will not be any money for Social Security. If you \ndo that 3 years in a row, there is no money for tax relief, and you are \nusing the Social Security surplus, which is for 3 years of domestic \nfunding at the level of the President.\n  So what is risky? They say it is risky to have marriage tax penalty \nrelief provided for in this bill. I say it is not risky; it is \nabsolutely necessary. It is urgent.\n  America must show we are concerned about married couples. There is a \nvery longstanding belief in America and in the world, that we ought to \ntry to promote family life, if we can, and married couples trying to \nstruggle through it.\n  It is not too early. It is the right time. But if we do not do it, I \ncan see it coming between all the new needs that are going to be \nprescribed for this budget that we have not done in the past, that we \nare going to have to add to this huge Federal expenditure called the \nbudget, and there will be nothing for marriage tax penalty relief or \nany kind of tax relief.\n  So once again, this budget says, over 5 years, $150 billion can be \nused in tax relief. Right off the bat, when somebody on the other side \nsays it is for the rich, I want everybody to understand\n\n[[Page S2676]]\n\nalmost half of it is for the marriage tax penalty reform. Second, we \ndon't touch a nickel of Social Security. We have Senator Abraham's part \nof this resolution which for the next year says the lockbox applies and \nmakes it part of the budget resolution that you need 60 votes to touch \nor use the Social Security surplus. Then to make it even more logical, \nwe put $170 billion against the public debt this year, the biggest \ninstallment on the debt in the history of the Republic, $1 trillion \nover the next 5 years. This is an enormous payment on the debt. Nothing \nsimilar was ever assumed 5 years ago or 10 years ago or, I imagine, for \nthe last three or four decades.\n\n  In addition, because of Senator Snowe's initiative, we provide $40 \nbillion on Medicare and prescription drugs.\n  On the tax relief--just to show the equity of it all--we put $170 \nbillion on the debt, and we have $13 billion in tax relief in the first \nyear, between 12 and 13. The ratio is about 12 to 1, almost 13 to 1 of \ndebt reduction versus tax relief. Over the 5 years, it is about 8 to 1 \nin debt reduction versus tax relief. That is pretty good fairness, \nsince we are talking about tax fairness in this budget resolution.\n  All spending will increase $212 billion over the next 5 years. That \nincludes the $40 billion for prescription drugs. There will be NIH, \nscience, funds for military, funds for health, funds for military \nretirees, veterans and other high-priority items.\n  Frankly, I hope we pass this resolution and proceed to prove we tried \nto try to do this. We think this is the right budget for our time. If \nwe don't hold down spending, except for high-priority items such as \ndefense, education, science, NIH and the like, then the married couples \nof America can say goodbye to any tax relief as it might affect them \nand make their commitment to the institution of marriage and family \nlife a little less difficult. After we have done marriage tax penalty \nrelief, we will do something on the tax side for small business, which \nis the cornerstone of our great success in the last 6 years. We will \ntalk about that later.\n  With that, unless one of my Republican Senators wants part of my \ntime, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time. I thank \nthe Senate for its attention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this is the last budget resolution on \nwhich I will be working. It has been quite an interesting exercise.\n  I start off by saying that I hope and believe firmly the goodwill \nthat exists with the chairman of the Budget Committee and myself will \nnot evaporate as we discuss this budget. We are good friends, and we \nhave been good partners in debate and discussion. We disagree on the \nconclusions. That means no disrespect flowing either way, and I am sure \nI speak for Senator Domenici. It is with esteem and--I use the term \ncarefully--affection that we have worked together.\n  Now that we have said the good things, we will get on to the others; \nthat is, I firmly believe this is the wrong budget resolution at the \nwrong time because we are still in the position that, with rare \nexception, we have almost no bipartisan agreement. I heard Senator \nDomenici describe the former occupant of the chair as fiscally \nresponsible. I assume that ``fiscally responsible'' is kind of a \ncatchall for the side of the aisle that one is on; that others on this \nside may appear to be fiscally irresponsible.\n  We can't buy that. We have a difference of view. The difference of \nview is clearly marked in this budget resolution. What should we do to \nuse the funds we have available on behalf of the American public? \nShould we focus on those whose incomes are at the middle or the lower \nend of the scale or should we give the tax breaks primarily to the \nwealthy of the country? It clearly reflects the values and priorities \nwe each have.\n  This budget conference report calls for costly and risky tax breaks \nthat would, contrary to the statements made, raid Social Security \nsurpluses. It proposes deep cuts in domestic programs such as education \nand health care and law enforcement and veterans' benefits and \nenvironmental protection. It fails to ensure that seniors will be \nprovided with a meaningful prescription drug benefit. It talks about \nit, but it doesn't arrange for it to happen. On debt reduction--the \nHoly Grail that Chairman Greenspan held out as being the cardinal first \nstep, the principle by which we operate in terms of maintaining our \nfiscal responsibility, paying down the debt--this fails to pay down the \ndebt as much as we can. It fails to make it a priority. It hides the \nlong-term cost of its tax breaks and it puts our economy at risk by \nweakening our commitment to fiscal discipline.\n  To understand my contention that the tax breaks in this conference \nreport would raid Social Security, I will take a quick look at the \nnumbers.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, says that over the next 5 \nyears, the non-Social Security surplus will be $171 billion. We don't \ndispute that. The sides have not argued on that count. This assumes \nthat Congress freezes discretionary spending at current real levels. \n``Current real levels'' means adjusting only for inflation. In fact, if \nCongress increases domestic spending at the same rate as it has done in \nrecent years, which has been greater than inflation, the actual surplus \nwould be substantially smaller. Still, to give the majority the benefit \nof the doubt, let's ignore history for a moment and optimistically \nassume that the non-Social Security surplus will be $171 billion. The \nconference report--that report which was debated and agreed upon \nbetween the House and the Senate, their budgeteers, our budgeteers, and \nfinally both bodies, they have already passed this so we are being \nasked to pass it--calls for tax breaks of $175 billion. Now, that is in \nthe face of a $171 billion non-Social Security surplus.\n  This reduction in future surpluses also would require the Government \nto pay about $21 billion more in interest payments because we would \nhave more debt. Thus, the real cost of the tax breaks isn't $175 \nbillion; it is $196 billion, $25 billion more than the entire non-\nSocial Security surplus of $171 billion. In clear words, this budget \nwould raid Social Security of $25 billion.\n  Now, if the tax breaks use the entire non-Social Security surplus, \nplus $25 billion of the Social Security surplus, how can the conference \nreport also provide funding for any of the new initiatives it claims, \nsuch as increases in military spending, prescription drug coverage, and \nagriculture, to name just a few high-priority items?\n  The real answer is, it just can't be done. The numbers don't add up. \nUnfortunately, the majority seeks to sidestep this problem by assuming \nhuge, unspecified cuts in domestic programs. The resolution calls for a \n7.5-percent cut in nondefense discretionary programs over the next 5 \nyears. The cut would be, in the fifth year, 9.8 percent. In fact, since \nthe majority claimed it would protect some specific programs, the cuts \nin other areas would be substantially higher.\n  We only received a single copy of the conference report last night at \nabout 10 o'clock. So we haven't had the time to fully analyze the \nimpact of cuts such as this. But these cuts are even more dramatic than \nthe cuts proposed in the Senate version of the legislation, which were \n8.2 percent in the fifth year. That was the Senate version of the \nlegislation, before it merged with the House in the conference report \nwe are examining now.\n  Here are some of the examples of the impact of the less severe Senate \ncuts--once again, the bill we sent over to merge with the House--as \nestimated by the Office of Management and Budget. We would have 20,000 \nnew teachers not being able to be hired to reduce class size; 5,000 \ncommunities would lose assistance to help construct and modernize their \nschools; 62,000 fewer children would be served by the Head Start \nProgram, which is a very successful program that says early education \nhelps kids prepare to learn. We find that is necessary in our society. \nThen, there would be 19,000 fewer researchers, educators, and students \nwho would receive support from the National Science Foundation. They do \nthe research that talks about climate variations. We all see what the \nimpending disasters might be like, such as tornadoes and other \nwindstorms with higher and higher velocities and more frequency. And \nfunding for all new federally led cleanup of toxic waste sites would be \neliminated. Nine-hundred fewer FBI agents could be retained.\n\n[[Page S2677]]\n\n  I wonder how the public feels about 900 fewer FBI agents--when we are \nlooking not only at reduced rates of criminality, but also \nunderstanding what the need might be; that includes domestic terrorism, \nit includes fraud, and it includes all kinds of things for which we \nknow the FBI has responsibility. We are going to work with 900 fewer \nFBI agents?\n  There would be 430 fewer Border Patrol agents available to safeguard \nour borders. Well, there isn't anybody I have talked to who thinks we \nneed less protection on our borders.\n  The list goes on. The actual cuts will be even deeper than those \nsuggested since the conference report calls for substantially deeper \ncuts than the Senate-passed version of the budget resolution.\n  As most people around here recognize, cuts of this magnitude are just \ncompletely unrealistic. They are not going to happen. Neither \nRepublicans nor Democrats are going to tolerate them. It is kind of \nputting it off in the future. It may get us through an election cycle, \nbut reality will come home and we will not be able to stand these cuts.\n  This is not the first time the Senate has assumed deep, unspecified \ncuts in the budget resolution. Last year's resolution included \nsimilarly unrealistic assumptions. Not surprisingly, by the end of the \nyear, the Republican majority of Congress had approved appropriations \nbills that spent about $35 billion more than it assumed earlier. No \ndoubt something similar is going to happen this year.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican budget relies on these unrealistic cuts \nfor its tax breaks and its various increases in mandatory spending.\n  Just to explain, mandatory spending is funding those programs that \nare decided by the legislature, the Congress--that these programs get a \nhigh priority. We recently voted $2 billion more for the FAA--not that \npeople disagree with the need for improving FAA's operations, but the \nfact is, it is mandatory. That means it gets priority, and no matter \nwhat happens behind it, the increases in FAA take place. Well, it has \nto come from someplace. It can come from transportation, from the Coast \nGuard, with all of the services they provide, or it can come from other \nsensitive places. The cost of that spending and the new tax breaks will \nbe locked in up front. The savings, however, will.\n  When Congress later fails to make the assumed cuts in appropriations \nbills, funds for the tax breaks and for new spending will require \ndeeper raids on Social Security. We should not let that fact escape. We \nwant everybody to think about it. We want the Congressmen and the \nSenators who are going home and looking toward reelection to be able to \nexplain to their constituents about how we had to dip into Social \nSecurity a little bit, even though everybody basically swore on the \nsword it would not happen. But it has to happen if this budget is going \nto stand.\n  One might think the assumption of deep, unrealistic cuts in \ndiscretionary spending would allow the Republicans to claim \nsignificantly more debt reduction than the budget proposed by \nDemocrats. However, if one assumes GOP spending cuts actually \nmaterialize, which is highly unlikely, the Republican budget would \nstill reduce much less debt than President Clinton and the Senate \nDemocrats. The Republican plan claimed to use non-Social Security \nsurpluses to reduce only about $12 billion of debt over 5 years. By \ncontrast, the President's budget would reduce $90 billion of debt over \nthat same period--more than seven times as much. So it is $90 billion \nunder the President's budget and $12 billion in the Republican budget. \nThis difference in debt reduction helps to show just how extreme the \nGOP tax breaks really are.\n  Throughout the debate on the resolution, the Republicans have claimed \nthat their budget contains over a trillion dollars of debt reduction. \nHowever, this figure is based almost entirely on Social Security \nsurpluses. These surpluses are called off-budget, and both parties are \ncommitted to protecting them. Yet when it comes to the portion of the \nbudget that remains subject to congressional discretion, Republicans \nhave refused to devote significant resources for debt reduction. In \ndoing so, they have rejected repeated calls by Federal Reserve Chairman \nAlan Greenspan to make debt reduction our first priority.\n  My next concern about the budget resolution is that it fails to \nensure that Congress will really act on legislation establishing a \nprescription drug benefit--another program that is saluted, generally. \nBut it is not real. This is in marked contrast to treatment of the tax \nbreaks. Tax breaks have an instruction to the Finance Committee that \nthey must report out a way to get tax breaks. They have to do it. There \nis quite a distinction between saying we should and they have to. The \nconference report includes two $20 billion reserve funds that, \ntheoretically, could be used for prescription drugs, but there is no \nrequirement for the Senate to act. It is very unspecific.\n  The second reserve fund contains vague language that would allow \nvirtually the entire $20 billion to be used for purposes other than \nprescription drugs. That could leave little more than $20 billion for \nprescription drugs, which is far short of what is needed to provide an \nadequate benefit. The Medicare reserve fund, applicable to the House, \nwould allow virtually the entire $40 billion fund to be diverted to \npurposes other than prescription drugs.\n  While they say we have to have it, they don't arrange for the \nmechanism to make it happen.\n  Compounding matters, Mr. President, the language of the second Senate \nreserve fund requires that the solvency of the Medicare Program be \nextended before a single penny can be used either for any prescription \ndrug benefit, or new provider payments. In other words, if you want \naccess to this money to help seniors with prescriptions, you have to \ncut somewhere else within Medicare first. And that seems very unlikely \nto happen.\n  Mr. President, there is only one conclusion to draw from all this: \nthe Republican Party simply is not committed to providing our seniors \nwith prescription drugs. The senior population has to listen to that. \nFor the Republican Party, tax breaks for the wealthy are a much higher \npriority.\n  Mr. President, my final concern about the conference report is that \nit covers only 5 years, not the 10 included in last year's resolution.\n  People might say: Well, what is the difference between 5 or 10? It \nmatters a lot because a tax break has an effect of compounding \nsignificantly in the second quintile. It is going to grow by leaps and \nbounds.\n  This has the effect of hiding the long-term cost of its tax breaks. \nIt also weakens the budget resolution as a means of enforcing long-term \nfiscal discipline, since points of order would not be available against \ntax breaks that explode in cost after 5 years.\n  Mr. President, as of last year, CBO has been producing 10-year \nnumbers. There's no excuse for Congress not doing the same. And if we \nwere serious about preparing for the baby boomers' retirement, we would \nbe sure to plan for longer term costs.\n  In sum, Mr. President, the Republican majority has made tax breaks \nthat go largely to the wealthy their highest priority. Higher than \nSocial Security. Higher than education. Higher than prescription drugs \nfor our seniors. Higher than reducing our debt. This is unacceptable. \nAnd higher than maintaining fiscal discipline.\n  In so doing, they have produced a budget that is fundamentally at \nodds with the priorities and values of the American people. A budget \nthat puts our economy at risk. And a budget that fails to prepare for \nour future.\n  Just to confirm something I earlier said, the budget resolution, as \nit came out of the Senate, says the Senate Committee on Finance shall \nreport to the Senate a reconciliation bill. That means they must do it. \nThat is the only place we have any force of law in the Budget \nCommittee. Otherwise, ours is generally a guideline or blueprint for \nhow the Congress should act, putting a ceiling on total spending. It is \nup to the Appropriations Committee to divide that spending. They say \nthis reconciliation bill shall be done not later than July 14 in the \nyear 2000, and not later than September 13 in the year 2000. So they \nhave 2 days. That is a realistic assignment for the Finance Committee.\n  There is no such thing for prescription drugs. The Republicans are \nnot asking that we treat prescription drugs\n\n[[Page S2678]]\n\nwith the same force and the same outcome as we do the tax breaks.\n  One thing is apparent. One thing is very clear. They are going to \nprotect the tax breaks no matter who they have to take the money from \nto make it happen--no matter what program they are going to take the \nmoney from to make it happen; no matter what it does to the budget and \nits balance; no matter what it does to debt reduction; no matter what. \nThe primary thing is tax reduction and tax breaks for the wealthy. If \nyou make $800,000, which is kind of the median figure for the top 1 \npercent, you might get a $50,000 tax cut, if plans go as they are. But \nif you make $35,000, you could be looking at $1 a week, or maybe even \n$2, if things go right.\n  We have to make decisions. There is no room for amendments. There is \nno room for change. This has been decided. The majority decided. The \nmajority will have to carry it because I predict that there is going to \nbe little, if any, support from Democrats. We don't believe it is \nfiscally responsible. We don't think it is fair. We don't think it is \nequitable. We don't think the wealthy ought to be the largest \nbeneficiary of the outcome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished ranking \nminority member would agree with me on a request. Senator Gorton is \ngoing to preside at 4 o'clock. He wonders, if he arrives on the floor 4 \nor 5 minutes before having to preside, if he could speak on my time for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have no objection assuming that we don't interrupt \nright in the middle. We will do our best to provide for Senator Gorton.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes in rebuttal. Then I will be \nglad to yield time to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey.\n  First, let me explain what we have done on Medicare.\n  Before any tax relief is provided in terms of dollar numbers, we have \nalready used $40 billion of the non-Social Security surplus for \nMedicare. That is waiting for the committee, at which time it is \nassigned to them. We are not gambling. We are saying that is it. As a \nmatter of fact, we are saying if you do not do it, it goes to the debt.\n  What do we provide with the $40 billion? There is a little, tiny bit \nof difference between the way we and others see it. And we think there \nwill be a majority for this view when the bill finally gets considered. \nWe say there is $40 billion. We say if you do no reform of the program, \nthere is $20 billion. Let me repeat that. If you do no reform, there is \n$20 billion for prescription drugs. If you do some reform to stabilize \nthe program, you can use the whole $40 billion for prescription drugs.\n  That is what Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine had as the underpinnings \nof her approach. She wanted some reform. But she wanted to make sure, \neven if we could not do that, we started a prescription drug program \nwith $20 billion.\n  If the committee does something like the Breaux-Frist--that is a \nbipartisan approach--with some reform in Medicare, you understand the \nMedicare program will be insolvent in about 13 years. I don't think \nseniors want us to add a benefit that will make it run out of money \nsooner. I think they would be asking us to see if we could fix it and \nmake it more responsive, more modern, to give them more money for \nprescription drugs.\n  Let me repeat that we are not taking this money from anyone. It is \naside and apart from the tax relief we are asking for, such as the \nmarriage tax penalty reform that the other side has been delaying here \non the floor.\n  We are saying $40 billion is set for Medicare, and it has two \npurposes. If you do not reform and make the program more modern so it \nhas a chance of surviving longer, you can use $20 billion of it. It \nsays so in the resolution for prescription drugs. But if you do \nsomething such as the Breaux-Frist reform, which is fixing the program, \nyou can use the $40 billion of new money for prescription drugs.\n  Frankly, I think it is a responsible way to handle a very difficult \nproblem because if you do not ask for some reform to get the full $40 \nbillion, we are going to have $40 billion, and the program next year is \nnot going to be any better off. Then seniors are going to ask: Now what \nhappens? We have prescription drugs, but we are still not going to have \nany money to pay our regular bills in about 13 years.\n  I think we are pushing both at the same time.\n  Let me make my last observation with reference to the difference \nbetween the two parties.\n  All of them are going to vote against this. It really says you cannot \npass the marriage tax penalty which is going to cost the Treasury about \n$64 billion over 5 years in the name of fairness to married couples. \nYou can't pass that, they say, until you have done all of these other \nthings that Government wants done for the Government. And there will \nnever be a time when we are going to have a surplus to give to the \nhard-working people of this country, in particular, relief items such \nas the marriage tax penalty. There is not going to be any money around. \nDon't kid anyone. There is a very big difference.\n  I ask that you take a visual inventory with me about the \nannouncements of late by the administration, the Secretary of Energy, \nand many others: We have new programs on which we have to spend \nmoney. It isn't enough that the President already provided a 14-percent \nincrease in domestic discretionary. There are all the new needs.\n\n  What money will they use for the ``pay fors''? Does anybody have any \nidea? Is the money coming from heaven? New manna in the desert? Of \ncourse not. It will be the surplus we think ought to go back to the \ntaxpayer in the form of tax relief after we spent money to increase \ngovernment.\n  We have money to increase government, but how much is enough? I think \nthere is enough money available to leave a little bit. I rechecked my \nnotes, and the tax relief in this first year is $11.6 billion; the debt \nreduction is $170 billion. How can anyone say we are not reducing the \ndebt when that is the largest payment on the national debt in the \nhistory of the Republic? This resolution says: Don't touch Social \nSecurity. You will reduce it by $1 trillion--hardly a number we can \nunderstand--and still have a little bit left over for such things as \ntax relief for married couples in America.\n  That is the big difference. They want to wait, we don't know how \nlong, but perhaps until we solve every problem we have in government \nwith reference to Medicare and everything else. Don't give the taxpayer \nback even this little tiny amount.\n  I hope the Republicans will support this. I am very proud of the \ndifference.\n  They would not have put more than $40 billion in for Medicare if they \nwere producing their own resolution. That is about the right number on \nwhich they could get consensus on their side of the aisle. They would \nnot put 50 or 60 or 80. If you put 40 in, there is money left over for \nthe taxpayer. That is the truth of the budget resolution.\n  There will be a historic debate on education reform in a couple of \nweeks. I am very pleased to know we have probably had something to do \nwith precipitating that reform debate. There is enough money to \nincrease education. It is obvious to this Senator the Republicans are \nnot going to go for an increase in education money if it is status quo \nfor education, if we are going to do more of the same, because more of \nthe same isn't good enough. We need to do something very different in \neducation and spend more money doing it. We are going to have an \nopportunity to have that discussed.\n  This conference report assumes $45.6 billion in 2001 for the \nDepartment of Education. That is overall, for everything--a $10 billion \nincrease. Not exactly for what the President wants but overall in this \nfunction. That is what is provided.\n  This is an election year. The administration and Secretary Richardson \nhave the latest idea to take care of anyone who worked in a nuclear \nfacility over the last 50 or 60 years. I know they are good sounding \nbills, but it is also an election year.\n  I say to the taxpayer and to married couples of America, beware of an \nelection year. In this country, an election year means they want to \nspend all your money and try to convince you that is right, leaving \nnothing to repair problems in tax law such as the marriage tax penalty. \nBeware. They will have more spending programs than you ever\n\n[[Page S2679]]\n\nheard of, including a 14-percent increase in domestic discretionary \nspending by the President in his budget in an election year.\n  The Republicans say: We want a change; we don't want the huge add-ons \nto government. We think in the scheme of things, over the next 5 years, \nthe taxpayer ought to get a little bit of relief.\n\n  That is the difference in the two bills. I think it is a good \ndifference. When they say rich people are going to get the benefit of \nthe tax relief on the marriage tax penalty, that is unfair. We want to \nfix it. How many want to do that? We win that. We have to use some of \nthe surplus to pay for that kind of reform. That money doesn't grow on \ntrees. That money has to come out of the coffers of the United States. \nIt doesn't belong to the Government.\n  I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to Senator Gorton, and then I yield \nback to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I appeal to my friends on the Democrat side, as well \nas others, we only have a total of 3 hours, plus an hour that Senator \nReed has, for Members to talk. Members need to be prepared to come to \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, there are, in my view, two remarkable \naspects to the budget resolution conference report before the Senate \nthis afternoon.\n  The first is, I believe for only the third or fourth time since the \nBudget Act was passed, the promptness with which the Senate is dealing \non a final basis with a budget resolution that is the springboard from \nwhich we will do the substantive work of the appropriations for the \nbalance of this year. For that promptness, for the efficiency with \nwhich the Senate has dealt with this issue, we owe our deepest and \nsincerest thanks not only to the chairman of the committee, my friend, \nPete Domenici, but to the staff who have labored so long and so hard on \na highly technical and complicated task.\n  More significant perhaps than the significance of finishing our work \non time is the substantive nature of this budget resolution. It is \nexquisitely balanced among three separate needs: The need to adequately \nfund those programs that are already major responsibilities of the \nFederal Government; the need to provide for additional programs of \nconsiderable interest, the most significant of which being the Medicare \nprogram about which Senator Domenici spoke earlier, but also including \npriorities with respect to education--particularly close to my heart--\nand to our national defense.\n  The second substantive element of this budget resolution is the \ndramatic reduction in the national debt it will cause. It is only a \nshort period of time since we were discussing how we could reduce \nannual national deficits of upwards of a quarter a trillion a year. Now \nwe face the equally difficult but far more pleasant prospect of paying \noff the national debt at a very substantial rate.\n  The third element in this budget resolution is the opportunity to \nprovide tax relief for hard-working Americans who pay taxes. The \nchairman of the committee, Senator Domenici, pointed out the importance \nof the bill, which regrettably was subjected to a filibuster earlier \ntoday, to end the unconscionable penalty against married Americans, \nboth of whom are at work. The thought that a couple in love, even in \nrelatively modest professions, should pay a penalty for getting married \nrather than receiving the approbation of society for doing so is \nbizarre. To have the ability to provide for that marriage tax penalty \nrelief, amounting, as the chairman pointed out, to almost half of the \nallowed tax relief in the bill, is a vitally important part of this \nbudget resolution.\n  As the chairman himself pointed out, if for some reason we cannot \npass tax relief, or if for some reason we pass a tax relief bill that \nis vetoed by the President, then that money should go to further pay \ndown the national debt. Regrettably, many of the Members on the other \nside, as evidenced by their actions just a week ago when we were \ndebating this issue on the floor of the Senate, would prefer to spend \nit. I suspect if we added up the expenditures contained in all of their \nunsuccessful amendments, we not only would have spent the entire \ngeneral fund surplus, but we would have once again eaten into the \nSocial Security surplus as well.\n  In summary, we have a budget resolution that allows us adequately to \nfund the functions of government. It allows us to meet some new needs \nand desires of the American people. It allows us modest but still \nsignificant room for tax relief. It makes dramatic payments on the \nnational debt.\n  For each and every one of those reasons, we not only owe our thanks \nto the chairman of the Budget Committee and to his staff, I believe we \nowe our votes in favor of the resolution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Who yields time? The Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I request to be recognized out of my time \nunder the unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is so recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are spending a few moments discussing the \nbudget. There are obvious differences on both sides with respect to \nthis budget. I commend the chairman, Senator Domenici, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Lautenberg, for their efforts over many months to \nfashion a budget and bring it to us.\n  My focal point is not on the vote that is forthcoming; it is on the \nvote we just concluded with respect to adjournment. In many respects, I \nshare the overall sentiments of the Senator from West Virginia that it \nis about time we get down to work and business, and if we need to take \ntime to consider the marriage tax penalty and other provisions, we \nshould do that, rather than arbitrarily and conveniently walking away.\n  The concern I have goes to another critical issue, and that is the \nissue of our inability over many months to bring to this floor a \nconference report on the juvenile justice bill which includes sensible \ngun safety measures we all adopted in the wake of the Columbine \ntragedy.\n  The first-year anniversary of that tragedy is just 7 days away, and \nwe will not be in Washington working on this issue; we will be \nscattered around the country. I believe--and that is why I joined many \nof my colleagues voting against adjournment--that we should be here \nworking rather than off about the country on April 20 saying, I am \nsure, thoughtful and pious comments about our outrage at what happened \nat Columbine High School and the need to do something. We should be \nhere instead doing something, and our departure should be tempered with \nthe realization that we have for months foregone effective action to \nprovide sensible gun safety rules in this country.\n  We all were shocked last April 20 by the carnage and horror at \nColumbine High School. Within a month, in May, we passed extremely \nsensible provisions as part of the juvenile justice bill to provide for \nchild safety locks, to close the gun show loophole, ban the importation \nof large-capacity ammunition clips for automatic weapons, and many \nother provisions. Yet all of our efforts have languished for months. In \nfact, the conference committee met just one time in August in a \nperfunctory meeting, and since that time, it has not even come together \nto consider these difficult issues and to seek a compromise resolution \nso we can send this measure to the President to become law.\n  We are leaving today with our work undone. I had hoped we could have \nstayed. I had hoped we could have worked harder and more efficiently so \nthat we could, in fact, have a conference report with gun control \nmeasures that would be sent to the President for his signature.\n  The Columbine tragedy is just one aspect of a pervasive climate of \ngun violence in this country that claims 12 children a day. We have to \ntake effective steps to prevent that tidal wave of gun violence.\n  I note the other body, responding to the pressure of public opinion \nand the sensible nature of the provisions we are talking about, moved \nlast Tuesday to enact legislation that provides enhanced penalties, \nmandatory minimum sentences on any person who uses a gun while \ncommitting a crime of violence or is involved in serious drug \ntrafficking offenses.\n  No one is going to argue about the need for strong enforcement and \nstiff\n\n[[Page S2680]]\n\npenalties, but enforcement without adequate, sensible, comprehensible \nlaws misses the point. We have to do both. Indeed, we insist both be \ndone.\n  My colleague, Senator Durbin of Illinois, has been very forceful in \ntrying to, within the context of this budget, enhance the resources \ndevoted to the enforcement of our gun laws. He has met opposition. That \nopposition, I believe, should fade. We can and must do both: Prevent \ngun violence by good, sound, commonsense laws, and enforce those laws \nso we further add to the prevention of violence in our community.\n\n  One other aspect of this enforcement issue is the simple fact that we \ncannot enforce loopholes. We have to have legislation that is sensible, \npractical, and works. We found, particularly in the case of the gun \nshow legislation, that the current regime just does not work. Senator \nLautenberg's amendment on the juvenile justice bill will effectively \nclose that loophole and give our authorities credible and effective \nmeans to prevent easy access to firearms by those individuals who are \nprohibited, either through criminal records or a history of mental \ninstability.\n  There are other aspects within the bill that are so clearly and \nobviously necessary and, indeed, noncontroversial. In poll after poll, \n89 percent of Americans support child safety locks, support the notion \nthat these safety locks should be sold with a weapon and, indeed, \nshould be incorporated in the design of a new weapon. The State of \nMaryland last week, in a very courageous legislative act, passed \nlegislation that will do just this.\n  The need is quite clear. For children under the age of 15, the rate \nof accidental gun deaths in America is nine times higher than the rate \nof 25 other industrial countries combined. Often, I believe, there is a \nmisperception about the nature of gun violence in this country; that it \nis the result of hoodlums attacking innocent citizens, victimizing them \nwith handguns, when, in fact, there is an extraordinary number of \nchildren who are killed accidentally. Here, certainly, is a situation \nwhere a child safety lock can and should make a difference.\n  There is another aspect of gun violence in America and, again, it is \nnot the gangs with guns attacking innocent citizens. It is the fact \nthat guns are frequently used in suicides. For young children under 15, \nsuicide deaths from guns are 11 times higher than that of the other 25 \nindustrial nations combined. In fact, 54 percent of all firearms-\nrelated deaths in 1996 were suicides. Once again, a child safety lock \nmight have helped, might have deterred for a moment a child, or even an \nadult, who was so desperate, so distraught that they contemplated and \nsadly acted out a death wish.\n  These statistics alone warrant the legislation--in fact, demand the \nlegislation. There is a wealth of research that suggests the likelihood \nof suicide among adolescents increases by the ease of access to \nfirearms--suicide by firearms.\n  According to the National Journal, one study last year found that \nthree-fourths of adolescents who use a gun to commit suicide obtain the \ngun from the family home.\n  The Injury Control Research Center at the Harvard School of Public \nHealth found in a 1999 survey that 20 percent of gun owners stored \ntheir guns loaded and unlocked. This is a situation, again, that cries \nout for sensible control of weapons to prevent these tragic and \nunnecessary deaths.\n  There is a national survey--the largest ever conducted--on gun \nstorage by the American Journal of Public Health which found that more \nthan 22 million children in the United States live in homes with \nfirearms; and in 43 percent of those homes, the guns are not locked up \nor fitted with trigger locks.\n  Simply by the adoption of a national requirement to have trigger \nlocks on weapons, we cannot ensure that each and every gun will be \nlocked up and secured. But certainly, we will have a much higher \npercentage of those weapons that are secured if we pass legislation of \nthis kind.\n  If we require a safety lock to be provided when a gun is sold, if we \ngive parents and adults who buy these weapons not only the incentive \nbut the actual lock, we can, I hope and expect, reduce these types of \ndeaths among children.\n  In fact, we probably should be doing more because there are many \nStates that have child access prevention laws--or CAP laws as they are \ncalled--which encourage the safe storage of firearms by holding adults \naccountable if they knowingly keep a firearm within their home where a \nchild might have access to it and that child, in fact, obtains the \nweapon and uses it to harm themselves or to harm others. Senator Durbin \nhas such a bill. I am proud to be a cosponsor of that legislation. This \nlegislation is working.\n  A 1997 article published in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation analyzed the effect of CAP laws in 12 States. The JAMA \nstudy found that, on average, there was a 23-percent drop in accidental \nfirearm-related deaths among children younger than 15 years old.\n  There has been an overall downward trend in unintentional shootings \nin the United States since 1979. That is encouraging. But indeed, we \nsaw a much steeper decline in those States that had child access \nprevention laws.\n  But if we are not yet ready to consider a child access prevention \nlaw, the least we can do, the minimum we can do, is follow through on \nour vote of last May and ensure the conference committee sends to us \nquickly the child safety lock legislation that we passed.\n  There is another important part of the legislation that is pending in \nthe conference committee, and that is the legislation that was \nsponsored and championed by Senator Lautenberg with respect to the gun \nshow loophole. This particularly resonates at this moment when we are \ndays away from the Columbine tragedy, because, in fact, three of the \nweapons used in the Columbine tragedy were bought at gun shows from \nunlicensed dealers who did not have to perform background checks.\n  The two killers, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, along with an older \nwoman friend, Robyn Anderson, went to a gun show and obtained these \nweapons. In fact, it is reported that both Harris and Klebold went from \ntable to table, from booth to booth, trying to find an unlicensed \ndealer, knowing they would not be subjected to a background check.\n  In fact, Robyn Anderson herself testified before the Colorado \nLegislature that she would not have helped these young men if she knew \nshe had to face a background check.\n  What more compelling evidence can we have of the need and the effects \nof this legislation than the reality of the tragedy at Columbine High \nSchool?\n\n  There has been a lot of talk by the gun proponents that a 72-hour \nwaiting period is involved in this amendment. It is not the case at \nall. There is not a waiting period. What it requires, though, is that \nthe law enforcement authority would have 72 hours to fully conduct the \nbackground check. The gun lobby and their allies say that would \ncompletely undermine gun shows, which are weekend events, which start \nup on a Saturday and end perhaps in midafternoon the next day, Sunday. \nThey say they could not do that.\n  In fact, not only could they do it in the vast majority of cases, but \nthey should do it because we should have the same Brady law applying to \nall dealers at a gun show.\n  It turns out that the FBI indicates, in their statistics, that most \ngun purchases are processed extremely quickly. In fact, using the \nnational instant check system, the FBI clears 72 percent of gun buyers \nwithin 30 seconds; another 23 percent are cleared within 2 hours. So 95 \npercent of the people who attempt to obtain guns are cleared within 2 \nhours. It is only that other 5 percent who might require an additional \nday or two.\n  But of that 5 percent, they are 20 times more likely to be prohibited \nfrom possessing a firearm. So the reality is that those people who \nargue for no background checks at gun shows or they have to be limited \nto 24 hours are simply protecting those who are most likely to be \nprohibited under the law from purchasing a firearm, a handgun.\n  In fact, the vast majority of gun purchasers, those law-abiding \ncitizens, those individuals that the NRA points to as their sterling \nmembers, would not be impeded at all. They would be checked within 2 \nhours.\n  The other aspect of this, in terms of requiring additional time for \nlaw enforcement officers, is that if there is a problematic application \nfor a purchase, if there is a suggestion or indication\n\n[[Page S2681]]\n\nthat the individual is not qualified, then those law enforcement \nofficers need the time to check out records, to go to a county \ncourthouse or to go someplace else to get the records that would be \nvirtually impossible if this was limited to 24 hours on a Saturday or a \nSunday.\n  Frankly, they have to do it because there is a due process \nrequirement. If you are going to turn down an individual from obtaining \na firearm, that police officer has to have sufficient evidence, real \nevidence--not hearsay, not the feeling that something is wrong, not a \nthought that they heard about this individual someplace, in the coffee \nshop, that he is unreliable or might have been convicted of a crime--\nthey have to have tangible evidence. Otherwise, they will be sued, \nprobably by advocates and proponents of the gun lobby. So this is a \nreal, practical and necessary need for enforcing the law.\n  But what we hear consistently from the gun lobby is lots of \nmisinformation: It will close down gun shows. There is a waiting \nperiod.\n  All of this is wrong. The Lautenberg amendment is sound, practical, \npragmatic legislation that will deal with the problem, that will not at \nall impede the vast majority of purchases of firearms at gun shows, and \nwill contribute significantly to the elimination of, we hope, or at \nleast a diminution of the gun violence we are seeing in the country \ntoday.\n  In the Senate last week, we had the opportunity to vote on a \nresolution I proposed that would urge the conferees to send a report \nback to us before April 20, including all of the provisions I have \nspoken about, that would, in fact, give us the chance to send this to \nthe President for his signature. The vote on April 6 was 53-47, with a \nbipartisan majority. That vote has started some wheels turning.\n  On April 11, Mr. Hyde, chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the \nother body, and John Conyers, the ranking member, sent a letter to \nSenator Hatch saying:\n\n       We write to request a juvenile justice conference meeting \n     as soon as possible.\n  We are making progress, but we are going to lose this momentum and \nthis progress as we leave this week. Perhaps that is intentional. \nPerhaps this is about stopping the momentum that is building up, \nplaying for time, hoping that we forget about Columbine, hoping that \nwhen the anniversary comes, we will be all around the country and the \nworld and not here to respond to the concerns of families in this \nNation who are deeply concerned about this issue.\n  I have spoken about the aspects of the legislation. I have spoken \nabout the logic behind it, the statistics that strongly support it. \nUltimately, this is about people's lives in America --sadly and too \noften, about children's lives.\n  On February 29, a 6-year-old, Kayla Rolland, was shot to death by her \n6-year-old classmate in Mount Morris Township, MI. I have said this \nbefore and it bears repeating: If any of us last May stood on this \nfloor and said a 6-year-old child would be shot to death with a handgun \nby another 6-year-old child in a school in America, we would have been \naccused and lambasted as a hysterical demagog who was trying to stir up \nunreasonable fears and concerns for political advantage.\n  The truth is, it has happened. A 6-year-old is dead, shot by another \n6-year-old in a school in this country. That week, Kayla's death was \njust one of other deaths of children that go unheralded because 12 \nchildren die a day. For example, one young woman in Carroll County, MD, \n18 years old, died of an accidental gunshot wound to the head after she \nand her friends were admiring her father's .22-caliber revolver. Where \nwere her parents? They were in Costa Rica as missionaries. Had there \nbeen a law requiring a trigger lock, had the gun salesman been required \nto provide a trigger lock with this weapon, I have to believe parents \nsuch as that would have locked up the weapon. As those teenagers were \nadmiring the weapon, it wouldn't have discharged. We might have been \nable to save a life if we had acted. Think of the lives that are being \nlost because we are not acting.\n  Another 16-year-old boy in Shopiere, WI, and his friend were horsing \naround with a .22-caliber pistol his mother kept for protection. It was \nusually stored in a dresser, but they got ahold of it. After posing \nwith the gun for pictures, the boy pointed the gun to his head. It went \noff, killing him. As his grandmother said: It was kid's play, total \nkid's play. Ask yourself, had that weapon been secured with a child \nsafety lock, would it have gone off as two young kids horsing around \nposed with it? Probably not.\n  Then a 15-year-old boy in San Bernardino, CA, found his stepfather's \nhandgun, while his pregnant mother slept, and used to it shoot himself. \nPerhaps at the height of desperation, if he had seen a lock on that \nweapon, he might have been deterred for a moment, enough time perhaps \nto somehow come back off the edge rather than to plunge into the abyss \nand take his own life.\n  A 16-year-old girl in Altoona, PA, argued with her father about her \ncurfew. He was a gun collector; he had handguns. She found one and \nkilled herself--over a curfew. Perhaps, again, if there had been a \nchild safety lock, some other protective device, that momentary pique, \nthat momentary anger we have all had with our parents, would have \nresulted in perhaps an annoyance but not death.\n  That is just one week in America, the week Kayla Rolland died. But it \nis every week in America, 12 children a day. We can do more. We should \ndo it, rather than leaving today and going off on our recess. That \nwould be the greatest tribute to the 12 young people and the 1 teacher \nwho died in Columbine High School.\n  I would like to say the conference committee has been working, but \nthat is not accurate. They have been waiting for a year. We have been \nwaiting for a year. We can do more. We should do more. We must do more. \nThe American people want it. The American people expect it. The \nAmerican people deserve it--certainly the families of those children \nwho were killed at Columbine and the 12 children a day who are victims \nof gun violence in this country.\n  I realize we have lost that vote on adjournment. We will be back. We \nwill come back again and again and again until we pass sensible gun \nsafety legislation to make this country a bit safer and, hopefully, do \nwhat the American people sent us here to do: To protect their children \nand ensure a rule of law and not an error of violence that claims the \nlives of children each and every day.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Massachusetts \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the budget resolution that Republicans \nput before the American people today proposes an unacceptable change of \ncourse, at a time when the Nation needs to stay the course of the \ninvestments that are driving our historic economic expansion. This is a \nbudget that reverts to the days of trickle-down economics, despite all \nthe evidence that it will only widen the unconscionable gap that \nalready exists between rich and poor in our society. It fails to \nrespond to the challenges the Nation so obviously faces in education, \nhealth care, prescription drugs for the elderly, youth violence, \nfirearm safety, hunger, scientific research and development, and \nenvironmental protection.\n  The Senate improved the House budget resolution in important respects \nlast week, but the House position prevailed on every issue during \nconference. The document before the Senate today is far less \nsatisfactory than the budget the Senate sent to conference last Friday. \nThe Senate resolution dedicated just $2.7 billion of the $150 billion \nRepublican tax cut to Pell Grants that help low-income, high-achieving \nstudents attend college. But the House Republicans killed even this \nmodest incentive for college education, preferring to keep every \npossible dollar for more tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  The Senate resolution included an $8.5 billion reserve fund to expand \nearly learning opportunities, so that young children enter school ready \nto learn. This was a bipartisan amendment that Senator Stevens, Senator \nJeffords and I offered. But House Republicans blocked it.\n  The Senate resolution included a pledge that the minimum wage should \nbe increased by $1, but the House Republicans rejected it.\n\n[[Page S2682]]\n\n  The Senate minimum wage provision expressed our fundamental \ncommitment that many of the hardest working Americans working 40 hours \na week, 52 weeks of the year, ought not to have to continue to live in \npoverty, nor should their children. But it was rejected by the House \nconferees.\n  The Senate resolution even included a provision by Republican Senator \nArlen Specter to increase funding for medical research. But again, \nHouse Republicans rejected it.\n  Instead, the Republican budget resolution that emerged from \nconference is a shortsighted scheme to protect narrow special-interests \ninstead of the national interest. I'm proud to join my Democratic \ncolleagues in voting against it. We will continue the battle for a fair \nbudget in weeks and months ahead. But the final battle may well be on \nelection day, when the American people at long last will have the \nchoice to elect the Congress that will make the right investments, not \nthe wrong investments, for the Nation's future.\n  During last week's budget debate we heard many statistics that are \nmisleading at best. When we cut through all the ``smoke and mirrors,'' \nwhat matters is that this unacceptable budget resolution supports a \nhuge tax break for the wealthy that the Nation can't afford.\n  The independent Congressional Budget Office confirms that the \nRepublican budget resolution reduces domestic discretionary spending by \nan average of 6.5%. It is impossible for this Congress to write honest \nappropriations bills with cuts that drastic. Our Republican colleagues \ncouldn't make the numbers add up without massive accounting gimmicks \nlast year, and they can't do it this year.\n  Our Republican friends say that they designed this budget resolution \nto curb the gimmicks used last year. But we all know there will be new \nones used to pretend to meet the urgent needs our country faces.\n  This budget also prevents us from acting to reduce the number of low-\nincome working families who have no health insurance--to rebuild our \ncrumbling public schools, to reduce the hunger that still afflicts 3 \nout of every 100 American households--to make college affordable for \nlow-income students --and to achieve the scientific advances that are \nso close.\n  Tax breaks for the wealthy are what this budget resolution is all \nabout. No other subject is treated so often and so thoroughly. There \nare reconciliation instructions on tax cuts, reserve funds for tax \ncuts, and even provisions for more tax cuts if the surplus grows. The \nonly things that this budget resolution requires committees to report \nare tax cuts. The only procedural protection under ``reconciliation'' \nprovided by the resolution is for tax cuts.\n  Democrats support affordable, targeted tax cuts, and they should be \nenacted promptly. But the merit of a tax cut depends on its size and \nits distribution. It is obvious that these GOP tax cuts are excessive \nand irresponsible. They offer plums for the rich and crumbs for \neveryone else, and President Clinton will be right to give them the \nveto they obviously deserve.\n  The budgets we vote for say a great deal about our values. It is easy \nto pay lip service to meeting the Nation's unmet needs. But a budget \nclearly shows whether we are willing to allocate resources to address \nthose needs effectively.\n  This budget does not pass the laugh test. It does not seriously \naddress the range of important challenges facing America. It does not \nmeet our national needs in education, in health care, in medical and \nother scientific research, in security for senior citizens, in \nenvironmental protection, and in public safety. On all these issues, it \nis a failed budget, because it fails America. It gives the most to \nthose who already have the most. It pretends that the Nation has no \nunmet needs--and it deserves to be defeated.\n  Mr. President, one very important aspect of the budget that was \naltered and changed in the budget conference report concerns the issue \nof prescription drugs. This issue was before the Senate Finance \nCommittee. We had debate on this measure on the floor during the budget \nconsideration. We hoped to be able to have debate on this issue when we \ntalked about the marriage tax penalty. Look at the contrast between the \nway the budget conference considered tax breaks and how the conference \ncommittee addressed prescription drugs--an issue that is calling out \nfor action by this Congress, and calling out for action now.\n  We made some progress in the budget resolution that passed the Senate \nearlier, but look at what happened in that conference. Look at what \nhappened on one of the most important issues in this country today. \nProviding America's seniors with the help they need in order to \nsurvive, through a responsible, comprehensive prescription drug benefit \nthat will be affordable and that will include basic benefits, as well \nas catastrophic coverage must be a priority.\n  Look at the difference on what we call reconciliation of revenue \nreductions in the Senate. In other words, what did the budget \nresolution say in the conference with regard to tax cuts? It says that \nthe Senate Committee on Finance shall report to the Senate a \nreconciliation bill not later than July 14 of the year 2000, and not \nlater than September 13, 2000, that consists of changes in laws within \nits jurisdiction sufficient to reduce the total level of revenues by \n$11.6 billion in 2001 and $150 billion for fiscal years 2001-2005. Not \nlater than July 14 or September 13. This is what is in the conference \nreport with regard to prescription drugs.\n  Whenever the Senate Committee on Finance reports a bill which \nimproves access to prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, the \nchairman of the Committee on the Budget may revise to accommodate such \nlegislation $20 billion over the period of fiscal years 2001 through \n2005. Then the (b) section talks about Medicare reform.\n  We have changed some rather specific instructions on prescription \ndrugs--improving access to prescription drugs. The seniors of this \ncountry know the difference between access to prescription drugs and a \nbenefit package that includes prescription drugs. Access to \nprescription drugs may mean a bus ticket for a senior living in Maine \nor any of the border States to go over to Canada. That is access to \nprescription drugs. We are not talking about access. We are talking \nabout a benefit package that is going to be meaningful to our senior \ncitizens.\n  That is what this debate has been about. Our seniors understand which \nbenefits they receive and they understand which benefits they don't \nreceive. One benefit they do not receive is a prescription drug \nbenefit. In addition, the $20 billion which may have access to \nprescription drugs at this time is half the amount the President has \nrecommended.\n  This is a clear abdication of this body's responsibility to our \nseniors. We cannot go home without taking action on an effective \nprescription drug program. We on this side of the aisle feel strongly \nthat one of the priorities that should have been attended to prior to a \ntax break is an effective prescription drug program; one that is \nuniversal, basic and catastrophic, and affordable--affordable to the \nindividuals and affordable to our government.\n  But, no, we get lip service on the issue of prescription drugs in \nthis particular proposal. That in and of itself should be enough reason \nto reject the proposal. If you vote for this budget, you are not \nserious about making sure our seniors are going to have prescription \ndrugs. You cannot vote for this budget and say you are serious about \nprescription drugs because this budget does not provide the necessary \nassurance to our senior citizens.\n  I will take a final minute to talk about the drug crisis America's \nseniors are facing. Prescription drug coverage is going down at the \nsame time drug costs are going up. I shared with the Senate the other \nday the reality our senior citizens across this country face. A third \nof all senior citizens don't have any prescription drug coverage at \nall; another third are losing coverage. These seniors have employer-\nbased coverage, which is declining dramatically every single year. Then \nthere are seniors with coverage through HMOs; their coverage is being \nsqueezed out. The only group that has reliable coverage are the poorest \nof the poor who are covered under the Medicaid program. Prescription \ndrug coverage is not just another benefit, it is life and death for our \nseniors.\n  This chart demonstrates what has been happening to drug costs. We are \nseeing double-digit increases in drug\n\n[[Page S2683]]\n\ncosts. From 1995, going up; in 1997, up 14 percent; and in 1998, up 15 \npercent; in 1999, up 16 percent. These increases were at a time when we \nhad an average of a 2-percent increase in the rate of inflation.\n  This issue affects Americans all across this country; it isn't an \nissue just in the Northeast. It is an issue in the Northeast, the \nSoutheast, the Midwest, the Northwest and the Southwest. It is a \nuniversal issue. Our senior citizens deserve better action by the \nBudget Committee in the conference. It is a tragedy. But we are \nstrongly committed on this side of the aisle not to give up on this \nissue. We are going to take every opportunity to fight for prescription \ndrugs. We believe our seniors are entitled to an effective drug \nprogram. We think a prescription drug program is absolutely essential. \nIt has to be one of our top priorities. It should have been done right \nby the Budget Committee.\n  The prescription drug benefit is more deserving than the tax breaks \nwhich are included in this resolution. That was the issue that was \nbefore the Budget Committee. That is the issue that is before the \nSenate of the United States this afternoon. That is the most important \nreason I will vote ``no.''\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence of Senator Boxer on \nthe floor. I have 45 minutes remaining and I will take a few minutes to \ndiscuss Senator Kennedy's remarks.\n  Mr. President, fellow Senators, nothing could be further from the \ntruth than this budget resolution and this budget conference does not \nprovide for Medicare prescription relief for senior citizens.\n  Let me state what I think the triggering mechanism would have \nultimately done. It would work in favor of those who don't want a \nbipartisan solution because they could have stonewalled this until the \ndate arrived and then produce a partisan solution to Medicare on the \nfloor of the Senate. But nobody should deny the work and the \nauthenticity of what is in this budget resolution as suggested in our \nBudget Committee by the distinguished Senator from Maine, Senator \nSnowe.\n  Senator Snowe recognizes seniors don't want a prescription drug added \nto a Medicare program that is going bankrupt. We provide in this budget \nresolution if there is some reform in this program, $40 billion in new \nmoney can be used for prescription drugs. I don't want to let my voice \ngrow any louder because I have on different occasions wondered whether \ntalking extremely loud helps with one's case or not. I have no \nillusions but that I am speaking to myself and I will speak very \nmoderately about this. The truth of the matter is, the Finance \nCommittee of the Senate is challenged by this budget resolution to \nproduce a bipartisan solution to the issue of prescription drugs. Some \nin this body do not want a bipartisan solution because it will have \nsome of the good points of experts on our side about how to fix this, \nincluding the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, a Republican, and many \nothers.\n  Let me repeat, this budget resolution says whatever you do on taxes \nor tax relief, such as the marriage tax penalty, there is in addition \nto that, $40 billion for Medicare. That is $40 billion that can be used \nfor prescription drugs. If the committee in charge of this wants to use \nit all for prescription drugs, they have to provide some reform to the \nsystem.\n\n  Frankly, there is a big split over whether that is what the bill \nought to do. But the Budget Committee opted, in this budget resolution, \nto try to be on the side of pursuing a bipartisan solution in the \ncommittee of jurisdiction, which has had 14 hearings, and is going to \ndo something. The House is going its way. Before the year is out, we \nwill have a bipartisan solution on this floor. That is precisely what \nwould be good for seniors. We will take the politics out of Medicare, \nand we will put money into prescription drugs. That is really what we \nwant to do in this budget resolution.\n  Some may call it irresponsibility. I call it the height of \nresponsibility. I believe to do otherwise is an invitation to election \nyear politicking about Medicare prescription drugs that is, in the end, \napt not to help with the Medicare program which everybody wants to try \nto fix and add prescription benefits.\n  I want to repeat, the reason we have tax relief in this budget, and \ntell the committee to produce it, is the very issue we debated 4 hours \nago on this floor called marriage tax penalty reform. It will cost, if \nwe do it right, somewhere between $50 and $65 billion. Where will we \nget that relief for the millions of married couples? We will get it in \nthis budget resolution and get $40 billion for Medicare, prescription \ndrugs, and reform.\n  If the seniors understand the two positions, they will say let's go \ntry this; let's have Senators on that committee of finance, Democrat \nand Republican, working on a solution that belongs to everybody. It \nwill probably be a right solution for the trust fund if it is a \nbipartisan solution.\n  So I repeat, there is money for prescription drugs and there is money \nfor tax relief, such as the marriage tax penalty reform that must be \nadopted.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time I have on the resolution.\n  Mr. REED. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from California from the \ntime I control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to say to Senator Reed, he is a \nvery powerful voice in favor of sensible gun laws. He is taking every \nopportunity he can. He has stated this many times, to bring this matter \nof the juvenile justice bill that contains all these important gun \ncontrol laws to the floor of the Senate. Today he said we should not \nadjourn until we take care of this. I think he is making a very \nimportant point. We have five important, sensible gun control measures \nin the juvenile justice bill. We voted for them here. On one of them, \nit was Al Gore, the Vice President, who broke that tie vote on closing \nthe gun show loophole on which Senator Lautenberg had worked so hard, \nto keep away from children, and to keep away from people who are \nmentally unstable, and keep away from criminals, access to weapons.\n  It is a very sad day indeed that we are going home, now, right on the \nheels of the tragic anniversary of Columbine--those killings occurred a \nyear ago--and we have done nothing.\n  I want to state for the Record, every time my friend Senator Reed \ncomes to the floor, I will be there with him as long as it takes. We \nare going to have a Million Mom March. I don't know whether a million \nmoms will come, but thousands will come to march in favor of these very \nresponsible gun laws. I intend to be there, and many of us will be \nthere with them. We will not stop the pressure.\n  Mr. President, every budget is a roadmap. This budget takes us down \nthe wrong road at almost every turn. I agreed with one thing that \nhappened in the conference, and I want to say thank you to the House. I \nam very careful not to say thank you to my chairman, who told me not to \nthank him for this because he is on the other side. The language \ncalling for drilling in the Arctic wildlife refuge was removed. I am \nvery pleased about that. I thank the House for doing that. I hope we do \nnot have to face that fight this year, next year, or the year after.\n  But in terms of everything else that happened, this budget got \ndecidedly worse. It is leading us down the wrong road, a road that does \nnot adequately fund education or prescription drug benefits, a road \nthat doesn't reduce the debt enough, a road that leads to risky tax \ncuts that can derail our economic recovery and therefore endanger \nMedicare and even Social Security.\n  This is a road that lacks fiscal responsibility. It has no room in it \nfor a lands legacy bill that people on both sides of the aisle want to \nsee, where we can take offshore oil revenues and put them into good use \nby expanding our public ownership of precious lands we are losing and \npreserve historic areas. I think this budget puts America in a risky, \ndangerous position and it does not meet the needs of our people.\n  We know what will happen if this budget goes into effect, as it will, \nand the appropriators carry it out. We will see cuts to the most \nvulnerable population--cuts in the Women, Infants and Children feeding \nprogram, cuts in Head Start, in the Job Corps, in child care, in \nchildren's mental health. Those cuts will be perhaps more than 10 \npercent.\n  We could not get more funding for afterschool programs even though we\n\n[[Page S2684]]\n\nhad some bipartisan support. The police chiefs all across this land \nknow that is the best crimefighting program. We could not get that. We \nknow juvenile crime peaks between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. What does this \nbudget say? We are holding the line on afterschool programs, and the \nmillion kids waiting to get in will simply have to wait. One million \nkids are waiting to get into afterschool programs. That is how popular \nthey are. Ninety percent of the American people want them. The police \nwant them. The President put it in his budget, and they have cut his \nrequest in half, leaving 1 million people out of the loop.\n  I do not understand how we can say we speak for the people when we \nwalk away from a program that has 90 percent approval and one we know \nworks.\n  Senator Kennedy has talked about the flimsy prescription drug \nbenefit. It is not going to help our seniors if we make them think we \nare doing something for them but we do not back it up with funding. \nSenator Conrad, who will speak after I finish my remarks, has talked \nlong and hard about a lockbox for Medicare. That was voted down. That \nis gone.\n  We agreed to lock up Social Security but not Medicare. It does not do \nus any good if our people get their full Social Security benefit and \nthey have to turn around and pay more and more for Medicare. They are \ngoing to be poor one way or the other. If my colleagues support Social \nSecurity, they have to support Medicare. This budget simply does not do \nit.\n  My colleagues should see the letters that come from the people in my \nState who are forced to cut their medicine in half in order to make \nends meet. They are choosing between prescription drugs and eating \ndinner. This is America. This is wrong.\n  Why does this budget turn out this way? Because of a risky tax cut.\n  Maybe some say it is good to have a tax cut; maybe they look at the \ntax cut as helping people who really need it. One roadmap we have is \nGeorge W. Bush's tax cut. Let's look at that one. What happens if one \nearns over $300,000? They get back $50,000 a year. They will be popping \nthose champagne corks in the boardrooms. But if one earns $38,000 a \nyear, they will get back about $260 or $280 a year.\n  Summing up, this budget takes us down the wrong path any way one \nlooks, whether it is looking at tax cuts that are fair and targeted, \nsensible and fiscally responsible, or it is a prescription drug benefit \nthat makes sense for our seniors, protecting Medicare that makes sense \nfor our seniors, or investing in education which makes sense for our \nchildren, or having a reserve fund for our environment.\n  By the way, on energy efficiency, they slash and burn the President's \nproposal, and then they say he has no energy policy. This budget takes \nus down a bad road. It should be rejected, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I regret that I am unable to support the \nbudget resolution that is before us today. Our annual budget resolution \nsupposedly represents our nation's fiscal blueprint, but this document \ncomes up short in terms of what our priorities ought to be. Instead of \nlarge, untargeted and unwarranted tax cuts, we ought to be dedicating \nour resources towards rebuilding our nation's schools, providing \nSeniors with affordable medication, strengthening Social Security and \nbuilding up our national defense--in addition to paying down the \nnational debt, so that the federal government can stay out of the \ncapital market and be better equipped to handle dips in the economy in \nthe future. In all of these categories the budget resolution falls \nwoefully short. Through fiscal discipline the past seven years, we \nfinally have the ability to begin to address our real needs. We cannot \nallow this golden opportunity to slip through our fingers. We owe it to \nour children and our parents to do a better job.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the conference \ncommittee dropped an amendment I offered with Senator Kohl that would \nhave applied additional surpluses estimated by CBO to debt reduction \nrather than tax cuts. I had hoped that this fiscally responsible \namendment, which was unanimously adopted by the Senate, would be \nincluded in the final version of the budget resolution. Instead, the \nCommittee accepted a House provision that would allow the budget \nchairman to use additional surpluses for tax cuts above and beyond the \n$150 billion in cuts already in the resolution. I find it disheartening \nthat Congress is not even willing to commit unexpected surpluses to \ndebt reduction.\n  In the 1980s, Congress went on a tax cut binge and left the bill for \nour children. During those years we all saw the lip service paid and \nthe sloganeering about balancing the budget, while we simultaneously \ntripled the national debt and ran the biggest deficits of any nation in \nthe history of the world. As a result, the national debt now stands at \n$3.6 trillion and the Federal government pays almost $1 billion in \ninterest every working day on this debt. Now that we have surpluses, we \nhave a chance and an obligation to pay off that debt. This budget \nresolution fails to live up to that responsibility.\n  Nothing would do more to keep our economy strong than paying down our \nnational debt. Paying down our national debt will keep interest rates \nlow. Consumers gain ground with lower mortgage costs, car payments, \ncredit card charges with low interest rates. And small business owners \ncan invest, expand and create jobs with low interest rates.\n  Alan Greenspan and nearly every other economist who has testified \nbefore the Senate Budget and Finance Committees has stated that our \nnation's budget surpluses should be used to pay down the debt. And yet, \nthe Republican budget resolution proposes far less debt reduction than \nthe budgets developed by President Clinton and Senate Democrats. This \nresolution would use 98% of the non-Social Security surplus for tax \nbreaks which would primarily benefit the wealthy. By dropping our \namendment, Congress is in danger of using an even higher percentage of \nthe surplus for tax cuts, and even less for debt reduction. This does \nnot make fiscal sense.\n  During markup, Senator Lautenberg offered an alternative budget that \nwould have reduced $330 billion in debt over ten years, while providing \nalmost $300 billion in targeted tax cuts--cuts that would go towards \neliminating the marriage tax penalty, permitting the self-employed a \nfull tax deduction for their health insurance and providing estate tax \nrelief for family farmers and small business owners. Such cuts would be \nfair and targeted to help all Vermonters, not just the wealthy. \nUnfortunately, this amendment failed.\n  In 1993, Congress charted a course of fiscal discipline and the \ncountry has reaped the benefits of this successful plan. Republicans \nand Democrats can rightfully claim their shares of the credit for \ngetting the nation's fiscal house in order. The important thing now is \nto keep our budget in balance, to pay down our debt, and to keep our \neconomy growing. Unfortunately, this budget resolution fails to make a \nreal commitment to debt reduction, which is why I must vote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for time off our side off the \nresolution and ask to be notified when I have consumed 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is one of the most important \ndecisions we make every year: the question of the budget outline for \nthe United States; what are our priorities; where is the money going to \nbe spent; what are the revenue sources for the United States. The \nfundamental question is, Are we going to maintain fiscal discipline? \nAre we going to maintain a strategy that has produced the longest \neconomic expansion in our country's history?\n  This article appeared in the Washington Post in the business section \nannouncing that the expansion was, at that time, the Nation's longest. \nThis is back in February. Of course, the expansion has now been \nextended even further. But even then, we had created the longest \neconomic expansion in our country's history. I say when ``we'' created; \nI am talking about all of us as Americans.\n  Part of it is a result of Federal policy: the fiscal policy of the \ncountry, which is controlled by the Congress and the President of the \nUnited States, and the monetary policy, which is controlled by the \nFederal Reserve. The two work hand in glove to produce economic results \nfor this country.\n\n[[Page S2685]]\n\n  Obviously, the underlying strength of America is the people of this \ncountry. Their hard work, their innovation, their creativity, their \nentrepreneurial spirit and drive makes this country the greatest \neconomic power on the face of the globe.\n  It is important to remember the economic strategy and the economic \nplan that brought us to where we are today. If we look back at the last \nthree administrations and look at the question of the budget deficits \nthat are so important to the fiscal policy of this country and the \nmonetary policy, this is what one finds: The Reagan administration \ninherited a deficit of about $80 billion and promptly ran it up to over \n$200 billion and dramatically expanded the Nation's debt over the \nperiod of that administration. In fact, they more than tripled the \nnational debt during this period.\n  Then we had the Bush administration, which inherited a deficit of \n$153 billion and promptly ran it up to a $290 billion deficit. It \nactually was somewhat worse than that because this is counting the \nSocial Security surplus. The true deficit, at least as I define it, was \nwell over $300 billion.\n  The Clinton administration came in, and in 1993, we passed a 5-year \nbudget plan that was designed to reduce the deficit dramatically to \ntake pressure off interest rates and to get this economy moving again. \nThat plan passed without a single Republican vote in either the House \nor the Senate. These are the facts.\n  That 5-year plan was put into place, and here are the results. They \nare clear; they are unambiguous. They show that each and every year \nthat 5-year plan reduced the budget deficit, first, to $255 billion; \nthen to $203 billion; then to $164 billion; then to $107 billion; then \nto $22 billion. By the end of the 5-year plan, we had done what was \nperhaps thought impossible when we started. We had balanced the Federal \nbudget.\n  Now we anticipate a $176 billion budget surplus in this year. This is \na plan that worked.\n  This shows the trend in receipts and outlays, the expenditures of the \nFederal Government that made this plan work. The blue line shows the \nspending of the Federal Government; the red line shows the receipts of \nthe Federal Government. This is over a 20-year period.\n  What it shows is obviously our spending was higher than receipts for \nan extended period in the eighties. That is why we were running massive \nbudget deficits. When Democrats voted for a 5-year plan to get our \nfiscal house in order, spending came down each and every year in \nrelationship to the size of our economy, revenue went up each and every \nyear because, in part, we raised taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent in \nthis country, and spending was cut. That is what allowed us to balance \nthe budget, get our fiscal house in order, and kick off the longest \neconomic expansion in our history. That is the record. Those are the \nfacts.\n\n  The question is, Are we going to put all this at risk and go back to \nthe old, bad days of ``debt'' and ``deficits'' and ``decline,'' what I \ncall the three Ds? I very much hope we do not return to those policies \nand those plans and that set of results: debt, deficits, and decline. \nThat would be a profound mistake. Why would we ever turn our back on an \neconomic strategy that has worked so well?\n  Let's look at the results.\n  Federal spending is now at its lowest level since 1966. We cut \nspending with that 5-year plan in 1993. Democrats cut spending because \nwe did not have any help from the other side of the aisle--none. We cut \nspending because it was necessary to get our fiscal house in order.\n  The results of reducing those deficits has been the virtuous cycle: \nReduced deficits, reduced debt, and reduced interest rates that helps \nspur investment in the private sector, that helps spur private growth \nin the private sector, that led to the creation of over 20 million \njobs, that gave us the lowest level of inflation since 1965. The \nvirtuous cycle does not end there because it also gave us the lowest \nrate of unemployment in 42 years.\n  These are the results of an economic plan that was put in place in \n1993. It has also brought down the debt. What a remarkable \ncircumstance. But we have actually started bringing down the publicly \nheld debt. We are in a position to nearly pay it off by the year 2010. \nWe are in a position to pay off the publicly held debt of this country \nby the year 2013, if we stay on course.\n  Alan Greenspan, who is in charge of monetary policy--the Congress and \nthe President are in charge of fiscal policy; the Federal Reserve is in \ncharge of monetary policy--the head of monetary policy for our country \nsays: Pay down the debt first. That is what he is urging us to do.\n  He is not alone because virtually every economist of whatever \nideological persuasion who has come before the Budget Committee and the \nFinance Committee, on which I sit, has told us: The highest priority \nought to be to continue to pay down the debt, to put us in a position \nto deal with the baby-boom generation when it starts to retire and puts \nenormous demands on Medicare, on Social Security, on veterans programs; \nthat the best way to prepare for the day when they retire is to build \nthis economy, to grow this economy. And the best way to grow this \neconomy is to lift the debt burden that is on this economy.\n  That is what will hold down interest rates. That is what will keep \nthe Government out of competition in private markets for scarce \nresources. That will allow additional resources to go into private \ninvestment.\n  This plan, this strategy, has been working. Now, all of a sudden, our \nfriends on the Republican side, who opposed putting in place that \nstrategy that has worked so well, tell us: Ah, well, we were wrong \nthen, but trust us, let's go back to that failed strategy we were \npursuing before, and let's try it again.\n  Why would we do that? It makes no earthly sense.\n  What will happen if we take this risky approach they are proposing? I \nsubmit to you, in their plan they use all of the non-Social Security \nsurplus--all of it--for a tax cut, a tax cut that goes to the \nwealthiest among us. Senator McCain said it well during the campaign. \nHe questioned the Bush plan to take 60 percent of the benefits of their \ntax plan and to give it to the wealthiest 10 percent.\n\n  Mr. Bush has said, over and over, in his campaign: What they don't \nknow in Washington is, this is the people's money. He is right about \nthat. It is the people's money. The question is, What should be done \nwith the people's money? Should it be given to the wealthiest 10 \npercent--disproportionately given to the wealthiest 10 percent--or \nshould our top priority be to use the people's money to pay down the \npeople's debt? I submit to you, the highest priority ought to be to pay \ndown the people's debt. But that is not the Republican priority.\n  It is true they take all of the Social Security surplus and reserve \nit for Social Security. We do the same thing in our budget. That is the \nright thing to do. I applaud them for it. But on the non-Social \nSecurity surplus, they have quite a different approach.\n  I think, objectively stated, the non-Social Security surplus is most \nlikely to be about $170 billion over the next 5 years. The Republican \nplan has a $150 billion tax cut, a $25 billion reserve for tax cuts, \nand costs another $21 billion in interest. So they have $196 billion \nreserved for a tax cut that goes primarily to the wealthiest among us \nwhen we have only $171 billion available in a non-Social Security \nsurplus.\n  Where is the rest of the money going to come from? I think it is \ngoing to come right out of the Social Security trust fund. We are going \nto go back to the old, bad days of raiding the Social Security trust \nfund surplus. I hope not. I do not know how else it happens.\n  Our priority on the Democratic side is to use the vast majority of \nthe projected surpluses over the next 10 years for debt reduction. In \nfact, we use 82 percent of the projected surpluses for debt reduction. \nThat is, every penny of the Social Security surplus for Social \nSecurity, since it is not used for that purpose immediately, goes to \npay down the debt. The Republicans do the same thing. But, in addition, \nwe take 36 percent of the non-Social Security surplus and use that for \nfurther paying down the debt.\n  We also have a chunk of money for tax relief--not nearly as much as \nthey do; we will stipulate to that. Their priority is a big tax cut to \nthe wealthiest among us. Our priority is to pay down the debt.\n\n[[Page S2686]]\n\n  As I indicated, we take all of the Social Security surplus and use \nthat to pay down debt. But, in addition, we take, of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus, 36 percent of it for debt reduction. We take 29 \npercent of it for tax cuts because we, too, believe tax relief is \nimportant.\n  We would like to solve the marriage tax penalty. We would like to \nease the estate tax burden. We would like to deal with some of the \nother inequities in the Tax Code.\n  We also reserve 23 percent for high-priority domestic needs such as \ndefense, education, agriculture, and, yes, a prescription drug benefit.\n  We believe these are the priorities of the American people.\n  Let me conclude by saying there are some on the Republican side who \nhave argued over and over that the tax burden on the American people is \nthe highest it has ever been.\n  The tax revenues are high, but the tax burden, the tax rates, on \nindividual taxpayers are not high. That is odd. How can the revenues be \nhigh but the tax rates on individuals not be high? The reason is, we \nhave a booming economy that produces lots of revenue. That is part of \nthe virtuous cycle we have created by getting our fiscal house in \norder.\n  But if we look at the individual tax burden, what we find is, \ncontrary to what our friends on the Republican side say so often and so \nrepeatedly, the Federal tax level has fallen for most people in this \ncountry.\n  Let me quote from the Washington Post of March 26 of this year:\n\n       Studies Show Burden Now Less Than 10%\n       For all but the wealthiest Americans, the federal income \n     tax burden has shrunk to the lowest level in four decades, \n     according to a series of studies by liberal and conservative \n     tax experts. . . .\n\n  What we see is that the tax burden on individual Americans has been \nreduced, and reduced dramatically.\n  The article further states:\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office estimates the middle fifth \n     of American families, with an average income of $39,100, paid \n     5.4 percent in income tax in 1999, compared with 8.3 percent \n     in 1981. The Treasury Department estimates a four-person \n     family, with a median income of $54,900, paid 7.46 percent of \n     that in income tax, the lowest since 1965.\n  The article continues: The Conservative Tax Foundation figures that \nthe median two-earner family, making $68,000, paid 8.8 percent in 1998, \nabout the same as 1955.\n  This is a question of priorities. We ought to reject this budget and \npass the alternative.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington,\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. First, I thank the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nLautenberg, for his tremendous leadership on the Democratic side of the \nBudget Committee. I have truly enjoyed working with him and will miss \nhim a great deal in the coming years. His leadership has been so \nimportant to all of us.\n  I come to the floor today to address the Republican budget proposal \nand to tell my colleagues that I will be a ``no'' vote because I \nbelieve it fails to reflect the priorities of families across this \ncountry. In fact, if this budget were submitted to any math class, it \nwould get an F because, frankly, the numbers do not add up.\n  The reality in this budget does not meet the rhetoric. Despite all \nthe claims, when we do the math, the things Americans care about--\nimproving their education, reducing the debt, saving Social Security, \nstrengthening and modernizing Medicare--have all been left behind. The \nthings that matter to families have been sacrificed in the name of an \nirresponsible tax cut.\n  I am disappointed that this budget abandons the progress we have made \nsince 1993. Since I first joined the Budget Committee, our Nation's \nfinancial strength has grown dramatically. Through the hard work of the \nPresident, the Vice President, and Congress, we have turned deficits \ninto surpluses. We learned many important lessons. We learned that \nbudgets must be realistic. They have to take into account what our \nNation needs and what we are capable of providing.\n  This budget is neither realistic nor responsible. It does not provide \nthe necessary investments in education and health care. It does not \nensure that prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries will \nbe considered before we enact tax cuts. Instead, this Republican budget \nsacrifices our priorities for a $200 billion tax cut.\n  I am extremely concerned that this tax cut could eat up all of the \non-budget surplus. Given this Congress' track record on tax cuts, it is \nfair to assume that, as usual, the top 10 percent of the people will \nget more than 60 percent of the benefits. The President and the \nAmerican people rejected that tax plan last year, and I expect they \nwill reject it again. We can have responsible and fair tax cuts that \nare fiscally prudent, but you won't find them in this budget.\n  I am also disappointed that this conference report dropped two \nimportant priorities during the conference committee. First, an \nimportant amendment I introduced to ensure programs that help victims \nof domestic violence was dropped. Another amendment concerning pipeline \nsafety was also left behind. In the Senate Budget Committee, I \nintroduced an amendment to ensure that pipeline safety efforts are \nfunded at levels that were called for in my bill. My amendment was \nunanimously passed by the Senate Budget Committee. Unfortunately, this \nbudget makes it almost impossible to fully fund the Office of Pipeline \nSafety. Our budget should help us make our pipeline safer. I fear this \nbudget moves away from our responsibility.\n  I will be talking later this evening about the issue of pipeline \nsafety as well.\n  While those two key amendments were dropped, I am pleased that my \namendment concerning women and Social Security was affirmed. After 2 \nyears, the Republican budget conferees have finally committed that \nSocial Security reform should not penalize women. I am pleased it is in \nthis budget.\n\n  Overall, to make room for their tax cut, Republicans shortchanged the \ninvestments that really matter to the American people. In fact, in key \nareas, this budget doesn't even keep up with inflation.\n  I will give a few examples of how this budget leaves America's \npriorities behind. The decisions in this budget will be felt in \nclassrooms across America. The budget before us would decimate the \nprogress we have made over the last 2 years in reducing overcrowded \nclassrooms. In the last 2 years, we have hired 29,000 new, fully \nqualified teachers to reduce class sizes in first, second, and third \ngrades. Today, because of that action, 1.7 million students are \nlearning in classrooms where the basics are taught in a disciplined \nenvironment. We should be building on our progress. This Republican \nbudget before us today abandons our progress. This budget tells \nstudents: Sorry, you are going to have to sit in an overcrowded \nclassroom next year because, under the Republican tax plan, you are not \na priority.\n  It should be a priority that we pay down our national debt instead of \npassing that burden along to our children. This budget tells every \nyoung American: Sorry, you better start saving money now to pay off the \nnational debt because, under the Republican tax plan, you are not a \npriority.\n  It is a priority that we strengthen and modernize Medicare. It is a \npriority that seniors get help buying the medicine they need because no \none should have to choose between buying medicine and paying for food. \nThis budget tells seniors: Sorry, you can't get the prescription drug \ncoverage you need because, under the Republican tax plan, you are not a \npriority.\n  The American people want real budgets, not gimmicks. They want to \nknow that our Nation's vital priorities are being treated as \npriorities. They don't want the things that matter in their lives to be \nsqueezed out by unbalanced tax cuts that only benefit a few people.\n  We should be using the surplus we have today to honor our commitments \nto our children and to our seniors. Now is the time to address the \nlong-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare and to provide \nresources to local communities to make our classrooms ready for the \n21st century. Those are the things a responsible budget would do. We \nshould pass a budget that reflects the priorities of the American \npeople and one that is realistic. I believe the budget before us fails \nthe American people on both counts. Therefore, I must oppose it.\n\n[[Page S2687]]\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the remainder of my time to the \nDemocratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Chair inform me how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 40 minutes; \nthe Senator from Rhode Island has 26 minutes; the Senator from New \nJersey has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't intend to use the entire time I \nhave. I would like to make sure I understand where they are going on \nthe other side. If we are going to make an effort to vote earlier, I \nwill be yielding back some of my time. I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  First, let me identify the occupant of the chair. The occupant of the \nchair is one of our new Senators, Mr. Smith, from way over on the West \nCoast. I am very proud to have him in the Senate, but I am more proud \nthat he is on the Budget Committee. There are people talking about what \nhappens in this budget resolution, such as the distinguished Senator, \nMrs. Murray, talking about a sense-of-the-Senate resolution as if it \nwere binding on somebody. It is nothing more than what it says. It \ndoesn't affect anything. To the extent we dropped some of her \nprovisions, there were scores of sense-of-the-Senate resolutions in \nthis budget that we did not take.\n  What we did keep was something for which the distinguished occupant \nof the chair fought hard. I am told there are so many people watching \nC-SPAN. Sometimes I wonder how many times they want to hear the same \nspeech, but I believe, when it is given again on that side, I have to \nsay a few words.\n  I repeat: Because of the distinguished Senator who occupies the \nchair, working in concert with the distinguished Senator from Maine, \nMs. Snowe, helped by Senator Wyden from the same State as the occupant \nof the chair, we have a real provision we did not drop that has to do \nwith Medicare prescription drugs and Medicare reform. I was so pleased \nto hear a freshman Senator, the occupant of the chair, say he wanted to \nsupport the Snowe amendment for $40 billion and that we might as well \nface up and get a bill. It says we can use the whole $40 billion for \nprescription drugs, and it is not crowded out by tax relief. It is \nseparate and distinct; it is available.\n  We have said if you do some reform to preserve the well-being of the \nMedicare system, you can have $40 billion in new money for prescription \ndrugs. Now, if you choose to only do prescription drugs and do nothing \nto Medicare, it gets $20 billion to go ahead and add some prescription \ndrugs. Frankly, I believe the Senator occupying the chair, Senator \nSmith of Oregon, was on the side of a very large majority of Senators. \nI think so long as we keep it bipartisan there is going to be an effort \nto repair the Medicare system for the senior citizens, which is going \nbroke, and we can say we reformed it and modernized it and at the same \ntime we have added $40 billion for prescription drugs.\n  No matter how many times the other side repeats it--and I don't know \nthat I am going to answer it again today--I will tell you what I know \nis in the budget resolution. If I had to read the words, you would see \nI am paraphrasing the words quite accurately. With reference to \neducation, we can continue to hear specifics, that we didn't provide \nclassroom teachers. Let me repeat, the only time we are going to find \nout what we really do for education is when the Appropriations \nCommittee, headed by Senator Specter, produces an appropriations bill, \nbecause anything we say in this budget resolution about specifics on \neducation are only assumptions.\n  Many times, if not most of the time, the Appropriations Committee \ndecides what they are going to spend on education, which programs they \nare going to fund, and whether it is going to be less children per \nclassroom or more. That is not going to be decided by this resolution. \nWhat is going to be, or could be, decided is how much is available for \neducation--not specifics but education.\n  I say that this conference report assumes $45.6 billion in the year \n2001 for the Department of Education--a $10 billion increase, or 30-\npercent increase, over last year's level. Over the next 5 years, most \ninterestingly, assumptions on education are $21.9 billion in new money, \nadditional money, which is essentially what the President asked for.\n  Now, whatever they want to say in the next hour in repetition, I \ndon't know that I will answer it again. I am trying my very best to say \nthat these specific things Senators bring to the Senator floor and say \nthere is a sense of the Senate on it and that would have gotten it \ndone, I want to be kind; I don't want to say what I might say. But the \nfact that it is in, or not, doesn't mean very much. It is what the \nAppropriations Committee does with the money. Then there is going to be \na bipartisan debate, for which I am grateful, on whether we should have \nthe status quo on education programs or whether we should have reform.\n  Essentially, for anybody interested in what is going to determine \nwhere we spend the money and how we spend it, it may be that we are \ngoing to leave all these categorical programs--money for more teachers \nand less students per classroom and all the other specifics that some \npeople think are important--it may be that we will let the schools keep \ndoing that. We are probably going to give them an option not to do \nthat; in a way, that is more accommodating to them, with flexibility \nand accountability.\n  That is essentially what we set up. We don't preclude that debate and \nits conclusions, which I understand from the majority leader will occur \nbefore this year is out. It is historical because it is coming out of \ncommittee of jurisdiction. It is not going to be done on the floor. It \nis headed by Senator Jeffords. Nobody thought there would be major \nreform. There is major reform, and it comes out to the floor to be \ndebated.\n\n  I don't know that I can do more on the issue of debt reduction other \nthan to tell the Senate that this budget resolution has over $1 \ntrillion in debt service over the next 5 years. It is most interesting \nthat, all of a sudden, there is a difference between reducing the debt \nheld by the public through Social Security surpluses and reducing it \nwith other surpluses. Let me say, dollar for dollar, it is the same \ndebt reduction, or reduction held by the public. It doesn't matter \nwhether it comes out of the Social Security surplus that we don't spend \nor whether it comes out of the surplus that is on budget. We have a \ndifferent way of accounting for them.\n  We think there is a lot of money available during the next 5 years. \nIn fact, we think over a freeze there is $400 billion in non-Social \nSecurity surplus. There is already a basic budget. Looking at this \nchart, we think it is $400 billion. Interestingly enough, that is over \nfreezing everything. The Democrats assume what they call a freeze in \nreal spending, that would bring the spending way up to here because \nthey add inflation every year and call it automatic. It is not spending \nnew money. We said let's start over. So we put $212 billion in domestic \nprograms--domestic and defense. We put $150 billion in tax relief, \nwhich we ask today, how many more times do we have to hear that our tax \nproposals are for the rich? The biggest tax proposal is the marriage \ntax penalty. Is that what they are saying is a typical Republican \neffort to help the rich? I hope all the married people in America \nlisten to that argument.\n  In addition, we take that surplus and we put $40 billion of it in \nthis non-Social Security on the debt. I don't believe the argument is \nabout debt reduction. It may be today, but the argument is: Let's spend \nthat tax relief money. Let's spend this. That is what the argument is \nabout. I repeat, if we don't get tax relief, all this money, $150 \nbillion, goes to debt reduction for the debt held by the public, adding \nto the $1 trillion I have just told you about that is in this.\n  I will conclude by thanking the Budget Committee. The Republican \nmajority produced this format. Obviously, from the newest Senator, to \nme as the most senior Senator on our side, we followed the lead of \nOlympia Snowe on Medicare and the leadership of my friend who is \noccupying the Chair, in getting a real Medicare proposal and that will \ndrive a bipartisan solution. Let me repeat, in an election year, praise \nthe Lord, if we can get a bipartisan solution to Medicare because it \nwill be the right one if it turns out to be a partisan solution. I am \nafraid it\n\n[[Page S2688]]\n\nwill be a political solution, and I am not sure the Medicare trust fund \nfor our seniors is going to come out very well. So that is why I think \nthis is a good approach.\n  My last observation is that the Appropriations Committee has to take \nall this money and decide what to do with it. Senator Ted Stevens is \nthe chairman and that is his principal responsibility. I assure those \nwho voted for this and who will vote for it today, it depends on how \nyou allocate the money among priorities. But if they happen to be \npriorities we have been expressing today and that we expressed in this \nresolution, there will be plenty of funding for education, plenty of \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health, plenty of funding \nfor Medicare--and that is not an appropriated account--and we will have \nplenty of money to prepare our defense for this new 100 years we are \nentering where we need to make up some lost ground.\n\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have a lot to say and not much time in \nwhich to say it. The fundamental point is that this budget resolution \nrepresents a statement of the values of the Members of Congress, \nrepresenting the 270 million citizens of the United States of America. \nWhat this budget resolution says is that we are giving a priority to \ntax cuts over meeting the moral, ethical, and legal obligations of the \nU.S. Government to its citizens by failing to make a commitment to \nstrengthen Social Security and to strengthen the Medicare program. That \nis the fundamental message of this budget resolution.\n  This budget resolution requires the Senate Finance Committee to \nreport two bills with tax cuts totalling $150 billion in the next 5 \nyears. The Finance Committee can report separate legislation cutting \ntaxes by an additional $25 billion over 5 years.\n  The Finance Committee can report even greater tax cuts if in July the \nCongressional Budget Office projects higher on-budget surpluses.\n  There is no similar set of mandates or permission as it relates to \nstrengthening Social Security and strengthening and expanding Medicare. \nWe must do these things. And we can do these things relative to tax \ncuts. There is no similar provision relative to our obligation to \nSocial Security and Medicare.\n  We already have embarked on a serious and, I say, unfocused tax-\ncutting process. If you add up what we have already done in the \neducational savings account, the Patients' Bill of Rights, the minimum \nwage, small business tax cut, and what was proposed this week in terms \nof marriage penalty tax cuts, and suspension of the gas tax, with that \nhole in our transportation funding being filled by the non-Social \nSecurity surplus, we have already spent approximately two-thirds of the \nnon-Social Security surplus we anticipate for this next fiscal year and \napproximately two-thirds of what we anticipate for the next 5 years \nwith those actions alone.\n  I suggest that is not a prudent way to go about using the non-Social \nSecurity surplus--that we ought to do first things first. The first \nthing we should do is to meet the obligation this Government has to its \ncitizens in the areas of Social Security and Medicare. Why are those \ntwo such priorities? They are priorities because the citizens of the \nUnited States every payday are paying into those trust funds for Social \nSecurity and for Medicare. They have a legal, contractual obligation \nfrom the Government to meet those benefits which they anticipate. We \nneed to have a similar commitment to assure that those programs are \ngoing to be capable of meeting those obligations.\n  We also have not been faithful in this budget resolution to some \ncommitments both Houses have made in terms of a prescription medication \nbenefit.\n  Both the Senate- and the House-passed resolutions infer--and the \nleadership of both Houses publicly stated--that we would be reserving \n$40 billion over the next 5 years for purposes of a prescription \nmedication benefit.\n  We received from the conference committee a commitment to spend $20 \nbillion for additional access to prescription medication--not a \nspecific modification of the Medicare program that would incorporate \nprescription medication as a benefit of Medicare. The other $20 billion \nwould be available only if there were changes in the structure of the \nMedicare program which would be scored by the Congressional Budget \nOffice as increasing the solvency of the Medicare program.\n  This is not the prescription medication benefit the American people \nexpected. This is not the benefit we anticipated when we passed the \nbudget resolution in the Senate. It is not a prescription medication \nbenefit that will respond to the realities of modern medicine.\n  One of the reasons many of us believe it is so important to have a \nprescription medication benefit is to change the fundamental culture of \nthe Medicare system. Medicare was adopted in 1965 as an acute-care \nprogram. If you were sick enough to go in the hospital, or if you were \nrun over by a truck, Medicare would provide financing for your health \ncare.\n  What we need to be thinking about as we start the 21st century is the \napproach to health care most Americans want. That is an approach that \nemphasizes prevention and wellness and the maintenance of quality of \nlife. Almost every step required to do that, whether it is to moderate \ndiabetes, to reduce the prospect of stroke and heart disease, to deal \nwith hormonal imbalances, all of those things that are fundamental to \nthe quality of life, particularly of older Americans, requires \nprescription medication as a key to this accomplishment.\n\n  Providing this prescription medication benefit is not just adding \nanother benefit to Medicare, as has been asserted; rather, it is \nchanging the fundamental orientation of Medicare to one that will focus \non the wellness of the American people, and not just wait until they \nget sick enough to go in the hospital.\n  That is the fundamental issue that is at risk with this budget \nresolution which puts at the top of the pyramid of American values \nproviding unspecified tax cuts and puts at the bottom of American \nvalues meeting our contract with the Americans who have built this \ngreat Nation through strength in Social Security and Medicare.\n  I urge the rejection of this budget resolution. Hopefully, we will \nhave an opportunity to adopt one that is more in keeping with the \ndesires of the American people.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  We have an economy that is booming. We have record low levels of \nunemployment. We have Government coffers that are overflowing. We have \na predicted $3 trillion surplus over the next 10 years.\n  We are still being told by this budget resolution that we can't \nafford in our country to provide a good education for every child; we \ncan't afford good health care for citizens; we can't afford to do \nsomething about the poverty of 14 million children in our country.\n  In the words of Rabbi Hill, ``If not now, when?'' This Republican \nbudget resolution provides a very discouraging answer to Rabbi Hill's \nquestion. This budget resolution says to Rabbi Hill, ``Not now and \nprobably not ever.''\n  The tradeoff is simple. You have huge tax cuts disproportionately \nflowing to wealthier, high-income citizens. You have in a post-world-\nwar era a bloated military budget. But you have a budget resolution \nthat does not invest in the health, the skill, the intellect, and the \ncharacter of our children, and you have a budget resolution that in \nnondefense discretionary spending calls for cuts with a booming \neconomy.\n  We will see cuts in Head Start, new teachers, reducing class size, \nhome-delivered meals to seniors, and environmental cleanup.\n  We will not do well in this new century, and we will not have the \nsuccessful economy or the successful moral nation Senator Graham talks \nabout, if we don't provide a good education for every child. We will \nnot do as well as we can do as a nation in this new century if we don't \ninvest in the skills development of our children. We will not\n\n[[Page S2689]]\n\ndo as well as we could and must do as a nation and national community \nif we don't invest in the health of our children. We, the United States \nof America, the good country, will not be better unless we make this \ninvestment in our children. By that standard, this budget is sorely \nlacking. I will vote against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, 7 years ago we ended a failed economic \npolicy of trickle down economics. It brought ballooning deficits, a \nquadrupling of the national debt, high interest rates, and low growth. \nBut we made some tough decisions and tough votes. We changed the course \nof the new economic policies that invested in people and imposed needed \nfiscal discipline.\n  The results are in: 21 million new jobs, 4 percent unemployment rate, \nthe lowest in 30 years, the fastest growth rate in 30 years, and the \nlowest crime and welfare rate in 30 years. There is the highest home \nownership ever, 108 months of straight economic growth, productivity-\nbreaking records, and inflation outside of energy is tame. Why do we \nwant to change this? Why return to the days of risky tax schemes, the \ndays of trickle down economics, and fiscal irresponsibility?\n  That is exactly what the conference report budget before the Senate \ndoes. This budget resolution before the Senate provides $175 billion to \ntax cuts, skewed to the wealthiest of Americans. The Congressional \nBudget Office, however, projects $171 billion in non-Social Security \nsurpluses over the next 5 years. Add the higher interest we have to pay \non the public debt because we did tax cuts instead of paying down the \ndebt, and what does that add up to? This budget conference report \nbefore the Senate means we will have to tap into the Social Security \nsurplus in order to pay for these tax cuts.\n  It is fiscally irresponsible. We ought to take a different course and \nfollow the adage that when times are good, prepare for the future. That \nmeans the budget should put the highest priority on paying off the \ndebt, securing Social Security and Medicare for the future.\n  I have said time and time again on this floor, if you want to save \nMedicare and cut down on Medicare expenses today, invest in medical \nresearch. To that end, 3 years ago, the Senate, in a unanimous vote, \nwent on record as saying we ought to double NIH basic medical research \nin 5 years. Last year, we had a historic increase of $2.3 billion to \nkeep on the track of doubling NIH research in 5 years. This next year \nwould require $2.7 billion. Keep in mind the Senate voted unanimously \nto double NIH funding.\n  When the budget came out of committee, it was short by $1.6 billion \nfor NIH research. Senator Specter, chairman of the appropriations \nsubcommittee on health and human services that funds NIH, offered an \namendment that I supported to add back the $1.6 billion to medical \nresearch. Nine Republicans joined the Democrats, and it passed 54-46.\n  As anyone who has even opened the newspapers lately knows, we are on \nthe verge of many breakthroughs in biomedical research, stem cell \nresearch, and the human genome, which is being mapped and will be done \nshortly. Now we need to push ahead to invest in medical research, to \nfind the causes, the cures, and the preventions for many of the \nillnesses that cost Medicare so much today. Yet this conference report \nignores the bipartisan vote in the Senate. It completely obliterates \nthe $1.6 billion that was added by the Specter amendment. It has been \nwiped out.\n  Let's bring it to concrete terms. What does it mean? The conference \nreport that took out that $1.6 billion, when spread over the different \nresearch being done by NIH, means, for example, that in AIDS research, \n$179 million less than what we had in the Senate; cancer research is \n$261 million less than what we had in the Senate; prostate cancer is \ndown $21 million; arthritis is down $24 million; Alzheimer's is $41.8 \nmillion less than what we had in the Senate.\n\n  If the conference report had kept in what we had voted for in the \nSenate, we would have an additional $261 million for cancer research; \nwe would have an additional $179 million for AIDS research; we would \nhave an additional $111 million for mental health research; we would \nhave an additional $14 million for Parkinson's; we would have an \nadditional $13 million for osteoporosis; we would have an additional \n$1.9 million for multiple sclerosis; we would have another $24 million \nfor kidney disease; we would have another $38 million to study infant \nmortality; we would have another $47 million for diabetes research if \nthis budget report has the $1.6 billion added by the Senate.\n  I thought the budget we passed was inadequate before; it is woefully \ninadequate now. For the life of me, I don't understand why the $1.6 \nbillion was taken out of this critically needed part of meeting our \nobligations of the future for NIH basic research.\n  There is another point. The Senate resolution had increased Pell \ngrants by $400, bringing them up to $3,700. We have needed to do that \nover the last 20 years. The purchasing power of Pell grants went down \n25 percent. A poor student in college today can spend 25 percent less \nwith the maximum Pell grant than 20 years ago. The education was also \ndropped in conference. That is deeply, deeply disappointing.\n  This budget needs to be sent back to the drawing board. It targets \nfiscally irresponsible tax breaks to the wealthiest of Americans. It \nshortchanges the critical investments we need: First, in medical \nresearch; and, second, in investment in education to keep our economy \nand our people healthy and strong.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in the last week, this budget has gone \nfrom bad to worse. That is the only ``progress'' we've seen. After a \nconference from which Democrats were excluded, our Republicans \ncolleagues are now proposing even bigger tax cuts. Last week, Senate \nRepublicans voted for $150 billion in tax cuts over five years, plus a \n``summer surprise'' of more tax cuts. This resolution calls for $175 \nbillion over five years, plus a ``summer surprise.''\n  To pay for those bigger tax cuts, this resolution calls for even \ndeeper cuts in education, health care, other critical priorities. It \nstill calls for 6 percent across-the-board cut in discretionary \nspending next year. That hasn't changed--for obvious reasons; our \ncolleagues don't want to make things even worse just before an \nelection.\n  But things do get much worse after the election--and every year for \nthe foreseeable future--under this plan. The additional cuts all \nratchet up in the ``out years.'' Instead of 8 percent across-the-board \ncuts by 2005, this plan calls for cuts of nearly 10 percent across-the-\nboard by 2005.\n  This plan dramatically weakens--in fact, it all but eliminates--any \ncommitment to a prescription drug benefit. Last week, this Senate \npassed a plan that dedicated $40 billion over five years for \nprescription drugs. That commitment is not included in this resolution. \nThis resolution includes $20 billion to quote--``improve access to \nprescription drugs''--whatever that means. There's another $20 \nbillion--but that's available only after we cut Medicare benefits.\n  As if that's not bad enough, this plan says the money for a \nprescription drug benefit will be available ``whenever'' the Finance \nCommittee reports out a prescription drug bill. ``Whenever''? Why don't \nthey just say the money will be available ``if we feel like it,'' or, \nthe money will be available ``if there's anything left after we pass \nall our tax breaks''?\n  The Senate-passed Republican budget at least included a date. It said \nmoney for prescription drug benefit would be available by Sept. 1, \n2000--whether or not the Finance Committee did its job. Now they've \nscratched out that date and written in ``whenever.'' You can \npractically see the budget writers winking! What they really mean is \n``never.''\n  Last week, a majority of Senators voted that Congress should put \nprescription drugs ahead of tax cuts. Fifty-one Senators--Republicans \nand Democrats--said we should not spend one dollar on tax cuts until we \npass a real prescription drug bill. This resolution directly \ncontradicts that statement. It says, ``Forget what we said last week. \nSpend nearly $200 billion on tax cuts now. Worry about prescription \ndrugs whenever.'' The contradiction would be laughable if it weren't so \ndeadly serious.\n\n[[Page S2690]]\n\n  Our Republican colleagues claim that, under their plan, total \ndiscretionary spending next year would be $14 billion above freeze. The \noperative word is ``total.'' What they don't like to say about their \nbudget is defense spending is $21 billion above a freeze; non-defense \ndiscretionary spending is $7 billion below a freeze.\n  There's another thing our colleagues don't like to talk about: \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the total non-Social \nSecurity surplus over the next five years will be $171 billion. The \nreason our colleagues don't like to talk about that is their tax cut \ncosts $196 billion over 5 years--$25 billion more than entire non-\nSocial Security surplus.\n  I am tempted to recycle that classic old Yogi Berra line--``It's deja \nvu all over again.''--because it seems like we've had this same debate \nevery year for the last five years. Instead, let me use a different \nYogi Berra quote: ``It ain't over `til it's over.'' This is just the \nbeginning of the budget process. We have many months to go.\n  This budget does not meet the priorities of American people. If we \npass this flawed plan, America would miss a once-in-a-lifetime \nopportunity to sustain and expand this economic prosperity; protect \nSocial Security and Medicare; and invest in America's future--in \neducation, medical research, safe communities, clean water--all the \nthings we need to remain strong and competitive.\n  In the five years since they regained control of Congress, \nRepublicans have never passed a budget without a major ``train wreck.'' \nThis budget, unfortunately, sets us up to extend that record. To quote \nthe Republican Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, these \nnumbers are ``unrealistic.'' They do not add up. It's obvious. We know \nit, and they know it.\n  We hope that this year, our colleagues will admit their plan can't \nwork--before the train wreck. If they do, Democrats are ready, willing \nand determined to work with them to get the budget process back on \ntrack. We want to work with Republicans to write a responsible budget. \nA budget that extends the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, so \nwe can avoid a Baby Boomer retirement crisis; a budget that includes a \nreal Medicare prescription drug plan that is voluntary, affordable and \nuniversal.\n  We want to work with Republicans to pass a budget that pays down our \nnational debt--so we can stop wasting $220 billion a year--$600 million \na day--on interest payments. We want to work with our colleagues to \npass a budget that provides tax cuts to help working families with real \nneeds--like child care, day care, and caring for older parents--a \nbudget that invests education, health care and other critical \npriorities. We want to work with Republicans to pass a budget, in \nshort, that allows us to seize, not squander, the once-in-a-lifetime \nopportunity now before us.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will reluctantly vote against the \nConference Report on the Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2001. \nAlthough the budget resolution includes most of the mechanisms approved \nby the Senate to ensure better budgetary discipline, the resolution \nfails to address the pressing issues of the impending financial \ninsolvency of Social Security and Medicare, and the massive burden of \ndebt that will be passed along to our children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, for the first time in history, economic projections \nshow a surplus of nearly $1.9 trillion over the next ten years, \nexclusive of the surplus in the Social Security Trust Funds. At the \nsame time, we know that the Social Security system is projected to be \nbankrupt by 2037 and Medicare will be broke in 2023, leaving millions \nof elderly Americans without the promised benefits they need to live \ncomfortably in their retirement years.\n  Yet, this budget resolution uses none of the surplus to shore up \neither Social Security or Medicare. Nor does it apply any significant \nportion of the surplus to reducing the burden on future generations of \nour $5.7 trillion national debt. In fact, debt will actually continue \nto accumulate because the resolution allows most of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus to be spent on more big government programs.\n  Mr. President, as I traveled around the country over the past several \nmonths, I listened to the American people. Everywhere I went, they told \nme that they wanted us to protect and preserve Social Security and \nMedicare. They said they wanted to pay down the debt. I proposed a plan \nto use the bulk of the non-Social Security surplus to do what the \npeople told me they wanted to do, and still provide much-needed tax \nrelief to those who need it most--lower- and middle-income families. \nUnfortunately, this budget spends too much and saves too little for the \nfuture, and I cannot support it.\n  Mr. President, there are some very good provisions in the budget \nresolution.\n  I support the increase of $4.5 billion in defense spending over the \nPresident's budget request, which represents real growth in the defense \nbudget for the first time in many years. I am pleased that the \nconference includes the $25 million added to the defense budget to get \n12,000 enlisted families off of food stamps and end the disgrace of the \nfood stamp Army once and for all. For too many years, the Clinton \nAdministration has neglected the people who volunteer for military \nservice. With this increase, and money freed up from eliminating waste \nand inefficiency in the defense budget, we can make progress toward \nrestoring the morale and readiness of our Armed Forces.\n  The addition of $1.9 billion to the budget request for veterans \nhealth care is the amount identified in the Independent Budget of the \nveterans groups as the minimum necessary to provide appropriate care \nfor our veterans. I hope the Congress sees fit this year to restore the \n``broken promise'' of free lifetime medical care that was made to our \nnation's oldest veterans, and I intend to work with my colleagues to \nensure all of our military personnel have access to the quality, \naffordable health care they deserve.\n\n  Many of the specific funding assumptions in the resolution are \nlaudable, but I disagree with funding most of these increases from the \nsurplus. I have identified billions of dollars of pork-barrel spending \nin annual appropriations bills over the past several years--programs \nthat are wasteful, inefficient, or low-priority. Because of the \ncompelling need to deal with the problems in Social Security and \nMedicare, we should look within the budget to ferret out waste in order \nto fund higher priority requirements, rather than spend the entire \nsurplus on more government.\n  Some of the objectionable provisions in this resolution are earmarks \nthat would qualify as pork-barrel spending if they were included in an \nappropriations bill. For example, the resolution identifies $700 \nmillion to construct, or site and design, more than ten new courthouses \nin 2001. It assumes $25 million will be set aside for the construction \nof a Metro station on New York Avenue in the District of Columbia. And \nit earmarks $510 million for NOAA's Pacific coastal salmon recovery \nprogram. As I have always said, I am not making a judgment on the \nmerits of these programs, but their mention in this resolution leads me \nto assume that they will show up as earmarks in the appropriations \nprocess --a process not noted for its reliance on merit over politics.\n  I also note the significant cut in the International Affairs budget \nin the resolution, which is $2.7 billion less than the President's \nrequest and $2.2 billion below last year's level. I am concerned that, \nas in past years, the foreign affairs budget is seen as an easy target \nfor cuts to offset spending in other areas. Clearly, the United States \nis and must remain a global power with global interests, both related \nto our security and that of our allies, as well as our economic health. \nOur continued international involvement requires not just a strong \nmilitary, but a robust diplomacy. I will be looking carefully at the \nForeign Operations Appropriations bill to ensure that the programs that \nare cut to meet this budget target are appropriate and do not in any \nway hinder our ability to influence world affairs to our advantage.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to note that the resolution includes \nseveral Senate-passed provisions to ensure Congress complies with the \nrevenue and spending levels in the resolution to limit the amount of \nemergency spending and budgetary gimmicks, including:\n  A Social Security ``lockbox'' point of order which can be raised \nagainst any\n\n[[Page S2691]]\n\nbudget resolution that dips into the Social Security Trust Funds.\n  A permanent 60-vote point of order in the Senate challenging any \n``emergency'' in any spending or revenue bill, to ensure that emergency \nspending is truly used for emergencies and not simply to avoid \naccounting for routine spending.\n  A restored firewall between defense and non-defense spending for FY \n2001, with any funds unused in either account to be used for debt \nreduction.\n  Two new 60-vote points of order to prevent the use of advanced \nappropriations and delayed obligations to circumvent spending limits.\n  Mr. President, there are many good provisions in the budget \nresolution, and I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Budget \nCommittee for taking on some very tough fights. The fact is that we \nsimply have different opinions about budget priorities. I cannot \nsupport this resolution because it spends the surplus on more \ngovernment, without guaranteeing funding for Social Security or \nMedicare reform or significantly reducing the debt, and I will vote \nagainst the resolution.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition \nto H. Con. Res. 290, the Budget Resolution for FY 2001 Conference \nReport that the Senate is voting on today. I feel it is important to \nnote that despite my opposition, I have deep and abiding respect for \nBudget Committee Chairman Domenici and recognize and appreciate the \nhard work, expertise, and excellent leadership that he has displayed in \nthe Senate's consideration of the federal budget.\n  There is much to praise in Chairman Domenici's budget. Increased \nfunding for education and defense. A reserve fund of $40 billion for a \nprescription drug benefit. Provisions to do away with budgetary \ngimmicks. A Social Security Lock-Box. But, there is just too much money \nset aside for tax cuts, and not enough for paying down the debt.\n  While I support some targeted tax cuts, such as the low-income \nhousing tax credit, and marriage penalty relief, I believe that $150 \nbillion over five years in tax cuts is too much. Instead, I believe it \nmakes more sense to pay down the debt. The federal debt--currently $5.7 \ntrillion, with interest costs of over $200 billion per year, or almost \n12 percent of annual federal outlays--represents a huge burden that \nshould not be passed on to our children and to our grandchildren. Not \nonly is this massive debt a problem, but by paying down the debt we \nwould free up more than $200 billion per year. That money eventually \ncould be used to ensure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare; \nto increase funding for education, specifically, Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act (IDEA); needed infrastructure and \nenvironmental improvements; and to provide for tax relief.\n  Let me take a few moments to explain a number of my votes from last \nweek during the Senate's consideration of the Budget Resolution. I \nvoted for an amendment offered by Senator Conrad that would have \nreduced the tax cuts in the Budget Resolution from $150 billion over \nfive years to $75 billion for tax cuts and $75 billion for debt relief. \nI also voted for an amendment offered by Senator Voinovich that would \nhave struck all tax relief from the Budget Resolution so that it may be \nused for debt relief. Believing that the approach taken by Senator \nLautenberg was more fiscally responsible, I voted in favor of his \namendment because it contained only $59 billion in tax cuts and \nprovided for more debt relief. Finally, I voted against the Budget \nResolution as it was reported from Committee because it contained a too \nhigh level of tax cuts and not enough debt relief.\n  All of us who have had to pay interest--be it on our house, car, \ncredit card, or other payment--know that these costs are painful. We \nneed to apply the same fiscal discipline here in Congress that we apply \nat home. To pay out 12 percent of our revenues annually on interest \ncosts rather than on education, needed infrastructure construction and \nimprovements, and to ensure the solvency of the Social Security and \nMedicare programs, seems to me to be a poor investment of taxpayer \ndollars. Therefore, in an effort to encourage fiscal discipline and \nresponsibility, I am casting my vote against the Budget Resolution \nConference Report.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first I must congratulate the Chairman \nof the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, for producing an on-time \nbudget for only the third time in the 24-plus-year history of the \nBudget Act.\n  Thrifty, cautious, and conservative. These adjectives describe the \nYankee qualities of many Vermonters when someone tries to get them to \nopen their wallets, and are in the genes of anyone who represents our \ngreat state in Congress. I am pleased that this resolution protects \nsocial security. Not one penny of the social security surplus is \ntouched. Second, it balances the budget every year without using the \nsocial security surplus. Thirdly, this resolution retires the national \ndebt held by the public--nearly $170 billion in the first year and $1 \ntrillion over the next five years.\n  I am greatly troubled, however, about certain elements in the budget, \nand will vote against the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution now before \nthe Senate.\n  What would a cautious farmer do when times are good--invest in new \nequipment to become more efficient, pay off debts, and put some away \nfor a rainy day. There is no question that tax relief is warranted, but \nnot at the expense of education, veterans health, job training, child \ncare and other important discretionary programs.\n  A farmer cautiously guards his seed corn for future harvests. Our \nnation's seed corn is its youth and investments in education are needed \nto protect our prosperity. The conference report now before us rejects \nfunding added on the floor of the Senate for three important education \nprograms. It not only rejects funding that a majority of this body \nsupported but it takes a giant step backward by reducing funding for \neducation $3 billion below what was contained within the original \nSenate-passed resolution.\n  When I first arrived in Congress, one of the very first bills that I \nhad the privilege of working on was the Education of All Handicapped \nAct of 1975. As a freshman Member of Congress, I was proud to sponsor \nthat legislation and to be named as a member of the House and Senate \nconference committee along with then Vermont Senator Bob Stafford.\n  At that time, despite a clear Constitutional obligation to educate \nall children, regardless of disability, thousands of disabled students \nwere denied access to a public education. Passage of the Education of \nAll Handicapped Act offered financial incentives to states to fulfill \nthis existing obligation. Recognizing that the costs associated with \neducating these children was more than many school districts could bear \nalone, the Federal government pledged to pay 40 percent of the costs of \neducating these students.\n  The budget resolution that is before us makes a mockery of this \npledge. The original Senate budget resolution assumed that the Federal \ngovernment would only fund between 15 and 18 percent of the cost of \neducating disabled students. My amendment to increase this percentage \nwas narrowly defeated last week and was then watered down by an \namendment by my colleague Senator Voinovich. I had hoped, nonetheless, \nthat passage of the Voinovich amendment meant that a serious effort \nwould be made in conference to increase funding for IDEA. This hope was \nclearly misplaced.\n\n  Let me also speak for a minute about early childhood education.\n  Research into the development and growth of the human brain clearly \ndemonstrates that learning begins at birth. The sheer magnitude of this \nscientific research is difficult to fathom. When talk turns to 100 \nbillion neurons or connections with axons and dendrites, confusion is \nthe most likely outcome. What this research basically says is something \nthat parents and grandparents have know for decades, very young \nchildren need a nurturing, stimulating environment in order for their \nbrains to make the myriad of connections they need to grow into \ncompetent, caring adults.\n  Research on the brain has shown that the years between birth and six \nare critical for future success in school, at work, and in society. I \nbelieve that education provides the cornerstone from which all other \nthings become possible. Our Nation's first educational goal is that all \nchildren should begin\n\n[[Page S2692]]\n\nschool ready to learn. In order to achieve that goal, parents and \ncaretakers need support and assistance to better ensure that they have \nthe tools necessary to incorporate early childhood learning into the \ndaily lives of our Nation's children. Senator Stevens offered an \namendment that was adopted by unanimous consent that provided mandatory \nfunding for this program. This funding was rejected in conference and \nis not contained within this budget resolution.\n  Senator Kennedy and I offered an amendment that provided for a $400 \nincrease in the maximum Pell Grant. These funds make it possible for \nmillions of students to attend college each year. Again, this funding \nwas rejected in conference and is not contained within this resolution.\n  Prosperity also dictates that we redouble our efforts to protect \nsociety's most vulnerable. Unfortunately, this budget does not go far \nenough to provide drugs to seniors who need them now. I agree with \nVermonters who tell me that prescription drug costs are too high, and \nthat it doesn't make sense for Medicare to cover hospital charges, but \nnot cover the drugs that could keep beneficiaries out of the hospital.\n  Let me be clear, Mr. President, I believe that we need Medicare \nreform that includes a broad prescription drug benefit. But even if we \nare not able to enact Medicare reform this year, I believe we need to \nprovide sufficient funds now, in this budget, that will provide relief \nto Medicare beneficiaries that need help the most--those low-income \nseniors whose income is high enough that they don't qualify for \nMedicaid, but still do not have enough income to afford the \nprescription drugs that they need.\n  Mr. President, I am very disappointed with the prescription drug \nprovision in this Budget Resolution. I supported the approach of \nSenator Snowe's amendment in the Budget Committee that would have \nprovided $40 billion for prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries \neven if Congress is unable to enact Medicare reform. We should not let \nCongress' inability to enact broad Medicare reform stand in the way of \nproviding seniors with the medicines that they need to live longer, \nhealthier lives.\n  I am further dismayed that this budget resolution does not fulfill \nour Nation's commitment to its veterans. Years of underfunding coupled \nwith spiraling health care costs have left the veterans health care \nsystem struggling to provide the quality care that veterans expect and \ndeserve. This trend must be stopped and reversed. We owe it to future \ngenerations to keep federal spending under control. But we must first \nrecognize the prior claim of veterans who have already given of \nthemselves and who expect to receive the medical care and benefits they \nwere promised.\n  This budget, like all budgets passed by Congress, is an expression of \npolitical intent, priorities, and a starting point for bargaining. Much \nwork remains to be done to pass the 13 appropriations bills that \nactually fund the government. In areas where I disagree with the budget \nresolution, I plan to work hard with appropriators to adjust spending \nlevels and turn this budget into reality.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the Budget Resolution before us is a \nresponsible budget framework. Senator Domenici has done a superb job in \nhelping to craft this budget on the Senate side, and he deserves our \npraise. This budget resolution balances the important goals of debt \nreduction, tax relief, and prudent spending levels.\n  Most importantly, the budget will fully protect Social Security now \nand in the future. This represents a sea change in the way business is \ndone in Washington. When I came to Washington, Congress routinely spent \nmoney out of the Social Security trust fund. This resolution ends the \nraid on Social Security, and does so in two ways.\n  First, the budget is based on the premise that Social Security funds \nwill not be used to pay for additional deficit spending or tax relief. \nSecond, as part of this budget's commitment to protect the entire \nSocial Security surplus, Senator Domenici included a point of order \nagainst any budget that spends money out of the Social Security \nsurplus. This rule is the same as the one I proposed last year, and \nthat was included in the FY 2000 budget.\n  As a result of this hard-fought fiscal discipline, this budget will \nretire $1.1 trillion in publicly held debt over 5 years, and \napproximately $170 billion next year. If we continue upon the path laid \nout by this budget, we will completely eliminate the publicly-held debt \nover the next 13 years.\n  We have already made great progress in this regard. When this budget \nis enacted, we will have reduced the national debt by $533 billion over \nthe past three years.\n  I was particularly pleased that the Senate unanimously accepted my \namendment objecting to the President's plan to have the government \ninvest Social Security surpluses in the stock market. This risky scheme \nwould have put both Social Security and the stock market at risk.\n  In addition to responsibly paying off our publicly-held debt, this \nbudget allows for approximately $150 billion in tax relief over 5 \nyears, including $13 billion in FY 2001. These actions include \nsignificant marriage penalty relief, which already has passed the \nHouse, and is working its way through the Senate. In fact, during the \ndebate on the Budget Resolution, the Senate passed the Hutchison-\nAshcroft amendment calling for marriage penalty relief 99-1.\n  In addition to providing a judicious mix of tax relief, debt \nreduction, and Social Security protection, the FY 2001 Budget \nResolution also includes responsible spending levels. This budget, \nwhich is a balanced budget for the third year in a row, calls for \napproximately $600.5 billion in discretionary spending.\n  This budget will fully fund Medicare, rejecting President Clinton's \nMedicare cuts of $14 billion over 5 years. In addition, Congress' \nspending plan calls for a $40 billion reserve fund to pay for Medicare \nreform and Medicare prescription drugs.\n  As I said, this budget focuses spending towards our national \npriorities, including a $4.5 billion increase in education spending in \nFY 2001, and $5.5 billion in agriculture spending in FY 2000. The FY \n2001 budget also increases funding for domestic priorities such as Head \nStart; embassy security; the National Science Foundation; the National \nInstitutes of Health; the Park Service; and highways and airports.\n  Of course, this budget isn't perfect. I was disappointed that the \nSenate did not adopt the effort to protect the Medicare surplus with my \nMedicare lockbox amendment. This amendment, which would have extended \nthe protections that now apply to Social Security to the Medicare Part \nA Hospital Insurance trust, did not overcome a point of order in the \nSenate.\n  Despite this setback, I am pleased with the overall package agreed to \nby Congress. It meets the vital national needs of protecting Social \nSecurity, reducing debt, cutting taxes, and funding our domestic \npriorities. I plan to vote for the FY 2001 Budget Resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the budget \nresolution conference report. This budget before us today continues the \nmomentum we started last year to provide additional funding for defense \nin an effort to correct the most critical readiness, modernization, and \nrecruiting and retention problems in our military.\n  I thank the Majority Leader, the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee and his staff and the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and his staff, for working with me to provide \nthe additional $4.0 billion in much-needed funding for the Department \nof Defense, the reserve for military retiree healthcare, and the \nimportant language necessary to allow the military thrift savings plan \nto become a reality. I also recognize members of my own committee \nstaff--Les Brownlee, Staff Director, Judy Ansley, our Deputy Staff \nDirector, and especially Larry Lanzillotta, our Budget Chief--whose \nexpertise in budgeting matters is invaluable not only to the Armed \nServices Committee, but to the entire Senate as well.\n  The funds which have been added in this Budget Resolution for defense \nare absolutely critical in providing readiness, modernization funding, \nand the personnel incentives necessary to reverse the negative trends \nin recruiting and retention. The increase of $4.0 billion will allow us \nto bring defense\n\n[[Page S2693]]\n\nspending to a more appropriate level and address some of the urgent \nunfunded requirements of the military chiefs. For too many years, the \nsize of our defense budget has been based on constrained funding, not \non the threats facing our country or the military strategy necessary to \nmeet those threats. This budget will go a long way in allowing us to \nensure the safety and security of our people by maintaining a strong \nand capable military.\n  Making the Thrift Savings Plan available to military personnel comes \nat a critical time for the military services. Participation in a thrift \nsavings account will encourage personal savings and enhance the \nretirement income for service members, who currently do not have access \nto a 401(k) savings plan. When the TSP program is implemented, military \npersonnel will be able to join federal workers in a savings program \nthat will enhance the value of their retirement system and permit them \nto improve their quality of life. The Service Chiefs have indicated \nthat this plan, combined with the pay raise, the repeal of the Redux \nretirement system, and the increased bonuses in the FY 2000 Defense \nAuthorization Act, will reduce the hemorrhage of trained and \nexperienced military personnel we are now experiencing.\n  The Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and the \nService Chiefs have all said that fulfilling our commitment for \nhealthcare to our military retirees should be among the highest \npriorities for this year. I believe there is overwhelming support in \nthe Senate to correct many of the shortfalls in the military healthcare \nsystem for our service members, their families, and our military \nretirees. It is critical that we enact the important initiatives \ncontained in the bipartisan healthcare legislation introduced by the \nleadership of the Senate and the leadership of the Armed Services \nCommittee earlier this year. This budget resolution makes it possible \nto fund these important health care initiatives for our military \nretirees.\n  I want to again express my appreciation to the distinguished Chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and the Chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, and also their highly \nprofessional staff members for assisting us in securing these much-\nneeded funds in support of a stronger national defense.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, once again, I am trying hard to \naccommodate Senators. I will not use more of our time if they want to \ngive back. I have one Senator who has not spoken. I yield 5 minutes to \nSenator Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nconference report on the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution and to \nhighlight a reserve fund that Senator Domenici has been referring to \nwith respect to a new prescription drug benefit.\n  In advance, I would like to thank the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee for his unwavering commitment to a balanced budget and \nfiscally responsible decisionmaking over the years. Thanks to his \nleadership and efforts, the turbulent waves of annual deficits and \nmounting debt have certainly been calmed. And if we adhere to the \nprinciples as contained in this year's budget resolution, and retain \nthese principles in the years to come, clearly, we will have provided \nsecurity for many generations.\n  The conference report we are now considering not only maintains \nfiscal discipline but it also ensures that critical priorities are \nprotected in fiscal year 2001 and beyond, which is the purpose of the \nbalanced budget: to be able to provide a constraint on Federal spending \nbut at the same time determine how best to invest in the future.\n  I commend the chairman of the Budget Committee for having taken the \nstep last year to protect every dollar that belongs to the Social \nSecurity trust fund and devoting it solely to reducing the publicly \nheld debt. Ultimately, this commitment and this conference report will \nensure that we reduce the publicly-held debt by approximately $1 \ntrillion over the next 5 years and eliminate it entirely by the year \n2013. Clearly, it is a paradigm shift, not only with respect to the \nfact we are no longer using surpluses that belong to Social Security, \nbut also the fact that we are able to reduce the publicly held debt and \nmake a commitment to protecting Social Security.\n  The second issue in this budget that is critically important is that \nwe are making investments where we should be making investments for the \nfuture--in education, health care, child care, and defense. In \naddition, this budget provides modest tax relief. The American people \ndo deserve tax relief, given the burdens they have faced over the years \nto achieve debt reduction, and the constraints we have had to adhere to \nover this last decade. Certainly they deserve to have a piece of that \npie through the elimination of the marriage tax penalty, through a \ndeduction for college tuition expenses and a credit for the interest \npaid on student loans. Those are the priorities that could be \naccommodated in this conference report that the American people \ndeserve. I think they are the right priorities.\n  Third, as the chairman of the committee has indicated, we have now \nincluded and have taken a giant step forward in ensuring our Nation's \nseniors have a prescription drug benefit program. Senator Wyden, \nSenator Smith, and I offered an amendment in the committee that would \nhave laid out a bifurcated approach that would provide a down-payment \nof $20 billion for a new benefit in the first 3 years, and $20 billion \nin years 2004 and 2005 contingent on Congress moving forward on \nMedicare reform. Of importance, the initial down-payment of $20 billion \nwould allow us to move forward in creating a new benefit this year with \nor without Medicare reform--and that structure has been retained in \nthis conference report.\n  We also included a date certain by which the Senate Finance Committee \nwould be required to report a new prescription drug benefit bill. If \nthat date was not met, we would be able to proceed with the stand-alone \nprescription drug benefit on the floor. That time certain was dropped.\n  But the fact of the matter is, the conference report retains the \nreserve fund language, and we still have the ability to create a stand-\nalone prescription drug benefit this year. As a result, the Senate \nFinance Committee still has $20 billion available to develop a \nprescription drug benefit program for our Nation's seniors that is not \ncontingent on Medicare reform or other legislation--and an additional \n$20 billion will be made available if they proceed with broader \nMedicare reform.\n  Accordingly, I thank Chairman Domenici for his efforts in ensuring \nthat provision would be included in the conference report. The \nsignificance of it is twofold. One is that we have $20 billion that \nwould be immediately available for such a benefit. As a result, this \nreserve fund gives us the opening we need to consider and pass a \nprescription drug benefit program this year. Furthermore, it not only \nprovides a downpayment for such a benefit over the next 5 years, but it \nalso provides an additional $20 billion if we move forward reach a \nconsensus on Medicare reform. This total allotment of $40 billion over \nthe coming five years is more than was contained in the Chairman's \nmark, and even more than was provided in the President's own budget \nproposal for a prescription drug benefit.\n  There are no caveats, there are no conditions. The Senate Finance \nCommittee has the ability to proceed with a comprehensive Medicare \nreform package. But in the event they cannot grapple with this issue, \nif they fail to reach a consensus and Congress fails to reach a \nconsensus, we can proceed and enact a prescription drug benefit \nprogram.\n  So the overall structure of this fund is the same as it was when we \noffered it as an amendment during the markup, as it was supported \nunanimously by Republicans and Democrats on the Budget Committee. As a \nresult, it provides the Finance Committee with both the means and the \nmotivation to act on this legislation in a timely manner.\n  In conclusion, I again applaud the efforts of the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Domenici, for preserving the essential \nstructure of this reserve fund which enables the Senate and the \nCongress to create a prescription drug benefit in a timely fashion. I \ncongratulate him because this is a significant step forward and gives \nus the opportunity, for the first time in a\n\n[[Page S2694]]\n\nvery long time, to enact this very significant and critical benefit for \nour Nation's seniors.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will propound a unanimous consent request. It is \ncleared on the other side.\n  I ask unanimous consent vote on adoption of the budget conference \nreport occur no later than 6:30 p.m. this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair and Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I conclude my remarks, regretfully noting we \nare leaving without passing the juvenile justice bill conference \nreport, without adopting sensible gun control legislation, missing the \nopportunity, I think, to do what the American people want us to do.\n  I have long been a supporter of effective gun controls, working hard \nfor the Brady bill and for the assault weapons ban while I was in the \nother body. But I have been galvanized to an even more concerted effort \nby an event that took place very recently in Providence. This, I think, \nis an example of the gun violence we face.\n  Two young men were horsing around wrestling. One got offended by the \nother one. Unfortunately, this happened in a neighborhood, like so many \nneighborhoods, where it is easier to get a gun than it is to get a \nlibrary book. Someone in the crowd had a handgun. In an act of absolute \nrecklessness, one young man fired at the other young man, critically \nwounding him in the head. That young man, the shooter, was so \ndistraught that he rushed off and took his own life. That is the face \nof gun violence in too many places in America today.\n  We can do something about it. We should do something about it. We \nshould not leave until we do something about it. Regretfully, we are \nleaving but we are coming back, I hope, with a renewed commitment to \nensure we will, in fact, pass the provisions in the juvenile justice \ncommittee report.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey, who has \nparticularly championed the legislation to close the gun show loophole.\n  I yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island \nfor the work he has done on trying to limit the damage from gun \nviolence in this country. He reminded us it is time. We are days away \nfrom April 20, the anniversary of the terrible tragedy at Columbine. We \nare days away. That means in this full year that passed, we could not \nfind time to get on with doing our best to control gun violence by \nexamining what the possibilities are, by closing the gun show loophole, \nby making sure those who are going to apply for gun ownership were fit \nto do it.\n  Here is a picture of a fellow who is on the FBI Ten Most Wanted \nFugitives list. He could walk up to an unlicensed dealer in a gun show \nand purchase all the guns the money in his pocket can buy. We ought not \npermit that. The American people do not want us to permit that.\n  Mr. President, we are closing the debate now. I congratulate my \nfriend and colleague from New Mexico for his ardent work on getting \nthis done. They have a majority, and the one thing we know about our \ndemocratic system is if a majority has been sent here by the American \npeople, we have to acknowledge that, and they have the choice of a \nmajority. I wish we had the majority, and we would be kinder and \ngentler, although I am not sure everybody would agree with that.\n  That is the die as it was cast. It was cast by a majority. In the \nprocess, I see substantial loopholes in this budget conference report. \nIt proposes deep cuts in programs such as education and health care, \nlaw enforcement, veterans benefits, and environmental protection. Also, \nbased on just the most simple arithmetic, it is going to raid the \nSocial Security surplus, regarding which so many of us have taken an \noath: Touch not a hair on yon gray Social Security head. Here we are, \npreparing to violate it, even as we present a program for the fiscal \nyear 2001.\n  They did purport--and I am not talking about as a deception; I am \ntalking about it as an analysis of the arithmetic, the mathematics as \nit is there--that prescription drugs were going to be taken care of.\n  I read from the conference committee report under the heading of \nprescription drugs. It says: Whenever the Committee on Finance in the \nSenate reports a bill, a joint resolution or conference report thereon \nsubmitted which improves access to prescription drugs for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. It does not say we are going to develop a program that \nis going to make prescription drugs more available, cheaper, et cetera. \nIt does not talk about that. It says access. Maybe it means the \nGovernment is going to produce lists of places where one can buy drugs \noff the Internet cheaper. Maybe access means if you visit country X, Y, \nor Z, you will be able to buy prescription drugs cheaper.\n  Access is a broad term. It does not say anything about having to get \nit done, but it does say in the tax section that the Finance Committee \nmust reconcile. That means they have to produce a sufficient amount of \nfunding for tax breaks for whomever it affects, and this is going to be \nprincipally the wealthy.\n  We leave the prescription drug section and go to the Medicare reform \non page 48. It says: Whenever the Committee on Finance in the Senate--\nthey are the people who can do it; we cannot do it in the Budget \nCommittee--whenever the Finance Committee reports a bill, joint \nresolution, or conference report thereon submitted which improves the \nsolvency of the Medicare program without the use of new subsidies from \nthe general fund--to me that says we are going to dip into the Medicare \ntrust fund in order to reform Medicare.\n  If that is reform, Heaven protect us, keep us from the kind of reform \nthat says we will have to take funds from cuts in the Medicare trust \nfund.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, this is my last attempt to work on the \nFederal budget. As disappointed as I am with the outcome, I am pleased \nto say I very comfortably and very forthrightly worked with Senator \nDomenici. He is a distinguished Senator. He knows his subjects, oh, so \nwell. I will miss the chance for the fray, but also the chance for the \npleasant contact we have had through this experience.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator from New Jersey yield back his time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to respond to the Senator for \n1 minute, and then I will have remarks about the Senator from New \nJersey and our relationship.\n  I say to the distinguished Senator who spoke about the National \nInstitutes of Health and what we are going to do and not going to do, \neverybody should know when and by whom the NIH increased in the most \ndramatic manner in its history.\n  In the last 3 years, when Republicans controlled both Houses, we \nincreased the National Institutes of Health--cancer, AIDS, all those \ndiseases--let me give the numbers to my colleagues. Since 1998, NIH has \nincreased 40 percent: In 1998, $13.7 billion; in 1999, it was $15.6 \nbillion. That is a 14-percent increase. In 2000, it went up 13.8 \npercent, one of the largest domestic program increases in this whole \nbudget. In 2001, this conference report, NIH funding is going to $19.3 \nbillion. That is an increase of 8 percent. We are doing pretty well \ntrying to find cures for serious ailments, thanks to the Republicans \nwho in conference and elsewhere pushed so hard for it.\n  I ask that it be in order to ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, when Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey \ncame to this committee, I do not know if he was like me, but I never \nthought I would be ranking member, much less chairman. I am not sure he \nhad a plan to be ranking member, especially when he had to put up with \nme.\n  It has been not only a joy, in terms of getting our committee work \ndone, but it has been healthy from the standpoint of adversaries who \nbelieve\n\n[[Page S2695]]\n\nstrongly about their position but understand the other fellow can have \na different opinion and it is all right, they are OK. That is how I \nfeel about him. He has different views than I, but he brought a lot of \nstability to this committee. The minority ought to be very grateful for \nthe way he handled matters. They all had a chance to contribute.\n  Today is his last effort on the floor of the Senate as ranking \nmember. I thank him. I hope the whole Senate understands what he has \ndone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if I may take 1 minute from the time \nremaining of the Senator from Rhode Island. I yielded back all my time.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record documents prepared by \nOMB that explain the impact as they see it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Potential Impact in FY 2001 of the Budget Resolution Conference Report\n\n       The following programmatic impact statements illustrate \n     reductions (by function) to the FY 2001 Budget request \n     contained in the Budget Resolution Conference Report.\n\n\n          education, training, employment, and social services\n\n       Class Size. The Conference Report appears to freeze the \n     Class Size Reduction program at the FY 2000 level and would \n     therefore prevent the hiring of the third group of teachers \n     meant to reduce class size in grades 1-3, to a nationwide \n     average of 18 students per class. Twenty thousand new \n     teachers could not be hired.\n       21st Century Community Learning Centers. The Conference \n     Report could cut $547 million from the President's request, \n     denying approximately 1.6 million school age children in over \n     6,000 new centers access to before- and after-school and \n     summer programs in safe, drug-free environments.\n       School Construction. The Budget Resolution Conference \n     Report could eliminate $1.3 billion in loan subsidies and \n     grants to repair 5,000 public schools.\n       Small, safe, and drug-free schools. The Conference Report \n     could prevent 400 additional high schools from developing \n     schools-within-schools and career academies that could create \n     smaller, safer learning environments for students. It could \n     also severely compromise the President's proposed 40-\n     community expansion of the popular interagency Safe Schools/\n     Healthy Students initiative, which supports comprehensive, \n     community-wide approaches to drug and violence prevention, \n     and eliminate Project SERV, an initiative to provide \n     emergency assistance to schools affected by serious violence \n     or other traumatic incidents.\n       Funding for the Dislocated Worker program would be cut by \n     about $213 million, denying training, job search assistance, \n     and support services to approximately 118,000 dislocated \n     workers.\n       Adult training services for over 45,000 of the 380,000 \n     adults who would otherwise be served in FY 2000 would be \n     eliminated.\n       Funding for the Youth Activities Formula Grant program \n     would be cut by about $123 million, denying 73,000 low-income \n     youth summer jobs and training opportunities.\n       The Community Service Employment for Older Americans \n     program would be cut by about $57 million. About 12,000 low-\n     income older Americans would lose their part-time jobs.\n       The budget resolution would cut the Job Corps program by \n     $163 million--preventing Job Corps from opening the final two \n     centers of the recent four center expansion and possibly \n     resulting in the closure of 8-11 additional Job Corps \n     Centers, denying job training opportunities to over 5,000 \n     disadvantaged youth.\n       Funding for the Youth Opportunity Grants program would be \n     cut by $45 million, denying over 10,000 youth in high-poverty \n     communities access to education, training, and employment \n     assistance.\n       A $845 million cut to the President's request would force \n     Head Start to provide services to approximately 70,000 fewer \n     children in FY 2001 than would otherwise be served.\n       The 12-percent cut to the Administration on Aging assumed \n     in the Budget Resolution would result in 20 million fewer \n     home-delivered meals to ill and disabled seniors than would \n     otherwise be served.\n\n\n                   community and regional development\n\n       The final Budget Resolution reduces funding for Community \n     and Regional Development below last year's level and is a \n     decrease of approximately $3 billion from the President's \n     budget. Given the competing demands within this program \n     category, this funding level would almost certainly result in \n     no increase in the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) \n     program, and would probably end up reducing CDBG funding by \n     eight percent below the President's budget level. This would \n     reduce local communities support of housing activities, \n     including a loss of more than 28,000 people from benefiting \n     from programs providing housing rehabilitation, construction, \n     and homebuyer assistance, and 6,900 fewer jobs being created \n     using CDBG assistance for economic development. The \n     resolution funding level would seriously impair the ability \n     of the New Markets initiatives to provide businesses with \n     funding and assistance, which they would use to invest in low \n     income neighborhoods around the country.\n       The Conference Report's funding level would seriously \n     impair the ability of the New Markets initiatives to provide \n     businesses with funding and assistance, which they would use \n     to invest in low-income neighborhoods around the country.\n       FEMA Emergency Funding. Contingent emergency appropriations \n     provide a means to make emergency disaster response funding \n     available to handle the disaster activity that is expected to \n     occur, based on recent experience. By stripping out \n     contingent emergency funding from the President's budget \n     request, the Budget Resolution makes it more difficult for \n     the President to release appropriate funding as quickly as \n     possible to enable Federal agencies to respond rapidly \n     when a disaster strikes. Postponing consideration of \n     contingent emergency appropriations until disasters strike \n     could lead to circumstances in which disaster victims are \n     left without shelter and communities are left without \n     critical clean up and rebuilding assistance for days, \n     weeks, and sometimes even months.\n       Super-Majority for FEMA Emergencies. Requiring a super-\n     majority of the Senate for an emergency appropriation would \n     make it much more difficult for the Federal Government to \n     respond quickly and appropriately to disasters. A super-\n     majority requirement could lead to some circumstances in \n     which disaster victims are left without Federal disaster \n     assistance for lengthy periods--and perhaps even some cases \n     in which disaster victims will not receive the assistance \n     they need.\n\n\n                            income security\n\n       The Budget Resolution explicitly states its intention to \n     provide funding for the renewal of all expiring Section 8 \n     housing contracts. However, the large and competing demands \n     on Income Security activities assumed in the Budget \n     Resolution indicate that full renewal funding cannot be \n     achieved within the resolution's functional total. As a \n     result, the resolution would necessitate significant cuts in \n     housing renewals from the President's request of $13 billion. \n     The resolution would also eliminate the Administration's \n     efforts to assist more needy families with 120,000 new \n     incremental housing vouchers. The deletion of new housing \n     assistance would come at a time when a record 5.4 million \n     low-income households in this country have worst-case housing \n     needs--defined as spending over 50 percent of their income in \n     rent or living in substandard housing.\n\n\n                         international affairs\n\n       International Organizations and Peacekeeping Accounts. A \n     17-percent reduction to funds for the international \n     organizations and peacekeeping accounts would prevent the \n     United States from making its full assessed payments to the \n     UN and other international organizations that directly \n     promote vital U.S. interests. This would substantially \n     increase U.S. arrears to the UN and jeopardize the \n     negotiations for reforms that would lead to the payment of \n     approximately $800 million in arrears. This cut would also \n     cripple continuing and critical new peacekeeping missions \n     seeking to redress the instability and suffering caused by \n     conflicts in East Timor, Kosovo, and Africa.\n       African Development Foundation (ADF) and Inter-American \n     Foundation (IAF). The abolition of ADF and IAF would \n     eliminate the only U.S. Government institutions that work \n     exclusively with local, grassroots organizations in Africa \n     and Latin America to expand economic opportunities and \n     develop basic democratic values and institutions.\n\n\n                           science and space\n\n       Reduced Support for Basic Research. A reduction of about \n     $365 million to NSF would result in almost 14,000 fewer \n     researchers, educators, and students receiving NSF support--\n     affecting the high-tech workforce and well-trained students \n     needed for the Nation's future. A reduction of this magnitude \n     would result in over 3,000 fewer awards for state-of-the-art \n     research and education activities.\n\n\n                           natural resources\n\n       The Budget Resolution would cut farm loan programs at the \n     USDA, resulting in 800 fewer loans to American farmers and \n     ranchers.\n       EPA's Superfund program would be cut by $69 million. This \n     would eliminate funding for all 15 new federally-led cleanups \n     and five ongoing federally-led cleanups in FY 2001, \n     needlessly jeopardizing public health for citizens living \n     near affected sites and making it more difficult to meet the \n     900-site cleanup goal in 2002.\n       The cut to EPA's Enforcement Program assumed by the Budget \n     Resolution would significantly hamper the environmental cop \n     on the beat, jeopardizing our ability to assure adequate \n     protection of public health and the environment. Nearly, \n     1,000 fewer inspections could contribute to a higher non-\n     compliance rate and an increase in pollution.\n       The reduction assumed by the Budget Resolution to the \n     Children's Health Initiative would impair efforts to train \n     health care workers on the environmental control of asthma; \n     limit outreach programs to children, parents, and care-givers \n     on avoidance of second-hand smoke and other indoor allergens; \n     and, hinder critical research into the role that pesticides \n     and chemicals may play\n\n[[Page S2696]]\n\n     in the onset of asthma. In addition, EPA's lead program, \n     which focuses on enforcing lead regulations and community-\n     based programs that are aimed at reducing children's exposure \n     to lead, would be curtailed.\n       The Budget Resolution reduces most Interior Department and \n     Forest Service programs by six percent below the President's \n     request. Such a reduction would hinder Wildland fire \n     suppression and protection programs, delay or limit the \n     construction and rehabilitation of needed visitor facilities, \n     and diminish the ability to oversee coalmining operations and \n     the ability to assist States and Tribes in cleanup of almost \n     9,000 acres of abandoned mine lands.\n\n\n                                 health\n\n       Funding for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could be \n     cut by over $191 million. Such a reduction would result in \n     extended product review times for new vaccines, new food \n     additives, and complex emerging medical technology, making it \n     difficult for the FDA to meet congressionally-mandated \n     performance levels. This reduction would also impede FDA's \n     efforts to ensure the safety of the Nation's food supply and \n     would strain the agency's ability to respond to outbreaks of \n     food borne illness.\n       Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration \n     funding would be reduced by $305 million, which would deny \n     treatment to roughly 66,000 people who receive mental health \n     and substance abuse services.\n\n\n                             transportation\n\n       A reduction of four percent, or $21 million, below the \n     President's request of $521 million for Amtrak would \n     jeopardize Amtrak's ability to achieve self-sufficiency. The \n     recently announced route expansions would be postponed, and \n     the frequency and level of service on Amtrak's remaining \n     trains reduced. This will further reduce revenues, leading to \n     additional service reductions.\n\n\n                       administration of justice\n\n       The Budget Resolution rejects the President's $1.335 \n     billion request for the 21st Century Policing Initiative \n     (COPS). It does not appear to provide any funds for the \n     hiring of additional police officers, or for community crime \n     prevention programs, and it is well below the President's \n     request for law enforcement technology and gun prosecution. \n     Without continued funding for the COPS hiring program, it \n     will be impossible to meet the President's goal of funding up \n     to 150,000 additional officers by 2005.\n\n\n                           general government\n\n       IRS. The Budget Resolution assumes cuts in the IRS's \n     resources by $1.2 billion below the President's Budget--\n     nearly $0.8 billion below the level needed to maintain \n     current operations. The IRS would lose 12,000 workers needed \n     to provide service to taxpayers and to ensure that the tax \n     laws are enforced fairly. IRS modernization efforts mandated \n     by the 1998 Restructuring and Reform Act would be halted. \n     Instead of the improvements in performance proposed in the \n     President's budget, audit rates--which have already fallen by \n     half over the past decade--would drop to unacceptable levels. \n     Taxpayers would face greater frustration, and the Treasury \n     would lose billions of dollars in enforcement revenue. Such a \n     dramatic cut in both compliance efforts and taxpayer service \n     would put at risk the voluntary compliance system, which \n     collects over $1.7 trillion in revenue each year.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, before the majority leader leaves, I say \nrespectfully that we appreciate his efforts to try to move legislation \nalong. But I just want to make sure the record is clear. We were \ngenerous in offering the majority the opportunity to review our \namendments. There is no requirement, of course, that we do so.\n  I also say to the leader that I think if we had started the marriage \npenalty legislation Monday or Tuesday of this week, we would be \nfinished with it by now.\n  There may have been a lot of amendments offered, but the way we used \nto do things around here, we had lots and lots of amendments. In fact, \nthere were a number of occasions when we had well over 100 amendments \nwithout any restriction of who offered them or what the subject matter \nwas. And we completed the legislation.\n  I believe and predict if we go right to work on the marriage penalty \nlegislation on the Tuesday when we return, we will complete it within 2 \nor 3 days, at the very most; maybe even in 2 days.\n  I think the majority leader should allow us--I say this not in a \npejorative way; we don't need to be allowed in the true sense of the \nword--to have the Senate work its will the way we have done it for a \ncouple hundred years. I think he would be surprised at how much \nlegislation we could move.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is my hope that over the next week or \nearly the next week, I will be able to propose a list of amendments. I \nsuggest that would be kind of in the realm of what we can agree to.\n  We have been looking at these various amendments. Some of them are \nclearly not going to be acceptable, and they probably could be easily \ntabled. Even though they are not relevant, some of them are \nmeritorious. Our concern is, they have not been considered by the \nappropriate committee, whether it is Finance, or Agriculture. We are \nhesitant to have a vote on these and try to get Members to vote against \nthem when, in fact, they may eventually want to be for them in a \ndifferent forum.\n  I have an idea of how we might be able to work something out on this. \nI will have a suggestion on that before we come back a week from \nTuesday.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend I very much appreciate \nthat. But I remind the Senator that the underlying bill skipped the \ncommittee process and came directly to the floor. I believe we should \ndo as much as we can in the committee process. But the bill before us \ndidn't get a vote in committee.\n  Mr. LOTT. The marriage tax penalty bill was considered by the Finance \nCommittee, and we had amendments, including an alternative that was \noffered and seriously considered. The Moynihan alternative amendment \nhas a lot of credibility to it.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize to the Senator. Maybe he didn't understand me. \nI didn't speak properly. What I should have said is, the legislation we \nspent a lot of time on this week--namely, the gas tax proposal--avoided \nthe committee process.\n\n[[Page S2700]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, in December 1988, a few days before \nChristmas, a terrorist bomb exploded on Pan Am flight #103 over \nScotland. 270 people died--murdered is the more fitting word--including \n189 Americans. It was one of the worst terrorist attacks in history.\n  Next month, two Libyan suspects are scheduled to go on trial in the \nNetherlands for the bombing. These two Libyans are believed to have \nplanted the bomb, but there is widespread belief that the Libyan \ngovernment ordered the attack.\n  Though the United Nations has suspended sanctions on Libya since \nQadhafi saw fit to turn over the two suspects in the Pan Am 103 \nbombing, Libya has by no means been restored to the status of a \ncivilized nation. Libya is a rogue nation that has been an avowed enemy \nof the United States for three decades. (``The time has come for us to \ndeal America a strong slap on it's cool arrogant face,'' Qadhafi said \nin 1973--at the same time he ``nationalized'' all foreign oil \nconcessions in his country. ``Nationalized'' in this instance is a \ndressed-up word for outright thievery.)\n  So it is Qadhafi's regime that stands accused of the deliberate \nmurder of American servicemen in the 1986 La Belle discotheque bombing. \nThe same regime whose top officials have been convicted, in absentia, \nby French courts for bombing a French jetliner, killing 171 people, \nincluding seven Americans. The same regime that ordered the murder of \n189 Americans on Pan Am Flight 103--Americans from 22 states: New York, \nNew Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts, \nMichigan, Minnesota, Maryland, North Dakota, California, New Hampshire, \nColorado, West Virginia, Texas, Florida, Virginia, Kansas, Arkansas, \nRhode Island, and Washington D.C. Nearly half of America's states lost \none or more residents to the Libyan terrorists in that 1988 bombing of \nPan Am 103 over Scotland.\n  The mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, and all those children \nof the Pan Am 103 victims will never forget the horror but, \nunfortunately, the U.S. foreign policy establishment appears less \nconcerned with that history, hence the recent U.S. decision to \n``review'' the ban on American citizens' travel to Libya.\n  Mr. President, this resolution should remind the Administration of \nthe heinous crimes committed by the Libyan regime. It identifies \nLibya's continued refusal to accept responsibility for its role in \nthese acts. It calls on President Clinton to consult with Congress on \npolicy toward Libya--consultations that would include disclosing United \nNations documents containing assurances to the Qadhafi regime that it \nwould not be destabilized as a result of the trial in The Hague.\n  Most importantly, this resolution would emphasize the Sense of the \nSenate that all U.S. restrictions on Libya, including the travel ban, \nshould remain in place until all cases of Libyan terrorism against \nAmericans have been resolved, and until the Libyan government \ncooperates in bringing the murderers to justice.\n  A clear signal is needed to Qadhafi, and, apparently, to the Clinton \nAdministration--that the United States will not stand idly by when our \ncitizens are murdered.\n  If and when Libya apologizes and begins to make amends to all \nAmericans, then perhaps there can be talks. Not before.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2700-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE NEED FOR FUNDAMENTAL TAX REFORM\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Every April, Americans are reintroduced to the beauty of \nSpring by blooming tulips, green lawns, and the 5.5 million word \nfederal income tax code.\n  As every citizen wrestles with the complexity and incomprehensibility \nof the mammoth tax code to file his or her return by the April 15th \n(April 17th this year) annual deadline, there is virtually universal \nagreement that change is desperately needed. I believe that amending \nthe tax code is not enough. I believe that we must scrap the entire tax \ncode--it is too complicated, too burdensome, too unfair.\n  How complicated is the tax code? Here are some illustrative facts and \nfigures. The current federal income tax system was born in 1913 as a \nlaw under 100 pages in length. The original 1040 form covered two \npages, front and back. This included instructions. Today, the 1040 form \nhas 76 pages of instructions alone. The most basic tax form today, the \nEZ1040, has 33 pages of instructions.\n  The annotated tax code fills 14 volumes of some 11,700 pages, and it \ntakes an additional 19 volumes totaling another almost 11,750 pages to \ncontain the regulations governing the code. To implement the code, the \nInternal Revenue Service prints over 400 forms and more than 100 \npamphlets with instructions on how to complete these forms.\n  We need to focus our attention in Congress on developing a new tax \nsystem, and we need the President to support changing the current tax \ncode, instead of defending it from reform. Fundamental reform of the \ntax code is my number one tax priority and I believe a new federal tax \nsystem must be based on four principles: fairness, simplicity, \nuniformity and consistency.\n  My support for tax reform should not be interpreted as opposition to \nproviding tax relief to American families and working individuals who \nare sending more of their paycheck to the federal government in taxes \nthan at almost any point in our nation's history. I absolutely support \nallowing people to keep more of the money they earned, and am pleased \nthat the budget resolution adopted by Congress allows for a responsible \nreduction in taxes of $150 billion over the next 5 years, rather than \nthe $13 billion tax increase for next year that the Clinton-Gore \nAdministration proposed in their budget. The budget plan will allow \nCongress to consider several tax relief measures that not only reduce \nthe tax burden on Americans, but also make the tax code simpler and \nmore fair.\n  Congress has already passed legislation to repeal the Social Security \nEarnings Limit that penalized working seniors one dollar of Social \nSecurity benefits for every $3 they earn over the limit of $17,000. \nCongress is engaged in a debate to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. \nEliminating the estate, or death, tax is not only a priority of mine \nand many in Congress, it is a priority for small business owners and \nfamily farmers whose very existence is threatened by this disgraceful \ntax.\n  Americans deserve a tax code they can understand and predict. About \nthe only thing Americans can predict about the current tax code is that \nevery April they will likely be sending a big check off to Uncle Sam, \nand about the only thing they understand is that the IRS will find them \nif they do not. This must change and it is why I am working for a new \ntax system that is fair, simple, uniform and consistent. A new code \nbased on these four principles will free Americans from suffering \nthrough the forms and tax tables of April tax season, and allow them to \nenjoy the blossoms and sunshine of the April Spring season.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2700-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2700-S2706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE: OBSERVATIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, when the bombing ceased, and Serbian \nmilitary forces withdrew from the Kosovo province, most Americans \nbelieved that the end of the air war meant the end of the United \nStates' involvement in the Balkans. Such a misconception is due \nprimarily to the fact that the political and military situation in the \nBalkans, as well as U.S. foreign policy towards the region, remains \nlargely unknown to the vast majority of Americans.\n  Because of my belief that the Balkan region is key to our strategic \ninterests in Europe, earlier this year, I traveled to the Republic of \nCroatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo and \nBrussels, Belgium in order to examine the humanitarian, economic, \npolitical and security situation in Southeastern Europe. Today, I would \nlike to take this opportunity to share some of my observations with my \ncolleagues and the American people.\n  Before I proceed further, I would like to publicly thank U.S. \nAmbassador to Croatia, William Montgomery, U.S. Ambassador to \nMacedonia, Michael Einik, Chief of the U.S. Mission to\n\n[[Page S2701]]\n\nKosovo, Larry Rossin, U.S. Ambassador to NATO, Sandy Vershbow and U.S. \nAmbassador to the EU, Richard Morningstar. They are fine \nrepresentatives of our nation, and they are doing an outstanding job to \nhelp bring peace and stability to this sensitive part of the world.\n  I would also like to thank our U.S. embassy staff in Croatia, \nMacedonia, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the \nEuropean Union (EU). In addition, I would like to thank the personnel \nwho comprise the U.S. Mission in Kosovo, the Department of State, the \nDepartment of Defense, and the U.S. Army--especially Colonel Timothy \nPeterson, who accompanied me on this trip and also provided his \nvaluable insight and expertise on the region.\n  I would further like to thank Senator Fred Thompson, my chairman on \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, for giving me the opportunity and \nthe Committee authorization to take this trip.\n  Finally, I would like to thank our men and women in uniform who \nprovided such invaluable assistance during my travels in the region. \nThey have my gratitude, and I believe the gratitude of our nation \nshould go out to our peacekeeping force in Kosovo. We have a tremendous \nteam working on our behalf in the region, and all Americans should be \nproud of their tireless efforts to help promote peace and protect the \ninterests of the United States in southeastern Europe.\n  Mr. President, one of the more encouraging developments I observed in \nmy trip to the Balkans was a new positive spirit that seems to be \nemerging in a number of nations in the region.\n  In my visit to Croatia, I had the opportunity to meet with the newly-\nelected president of Croatia, Stipe Mesic.\n  President Mesic is a bright, engaging, well-spoken gentleman with a \ntremendous understanding of the varied and complex issues facing his \ncountry. More importantly, he has a clear concept--supported by his \nelectorate--of the direction his country should take for the future.\n  President Mesic is pleased that the region finally seems to have \nabandoned the two terrible ideas that have caused so much bloodshed \nover the last decade--the dream of a ``Greater Serbia'' and the dream \nof a ``Greater Croatia.'' In an indication of his commitment to ending \nthese disastrous notions, he expressed to me his support for sending \nindividuals responsible for war crimes that have taken place over the \nlast decade to the International Criminal Tribunal for prosecution.\n  He is also committed to fully returning to Croatia those refugees who \nwere displaced after conflict swept the nation in the 1990's. He \nunderstands that a functional economy, the establishment of private \nproperty rights and the rule of law are key to the return of these \nrefugees.\n  President Mesic appeared to understand that the future of \nsoutheastern Europe is linked to minority rights and that redrawing \ninternational boundaries along ethnic lines is fundamentally \nunworkable--we need only witness the ongoing debacle in Bosnia for such \nan example. With this realization on the need to consider minority \nrights, he plans on appealing to the best instincts in his people to \nput aside ethnic hatred, so that they and their nation may move ahead. \nHe has stated that he looks forward to serving as the President of all \nof the Croatian people, regardless of their ethnicity. If lines are not \ngoing to be redrawn, then a major hurdle to domestic peace in Croatia \nwill have been removed.\n  It is my understanding that Prime Minister Racan, who I did not have \nthe opportunity to meet since he was out of the country during my \nvisit, seems committed to these principles as well. I'm also encouraged \nthat Parliamentary President Zlatko Tomcic, Deputy Parliamentary \nPresident Zdravko Tomac, Serbian Member of Parliament Milan Djukic and \nSerbian Democratic Forum President Veljko Dzakula--all of whom I met in \nCroatia--appear to be supportive.\n  I was also pleased to meet with Macedonia's President Boris \nTrajkovski, the Macedonian Prime Minister, Ljubco Georgievski, and \nArben Xhaferi, the leader of Macedonia's ethnic Albanian community. \nThey seem to have been able to successfully bridge the domestic ethnic \nproblems that have been at the heart of the various conflicts that have \ndecimated southeastern Europe over the last ten years.\n  As many of my colleagues may recall, Macedonia was seen as another \npotential flashpoint during the course of the Kosovo bombing campaign \nas the Macedonian people became polarized either in favor, or against, \nNATO's actions. This possibility seems to have been successfully \naverted because Macedonians do not generally possess the same kind of \nethnic hatreds towards their minority community that have plagued other \nnations in the region.\n  Domestic peace and stability has been achieved in Macedonia by \nappealing to the best instincts in people, rather than the worst. The \nelected leadership has made it clear that the ethnic Albanian \ncommunity, which makes up roughly 25% to 30% of the population, is an \nintegral and respected component of society. Because of this, minority \nrights are, by and large, protected, and the rule of law is, for the \nmost part, very well respected. The importance of these trends cannot \nbe understated.\n  I was particularly interested to hear President Trajkovski discuss \nthe amazing recovery of Macedonia's economy. When the nation separated \nfrom the FRY in 1991, Macedonia's per capita income immediately started \nsliding downward, dropping 40 percent. This decline was clearly \nexacerbated by the Kosovo bombing campaign.\n  Nevertheless, in recent months, the economy has staged a dramatic \nturnaround because of stable and progressive leadership, market reforms \nand economic activity as a result of Macedonia's serving as a staging \npoint for KFOR. Macedonia is beginning the slow process of returning to \nits pre-independence level of economic activity. More importantly, the \nEU, as a part of its new focus on the Balkans region, has established a \nrelationship with Macedonia intended to lead to its eventual membership \nin the European Union, a commitment that had never been made before the \nKosovo war. Given my belief that integration of the nations of the \nregion into the broader European community is essential to long-term \npeace and stability, this is a dramatic development.\n  At the headquarters of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) \nin Pristina, Kosovo, I had the opportunity to sit down and meet with \nseveral key leaders of the Kosovo Albanian community and \nrepresentatives on the Interim Administrative Council--Dr. Ibrahim \nRugova, Mr. Hashim Thaci and Dr. Rexhep Qosja. This was an \nextraordinary meeting given the historical animosity between these \nleaders.\n  All three leaders made a very clear promise to me that they were \ncommitted to a multi-ethnic, democratic Kosovo, one that would respect \nthe rights of all ethnic minorities. I was heartened to hear these \ncomments. This commitment could serve as the basis for long-term peace \nand stability in Kosovo.\n  In response, I said that they could go down in history as truly great \nmen were they to make this commitment a reality. I explained that the \nhistoric cycle of revenge in Kosovo must end and minority rights must \nbe respected--including the sanctity of churches and monasteries. This \nwould be the key to the future of Kosovo.\n  I traveled to Brussels to make my feelings known to the leadership of \nthe European Union (EU) regarding their lack of leadership and \ncommitment to the problems facing southeastern Europe. I met with U.S. \nAmbassador to the EU, Richard Morningstar and U.S. Ambassador to NATO, \nAlexander Vershbow and with other leaders of NATO and the EU. I was \npleasantly surprised to learn that the Europeans basically ``get it.'' \nThat is, they understand that unless the Balkan region is fully \nintegrated into the broader European community, the region will \n``Balkanize Europe.'' This is the same message I have been saying for \nmonths. I was pleased to see the Europeans taking the necessary steps \nthat will eventually include the nations of the region in the EU and \nNATO.\n  I think it is important to highlight the level of support the \nEuropeans are providing the region. They have budgeted six billion \neuros (basically $6 billion) over the next six years to help bring \nRomania and Bulgaria into the EU. They have also prepared to provide\n\n[[Page S2702]]\n\n5.5 billion euros (again, roughly $5.5 billion) over the same time \nperiod to implement the three initiatives of the Stability Pact--\ndemocratization, security, and regional infrastructure development.\n  Of the total financial support committed to Kosovo by the \ninternational community, including humanitarian, development, economic \nrecovery and reconstruction assistance, the EU has pledged 35.5 \npercent. The U.S. has pledged 15.4 percent.\n  Of the total amount pledged for the operations of UNMIK, the EU has \npledged 41.4 percent, the U.S. 13.2 percent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a document detailing these burden-\nsharing numbers be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. We need to understand that while the Europeans are \nhandling the bulk of the spending in the region, we must also be \nwilling to come to the table to provide leadership. The importance of \nthe United States to provide leadership was underscored by members of \nNATO and the EU, particularly those countries benefitting from the \nStability Pact.\n  One of the highlights of my trip was the opportunity I had to spend \ntime with our troops in Macedonia and Kosovo. There are few things that \nmake me more proud of being an American than seeing the pride, \nprofessionalism, sense of duty and commitment in the faces of our young \npeople in uniform.\n  I was especially happy to spend time with the 321st Psychological \nOperations Company, Task Force Falcon, which was deployed from Ohio and \nstationed at Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo. It gave me the chance to \ninteract with these fine men and women from Ohio and hear their views \non their mission in Kosovo. It also gave me the opportunity to visit \nwith my friend, Major Wendell Bugg, whom I've known since my days as \nGovernor. He is with the 321st and is doing a wonderful job. It was \ngreat to see him and get reacquainted.\n  And, Mr. President, I can't forget the unsung heroes of Kosovo--the \nmen and women of the various humanitarian missions. I had the \nopportunity to meet with representatives from all of the major \nhumanitarian aid organizations involved in Kosovo and Macedonia. I \ntruly admire the service these people provide their fellow man. They \nare on the front lines daily, helping people, making a difference. To \nall of them I say, keep up the good work. Their efforts are key to \nstability in southeastern Europe and in responding to basic human \nneeds.\n  While I encountered many encouraging prospects for regional peace and \nprosperity during my trip, I also identified a number of challenges the \nregion and the international community are facing.\n  While there is ample reason to be optimistic about the future of \nCroatia under the leadership of President Mesic and Prime Minister \nRacan, there are also reasons to be concerned. The Croatian economy has \nbeen struggling for years. Unemployment and inflation rates are high. \nThe country is deep in debt internationally. Many skilled, well-\neducated young people have left the country for better job prospects \nelsewhere. This has effectively created a ``brain drain,'' which, \nunless it is stemmed, will have a negative impact for decades. For \nCroatia to continue on its new path, away from its nationalist past, \nthe economy must improve. If a solid market economy cannot take hold, \nthere is a very real possibility that the Croatian people will grow \nimpatient with President Mesic and Prime Minister Racan and seek to \nreplace them; possibly with individuals who would rule the country \nunder nationalist communist ideology.\n  The other problem facing the Croatian economy is in the area of \nrefugee returns. As my colleagues may know, the majority of the \ncivilians forced out of their homes during the conflicts of the early \n1990's still have not returned to their homes. Even as President Mesic \nworks to implement his campaign commitment to create a legal \nenvironment where minority rights are protected, people will not return \nto their homes--if their home still exists--if there is no work for \nthem when they return. Thus, Croatia's struggling economy does impact \nand will continue to impact the entire region.\n  Current trends in Macedonia suggest the existence of an extremist \nelement within the ethnic Albanian community. These individuals are \nwilling to resort to violence in order to destabilize the sitting \ndemocratically-elected government of Macedonia, and put in its place a \ngovernment run by Albanians, for Albanians. These extremists are \nbeginning to make their presence felt with the government in Macedonia. \nIt will take a tremendous commitment on the part of the current \ngovernment to maintain a democratic, multi-ethnic form of government in \nMacedonia in the face of this threat.\n  A major impediment to peace and prosperity in southeastern Europe is \nthe rise in organized crime. There have been a number of recent reports \nindicating that the Balkans region is being used more and more \nfrequently as a transshipment point for illegal narcotics and arms. \nThese reports were echoed by nearly everyone I spoke with on the trip. \nWith this illicit trade comes violence, corruption, a lack of foreign \ninvestment and general societal havoc. As the nations of the region \nwork to establish the rule of law, a functional judicial system and \nprosperous economies, I believe America and European nations must offer \ntheir crime-fighting expertise in order to help the Balkan nations \nshape their own future and steer clear from the menace of organized \ncrime.\n  A tremendous concern that Dr. Bernard Kouchner, civilian head of the \nUNMIK operation, brought to the forefront was that the international \ncommunity must be more active in their dispersal of aid-money pledged \nto the region, and in particular, the EU needed to be a more active \nparticipant in this area. Indeed, the EU has only dispersed 13.3 \npercent of the money they have pledged to UNMIK thus far. The EU has a \nnumber of strong arguments to explain their delay, including the nature \nof their fiscal cycle, the various mechanisms in place to prevent fraud \nand abuse, the unwieldy nature of the body, etc. Regardless, the fact \nis that the money has to be put on the table. As I mentioned before, \nthe U.S. is doing its fair share given the role we played during the \ncourse of the bombing campaign. Now is the time for the Europeans to do \ntheirs.\n  Throughout my trip to the Balkans, all signs pointed to the fact that \nthe Stability Pact was not being implemented to the benefit of the \nregion.\n  I believe that the Stability Pact represents one of the few good \nthings that resulted from the Kosovo bombing campaign. Under the \nStability Pact, the Europeans, with the leadership of the Germans and \nthe French, agreed to work towards the gradual integration of the \nnations of southeastern Europe into the broader European community. In \npractice, this means EU and NATO membership. In exchange, the nations \nof the Balkan region must agree to put aside the ethnic divisions and \nnationalism that has caused so much death and destruction in recent \nyears. This compact, if implemented, would be a gigantic leap forward.\n  Unfortunately, so far, not much has happened with the Pact. Meetings \nand conferences between government bureaucrats have been held. There \nhave been a lot of speeches, studies, conversations, debates, and the \nlike, but nothing has really happened ``on the ground'' in the region. \nI believe the Pact must move ahead with infrastructure projects that \nbenefit the economies of the region. Start building bridges. Start \ncleaning the Danube River. Start building ``Corridor Eight,'' which \nwill create an East-West railway/roadway travel corridor to stimulate \ncommerce. Just start doing something!\n  I am somewhat heartened by the results of the Stability Pact \nconference in Brussels 2 weeks ago. There, 4 dozen countries and 3 \ndozen organizations pledged 2.4 billion Euros to fully-finance a 1.8 \nbillion Euro ``Quick Start'' package of regional economic development \nand infrastructure projects and initiatives in southeast Europe over \nthe next twelve months. I believe this commitment represents one of the \nfirst positive steps that has been taken since the end of the air war \ntowards restoring peace and stability to the region.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record at \nthe\n\n[[Page S2703]]\n\nend of my remarks a statement that was made by the Honorable Nadezhda \nMihailova, Foreign Minister of the Republic of Bulgaria, regarding \nBulgaria's perspective on southeastern Europe prior to the Stability \nPact Conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. The deeds of the Kosovar Albanians are not matching \nthe rhetoric of the Albanian leadership. As recent press reports have \nmade clear, NATO is facing another potential crisis in Kosovo. \nExtremist members of the ethnic Albanian community--some have argued \nunder the direction of Hashim Thaci--have refused to put down their \narms, put aside their desire for revenge against the Serbs, and work \ntowards peace. Rather, they are intent on pushing the Serbs, with \nbombings, assassinations, threats, etc. to force a response from \nSlobodan Milosevic in Belgrade. Today, Kosovo Serbs are being killed, \ntheir monasteries are being burned, and they are afraid to leave their \nhomes. This is not KFOR's fault. This is not UNMIK's fault. Radical \nelements within the Kosovo Albanian community are responsible for \ncontinued attacks against the dwindling Serb community in Kosovo. I am \nconcerned that many in the Kosovo Albanian community want to force \nanother confrontation between NATO and Milosevic so Kosovo can finally \nbe rid of the Serb community and establish itself as an independent \nnation.\n  Let me be clear. The same group our State Department once called a \nterrorist organization--the KLA--whom we embraced as our friends and \nallies when NATO was bombing, are again becoming terrorists. They are \nworking against the healing of Kosovo. Our message must be clear to \nThaci, Rugova, Qosja and their Kosovo Albanian followers--stop this \nviolence against the Serb community or the U.S. will pull out our \ntroops. I said this directly to Thaci, Rugova and Qosja when I met \nthem. As much as I want southeast Europe, including Kosovo and Serbia, \nto be integrated into the European community, I will work against it if \nthe cycle of violence continues. The Kosovo Albanians have a historic \nopportunity to choose between two very different paths for the future--\nintegration or continued isolation. The choice is theirs to make and \nthe world will be watching.\n  Let me now turn to the Kosovo Serbs. They have suffered a great deal \nsince the end of the Kosovo bombing campaign at the hands of certain \nelements within the Albanian community seeking revenge. However, the \nKosovo Serbs' continued refusal to participate in UNMIK's Interim \nAdministrative Council is unacceptable. I took the same message I made \nto the Albanians to the Serbs--stop the cycle of violence and move \nahead towards reconciliation.\n  Decisions are going to be made regarding the future of Kosovo with or \nwithout Serbian participation. It is in their best interest to become \ninvolved. I am somewhat heartened that Bishop Artemjie's visit to the \nU.S. has prompted some progress towards getting the Kosovo Serbs to \nparticipate in the Interim Administrative Council. I understand that as \na result of his visit, discussions are taking place that would allow \nthe development of several media outlets within Kosovo. I am hopeful \nthat this will serve as the impetus to get the Serb community in Kosovo \ninvolved in the Interim Administrative Council. It will require \ndiligence and co-operation on a multi-ethnic approach, but I believe it \nwill ultimately serve to draw the whole of Kosovo society together and \nstop the killing and violence and fear for life, limb and property that \npermeates the minority community in Kosovo.\n  Meanwhile, NATO continues to struggle with Milosevic's meddling hands \nin Kosovo. He has a group of extremist Kosovo Serbs, mainly situated \naround Mitrovica, agitating the situation in Kosovo whenever possible \nin an effort to encourage NATO to pack up and go home. He must not \nsucceed. NATO must stand strong and refuse to accept any more \nprovocations. They should seize illegal weapons and jail law-breakers \nand agitators. NATO forces should take the enemies of peace off the \nstreets and shut-down the extremists of both sides. De-fusing the \nsituation will lower tensions and allow the mainstream people of Kosovo \nto move forward with their future.\n  Last month, I introduced S. Res. 272 which I believe effectively \naddresses this issue, and many more. On Milosevic, the Resolution makes \nit clear that he continues to be the heart of the problem in the \nregion. In order to encourage democratic change, the Resolution:\n  Expresses the readiness of the Senate, once there is a democratic \ngovernment in Serbia, to review conditions for Serbia's full \nreintegration into the international community;\n  Expresses its readiness to assist a future democratic government in \nSerbia to build a democratic, peaceful, and prosperous society, based \non the same principle of respect for international obligations, as set \nout by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \nand the United Nations, which guide the relations of the United States \nwith other countries in southeastern Europe; and\n  Calls upon the United States and other Western democracies to \npublicly announce and demonstrate to the Serbian people the magnitude \nof assistance they could expect after democratization.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of S. Res. 272 be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the NATO KFOR troops are in Kosovo to \nprovide a secure environment for all citizens while civic institutions \ndevelop. The UNMIK structure, which I will address momentarily, has \nbeen charged with this civic development--this nation building. One of \nthe key elements in this process is the establishment of a functional \njudicial system, including a functional police force. It is hoped that \nonce properly trained, this police force will eventually take the \nresponsibility for domestic law enforcement from the KFOR troops.\n  The international community has promised to supply 4,433 police for \nthis UN force in Kosovo. Our European friends have committed the bulk \nof this total. However, only 2,359 police are in place in Kosovo. This \nis appalling.\n  As a rule, our European allies have national police systems rather \nthan state or provincial police forces like we do in the U.S. This \nmatters because it gives the national governments--governments that \nhave promised to put their police in Kosovo to serve in the UN body--\nthe ability to simply direct redeployments to meet their commitments. \nThis lack of will and action is truly appalling. To provide context, I \nthink it is important to note that we have had to recruit the American \nmen and women serving with the UN in Kosovo from our state and local \npolice departments. The best information I have shows that we have put \n481 people, out of our total commitment of 550, in place in Kosovo. If \nwe can meet our promises through recruitment, surely our European \nfriends can meet theirs through directives.\n  This all matters because the sooner the UN police force and a \njudicial system is operational in Kosovo, the sooner our troops can \ncome home.\n  One of the issues hardly considered when NATO became involved in \nKosovo was the development of an end game. Well, now we know why. We \nare, in fact, building a nation. I understand no one is willing to say \nthis publicly but we need to be truthful: the international community--\nusing UNMIK as its tool on the ground--is building a new nation in \nKosovo. It's all-encompassing. From schools, to roads, to power grids, \nto taxation, to local elections, to municipal councils, to the judicial \nsystem--it is all now our responsibility because we won the war.\n  In conclusion, I would like to address those cynics who believe we \nshould immediately pull out of Kosovo and the Balkans because they \nbelieve we will never successfully bring about peace in the region. \nThese cynics often point to the historical hatred between the ethnic \ngroups in the region as an indication that NATO and the UN are doomed \nto fail. I disagree. We can make a difference and history supports my \nview.\n  Consider the centuries of animosity and hatred between the nations of \nwestern Europe. Few would have thought that the bitter adversaries at \nthe heart of two world wars last century could be looking to a new \ncentury\n\n[[Page S2704]]\n\nwhere borders are crossed without passports, where there is freedom of \nlabor movement, and where there is no military presence on the borders. \nIt happened because the nations of western Europe were willing to put \naside centuries of hatred, revenge and ethnic prejudice and break the \ncycle of violence. If it could happen there, it can happen in southeast \nEurope.\n  One of the Beatitudes states that ``blessed are the peacemakers, for \nthey shall be called the children of God'' (Matthew 5:9). With these \nwords in mind, our efforts must be redoubled so that we may help bring \npeace, stability and prosperity to southeastern Europe.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                      Southeastern Europe Funding\n\n     Southeastern Europe (includes humanitarian, development, \n         economic recovery and reconstruction assistance--\n         military, security and assessed expenditures are not \n         included)\n       The international community, led by the United States, the \n     European Union and international financial institutions, has \n     pledged $4.033 billion in support for southeastern Europe for \n     the year 2000.

Nadezhda Mihailova, Foreign Minister of the Republic \n                              of Bulgaria\n\n       As the United States discusses assistance to Southeastern \n     Europe prior to the Stability Pact financing conference in \n     Brussels on March 29-30, 2000, I believe it is important to \n     provide you with the Bulgarian perspective.\n       Before I speak to the contributions Bulgaria will make to \n     peace and security in Southeast Europe, let me tell you a \n     little about the distance Bulgaria has traveled since 1989.\n       In 1989, Bulgaria shared the plight of all the former \n     Warsaw Pact countries. My generation inherited a country \n     without democratic institutions, without the basic mechanisms \n     of a market economy, and without a balance of political power \n     based on trust between the citizens of Bulgaria and their \n     government. Indeed, we had only two assets that proved to be \n     of value: Bulgaria's 1300-year history as a state deeply \n     involved in the history of Europe and a highly self-confident \n     and self-reliant population.\n       Many of those who were committed to rebuilding a Bulgarian \n     democracy, myself included, spent the early years of the \n     1990's in Europe and the United States refining our political \n     thinking. I myself benefited from the National Endowment for \n     Democracy (NED) established by Congress to fan the flames of \n     freedom and in 1991-92, I specialized in foreign policy and \n     public relations in the US Congress and Harvard University.\n       By 1996 Peter Stoyanov was elected President. Bulgaria had \n     begun to turn the corner in its transition to a market \n     economy and the election of Prime Minister Kostov and his \n     Government gave a strong impetus to this process. A new \n     generation of Bulgarians was ready to begin our drive for \n     full integration (actually re-integration) into the \n     institutions of the Euro-Atlantic community.\n       In the few short years in which I have been fortunate to \n     serve as Foreign Minister, Bulgaria has been identified as \n     one of the most qualified candidates under consideration for \n     NATO membership. We have been invited by the European Union \n     to begin accession negotiations on full membership and we \n     allied ourselves with other democracies in resisting the \n     depredations of Milosevic during the Kosovo War. Today, the \n     values of freedom and democracy and the commitment to Euro-\n     Atlantic cooperation form the foundation of our foreign \n     policy. Our country is firmly dedicated to progressive but \n     prompt integration into the European community.\n       I can state with considerable pride that Bulgaria has made \n     great progress in the establishment of a robust and permanent \n     pluralistic democracy and in building the structures to \n     support a modern market economy. On the political side, we \n     have reestablished institutions that guarantee democracy, the \n     rule of law, human rights, and ensure respect for and \n     protection of minorities. On the economic side, Bulgaria has \n     concentrated its efforts on the consolidation of market \n     reforms, the acceleration of privatization, and the juridical \n     measures a functioning market economy requires to operate \n     openly and transparently.\n       These reforms have already produced significant improvement \n     in the macroeconomic situation in Bulgaria. In 1998, we had a \n     remarkably low annual inflation rate of 1%, after a horrible \n     578.6% in 1997. In 1999, the inflation rate increased to 6.2% \n     mainly due to the obstruction of the Danube River, which \n     damaged our trade relations with Europe. In 1998-99 our \n     budget deficit was almost zero and we achieved a 3% growth in \n     GDP. Additionally, the government maintains a high-level of \n     hard currency reserves accounting for more than 30% of GDP.\n       We have completed the difficult task of liquidating state \n     enterprises and banks undergoing losses. Privatization of \n     Bulgaria's largest companies is nearly complete. My country \n     has also begun to apply the rules of the European Monetary \n     Union and the use of the Euro-currency. The European Union \n     accession process will provide the Bulgarian economy a \n     further impetus for development. The full introduction of \n     European rules and practices in this rapidly growing emerging \n     market should make Bulgaria very attractive for foreign \n     investment. At the same time, by expanding its borders to \n     include Bulgaria, the EU will come closer to regions, rich in \n     natural resources and of great economic potential, with which \n     Bulgaria has traditional economic ties.\n       In the foreign policy arena, Bulgaria has clearly and \n     consistently defined its strategic goals. NATO membership, \n     accession to the European Union, and dedication to lasting \n     political stabilization for Southeastern Europe. After years \n     of political legal, social and economic reform, our country \n     began official negotiations with the EU last month. Full \n     membership into the European Union is a strategic goal that \n     enjoys wide support throughout Bulgarian society. The long \n     cherished aspirations of the Bulgarian people for sharing \n     the identity and the political future of a united Europe \n     will be substantially advanced by our accession in the EU. \n     But this step alone is insufficient.\n       Bulgaria's aspiration to join the European Union and NATO \n     are motivated not only by its own economic interests and \n     security reasons, but also by the desire to help strengthen \n     the Euro-Atlantic community by promoting democracy throughout \n     all the nations of Southeast Europe. Thus, Bulgaria's long-\n     term foreign policy interests can only be served by joining \n     with its neighbors in the effort to consolidate regional \n     stability and security.\n       We believe that a safe and prosperous home can be built \n     only in a safe and prosperous neighborhood.\n       Thus, only primary foreign policy goals in Southeast Europe \n     are to:\n       Develop bilateral relations with all countries of the \n     region based on a shared commitment to democratic values and \n     human rights;\n       Mobilize and accelerate regional economic development \n     through joint infrastructure projects, trade and investment \n     encouragement, etc.;\n       Expand the scope of arms control, and support other \n     measures for strengthening confidence and security;\n       Implement bilateral and multilateral measures for \n     restricting new security risks, including regional programs \n     aimed at combating transborder crime;\n\n[[Page S2705]]\n\n       Play an active role in implementing the goals of the \n     Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe.\n       A defining principle of Bulgaria's foreign policy with its \n     neighbors has been to address and resolve contentious issues \n     in pursuit of balanced bilateral relations. This bold \n     approach has recently led to the resolution of some of the \n     region's diplomatic divisions. Successes include re-opening \n     relations between Bulgaria and the Republic of Macedonia \n     (Bulgaria strongly supports Macedonia and as you know, was \n     the first country in the world to recognize Macedonia) and \n     the resolution of all disputed issues and development of \n     equally friendly relations with Greece and Turkey. In \n     addition, just last month, Bulgaria and Romania reached \n     agreement on building a second bridge on the Danube River \n     between Vidin and Kalafat. This agreement, I would argue, \n     highlights the important strategic role Bulgaria can play in \n     the context of regional political and economic stabilization \n     as well as promoting the integration of Southeast Europe into \n     the Euro-Atlantic community.\n       As an illustration of our efforts to enhance regional \n     cooperation, Prime Minister Ivan Kostov organized a meeting \n     in January with the Prime Ministers of the countries \n     bordering the Former Republic of Yugoslavia. The basic goal \n     of this meeting was to encourage broad discussion on how to \n     pursue joint stabilization efforts. We also sought to send a \n     clear message to the international community reflecting the \n     view of these Southeastern European leaders.\n       Only a few weeks ago the first trilateral meeting of the \n     foreign ministers of Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece took place \n     that was generally estimated as a new step in building new \n     patterns of relations in the region.\n       In addition, last month, Bulgaria joined six other nations \n     in signing a 21-point charter to further democratic and \n     economic development in the region. We pledged to support \n     good neighborly relations, stability, security, and \n     cooperation in Southeast Europe.\n       The United States does not need to be reminded that without \n     Hungary, Romania, Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria working \n     together, the containment of Serbian aggression and the \n     eventual democratization of all of the Balkans will be \n     impossible.\n       President Clinton's visit to Sofia last year and numerous \n     conversations I have had with Lord Robertson and General \n     Clark, serve to reinforce the role Bulgaria has played in \n     developing and promoting multilateral cooperation in \n     Southeast Europe and in standing firm with NATO during the \n     Kosovo crisis. It is because of our past contributions and \n     the pivotal role we can play in the region that the Bulgarian \n     city of Plovdiv was chosen as the headquarters of the newly \n     established Multinational Peace-keeping Forces in Southeast \n     Europe.\n       Events in Serbia and Kosovo last year, however, adversely \n     affected the economics of the region. We suffered direct \n     losses in trade as a result of transportation difficulties \n     and foreign investment in Bulgaria declined because the \n     neighborhood was, and still is to some degree, perceived \n     as unsafe and unreliable for foreign investors.\n       Bulgaria's view for the future of Southeast Europe is for \n     the region to transform into a source of economic growth and \n     an active link between Western Europe and the adjacent area \n     to the northeast and southeast, whose strategic importance \n     will continue to increase in this century. This vision is \n     based, among other things, on the understanding that the \n     region has an important place in the overall geopolitical \n     architecture of Europe.\n       The present level of interdependence among countries and \n     the status of Southeast Europe's political and economic \n     development directly impacts the entire European continent. \n     In addition, security and stability in the region represents \n     an important element of the European security architecture, \n     and therefore is of strategic importance to the US.\n       That is precisely the reason why we are strongly encouraged \n     by the growing involvement of the Euro-Atlantic community \n     with the issues expressed in the Stability Pact promotion of \n     security, democracy and economic development in the Balkans. \n     This engagement marks the beginning of an approach that is \n     fundamentally different from the past. It does not mean \n     temporary crisis-management measures, but rather a move \n     beyond this to a comprehensive effort to find a common \n     concept for development of the region and its full \n     integration into the Euro-Atlantic community.\n       Now is the time--nearly one year after the crisis in \n     Kosovo--to turn the financial commitments made by the \n     European Union into reality. We seek the support and \n     leadership of the international community, and particularly \n     the United States to transform the Stability Pact's long-term \n     vision for ``integrating the Balkans into Europe'' into a \n     concrete policy, with structured benchmarks backed by \n     financial resources. The goal should not only be to \n     neutralize the immediate consequences of the Kosovo crisis, \n     but also to find solutions to the problems of economic \n     development in the region as a whole. Cooperation and full \n     integration of the region with a prospering and democratic \n     Europe can be achieved only through integration on all \n     fronts--political, economic, and financial. However, it is \n     impossible to expect quick developments if no money comes to \n     the region. We believe that funds should be devoted to long-\n     term regional goals like transportation routes, \n     infrastructure development, and improving specific \n     institutions that can facilitate the links between the \n     countries, such as customs operations, drug control and \n     combating corruption.\n     Our key priorities for Stability Pact assistance include:\n       1. Construction of the Trans-European Transport Corridor \n     #4. This project will connect Central Europe with Bulgaria \n     and Macedonia and includes construction of a second bridge \n     over the Danube at Vidin-Calafat. The bridge will replace the \n     ferry, decreasing travel time and eliminating the need to \n     load and unload cargo. The project also includes construction \n     of road and railway approaches, as well as border and customs \n     infrastructure. The budget for the bridge is estimated to be \n     US $177 million. Included in this cost are road connections \n     to the bridge from Romania and Bulgaria. The project is \n     expected to take 3\\1/2\\ years.\n       2. Construction of a regional section of Trans-European \n     Transport Corridor #8. This project, estimated at US$10 \n     million, involves construction of a 2.5-km railway connecting \n     Gyueshevo, Bulgaria with the Macedonian border. This project \n     will greatly improve the capacity of Trans-European Corridor \n     #8. Project coordinators can make use of the partially \n     installed track, and will need to construct a ballast prism, \n     lay additional rails, complete and install electrification of \n     a 500-meter tunnel, and improve border railway station and \n     facilities. US $1.1 million has already been invested to \n     modernize Gyueshevo station, which started in the second \n     quarter of 1998.\n       Completion of a new railroad between Beliakovitsa, \n     Macedonia and the Bulgarian border is critical for effective \n     functioning of the transportation corridor and requires an \n     additional investment of US $220 million.\n       Reconstruction of the railway track between Radomir and \n     Gyueshevo in Bulgaria is also necessary. This project \n     includes laying electrical lines on 88 km of railway to \n     increase maximum train speed from 65-75 to 160 km/h. It will \n     cost US $93 million and is expected to take three years.\n       3. Pipeline for light fuels. US $40 million is needed to \n     construct a 110-km pipeline from Thtiman, Bulgaria to \n     Koumanova, Macedonia. This project also includes construction \n     of petrol depot in Kriva Palanka or Koumanova.\n       4. Increased electrification of the railway between \n     Karnobat and Sindel, Bulgaria. This project includes \n     reconstruction and expansion of electrification along an \n     existing 123-km railway line in order to increase \n     transmission capacity and allow a maximum speed of 130 km/hr. \n     Estimated cost of this project is US $125 million, of which \n     US $38 million has already been spent. Additional funds would \n     allow the project, part of Transport Corridor #8, to continue \n     immediately.\n       5. Construction of an Information Center for Democratic \n     Development for Southeastern Europe. The Center will \n     contribute to the development and strengthening of democracy \n     in the region by deepening the process of reform and building \n     an atmosphere of confidence and understanding. It will also \n     help prevent new crises and conflicts in the region. The \n     center will be directly involved in the process of \n     Yugoslavia's democratization, as well as the search for \n     solutions to the lasting political and economic effects of \n     the Kosovo crisis. Active NGO participation from the region \n     will be key to realization of the Center's potential.\n       I cannot state strongly enough how critical U.S. leadership \n     is at this time to ensure that the Stability Pact goals turn \n     into action. U.S. Congressional commitment, along with a \n     renewed commitment by the Administration, to support and \n     encourage Europe to honor her financial commitments is vital \n     to the success of the Stability Pact. Continued U.S. \n     assistance through OPIC, EXIM and TDA is also crucial for \n     stimulating foreign investment increased trade and \n     implementation of infrastructure projects.\n       Finally, I would like to express my personal gratitude and \n     that of the Republic of Bulgaria to the United States and \n     particularly the U.S. Congress, for providing essential \n     economic, political, and military assistance to Bulgaria and \n     the other Balkan nations throughout the Kosovo conflict and \n     beyond. The active support of the United states continues to \n     be the indispensable condition for economic recovery of \n     Southeast Europe and the completion of its long journey \n     towards democracy. I cannot tell you how important it is for \n     the United States to remain committed to your allies in this \n     critical and dynamic region of the Euro-Atlantic community.\n       Thank you.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n                              S. Res. 272\n\n       Whereas the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) \n     March 24, 1999 through June 10, 1999 bombing of the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia focused the attention of the \n     international community on southeastern Europe;\n       Whereas the international community, in particular the \n     United States and the European Union, made a commitment at \n     the conclusion of the bombing campaign to integrate \n     southeastern Europe into the broader European community;\n       Whereas there is an historic opportunity for the \n     international community to help the people of southeastern \n     Europe break the cycle of violence, retribution, and revenge \n     and move towards respect for minority rights, establishment \n     of the rule of law, and the further development of democratic \n     governments;\n\n[[Page S2706]]\n\n       Whereas the Stability Pact was established in July 1999 \n     with the goal of promoting cooperation among the countries of \n     southeastern Europe, with a focus on long-term political \n     stability and peace, security, democratization, and economic \n     reconstruction and development;\n       Whereas the effective implementation of the Stability Pact \n     is important to the long-term peace and stability in the \n     region;\n       Whereas the people and Government of the Former Yugoslav \n     Republic of Macedonia have a positive record of respect for \n     minority rights, the rule of law, and democratic traditions \n     since independence;\n       Whereas the people of Croatia have recently elected leaders \n     that respect minority rights, the rule of law, and democratic \n     traditions;\n       Whereas positive developments in the Former Yugoslav \n     Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Croatia will \n     clearly indicate to the people of Serbia that economic \n     progress and integration into the international community is \n     only possible if Milosevic is removed from power; and\n       Whereas the Republic of Slovenia continues to serve as a \n     model for the region as it moves closer to European Union and \n     NATO membership: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) welcomes the tide of democratic change in southeastern \n     Europe, particularly the free and fair elections in Croatia, \n     and the regional cooperation taking place under the umbrella \n     of the Stability Pact;\n       (2) recognizes that in this trend, the regime of Slobodan \n     Milosevic is ever more an anomaly, the only government in the \n     region not democratically elected, and an obstacle to peace \n     and neighborly relations in the region;\n       (3) expresses its sense that the United States cannot have \n     normal relations with Belgrade as long as the Milosevic \n     regime is in power;\n       (4) views Slobodan Milosevic as a brutal indicted war \n     criminal, responsible for immeasurable bloodshed, ethnic \n     hatred, and human rights abuses in southeastern Europe in \n     recent years;\n       (5) considers international sanctions an essential tool to \n     isolate the Milosevic regime and promote democracy, and urges \n     the Administration to intensify, focus, and expand those \n     sanctions that most effectively target the regime and its key \n     supporters;\n       (6) supports strongly the efforts of the Serbian people to \n     establish a democratic government and endorses their call for \n     early, free, and fair elections;\n       (7) looks forward to establishing a normal relationship \n     with a new democratic government in Serbia, which will permit \n     an end to Belgrade's isolation and the opportunity to restore \n     the historically friendly relations between the Serbian and \n     American people;\n       (8) expresses the readiness of the Senate, once there is a \n     democratic government in Serbia, to review conditions for \n     Serbia's full reintegration into the international community;\n       (9) expresses its readiness to assist a future democratic \n     government in Serbia to build a democratic, peaceful, and \n     prosperous society, based on the same principle of respect \n     for international obligations, as set out by the Organization \n     for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the United \n     Nations, which guide the relations of the United States with \n     other countries in southeastern Europe;\n       (10) calls upon the United States and other Western \n     democracies to publicly announce and demonstrate to the \n     Serbian people the magnitude of assistance they could expect \n     after democratization; and\n       (11) recognizes the progress in democratic and market \n     reform made by Montenegro, which can serve as a model for \n     Serbia, and urges a peaceful resolution of political \n     differences over the abrogation of Montenegro's rights under \n     the federal constitution.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2706-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    THE JUVENILE JUSTICE CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the majority \ncontinues to refuse to reconvene the conference on juvenile justice \nlegislation.\n  This Congress has kept the country waiting far too long for action on \njuvenile justice legislation and sensible gun safety laws. We are fast \napproaching the first-year anniversary of the shooting at Columbine \nHigh School in Littleton, Colorado. Next Thursday will sadly mark one \nyear since fourteen students and a teacher lost their lives in that \ntragedy on April 20, 1999.\n  It has been 11 months since the Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy \njuvenile justice bill by an overwhelming vote of 73-25. Our bipartisan \nbill includes modest yet effective gun safety provisions. It has been \n10 months since the House of Representatives passed its own juvenile \ncrime bill on June 17, 1999. It has been 9 months since the House and \nSenate juvenile justice conference met for the first--and only--time on \nAugust 5, 1999, less than 24 hours before the Congress adjourned for \nits long August recess.\n  Senate and House Democrats have been ready for months to reconvene \nthe juvenile justice conference and work with Republicans to craft an \neffective juvenile justice conference report that includes reasonable \ngun safety provisions, but the majority refuses to act. Indeed, on \nOctober 20, 1999, all the House and Senate Democratic conferees wrote \nto Senator Hatch, the Chairman of the juvenile justice conference, and \nCongressman Hyde, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, to \nreconvene the conference immediately. This week, Congressman Hyde \njoined our call for the juvenile justice conference to meet as soon as \npossible in a letter to Senator Hatch, which was also signed by \nCongressman Conyers.\n  Every parent, teacher and student in this country is concerned about \nschool violence over the last two years and worried about when the next \nshooting may occur. They only hope it does not happen at their school \nor involve their children.\n  We all recognize that there is no single cause and no single \nlegislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our \nschools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do \nour part. We should seize this opportunity to act on balanced, \neffective juvenile justice legislation, and measures to keep guns out \nof the hands of children and away from criminals.\n  It is ironic that the Senate will be in recess next week on the \nanniversary of the Columbine tragedy. In fact, the Senate has been in \nrecess more than in session since the one ceremonial meeting of the \njuvenile crime conference committee. I hope we get to work soon and \nfinish what we started in the juvenile justice conference. It is well \npast the time for Congress to act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this Hyde-Conyers letter of April 11, \n2000 be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         House of Representatives, Congress of the United States, \n           Committee on the Judiciary,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2000.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: We write to request a juvenile justice \n     conference meeting as soon as possible.\n       As you are aware, in the last two months, we have witnessed \n     a succession of gun violence tragedies. We have been shocked \n     by a six-year-old shooting a six-year-old in Mount Morris \n     Township, Michigan. We have seen a nursing home held hostage \n     and a mass shooting in Pittsburgh. In February, Memphis \n     firefighters responding to a call were shot and killed by a \n     disturbed man. It is clear that the Nation would like \n     Congress to respond.\n       We know that there is not complete agreement on all of the \n     issues before the Conference. We also recognize the need for \n     compromise. We have already agreed in principle to proposed \n     language to reduce the waiting period to 24 hours in most \n     cases, but are still trying to resolve appropriate ``safety \n     hatch'' exceptions.\n       We have pledged to each other to begin anew negotiations. \n     We believe, however, that beginning the work of the \n     Conference will play a constructive role in the necessary \n     process of narrowing our differences.\n       We appreciate your consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Henry J.

Mr. President, during this week prior to the April \ndeadline for filing income tax returns with the Internal Revenue \nService, Congress often focuses on the high tax burden shouldered by \nAmerican families and the need for tax reform. Fundamental reform is my \ntop tax legislative priority. I believe the entire confusing and \nincomprehensible tax code should be scrapped and replaced with a system \nthat is fair, simple, uniform and consistent. Until such fundamental \nreform can take place, I will continue to work in support of tax reform \nmeasures that correct unfair aspects of the existing tax code mess.\n  One section of the code that I believe needs to be changed and \nchanged soon is Section 415. Section 415 of the tax code was enacted in \n1974 for the purpose of limiting the pensions of corporate executives. \nSection 415 no\n\n[[Page S2707]]\n\nlonger impacts corporate executives, but it does unfairly impact middle \nincome workers who are prevented from collecting the full pensions they \nearned and deserve from their multi-employer plan. This is as simple as \nthe tax code keeping workers from being able to collect their own \nmoney. I believe this injustice should be corrected, and I have \ncosponsored legislation, Senate bill 1209, that will restore fairness \nto this section of the tax code.\n  The Senate version of the 1999 tax relief bill included the fix to \nSection 415. I am pleased that the Senate joined me in recognizing the \nabsolute need to correct Section 415 and to stop unfairly punishing \nworkers by blocking access to their hard-earned pensions, though I am \ndisappointed that this change did not become law last year. It was, \nhowever, an important step towards achieving reform. As the nation \nfocuses on tax season, I reaffirm my dedication to fighting to pass \nlegislation to bring fairness to Section 415 of the tax code and ensure \nour nation's workers collect what they have rightfully earned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2707-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2707-S2708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      U.S.S. ``J. WILLIAM DITTER''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in honor of their reunion to be held this \nmonth, I am pleased to call the Senate's attention to honor the crew of \nU.S.S. J. William Ditter who served during World War II.\n  I commend the dedication and courage of that crew of the minelayer \nnamed in honor of former Pennsylvania Congressman J. William Ditter.\n  Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on September 5, 1888, J. William \nDitter received his law degree from Temple University in 1913 and was \nadmitted to the bar the same year. As a school teacher and baseball \ncoach at Northeast High School from 1912 until 1925, one of Coach \nDitter's team members was Jimmy Dykes, who later went on to become \nConnie Mack's star third baseman during the Philadelphia Athletics' \nglory years in the nineteen-thirties. Less famous, but equally \nimportant were the hundreds of young men and women who studied at \nNortheast High under ``Doc'' Ditter's tutelage. They constantly sought \nhis advice and retained their affection for him in the years that \nfollowed.\n  In 1925, Mr. Ditter moved to Montgomery County, where he practiced \nlaw and became an active member of his church and community. In 1932, \nMontgomery County was made a separate Congressional district and Mr. \nDitter was elected to serve as its first Representative.\n  As a member of the House of Representatives, he quickly became known \nfor his tireless work, dedication to our country, and consummate skill \nin debate. Congressman Ditter took a prominent role in defeating \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt's efforts to pack the Supreme Court in \norder to insure that New Deal legislation would not be declared \nunconstitutional. As the Ranking Member of the House Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Naval Affairs, he led the fight to establish a two-\nocean Navy. The success of the Navy in World War II, including the ship \nwhich was named after him, was due in part to the leadership and \ndedication of Congressman J. William Ditter.\n  In recognition of his leadership, Bill Ditter was selected to be the \nChairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, a post he \nheld until his death in 1943. While in Congress, Mr. Ditter explained \nhis positions on public affairs by writing a weekly newspaper column, \nTrend of Events. During his years in Congress, he was much in demand as \na public speaker, not only in Montgomery County but throughout the \nstate and nation.\n  Congressman Ditter's political career was cut short by his untimely \ndeath in a Navy plane crash near Columbia, Pennsylvania. He was \nreturning from Boston where he had been on a trip to participate in the \ncommissioning of the Navy's new carrier, U.S.S. Wasp. Among the many \ndignitaries who attended his funeral were former President Herbert C. \nHoover, a close, personal friend and my colleague Senator McCain's \ngrandfather Admiral John S. McCain, Sr., Commander of Carrier Task \nForce 38. Congressman Ditter was buried with military honors at \nWhitemarsh Memorial Cemetery. In light of his distinguished service to \nour nation, the Navy named a destroyer-mine layer in his honor, U.S.S. \nJ. William Ditter (DM 31).\n  U.S.S. J. William Ditter was a fitting tribute to Congressman Ditter. \nThe Sumner class destroyer, which was converted to a high speed mine \nlayer, was christened by Mrs. J. William Ditter on July 4, 1944. It was \ncommissioned on October 28, 1944, and served as a unit of Division 9, \nMine Squadron 3. Congressman Ditter's dedication and service to his \ncountry was mirrored by the actions of the men on U.S.S. J. William \nDitter. The ``Fighting J. Willy'', as the crew called the mine layer, \ndestroyed many Japanese suicide aircraft and boats during its years of \nservice.\n  The end of April marks the fifty-fifth anniversary of the brave \nactions of the crew in the early days of the operations in Okinawa. \nU.S.S. J. William Ditter greatly contributed to the success of the \nfirst landings on April 1, 1945 by escorting transport ships carrying \nAmerican invasion forces.\n  On April 12, U.S.S. J. William Ditter joined the radar picket line to \nprotect ships against attacking Japanese aircraft. On April 26, U.S.S. \nJ. William Ditter drove off an attacking enemy aircraft, and on April \n27, the crew helped to down two enemy aircraft. On April 28, the crew \nshot down an attacking suicide aircraft and combined its fire with \nanother ship in order to shoot down two other hostile aircraft. On \nApril 29, the crew detected and attacked an enemy submarine.\n  By May 28, 1945, U.S.S. J. William Ditter had shot down eight \nJapanese aircraft and assisted in destroying three others. On June 6, \n1945, in the radar picket line of Task Force 51.5 patrolling southeast \nof Nakagusukua Wan, U.S.S. J. William Ditter shot down four. However, \none suicide plane hit U.S.S. J. William Ditter, inflicting heavy damage \nand numerous casualties. Ten men were killed and twenty-seven were \nwounded on that fateful day.\n  Although the ship was repaired enough to make it home to the United \nStates, it was decommissioned and struck from the Navy's fleet when the \nwar ended. Despite the short term of service, U.S.S. J. William Ditter \nhad a distinguished war record, keeping in honor with the person for \nwhom the ship was named--Congressman J. William Ditter.\n  The crew deserves special recognition for their service, and I am \npleased to be able to commend them on the floor of the United States \nSenate. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the list \nof the names of the crew members who served on U.S.S. J. William \nDitter.\n  As an addendum, I think it is appropriate to note the distinguished \npublic service of Congressman Ditter's son, J. William Ditter, Jr., who \nis a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania where I knew him as a practicing attorney in that court.\n  There being no objections, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                Crew of the U.S.S. ``J.

I think kids belong with their \nparents--I have always believed that--unless there is some reason a \nchild should not be with the parent, if the child has a bad parent. \nThere is no proof of that in any way, or suggestion of that, except at \nthe last minute the relatives who are caring for Elian, now, have made \nthese charges.\n  It seems as if every time the father comes closer, he becomes a worse \nperson. First, he was wonderful. They said, he is wonderful but he \ndoesn't care about his son; he is not here. Now he is here, and they \nstill will not turn the child over.\n  I have a little grandson. He is about a year younger than Elian, so I \nam pretty familiar with kids that age because I have watched him so \nclosely. They are babies; they really are. They are little children. \nThey are babies. They are impressionable. That is why it is so \nimportant to treat them well and to not use them for any purpose--let \nthem be children.\n  I have to say unequivocally as a grandmother, not as a Senator, I \nbelieve it is very harmful for a child to be exposed to screaming \nadults outside of his home, day in and day out, shouting things. There \nis something wrong with that. It is harmful to a child.\n  I also want to point out there is room for politics over the Cuba \nissue. Of course there is. But it is not around this case. It should \nnot be around this case, either by those in this country who want to \nmake it a political issue, or Fidel Castro, who may well want to do \nthat if and when Elian is back. That would be deplorable.\n  We have to treat this child gently. We have to reunite this child \nwith his living parent. I just would like to make a plea to those who \ndo not want to do that and who have said that to get Elian with his \nfather is going to take people coming to the door, that they will not \nrelinquish this child except if there is force used, that is not the \nway we do things in this country.\n  This is a country of peaceful laws. That is why we have courts. That \nis why people have to obey court orders. We have laws. We cannot, \nbecause we disagree with them--God knows, every one of us disagree with \njury verdicts; we disagree with laws; we disagree with decisions. The \nbeauty of our Nation is\n\n[[Page S2709]]\n\nthat we are a country of laws. We must make it clear those laws should \nbe obeyed. We ought to do it in the best interests of this child, which \nmeans gently and peacefully.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2709-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBRANCE OF THE KATYN FOREST MASSACRE\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to remind my fellow \nAmericans of a horrific tragedy which occurred in Poland six decades \nago. April 13 serves as a day of remembrance of this terrible massacre.\n  On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland to begin World War II. \nTwo weeks later, in accordance with the secret Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, \nthe Soviet Union invaded Poland from the East and completed the \npartition of this nation. The Soviet invasion lasted eleven days and \nresulted in the forced deportation of 1.5 million Poles to Russian \nlabor camps. Of those 1.5 million, approximately 15,000 Polish military \nofficers disappeared under mysterious circumstances. On June 22, 1941, \ntensions between Germany and the Soviet Union exploded as the German \narmy stormed into Soviet territory. It would take nearly two years \nbefore the German army would uncover evidence relating to the 15,000 \nPolish officers who had disappeared in 1940.\n  In 1943, German forces near Smolensk, in western Russia, investigated \nreports they heard from Russian civilians to the effect that a large \nnumber of prisoners had been murdered by the Soviet secret police in \nthe area nearly three years earlier. The German investigators were led \nby local Russians to a series of mounds in a wooded area about 10 miles \nwest of Smolensk. On April 13, 1943, German officials made a gruesome \ndiscovery as they uncovered buried corpses. They found numerous \nvictims, each with hands bound behind their backs and a bullet hole in \nthe base of their skulls. Over the course of the next month, the \nGermans exhumed more than 4500 corpses. Unable to continue to dig \nthrough Katyn Forest, Germany requested the assistance of the \nInternational Red Cross and representatives of neutral countries to \ndetermine the circumstances surrounding the execution and burial of \nthese 4500 Polish officers.\n  After examining the bodies, these representatives reported to the \nappropriate authorities their conclusion that the men buried in Katyn \nForest were those of Polish military officers, along with a number of \ncivilian cultural leaders, business leaders, and intellectuals--\nscientists, writers, and poets--who had been in the portion of Poland \noccupied by the Soviet Union in September 1939. The Soviet Union \nvehemently denied the allegations of responsibility. Once the Soviet \nUnion had reclaimed Katyn Forest, a pro-Soviet investigation of the \nKatyn Forest Massacre determined that the Polish officers and leaders \nhad been massacred by the German army. It would take another 45 years \nbefore the truth of the massacre would finally be acknowledged by the \nleaders of the Soviet Union.\n  Aside from United States congressional hearings held in Britain, \nItaly, Germany and the United States in the early 1950s, the Katyn \nForest Massacre was largely forgotten by the international community. \nBut the truth of Katyn Forest remained vivid for the Polish nation. \nPolish nationals were determined to discover the truth. These \nindividuals wanted justice for the fallen comrades.\n  After the publication of an account of the Massacre by a Soviet \nhistorian in 1990, Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski quickly \narranged a series of meetings with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev \nand other Soviet officials in an attempt to finally bring a conclusion \nto the Katyn conspiracy. On April 13, 1990, the day after President \nJaruzelski's final meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet news \nagency published a statement of acknowledgment on behalf of the Soviet \ngovernment for summary execution of 15,000 Polish officers in the Katyn \nForest during late April and early May of 1940. The statement claimed \nthat the NKVD, the Soviet secret police, followed the orders of their \nchief, Lavrenti P. Beria, and massacred these 15,000 Polish captives.\n  We must never forget the crime against humanity which was carried out \nin this rural section of Poland. As our nation looks towards the 21st \nCentury and the promising future, we must always remember the \nsacrifices of brave and gallant men in the defense of their nation and \ntheir heritage which have helping the world achieve greater freedom and \ndemocracy. April 13 should always be remembered not as a day in which \nhope briefly dimmed when these brave men were executed but a day in \nwhich freedom triumphed and shown brightly after decades of silence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2709-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2709-S2710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FEDERAL COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, last week the Senate passed the FY 2001 \nBudget Resolution. I would be remiss if, upon reflection, I did not \ntake this opportunity to talk about the federal commitment to education \nin my state of Utah.\n  In my state of Utah, education consistently ranks as one of the \nhighest priorities for Utahns. During this year's session of the Utah \nlegislature, Utah reaffirmed its commitment to improving education, \nreducing class size and paying dedicated teachers a salary commensurate \nwith their efforts and qualifications.\n  Utah takes its commitment to education funding very seriously. During \nthe 1995-96 school year, education expenditures in Utah amounted to $92 \nper $1000 of personal income. The national average was $62 per $1000. \nIn other words, Mr. President, Utah's education expenditure relative to \ntotal personal income is nearly 50 percent more than the national \naverage. It is the third highest in the nation.\n  In education expenditures as a percent of total direct state and \nlocal government expenditures, Utah ranks 2nd in the nation. Utah's \nexpenditure for education was 41.5 percent of the total amount spent \nfor government. The national average is 33.5 percent.\n  Mr. President, no one can tell me that Utahns are not serious about \nfunding education. And these efforts have garnered results. Utah's \nscores on ACT tests are equal to or better than the national average in \nEnglish, math, reading and science. Utah ranks 1st in the nation in \nAdvanced Placement tests taken and passed.\n  Still, even with these efforts, Utah remains 1st the nation in terms \nof class size and last in per-pupil expenditure. This is due to Utah's \nunique demographic. Utah families are, on average, larger than any \nother state. Utah has the highest birth rate in the nation.\n  While it is true that these factors contribute to the allocation of \nfederal education funds, most notably the Title I funds, the Clinton \nadministration has done very little to help Utah. Indeed, many of the \nproposals in the administration budget would be detrimental to \neducation efforts underway in Utah.\n  Among other things, this administration has consistently cut funding \nfor Impact Aid. Impact Aid is a vital program for Utah because it helps \nmake up for the lost property tax revenue in school districts where \nthere is a significant federal presence. Since half of our state is \nfederally owned or controlled, that means our schools would suffer even \ngreater financial difficulties without Impact Aid. I appreciate that \nthis Budget Resolution rejects the 15 percent cut requested by the \nClinton administration.\n  Indeed, in addition to support for Impact Aid, there is much to \napplaud in this Budget Resolution relative to education. It assumes an \nincrease of more than $600 million over the administration's request. \nOver $11 billion will be dedicated to funding the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act. This will greatly assist Utah fund the \neducation of students with special needs.\n  Moreover, because the federal government will be contributing more \ntoward the costs of special education, fulfilling more of its promise \nto fund 40 percent of the cost for educating students with \ndisabilities, the state will be able to use its own resources to \naddress state and local priorities such as lowering class size, improve \nfacilities, increasing teachers' pay, upgrading instructional equipment \nand textbooks, or offering enrichment programs.\n  Finally, this administration has never recommended funding for the \nEducation Finance Incentive Grant program which, instead of a per-pupil \nexpenditure as a proxy for a state's\n\n[[Page S2710]]\n\ncommitment to education, uses a combination of a state's effort to fund \neducation and a state's willingness to more equitably distribute \nresources among a state's economically diverse school districts. As I \nhave noted, Utah allocates a significant amount of state revenue to \neducation, demonstrating our state's effort. Utah also has in place an \n``equity program'' for assisting schools with smaller tax bases. \nNationally, we ought to be encouraging states to make such effort, and \nwe ought to be rewarding states that do. This is an important program \nthat deserves a consistent funding stream, and I will be addressing \nthis issue in the context of the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  In the area of higher education, this Budget Resolution rejects the \nadministration's proposal to require guaranty agencies, which finance \nguaranteed student loans (GSLs), to pay accelerated and increased funds \nfrom their federal reserves. This would be especially devastating to \nUtah's Higher Education Assistance Authority (UHEAA). Utah has one of \nthe lowest average incomes in the nation; and, therefore, Utah students \nwho are not reliant on their parents for financial assistance rely \ninstead on assistance from UHEAA.\n  During past assessments, because UHEAA had maintained one of highest \nguarantee program reserves ratios, Utah had to return one of the \nhighest percentages of current reserves to the federal government. \nUnder the administration's proposal, these cuts would have been \ndeepened, and I am grateful to the Budget committee for rejecting them.\n  In closing, I would like to commend the tireless hard work of the \nChairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici. His dedication to \nsound fiscal policy and appropriate spending priorities are laudable. I \nalso thank the Senate leadership for their efforts on moving this \nprocess along. I look forward to the enactment of this Budget \nResolution. I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2710-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PASSAGE OF S. 376 ``ORBIT''\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support the conference \nreport on satellite reform. As a co-sponsor of the original bill, I \nbelieve this bi-partisan legislation will encourage more competition in \nthe satellite communications market. This will benefit American \nconsumers and workers. It will also make America more competitive in \nthe global satellite market.\n  The Open-market Reorganization for the Betterment of International \nTelecommunications Act (ORBIT bill) will benefit our nation in a number \nof ways. First, the bill allows Lockheed Martin to acquire 100% of \nCOMSAT Corporation by removing a number of old and outdated regulatory \nbarriers. This is great news for these two outstanding Maryland \ncompanies and their employees. The merger will encourage growth and \neconomic competition in one of the most dynamic sectors of our \neconomy--the global satellite market. It means jobs today and jobs \ntomorrow--both in Maryland and throughout our nation. I look forward to \nLockheed Martin and COMSAT completing their merger without any further \ndelay.\n  Second, this legislation encourages the privatization of INTELSAT, an \ninter-governmental organization, by including the leverage necessary to \nensure that INTELSAT's privatization will conclude in a timely and pro-\ncompetitive manner.\n  Third, the conference agreement also reaffirms the ability of \ncarriers to obtain Level III direct access. Level III direct access \nallows customers to enter into contractual agreements with INTELSAT to \norder, receive and pay for INTELSAT space segment capacity at the same \nrate that INTELSAT charges its signatories. This means that users of \nINTELSAT services will be able to purchase services directly from \nINTELSAT without going through COMSAT.\n  Fourth, the bill does not remove the current prohibition on Level IV \ndirect access until after INTELSAT privatizes. Allowing Level IV access \nbefore privatization would have unfairly and unjustly permitted \nCOMSAT's competitors to buy all of COMSAT's investment in INTELSAT \nbelow market value which would have weakened the value of this \ninternational asset. This would have significantly diminished the value \nof the Lockheed-COMSAT transaction.\n  I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the Senate and \nin the House for passing S. 376 and commend the President for signing \nthis important legislation into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2710-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, April 24 marks the 85th anniversary of \nthe beginning of one of the most tragic events in history, the Armenian \nGenocide. In 1915, the Ottoman Turkish Government embarked on a brutal \npolicy of ethnic extermination. Over the next eight years, 1.5 million \nArmenians were killed, and more than half a million were forced from \ntheir homeland into exile.\n  In the years since then, the Armenian diaspora has thrived in the \nUnited States and in many other countries, bringing extraordinary \nvitality and achievement to communities across America and throughout \nthe world. The Armenian Assembly of America, the Armenian National \nCommittee of America, and other distinguished groups deserve great \ncredit for their impressive work in maintaining the proud history and \nheritage of the Armenian people, and guaranteeing that the Armenian \nGenocide will never be forgotten.\n  One of the enduring achievements of the survivors of the Genocide and \ntheir descendants has been to keep its tragic memory alive, in spite of \ncontinuing efforts by those who refuse to acknowledge the atrocities \nthat took place. In Massachusetts, the curriculum of every public \nschool now includes human rights and genocide, and the Armenian \nGenocide is part of that curriculum.\n  As this new century unfolds, it is time for all governments, \npolitical leaders and peoples everywhere to recognize the Armenian \nGenocide. These annual commemorations are an effective way to pay \ntribute to the courage and suffering and triumph of the Armenian \npeople, and to ensure that such atrocities will never happen again to \nany people on earth.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, each year on April 24, we pause to \nremember the tragedy of the Armenian genocide. On that date in 1915, \nmore than two hundred Armenian religious, political, and intellectual \nleaders were arrested in Constantinople (now Istanbul) and killed, \nmarking the beginning of an organized campaign to eliminate the \nArmenian presence from the Ottoman Empire. This brutal campaign would \nresult in the massacre of a million and a half Armenian men, women, and \nchildren.\n  Thousands of Armenians were subjected to torture, deportation, \nslavery, and murder. More than five hundred thousand were removed from \ntheir homes and sent on forced death marches through the deserts of \nSyria. This dark time is among the saddest chapters in human history.\n  But Armenians are strong people, and their dream of freedom did not \ndie. More than seventy years after the genocide, the new Republic of \nArmenia was born as the Soviet Union crumbled. Today, we pay tribute to \nthe courage and strength of a people who would not know defeat.\n  Yet independence has not meant an end to their struggle. There are \nstill those who question the reality of the Armenian slaughter, who \nhave failed to recognize its very existence. We must not allow the \nhorror of the Armenian genocide to be either dismissed or denied.\n  Genocide is the worst of all crimes against humanity. As we try to \nlearn from the recent genocidal conflicts in Kosovo and Rwanda and \nprevent future atrocities, it is especially important to remember those \nwho lost their lives in the first genocide of the twentieth century. We \nmust never forget the victims of the Armenian genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2710-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2710-S2713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          A MODERN DAY TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today to \ntell a story--a modern day tragedy about a mother, Elizabeth, who so \nloved her son, Elian, that she tried to bring him to the shores of the \nUnited States of America from Cuba--to the shores of freedom. Had she \nsucceeded, she would have joined her family members already in the \nUnited States: her cousin\n\n[[Page S2711]]\n\nwho arrived only last year; her son's great uncle and his family who \nhave been in the United States for many years; and another cousin who \nhas been here for over fifteen years. She would have been reunited with \nmany other relatives who must today remain anonymous for fear of \nretribution by Castro against those still trapped in Cuba. Instead, she \nmet with tragedy in the Florida straits. Elizabeth died. Her five-year-\nold son survived.\n  Let me be a little more specific. On November 21, 1999, a group of 14 \nCuban citizens boarded a boat bound for the United States and the \nshores of freedom. The motor failed shortly after departing and the \ngroup was forced to return to Cuba. Think of the anxiety at this \nmoment, having to return after risking everything. The anticipation. \nThe disappointment. The fear.\n  When the boat returned to Cuba, one of the other female passengers, \nArianne Horta, placed her young daughter back on the shore of Cuba. She \nthen wanted to make sure that Elizabeth was positive in her decision to \ntake Elian. And despite the fact that Elian had a father in Cuba, \nElizabeth brought her son back on the boat to set sail for the second \ntime that night--seeking freedom on the shores of America.\n  If you are interested in what Elian's mother really wanted, think \nabout the act of choosing to keep her son on the boat, while Arianne \ntook her child off the boat. This is as clear a message as a mother can \nsend that she wanted freedom for her child. She wanted freedom despite \nthe risks involved, despite a failed attempt to flee hours earlier, and \ndespite the fact that the father remained in Cuba.\n  Think about that moment of choice for Elizabeth--put my son on the \nbeach and he can live with his father, or keep him with me so we could \nhave the hope of freedom. It is clear to me that she valued freedom \nabove everything. Now think--if that was you, and you died, would you \nwant the child returned to Cuba?\n  Think of yourself in Nazi Germany. A mother successfully smuggles a \nchild out, but dies in the process at the hands of the Nazis. The \nfather, probably under duress, demands the return of his child. Would \nwe contemplate returning him? Would we return a child under the same \ncircumstances to Saddam Hussein's Iraq? If a mother and child were \nscaling the Berlin wall and the mother was shot, but the child was \npushed over--would we send the child back? Absolutely not.\n  On the night of November 21, this group of Cuban nationals repaired \ntheir boat and set sail a second time. On the following night, the boat \ncapsized. The survivors clung to anything that would float and hung on \nfor dear life. After a day struggling for her life, Elizabeth died. But \nbefore she passed on, she told a fellow passenger who did survive, \nNivaldo Fernandez, to make sure that Elian touches land, to make sure \nhe touches dry land.\n  As many of my colleagues know well, if a Cuban refugee reaches \nAmerican soil they will not be sent back to Cuba. Every Cuban knows \nthat reaching ``dry land'' means they will be free from Castro's iron \nfist. Elizabeth's dying wish was for her Elian to reach dry land. There \ncan be no doubt about what she wanted for her son.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today with great disappointment--\ndisappointment in this Administration and disappointment in the \nAttorney General. Elian Gonzalez's mother's death will be in vain and \nthis little boy's struggle for freedom, his struggle to live in \nAmerica, simply is being dismissed if the boy's best interests and the \nfamily's legal rights are not considered.\n  Many will say that this is a simple decision, the INS and the \nDepartment of Justice should merely reunite a father with the son he \nloves. I think all of us recognize the intense and profound bond \nbetween parent and child. It is to be respected and cherished. It is a \nnatural instinct to want to reunite parent and child. But these are by \nno means ordinary circumstances. I ask the American people to look \nbeyond the headlines, to understand the intense pressure this father is \nunder. It is unlike anything you or I will ever experience in a free \nAmerica. I have no doubt the father loves his little boy. But how many \nof us have stopped and thought about why this father did not come to \nhis son the day he was found, exhausted and dehydrated having survived \na treacherous trip at sea. Consider why he has not come for almost 5 \nmonths to support his son, hug his son, comfort his son. Again, I would \nsuspect it is not out of lack of concern for his boy. I would suspect \nit is because Castro would not let him.\n  Is it possible the father wants the boy to remain with his family in \nMiami and live in freedom? My understanding is that the father knew \nElian and his mother were coming to this country and even told other \nfamily members that he would get to America if he ``had to do so in a \nbowl.''\n  I can't imagine anyone disagrees with the notion that Castro controls \nthe father's words and actions through duress--through intimidation. \nThe fact is that none of us knows the true wishes of this father. \nCastro has used this father and son to manipulate both Cuba and the \nUnited States.\n  Today, the United States is not about to reunite a boy and his \nfather, instead we are about to reunite a child and his dictator. And \nwe are doing so against his mother's wishes. We may be doing so against \nhis father's wishes, as well.\n  Last week, a spokesman of the Cuban embassy stated ``Elian Gonzalez \nis a possession of the Cuban Government.'' In Castro's Cuba, the state \nalways has the last word in how a child is raised--it does not matter \nif a parent disagrees. According to Cuban law, any parent who questions \nthe regime or takes any action deemed to run contrary to the \nrevolution's goals could be imprisoned or executed.\n  Let me quote a former Cuban Government official from a recent \nWashington Post op-ed.\n\n       Within Cuba, the return of Elian will not be seen as an act \n     of justice by the U.S. government, but rather as yet another \n     victory for the bully-boy tactics of Fidel Castro. This is \n     why the dictator is trying to recover Elian--to convert him \n     into a different kind of symbol--a symbol of the Revolution--\n     even though for that to happen, Elian would have to renounce \n     his mother, the family in Miami that took care of him and \n     even in fact, his father, Juan Miguel. Because upon returning \n     to Cuba, he will not belong to his family. He will be another \n     son of the Revolution.\n\n  If Cuba were a free country, this situation would have been easily \nresolved. But Cuba is not free, it is a police state. In fact, Article \n8 of Cuba's Code for Children and Youth states: ``Society and the State \nwork for the efficient protection of youths against all influences \ncontrary to their communist formation.''\n  Make no mistake, in Cuba, Elian will not have a normal childhood.\n  In Cuba, Elian will be allowed to live with his father until he is \neleven; thereafter he will be sent to work in a farm-labor camp for 45 \nto 60 days per year.\n  In Cuba, Elian will face compulsory military service until he is 27.\n  In Cuba, Elian will be indoctrinated in the glories of ``the \nrevolution'' and taught to regard any Cubans who reject Castroism--\nincluding his dead mother--as counterrevolutionaries and traitors.\n  In Cuba, Elian will be allowed to attend college only if his \n``political attitude and social conduct'' satisfy the regime in Havana.\n  Returning Elian to Cuba means returning him to Fidel Castro. When I \nwas a child, my parents had the last word in my upbringing. In Cuba, \nCastro's wishes carry the day--he can override any parent. Be assured \nCastro will begin his manipulation of Elian from the day of his return. \nI can see the images now--parades and banners, welcoming home the young \ndefender of the ``Communist Revolution.'' Elian may remain closer to \nFidel than any other child may be forced to suffer. The boy may get \nbetter treatment as a result, but this will be only on the surface. \nThis innocent child will be captive--a prisoner in his own homeland. \nThe regime cannot afford for this boy to return to Cuba only to \nrenounce Castro's ways. Elian will be treated, not as a child, but as \nan opportunity to exploit. His home, his education, his father's \nsalary, everything, will be provided as Fidel dictates. The pathetic \nefforts of a desperate tyrant to legitimize his method of oppression \nwill make Elian a test. My colleagues, he is a child. Instead of \nFidel's cruelties, he needs compassion.\n  There is a reason Elian's mother and countless others have risked \neverything and have given their lives in the hope that their children \nwill taste freedom. And while Elian's mother's voice\n\n[[Page S2712]]\n\ncannot be heard now, her actions were loud and clear.\n  I would not be so angry if we were truly reuniting a parent and \nchild. But if we return Elian, the United States will be caving to the \ndemands of the last tyrant in the Western Hemisphere and will be \nsending a six-year-old boy to a place that Human Rights Watch states \nhas a ``highly developed machinery of repression.'' And the United \nStates will be doing this without providing basic civil rights to \nElian--without permitting his legal options to play out.\n  Instead, our Government is short circuiting justice for political \nexpediency and we will have to live with that. The outrage and fury I \nfeel toward the administration, the Department of Justice and the INS \nfor the manner in which they have handled the Elian Gonzalez case is \noverwhelming.\n  The United States is a Nation committed to the principles of freedom, \njustice, democracy and respect for human dignity. We are a nation built \nupon a rich diversity of heritage. We celebrate the uniqueness of our \nroots, family traditions and cultural experiences. And while this rich \ndiversity is the strength of our great country, we, as Americans, share \na common bond that is even stronger. That common bond is our precious \nfreedom. Freedom to pursue our dreams, freedom to raise our children, \nfreedom to speak our minds, and freedom from a government that dictates \nwhat we say, where we should live, and what we will become.\n  These principles strengthen our democracy, our nation. These \nprinciples are what continue to draw people to America's shores. Our \ndemocracy is designed to preserve and protect the rights of the weak \nand the strong. Our judicial system is designed to promote access to \njustice for all Americans. But what we have seen in the past several \nweeks from our own Justice Department in its' handling of the Elian \nGonzalez case shakes the very foundation of our American principles.\n  Instead of defending these principles, this Administration has \nintimidated Elian's American family with the sheer weight, power, and \nforce of the United States Government. This Administration has chosen \nto grind down this family's emotions and trample on the family's \nrights. In the process, the best interests of this boy have been \nundeniably neglected and his mother's wishes ignored. This \nAdministration's treatment of a young child has evolved into an \nexercise of cruel and unusual punishment to preserve a pre-determined \noutcome and to placate an old and bitter dictator.\n  The United States is a free country. We have a Bill or Rights, a code \nof laws, and a separation of powers which guarantees no administration \nshall be able to sidestep the law. We are a country in which the \njudicial system should be permitted to work without presidential \ninfluence for political expediency--and certainly without bringing the \nmighty weight and power of the government down on the weakest of all \npeople--a child.\n  But, in the last four months, this administration, our United States \nGovernment, has overstepped its bounds. Mr. President, I am \ndisillusioned by the present status of this struggle for freedom. \nDisillusioned that these calls to honor freedom have fallen on deaf \nears. But, then I think of the Cuban parents who so loved their \nchildren that they sent them unaccompanied to the United States in the \n1960's in what became known as ``Operation Pedro Pan.'' Fourteen \nthousand and eighty-four children were sent away from the clutches of \nCastro by their loving parents to go to America to live in freedom. \nThese parents willingly sent their children in order to escape Castro--\nin order to escape oppression. Many, if not most, of these children had \nno family in the United States. But they were sent to the United States \nwith their parents wish for freedom--freedom at all costs.\n  We know Elian's mother sought freedom for her son--and she paid the \nultimate price. We know many in Elian's family had already come to the \nUnited States; some recently, some long ago. But we have taken the sad, \nsad action of assuming a man whose very life and that of his family, \ndepends upon the goodwill of a tyrant, has the ability to speak freely. \nWhat a tragedy that this man cannot speak openly and freely about his \ntrue desire. What a sad day in the history of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Our founding principle--our Declaration of Independence--declares, \n``we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created \nequal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable \nrights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness.'' We, the inheritors of this legacy, must not force people \ninto tyranny.\n  I appeal to the President and the Attorney General to resolve this in \nsuch a manner that Elian's struggle and his mother's tragic death will \nnot have been in vain. Perhaps we, the United States of America, will \nrealize that if we don't, we are making a tragic mistake in the \nhandling of this case. It is not too late, though, to do the right \nthing for this little boy. I call on the President of the United States \nand the Attorney General once again, to consider what is in the little \nboy's best interest.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I was listening to Senator Mack. And I \nreally wish all Americans could hear his concerns and message because I \ndon't think the message he is sending today is getting out to people. I \nreally believe most people think this is just a technical issue, it is \nautomatic, it is what ought to happen.\n  I think what the Senator from Florida shared with us indicates that \nthis is not an ordinary situation. It is very unordinary. Cuba is not \nan ordinary country. It is a very unordinary country, in the manner and \nin the ways the Senator from Florida described it, and more.\n  I thank him for coming here and asking the President and the Attorney \nGeneral in a senatorial way--he made no threats, and there were no \nconnotations in his voice. He clearly said, I ask that you consider the \nother side of this coin.\n  I thank him for that.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the Senator \nfrom Florida. But I am reminded, it is a pathetic thing. It is pathetic \nto see this child twisted and turned and seduced, if I may say--\nsomething that goes far beyond the capacity of a 6-year-old child to \nanalyze and describe in appropriate terms.\n  But I say this: My sympathy goes out to the family in Miami that has \nbeen attached. But I also know this is a place where we often preach \nfamily values, family control, no interference by government, to remind \neveryone that this is a country of laws. If we subvert the law simply \nbecause there is pressure coming from one corner or another, what kind \nof message does it send to the millions of people who would crowd our \nshores and want to be here? It would say, well, we discriminate because \nwe have louder voices in one place than we have in another.\n  Again, I think we have to remember that this country is founded on \nthe principle of being a nation of laws, and one can challenge and go \nto court.\n  But to say, no, we are not going to obey the law, I don't think, \nfrankly, does the cause of our country or the cause of this little boy, \nin the final analysis, any value.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, there was an interest here, certainly. There \nare some who have discriminated against one group or another, who have \nnot spoken out for one group and have spoken out for another.\n  In my career representing the State of Florida and the Senate, I have \nspoken out for every group looking for honest and fair treatment, \nwhether they be Cuban, whether they be Nicaraguan, or whether they be \nHaitian. I have done that. I am proud that I have done that. Some of \nthose positions have not been particularly popular in my State. But I \nhave always taken that position.\n  Again, I think the right thing to do is to ask a very simple \nquestion: What is in the boy's best interest?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. In all due respect, I say this to my friend from \nFlorida for whom I have a great deal of respect and admiration. \nReunification of families is something we wrestle with here all the \ntime--people pleading to allow a relative to join a family that has \nbeen here for years. And we say: No, the law doesn't permit it, the \nrules don't permit it. So we say: Sorry, we can't do that.\n  I get lots of pleas in my office--I am sure every Senator does--\nsaying: Let\n\n[[Page S2713]]\n\nmy mother come from country X, Y, or Z, or otherwise, and let us join \ntogether.\n  I say once again, if we forget we are a nation of laws, then all of \nus--the people in this room and the people throughout the country--\nought to be bound by the same rules and the same laws. We cannot make \nthe kind of exception that looks as if it is responding to particular \npressure in a particular moment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2713-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RESOLUTION ON METHAMPHETAMINE CLEAN UP FUNDS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today I rise in support of Senator \nGrassley's Sense of the Senate Resolution urging President Clinton to \nsee to it that the Department of Justice reprogramms $10,000,000 in \nrecovery funds within the Community Oriented Policing Service (COPS) so \nthe Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) can continue to reimburse \nstate and local law enforcement officials in the proper removal and \ndisposal of hazardous materials recovered from clandestine \nmethamphetamine laboratories.\n  Mr. President, Wyoming is one of a number of states that has \nexperienced an astronomic increase in methamphetamine production, \ntrafficking and use. In fact, during fiscal year 1998, of all cases \nprosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's office in Wyoming, 45% were drug \ncases and of that nearly 75% were methamphetamine related.\n  When law enforcement officials bust a methamphetamine laboratory not \nonly do they have to prosecute the individuals involved but they must \nalso dispose of the highly toxic chemicals that were used to produce \nthis illegal drug. It is estimated that it costs between $3,000 and \n$100,000 for the safe clean up of methamphetamine labs. It is very \nimportant to see to it that methamphetamine labs are properly handled \nbecause six pounds of toxic waste are produced for every pound of \nmethamphetamine manufactured.\n  Wyoming's law enforcement officials rely exclusively on the funds \nthat the DEA provides to state and local law enforcement officials for \nthe clean up of methamphetamine labs. Because of this growing problem, \nthe allocated funds the DEA uses to reimburse state and local law \nenforcement officials ran out last month. As a result, numerous towns \nand communities across the country are no longer able to rely on the \nDEA for much needed funding.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that President Clinton will see to it \nthat the Justice Department approves this reprogramming of funds so law \nenforcement officials across the country can continue to fight the \ngrowing problem of methamphetamine production.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2713-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NATIONAL ORGAN AND TISSUE DONOR AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to the \ncritical issue of organ and tissue donation, particularly with the \nupcoming National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week (April 16th-\n22nd) upon us. Although many of us will be back in our home states next \nweek, we must remember to spread the word about the need for donation \nwhenever we have the chance.\n  National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week was first designated \nby Congress in 1983 and proclaimed by the President annually since then \nto raise awareness of the significant need for organ and tissue \ndonation and to encourage all Americans to share their decision to \ndonate with their families so their wishes can be honored. Last year, \nfor example, the Transplant Recipients International Organization's \nChicago chapter reached thousands of people through its donation \ndisplays at City Hall and other public buildings. In addition, many \ngroups sponsored donor recognition ceremonies, remembrance services, \nand other events to honor the generous and caring individuals and \nfamilies who have given the gift of life.\n  Today, nearly 70,000 men, women, and children are waiting for an \norgan transplant and the list is growing longer. Each day about 57 \npeople are given the gift of life through the generosity of organ and \ntissue donations, but another 16 people on the waiting list die because \nthe need for donations greatly exceeds the supply available. \nAdditionally, the need for a more diverse donor pool, including a \nvariety of racial and ethnic minorities, will also continue to grow in \nthe coming years. All anyone needs to do is this: say yes to organ and \ntissue donation on a donor card or driver's license and discuss your \ndecision with your family members so they know your wishes. \nTransplantation does save lives, but only if all of us help as we \nstrive toward a fair, equitable and accountable system of organ and \ntissue donation and transplantation.\n  Last session, the Give Thanks, Give Life resolution that I sponsored \nwith my distinguished colleagues, Senator Frist, Senator DeWine, \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Levin and others was passed in the Senate. \nThis legislation, which has the support of numerous national organ and \ntissue donation organizations, designates Thanksgiving of 2000 as a day \nfor families to discuss organ and tissue donation with each other since \nthe final decision to share the gift of life is almost always made by a \nloved one's family. This week, I also introduced the Comprehensive \nImmunosuppressive Drug Coverage for Transplant Patients Act of 2000, \nwhich sets up a new policy stating that all Medicare beneficiaries who \nhave received a transplant and need immunosuppressive drugs to prevent \nrejection of their transplant will be covered for as long as anti-\nrejection drugs are needed.\n  There are many stories that touch the heart on this compelling issue, \nbut I'll share just one. Kelly Therese Nachreiner was a bright, \nartistic teenager in the class of 2002. At 16, she went with her \nmother, Mary, to get her temporary driver's license. At that time, Mary \npointed out the donation question on the form for her license to Kelly, \nhaving no idea how her daughter would respond to this serious issue. \nKelly quickly responded, ``Well, of course, Mom, I mean if somebody can \nlive after me . . . if I'm dead why does it matter? Why do I want to \nkeep those organs? If I can save somebody else's life, why wouldn't \nI?'' Just one month later, her unselfish decision would save the lives \nof three people after she died as the result of an automobile accident. \nKelly not only saved those three lives, she also brought a spotlight to \nthe issue of organ and tissue donation awareness, which can potentially \nsave thousands more.\n  Mr. President, all of us would want to save somebody else's life if \nwe could. Let us continue to work together throughout National Organ \nand Tissue Donor Awareness Week and beyond, to promote organ and tissue \ndonation wherever we can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2713-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2713-S2714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ANNIVERSARY OF THE COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, next Thursday, April 20th, marks an \nimportant date in the hearts of the families of those killed inside \nColumbine High School, and for those who survived the horrible events \non that infamous day one year ago. Indeed, this day is important for \neveryone whose lives were touched by those tragic events.\n  I can think of no greater burden for a parent than to have to bury \none of his or her children. That burden is only magnified when a loved \none is taken with such unimaginable and unspeakable violence.\n  A year is not enough time to heal the scars created on that day; not \nfor the families of those taken, not for the children who were spared, \nnot for the community of Littleton, Colorado, and not for our nation.\n  While the events of that fateful day shall always be with us, so too \nis the memory of those slain and the strength of spirit they and their \nfamilies have given to all of us. Like the Columbine flower which \nreturns every Spring from under the darkness of winter, so too has a \nsense of community blossomed in Littleton and throughout the State of \nColorado in response to the horror of that day.\n  As a step toward healing, many groups, individuals, and entities from \nboth Colorado and our nation have worked to honor those who have died \nand to memorialize their passing in an appropriate and meaningful \nmanner.\n  In seems especially fitting that today I recognize with honor the \nparents and the families of those killed and wounded in the school that \nday who are working to raise money to replace the library at Columbine \nHigh School, the scene of much of the violence that occurred last April \n20.\n\n[[Page S2714]]\n\n  They have, to date, received pledges for nearly all of the estimated \n$3 million it will take to replace the library at Columbine High \nSchool. Other pending pledges could bring them close to the full amount \nthey need to replace this scene of horror with one of hope. This is \njust one outstanding example of a community pulling together in a \ngrassroots effort to lift itself up free of governmental intervention \nand regulation. I would encourage every American capable of sharing to \nhelp all of the families whose lives were abruptly and forever changed \nby the events at Columbine in whatever way they can.\n  Mr. President, there is good and evil present among us in human \nnature. We never know when we will be faced with either. I pray no \nfamily has ever to face the sadness and grief visited on the victims \nand the families of those in Columbine High School one year ago today. \nI also pray that peace comes to all of our families through the gentle \nspirit of all the victims taken from us in Columbine High School, and \nthose who will live with the pain caused that day. That spirit lives on \nin all of us and has been best described by the students and community \nof Littleton who proudly proclaim: ``We are Columbine.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2714-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CARHART V. STENBERG\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, on April 25, 2000 the United States \nSupreme Court will hear arguments in the Carhart v. Stenberg case. As a \nlifelong Nebraskan, I have received several requests to take a \nprominent public position with regard to this case, including a request \nthat I file an amicus brief, also known as a ``friend of the court'' \nbrief in this case. I am honored by these requests, but remain \ndetermined not to become officially involved in this case before the \nSupreme Court. I have come to believe that active involvement in \nmatters before the courts, particularly the U.S. Supreme Court, would \nbe an ineffective use of the power of the Senate office which I hold in \ntrust for all Nebraskans.\n  However, I do not want my silence and absence from these amicus \nbriefs to be mistaken for something that it is not. Because I have had \nseveral opportunities as a Nebraska Senator to debate this issue, and \nbecause this landmark case before the Supreme Court affects Nebraskans \ndirectly, I feel compelled to explain to Nebraskans my thoughts on this \nimportant issue.\n  On September 24, 1999, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a \nNebraska district court decision that a Nebraska statute banning a \nmedical procedure commonly known as ``partial-birth abortion'' is \nunconstitutional. The appellate court sustained the decision on the \ngrounds that the Nebraska law creates an undue burden on women seeking \nabortions.\n  It is my sincere belief that the Eight Circuit's decision should be \nsustained. In sum, the law adopted by the State of Nebraska (LB 23, \nJune 9, 1997) is too vague to be enforced without placing an undue \nburden on a woman making this difficult choice. The Supreme Court \nshould uphold the Eighth Circuit's decision because this law bans \nprocedures commonly used for second trimester abortions and will affect \nany Nebraska doctor who performs either the D (dilation and \nevacuation) or D (dilation and extraction) procedure. This statute \nmakes the act of performing legal medical procedures a Class III felony \n(up to 20 years in jail) and subjects a participating physician to the \nloss of his or her license.\n  Each year, five thousand women in Nebraska, with the help and counsel \nof their loved ones, their doctors and their clergy, face the very \ndifficult decision to end a pregnancy. None of us believe that they \nmake their decision lightly. They are guided by their moral beliefs and \nby the previous decisions of the Supreme Court giving elected State and \nFederal officials a legal foundation upon which to effectuate, and in \nsome cases limit, the scope of their choices.\n  The central problem with the Nebraska law is that legislators made no \nattempt to abide by previous Court decisions. Called the ``Partial \nBirth Abortion Ban'' by its sponsors, the bill has been inaccurately \ncharacterized as ``banning certain late term abortions.'' In reality, \nthe bill does not concern itself with late term abortions--neither \ncurbing them nor banning them--which the Court gives lawmakers the \ncapacity to do. Instead the bill seeks to ban a medical procedure used \nto end a pregnancy without reference to when that procedure is used. \nMoreover, it bans a medical intervention that is very difficult to \ndefine with the precision needed under law to give both doctors and \nthose who enforce the law the guidance they need.\n  Given this uncertainty, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals found \nthat LB 23 was unconstitutional. Writing for the majority, former Chief \nJudge Richard Arnold explained that it created an undue burden on women \nbecause, in many instances, it would ban the most common and safest \nprocedure for second-trimester abortions. The Court pointed out that \nthe term ``partial birth abortion'' has ``no fixed medical or legal \ncontent'' and that the Nebraska statute is too broad.\n  Most second and third-term abortions occur in situations where a \nwoman would have preferred, indeed desperately wanted, to carry the \nbaby full term. The doctor made a recommendation based upon a threat to \nthe life and health of the mother if the pregnancy were to continue. A \nlaw like Nebraska's would make doctors who perform this procedure \nliable for prosecution, with penalties that include loss of their \nlicense to practice medicine and time in jail. The threat of these \npenalties could result in physicians choosing not to treat women with a \nhistory of high-risk pregnancies.\n  We are wrong to presume that women no longer die during child birth \nor abortion. Medical science has reduced but not eliminated the risk \nassociated with either. We must not deny women their ability to freely \nchoose to undergo an abortion, or the access to physician care \nnecessary to ensure their safety.\n  Freedom of choice in reproductive decision-making is a constitutional \nguarantee established by this Court with limitations. Nebraska's law \nfundamentally ignores the limitations allowed and not allowed by the \nCourt's previous decisions. If it is sustained, it will imperil the \nsafety and well-being of women throughout our state. We cannot allow \nmisinformation to obscure the broad consensus in America that women \nmust decide for themselves how best to live their lives. Moreover, it \nis equally important that no one be denied the safe and appropriate \nmedical treatment necessary to make a reproductive decision which this \nlaw would do.\n  It is my hope that this statement will help Nebraskans better \nunderstand my position on this very important matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2714-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2714-S2715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PIPELINE SAFETY\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to share with my colleagues \nsome recent developments on the pipeline safety legislation I \nintroduced two months ago. I'm pleased to report that in the past week, \nwe've made a lot of progress.\n  About 10 months have passed since a gasoline pipeline in Bellingham, \nWashington ruptured--spilling more than 275,000 gallons of gasoline. \nThat pipeline disaster killed three young people, and left thousands of \npeople in my state wondering about the safety of the pipelines near \ntheir homes.\n  We can't undo what happened in Bellingham--it will never be the same. \nBut we can make sure that what happened in Bellingham doesn't happen \nanywhere else.\n  There are 2.2 million miles of pipelines running across the country--\nbringing us the energy we need to fuel our cars and heat our homes. \nThey run near our schools, houses and communities. We have a \nresponsibility to make sure these pipelines are safe. And it is clear \nthat the current laws are not sufficient.\n  That's why I introduced my pipeline safety bill back in January. \nSince that time, I have been meeting with the Administration, with \nSenators, safety officials, citizen groups, and industry \nrepresentatives.\n  This week, I spoke at a national conference on pipeline safety here \nin Washington, D.C. It was hosted by the National Pipeline Reform \nCoalition, SAFE Bellingham, and the Cascade Columbia Alliance.\n  I can tell you that people all across the country are following this \nissue closely, they understand the problem, and they are calling for \naction.\n\n[[Page S2715]]\n\n  I want to be clear. We cannot wait any longer--and we can certainly \nnot let this year pass without improving our nation's inadequate \npipeline safety laws.\n  The danger posed by aging, corroded pipelines is not going away. In \nfact, it's getting worse.\n  Since 1986, there have been more than 5,700 pipeline accidents, 325 \ndeaths, 1,500 injuries. More than $850 million in environmental damage. \nOn average there is 1 pipeline accident every day, and 6 million \nhazardous gallons are spilled every year.\n  In the two months since I introduced my pipeline safety bill, at \nleast 20 states--almost half of the country--have experienced pipeline \naccidents. Let me repeat that. In just two months, 20 more states have \nhad pipeline accidents.\n  Just last week there was a major pipeline spill in Maryland. The \nclock is ticking, and the list of affected communities is growing.\n  Back home in Washington state, there is a great deal of impatience \nthat Congress has not acted on pipeline safety measures. This editorial \nby the Bellingham Herald--from April 5th--gives you a good sense of how \nmany of my constituents feel.\n  It's titled, Wake Up, Pipeline Bill Is On The Way. It's addressed to \nCongress, and it says, in part:\n\n       Don't know if you had a chance to look at our pipeline \n     bill, but we're sending you a message. We want you to hear us \n     loud and clear.\n\n  And later it says:\n\n       * * * even though what happened in Bellingham could happen \n     in any one of your home states, we feel you aren't giving \n     this issue much attention.\n\n  As this editorial says--these accidents can happen in any of our \nstates. I don't want another community to go through what the people of \nBellingham, Washington have gone through. We can make pipelines safer \ntoday.\n  My bill addresses five key areas of pipeline safety: My bill will \nexpand state authority over pipeline safety. My bill will improve \ninspection and prevention practices. My bill will invest in new safety \ntechnology. My bill will expand the public's right to know about \nproblems with pipelines. Finally, my bill will increase funding to \nimprove pipeline safety by providing funds for new state and federal \npipeline safety programs.\n  I'm proud to say that we are making progress. And I want to share \nwith you some recent developments.\n  Yesterday, Senator McCain announced that he has scheduled a hearing \non pipeline safety for May 11, and he has committed to marking up a \npipeline safety bill by the end of May. He also introduced his own \npipeline safety bill.\n  As you may recall, in February, I sent a letter to Senator McCain \nasking for a hearing. Last week, I spoke with him in person about it, \nand he pledged to work with me on this issue. As he told me, ``this is \nthe right thing to do.''\n  I would like to commend Senator McCain for moving the process \nforward. I would also like to share with the Senate the important work \ndone by the parents of the young people who were killed in the \nBellingham explosion, especially Mr. Frank King. On Tuesday, Mr. King \nmet with Senator McCain's staff, and in bringing his own personal story \nto the Senate--he has helped move this legislation forward.\n  I'm pleased today to become the Democratic sponsor of Senator \nMcCain's bill. This bill contains many of the elements of the \nlegislation I introduced back in January. The bill also includes some \nof the good elements of the Administration's proposal, which was \nintroduced this week.\n  Senator McCain, as chairman of the Commerce Committee, has done a \nservice to our nation and the state of Washington by providing his \nleadership on this important topic.\n  During the committee process, I hope we can all work together in a \nbipartisan manner to make the McCain-Murray bill even more effective at \nimproving pipeline safety. There is still a long way to go, and I look \nforward to working with Senator McCain on this important issue.\n  Another step forward took place this week, when the Clinton/Gore \nAdministration sent its pipeline safety proposal to Congress. Working \nwith us, the Administration has crafted a proposal which includes many \nof my priorities: It places a clear value on the importance of safety. \nIt strengthens community ``right to know'' provisions. It improves \ninspection standards. It invests in research and development for \ninspection devices. And it increases penalties for safety violations.\n  This proposal is a good first step, and now we will work to improve \nit. Clearly, there are some differences on the partnership with states \nprovisions and other areas, and I will be working to strengthen them \nwithin the legislative process. I should add that the Administration's \nbill has been introduced in the Senate by Senators Hollings and \nSarbanes, and in the House by Representatives Shuster, Oberstar, \nFranks, and Wise.\n  I want to commend the Vice President, who learned about this issue \nwhen he was in Washington state. He recognized the importance of \npipeline safety, and he has been working to prompt the Administration \nto act quickly. I also appreciate the work Transportation Secretary \nRodney Slater has done. Shortly after the explosion, he stationed a \npipeline inspector in Washington state.\n  So clearly we are making some progress, but there is still much more \nto do. Unfortunately, the Senate leadership has not expressed a lot of \ninterest in pipeline safety.\n  I recently received a note from the majority leader's office--listing \nalmost 50 bills that he has deemed ``Legislative Calendar Items'' which \nhe hopes to consider prior to the August recess. Pipeline safety was \nnot on his list. Now, I know priority lists are flexible, and I hope we \ncan get a pipeline safety bill through the committee and onto the \nSenate floor for consideration before August.\n  We need to pass a pipeline safety bill, and we need to do it now. I \nagain ask my colleagues to stand with the thousands of people who have \nbeen adversely affected by pipeline disasters and pass a bill that will \nmake sure no other community has to suffer from another pipeline \ndisaster.\n  We have a strong pipeline safety bill. We have Administration \nsupport. And we have a commitment from the Commerce Committee \nleadership to pass legislation this year.\n  This is our chance for safer pipelines, for safer communities, and \nfor peace of mind. We have a bill. It's up to this Congress, this year \nto make sure this opportunity doesn't pass us by.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2715-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on the \nLibrary, it is my great pleasure to congratulate the Library of \nCongress, and Dr. Billington, the Librarian on the occasion of the \nLibrary's Bicentennial. The Library is America's oldest Federal \ncultural institution, and was established on April 24, 1800. It houses \nthe largest and most extensive collection in history, and is one of the \nnation's assets. Congress is very proud of\n\n[[Page S2716]]\n\nthe Library, and the role it plays in ensuring free public access to \ninformation. As we move forward into the new millennium, efforts are \nunderway to enhance public access to the collections of the Library \nthrough the National Digital Library.\n  The Library has planned a wonderful day of activities on Monday, \nApril 24, in honor of Thomas Jefferson's birthday. It was Thomas \nJefferson's collection of 6,487 books that first began the Library's \ncollections. The events include the issuance of the first bimetallic \ncommemorative coin, and a postage stamp featuring a color photograph of \nthe interior dome and several of the arched windows in the Jefferson \nbuilding. At noon there will be a birthday party and concert outside on \nthe East Lawn of the Capitol.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following message from the Librarian \nof Congress, and press announcements of the exhibits and events \nassociated with the Bicentennial of the Library be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Library of Congress Bicentennial Celebration--A Message from the \n                   Librarian of Congress, March 2000\n\n       The Library of Congress--America's national library and \n     oldest federal cultural institution--will celebrate its \n     Bicentennial in the year 2000. We want to make our 200th \n     birthday a national celebration of the important role that \n     libraries play in our democratic society. Our goal is to \n     inspire creativity in the century ahead by stimulating \n     greater use of the Library of Congress and libraries across \n     the country.\n       The centerpiece of this effort is an unprecedented project \n     called ``Local Legacies,'' an attempt to celebrate and share \n     with the nation the grassroots creativity of every part of \n     America. The Library of Congress will ask each Member of \n     Congress to lead an effort to find or create documentation \n     for at least one significant cultural event or tradition that \n     has been important to or representative of your district or \n     state as we reach the end of this century. Selections from \n     each documentation project will be forwarded to the Library \n     and added to the rich collections of our American Folklife \n     Center's Archive of Folk Culture to provide a rich cross \n     section of the grassroots creativity of America that will be \n     preserved and shared with future generations.\n       We also plan to digitize selections and share them \n     electronically, free of charge over the Internet, through our \n     National Digital Library Program. All participants and each \n     Member of Congress will be credited with helping locate a \n     distinctive contribution from his or her district or state. \n     This is an especially exciting and historic initiative \n     because we hope to receive and celebrate the widest possible \n     range of contributions, including video, sound, print, \n     manuscript and electronic formats.\n       Several other bicentennial activities embrace the broadest \n     participation of all Americans and encourage an understanding \n     of the creative roles that libraries play in modern society \n     and in social scholarly discourse. Included among them are \n     symposia such as ``Frontiers of the Mind in the 21st \n     Century,'' which brought together distinguished scholars who \n     examined the exciting horizons for knowledge in the century \n     ahead in a symposium held in June and now available on the \n     Library's Web site (www.loc.gov). Poet Laureate Robert \n     Pinsky's ``Favorite Poem'' program will create audio and \n     video archives of Americans of all ages and backgrounds \n     reading their favorite poems. Two commemorative coins and a \n     stamp will be issued in honor of the Library's 200th \n     birthday, April 24, 2000. Also on that day, the Library will \n     launch a new education Web site for families that will \n     complement our widely acclaimed American Memory site for \n     students and teachers. Another special initiative, ``Gifts to \n     the Nation,'' will encourage benefactors to bring rare and \n     important acquisitions to the national collection in the \n     Library of Congress.\n       I invite you to learn more about our Bicentennial, and I \n     encourage you to participate in the programs and activities \n     marking our 200th birthday. As you reflect on our nation's \n     accomplishments as we near the end of the century, you may \n     recall the Jeffersonian principle upon which the Library of \n     Congress was built--that free access to information and \n     knowledge is one of the cornerstones of democracy.\n                                              James H.

Congress purchased Jefferson's library after \n     its own collections, housed in the U.S. Capitol, were burned \n     by the British in 1814.\n       That library--the original volumes that came to Washington \n     in carts from Monticello--will be a major feature of the \n     ``Thomas Jefferson'' exhibition. Because of an 1851 fire in \n     the Library, many of those original books had been lost. \n     Spurred by a very generous donation of Jerry and Gene Jones, \n     as a\n\n[[Page S2717]]\n\n     Bicentennial ``Gift to the Nation,'' the Library has been \n     reassembling copies of the same editions of the works that \n     Jefferson held. The reconstituted Jefferson's library should \n     be more than 90 percent complete by April 24.\n       The display of Jefferson's library as part of this \n     exhibition will be the first time ever that the public will \n     be able to view Jefferson's library. It is also the first \n     time that the volumes have been assembled in one place in the \n     original order that Jefferson himself devised since the \n     collection came to Washington in 1815. Visitors to the \n     exhibition will be able to tell which volumes were owned by \n     Jefferson and sold to Congress in 1815, which were recently \n     identified and pulled from the Library's general collections, \n     which have been recently purchased, and which are still \n     missing.\n       ``Thomas Jefferson'' will be on view in the Northwest \n     Gallery and Pavilion of the Thomas Jefferson Building, 10 \n     First Street S.E., from April 24 through October 31. Hours \n     for the exhibition are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday-Saturday.\n       Items from the exhibition are available on the Library's \n     Web site at www.loc.gov, and by April 24 the Library's entire \n     collection of Jefferson Papers (more than 25,000 items) will \n     be accessible on-line.\n       Thomas Jefferson--founding father, farmer, architect, \n     inventor, slaveholder, book collector, scholar, diplomat and \n     third president of the United States--was a complex figure \n     who contributed immeasurably to the creation of the new \n     republicanism in America. Wherever Anglo-American culture has \n     shaped political and intellectual developments, Jefferson is \n     almost inevitably part of the mix. Drawing on the \n     extraordinary written legacy of Thomas Jefferson that is held \n     in the Library's collections, the exhibition traces \n     Jefferson's development from his earliest days in Virginia to \n     an ever-expanding realm of influence in republican Virginia, \n     the American Revolutionary government, the creation of the \n     American nation, the revolution in individual rights in \n     America and the world, the revolution in France, and the \n     burgeoning republican revolutionary movement throughout the \n     world. Items borrowed from other institutions contribute to \n     the exhibition's attempt to offer viewers a fully rounded \n     portrait of the nation's third president.\n       The exhibition focuses on the complexities and \n     contradictions of Thomas Jefferson, the man, the myth, the \n     model. He was simultaneously an unquenchable idealist and a \n     third-headed realist. He deplored inequality among men, but \n     owned slaves, supported servitude, and relegated women to a \n     secondary role. He supported freedom of the press until his \n     own foibles and politics became the focus. He was a firm \n     believer in the separation of church and state, but he was \n     often accused of being anti-Christian. He expounded the \n     virtues of public education, ensured that his own daughters \n     were well educated, and founded a public university at \n     Charlottesville, but he assumed that access to higher \n     education would be strictly limited. His life embodies the \n     public and private struggles of life in a democratic \n     republic.\n       Some 150 items in the eight sections will illustrate and \n     provide a context for the life and character of Thomas \n     Jefferson. The final and ninth section will be the \n     reassembled ``Jefferson Library.'' Visitors to the exhibition \n     will see such items as the only surviving fragment of the \n     earliest known draft of the Declaration of Independence as \n     well as the desk on which he composed the Declaration; \n     Martha Jefferson's thread case; Jefferson's instructions \n     to Lewis and Clark; political cartoons of the day \n     lampooning Jefferson; and the last letter that Thomas \n     Jefferson wrote to the mayor of the city of Washington \n     just 10 days before he died, espousing his vision of the \n     Declaration of Independence and the American nation as \n     signals of the blessings of self-government to an ever-\n     evolving world.\n       ``Life and Labor at Monticello'' examines how Jefferson's \n     family, his era, education, role as plantation master and \n     slaveholder, and his love and use of books influenced his \n     character and the formation of his ideas on individual and \n     institutional rights and limits. Items include:\n       Thomas Jefferson's Memorandum Book, 1773, where he kept \n     detailed records on his expenditures including the purchase \n     of slaves;\n       Plantation account books kept by Jefferson's wife and then \n     his granddaughter, recording purchases made from Monticello \n     slaves, especially the Hemings family, for vegetables and \n     fowl from the slave families' own flocks and gardens;\n       The 1873 memoir by Madison Hemings published in the Pike \n     County (Ohio) Republican, who testified that his mother, \n     Sally Hemings, gave birth to five children ``and Jefferson \n     was the father of them all.'' Historical evidence, both \n     circumstantial and direct, documentary and oral, along with \n     DNA testing in 1998, substantiates Hemings' assertion;\n       Letters Jefferson exchanged in 1791 with Benjamin Banneker, \n     a free black living in Maryland, in which Jefferson praised \n     Banneker's mathematical accomplishment (``no body wishes more \n     than I do to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has \n     given to our black brethren, talents equal to those of the \n     other colors of men * * *'') as well as with Abbe Henri \n     Gregoire in 1809 trying to explain why he asserted the \n     inferiority of African Americans in his Notes on the State of \n     Virginia published in 1785; and\n       Letter written by Thomas Jefferson to John Adams in 1815 in \n     which he says, ``I cannot live without books, but fewer will \n     suffice where amusement, and not use, is the only future \n     object.''\n       The exhibition continues by demonstrating the expanding \n     influence of Jefferson on American life and his interest in \n     creating a culture based on republican principles--first in \n     his own state of Virginia, then on the federal scene with his \n     drafting of the Declaration of Independence and his \n     election to the presidency in 1800. On view are:\n       One of the nation's greatest treasures--Jefferson's \n     ``original Rough draught'' of the Declaration of \n     Independence. The ``Rough draught'' is the final draft \n     presented by Jefferson to his fellow committee members and \n     indicates changes made by John Adams and Benjamin Franklin;\n       Fragment of the earliest known draft of the Declaration of \n     Independence in Jefferson's hand;\n       An 1806 document in President Jefferson's hand calling upon \n     Congress to end the practice of importing slaves as soon as \n     permitted by the U.S. Constitution in 1808; and\n       Notes on the State of Virginia, 1785, the only book ever \n     published by Thomas Jefferson.\n       ``The West'' explores Thomas Jefferson's persistent \n     fascination with the vast part of the continent that lay \n     beyond Virginia--an area he never saw--and his conviction \n     that the new nation had to expand westward in order to \n     survive. A highlight is Jefferson's instructions to the \n     explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark before they set \n     out to map and explore the Western territories with their \n     Corps of Discovery in 1803. Visitors can also see a Nicholas \n     King manuscript map documenting the Lewis and Clark \n     expedition that is annotated by Lewis with information from \n     fur traders and Native Americans.\n       The influence of Jefferson's republican ideas were felt far \n     beyond America, especially in France, his first experience on \n     the world stage beyond America. He became an ardent supporter \n     of the French revolution and often consulted with Lafayette \n     during the drafting of the French Declaration of the Rights \n     of Man. In a July 9, 1789, letter to Jefferson, Lafayette \n     asked him for his ``observations'' on ``my bill of rights'' \n     before presenting it to the National Assembly. On view in the \n     exhibition is a manuscript copy of the French Declaration \n     written in a clerical hand, with emendations in the hand of \n     Thomas Jefferson. Also in the exhibition is the 1789 passport \n     that Thomas Jefferson used upon his return from France, \n     signed by King Louis XVI.\n       The exhibition concludes with ``Epitaph: Take Care of Me,'' \n     which reviews Jefferson's own evaluation of the meaning of \n     his life and his thoughts about how he would be viewed by \n     history. Key items here are: A sketch and wording for \n     Jefferson's tombstone, in his own hand; A letter explaining \n     his position on slavery, written just six weeks before his \n     death; A letter to Jefferson from his granddaughter, Ellen \n     Randolph Coolidge, despairing of the ``canker of slavery'' \n     that oppresses the Southern states; and A newspaper account \n     of the sale of Jefferson's slaves by his heirs in order to \n     pay off estate debts.\n       A volume accompanying the exhibition, Thomas Jefferson: \n     Genius of Liberty, includes an introduction by Garry Wills \n     and essays by Jefferson scholars Pauline Maier, Charles A. \n     Miller, Annette Gordon-Reed, Peter S. Onuf and Joseph J. \n     Ellis. Published by Viking Studio, the hardcover volume is \n     highly illustrated with mostly color images and sells for \n     $35. It is available in major bookstores and from the \n     Library's Sales Shops; order with major credit card by \n     calling (202) 707-0204.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          Commemorative Coins and Stamp Issues for the Nation\n\n       The Bicentennial of the Library of Congress presents a \n     unique opportunity for commemorative items. Commemorative \n     coins and a commemorative stamp for the Library's \n     Bicentennial will be issued on April 24, the Library's 200th \n     birthday.\n       The Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee \n     recommended enactment of legislation to mint a commemorative \n     coin to honor the Library of Congress's Bicentennial. As one \n     of only two commemorative coins to be issued in 2000, this is \n     an extraordinary honor for the Library. The Library's coin \n     will be the nation's first bimetallic coin (gold and \n     platinum) and the first commemorative with the new millennium \n     date.\n       The minting of commemorative coins requires passage of \n     legislation by both chambers of the U.S. Congress. The coin \n     bill (H.R. 3790) was passed by the House of Representatives \n     on August 4, 1998, and by the Senate on October 6. President \n     Clinton signed the bill into law as P.L. 105-268 on October \n     19, 1998. The design of the commemorative coins by sculptors \n     and engravers at the Philadelphia Mint is under way.\n       The Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee, a group of \n     independent citizens appointed by the Postmaster General to \n     review the more than 40,000 suggestions for stamp subjects \n     received by the U.S. Postal Service annually, recommended a \n     commemorative stamp for issuance in honor of the Library's \n     birthday. Ethel Kessler, the designer of the breast cancer \n     stamp, designed the Library's Bicentennial commemorative \n     stamp, which features a photograph by Michael Freeman of the \n     interior dome and several of the arched windows in the main \n     Reading Room in the 1897 Thomas Jefferson Building.\n\n[[Page S2718]]\n\n       The stamp will be issued on April 24, 2000, during a \n     ceremony to be held in the Jefferson Building in Washington. \n     From April 25 through May 31, state and local libraries \n     across the country will hold issuance ceremonies to celebrate \n     the Library's birthday and to applaud the important role of \n     libraries throughout the United States.\n       How You Can Participate: If your library or other \n     institution would like to sponsor a second-day-issue event, \n     contact Kathy Woodrell in the Bicentennial Program Office at \n     (800) 707-7145 or kwoo@loc.gov.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           The Local Legacies\n\n       The Local Legacies project is an opportunity for citizens \n     to participate in the Library of Congress's Bicentennial \n     Program. Working through their U.S. senator or representative \n     and with hometown libraries, folklife organizations and other \n     local cultural institutions, Americans everywhere have been \n     participating in an unprecedented effort to document the \n     cultural heritage of communities throughout the nation.\n       What is a local legacy?\n       It is a traditional activity or event that merits being \n     documented for future generations. A Local Legacy might \n     include the music, crafts or food customs that represent \n     traditional life. Examples of defining or signature events \n     include a rodeo, powwow, auction, market-day celebration, \n     parade, procession or festival. Local Legacies might also \n     include the artistry of individuals performing traditional \n     music or dance, or working at crafts or trades. From zydeco \n     music to decoy carving, rodeos to dogsled races, parades to \n     food festivals, the Local Legacies project is reaching into \n     every corner of the nation to document America's folk \n     heritage.\n       More than 1,000 Local Legacies projects, which were \n     selected by members of Congress in every state and the \n     District of Columbia, celebrate the nation's diversity as a \n     source of its strength and vitality. As a whole, the projects \n     will serve as a snapshot of everyday life in America at the \n     turn of the 21st century and will be preserved in the \n     Library's Folklife Center and made available for study by \n     others.\n       On May 23, the Library of Congress will celebrate these \n     cultural and historical contributions to the Bicentennial \n     with participants and their Congressional representatives. \n     Selections from the Local Legacies projects will be digitized \n     and shared electronically over the Internet at www.loc.gov, \n     where Americans for generations to come will be able to learn \n     about their cultural heritage.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              A New Collection of America's Favorite Poems\n\n       Poet Laureate of the United States Robert Pinsky launched \n     the Favorite Poem Project with poetry readings in New York, \n     Washington, Boston, St. Louis and Los Angeles in April 1998, \n     during National Poetry Month. A part of the Library of \n     Congress Bicentennial celebration, the Project has created \n     audio and video archives of Americans of all ages, \n     backgrounds and walks of life reciting their favorite poems. \n     At the heart of this initiative is Mr. Pinsky's belief that \n     poetry is meant to be read aloud.\n       ``The archives will be a record at the end of the \n     millennium of what we choose and what we do with our voices \n     and faces, when asked to say aloud a poem that we love,'' \n     said Mr. Pinsky, appointed Poet Laureate in 1997 by Librarian \n     of Congress James H. Billington. Mr. Pinsky is serving an \n     unprecedented third term as Poet Laureate.\n       The two long-term goals of the Favorite Poem Project are to \n     promote the reading and appreciation of poetry and encourage \n     the teaching of poetry in schools nationwide. Collaborating \n     with Mr. Pinsky are the New England Foundation for the Arts, \n     which administers the program, the Library of Congress, which \n     is the home of the Poet Laureate, and Boston University.\n       The Project aims to record up to 1,000 Americans saying \n     poems that they love. Mr. Pinsky will deliver the first 50 \n     audio and video segments to the Library of Congress as part \n     of a Library-sponsored poetry symposium scheduled for April \n     3-4, 2000. The audio and video tapes will become a permanent \n     part of the Library's Archive of Recorded Poetry and \n     Literature. ``This will be a gift to the nation's future: an \n     archive that may come to represent, in a form both individual \n     and public, the collective cultural consciousness of the \n     American people at the turn of the century,'' said Mr. \n     Pinsky, a professor of English and creative writing at Boston \n     University.\n       For information on the Favorite Poem Project, visit the \n     Project's Web site at www.bu.edu/favoritepoem/.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      New Radio Series to Air for Library of Congress Bicentennial\n\n       ``Favorite Poets.'' a series of four one-hour programs of \n     American poets interviewed by Grace Cavalieri, will air on \n     public radio during National Poetry Month, April 2000, In \n     Washington, D.C., the series will be heard on WPFW-FM on \n     Sundays at 9 p.m. on April 16 and 23.

Merwin. The poets, recorded at the \n     Library of Congress, honor the Library's Bicentennial \n     celebration on April 24, as well as National Poetry Month.\n       Each program presents the poets reading their work, a \n     discussion of the writing process, and a portrait of the poet \n     through conversation and interview, with an entertaining look \n     at the personal and poetic lives of each of these literary \n     figures. The poetry archives at the Library are among the \n     largest and most comprehensive in the world.\n       Grace Cavalieri, host of the series, is a familiar voice on \n     public radio, having presented more than 2,000 poets through \n     her program ``The Poet and the Poem'' on WPFW-FM from 1977 to \n     1997. She has had 11 books of poetry published, and a number \n     of her plays have been produced throughout the country and \n     Off-Broadway. She has received the Allen Ginsberg Award for \n     Poetry, the Pen Syndicated Prize for Fiction, and the Silver \n     Medal from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for \n     ``entertainment and innovation in radio.''\n       ``Favorite Poets'' will be distributed nationally via NPR \n     satellite, Interested listeners should contact their local \n     public radio stations for times and dates of airing.

The publication is one of several planned to celebrate \n     the Library's Bicentennial on April 24, 2000.\n       The Library was founded in 1800 with the primary mission of \n     serving the research needs of the United States Congress. \n     During the past two centuries the collections have evolved \n     into the largest repository of knowledge in the world and are \n     accessible to all Americans. The Library maintains a \n     collection of nearly 119 million books, maps, manuscripts, \n     photographs, motion pictures, sound recordings and digital \n     materials in some 460 languages.\n       ``In America's Library, James Conaway invites you to learn \n     the story of this great and complex institution, during its \n     two centuries of development, as the men and women within its \n     walls collect, preserve, and make useful the heritage it \n     holds,'' said Librarian of Congress James H. Billington. \n     ``Its collections represent and celebrate the many and varied \n     ways that one generation has informed another.''\n       This lively account of the Library of Congress is filled \n     with an immense cast of characters ranging from presidents, \n     poets, journalists, and members of Congress to collectors, \n     artists, curators, and eccentrics. The author focuses the \n     Library's 200 year history on the 13 men who have been \n     appointed by presidents to lead the Library of Congress. He \n     investigates how the Librarians' experiences and \n     contributions, as well as the Library's collections, have \n     reflected political and intellectual developments in the \n     United States. Each Librarian confronted great challenges: \n     the entire Library collection was lost when the British \n     burned the Capitol in 1814, and rebuilt a year later with \n     Thomas Jefferson's personal library; in the 1940s, a backlog \n     of 1.5 million objects waited to be cataloged; the gigantic \n     task of replacing the card catalog with a computerized system \n     was undertaken in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the current \n     Librarian, Dr. Billington, has expanded the reach of the \n     institution nationwide through the National Digital Library \n     Program (www.loc.gov). The Library's widely acclaimed Web \n     site is one of the most heavily used in the federal \n     government.\n       Yet each Librarian also enjoyed the excitement of acquiring \n     unique treasures--from Walt Whitman's walking stick to the \n     papers of the Wright brothers, from the Civil War photographs \n     of Mathew Brady to the archives of Leonard Bernstein. The \n     thrill of using these collections in the Library's Thomas \n     Jefferson building is conveyed in the book's introduction, \n     ``One Writer's Library,'' by biographer Edmund Morris:\n       ``Those lights, those glowing rectangles and portholes, are \n     windows into the central repository of our nation's cultural \n     intelligence: a cerebellum, a sanctum of free thought forever \n     energized by the spirit of Thomas Jefferson.''\n       Conaway is the author of eight books, including The \n     Smithsonian: 150 Years of Adventure, Discovery and Wonder, \n     copublished by Smithsonian Books and Alfred A. Knopf in \n     connection with the Smithsonian's 150th anniversary \n     celebration in 1996. He is the former Washington editor of \n     Harper's and has written for many publications: Civilization, \n     The Atlantic Monthly, The New York Times Magazine, National \n     Geographic, and Preservation.\n       America's Library--a 256-page, hardbound book--is available \n     for $39.95 in major bookstores and from the Library of \n     Congress Sales Shops (Credit card orders: 202-707-0204).\n                                  ____\n\n\n    The Wizard of Oz is Saluted in Library of Congress Bicentennial \n                               Exhibition\n\n       The ``yellow brick road'' leads to the Library of Congress \n     on April 21 with the opening of an exhibition marking the \n     100th anniversary of one of America's most beloved stories, \n     The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The Library's Copyright Office \n     registered this work by L. Frank Baum in 1900, and it has \n     gone on\n\n[[Page S2719]]\n\n     to become one of the most profitable and well-known copyright \n     ever issued.\n       Since its publication, the book has outsold all other \n     children's books in numerous editions. It has also inspired a \n     long series of sequels, stage plays and musicals, movies and \n     television shows, biographics of Baum, scholarly studies of \n     the significance of the book and film, advertisements, toys, \n     games and all sorts of Oz-related products.\n       Drawing on the Library's unparalleled collection of books, \n     posters, films, sheet music, manuscripts and sound \n     recordings, ``The Wizard of Oz: An American Fairy Tale'' \n     examines the creation of this timeless American classic and \n     traces its rapid and enduring success and its impact on \n     American popular culture. It can be seen in the South Gallery \n     of the Great Hall of the Thomas Jefferson Building from April \n     21 through September 23. Hours for the exhibition are 10 a.m. \n     to 5:30 p.m. Monday-Saturday.\n       Approximately 100 items in a variety of formats will be on \n     view from the Library's collections, including play scripts, \n     rare books, photographs, posters, drawings, manuscripts, \n     maps, sheet music and film, as well as three-dimensional \n     objects such as figurines, dolls, games and toys. The Library \n     will supplement its own large holdings with items borrowed \n     from other museums, libraries and private collectors.\n       Of particular interest to visitors of the exhibition will \n     be items related to the classic 1939 film ``The Wizard of \n     Oz,'' including a pair of the ruby slippers (size 5B) worn by \n     Judy Garland as Dorothy; the sacrecrow costume worn by Ray \n     Bolger; the mane and beard worn by Bert Lahr as the Cowardly \n     Lion; a Munchkin costume; and an Emerald City townsman's \n     coat. These are supplemented with publicity shots and \n     photographs taken on the set of the film, related sheet \n     music, recordings, magazine advertisements, posters and lobby \n     cards, from the Library's own collections. Clips from other \n     Oz films--from early silents to ``The Wiz''--will be shown on \n     a video kiosk.\n       L. Frank Baum's ability to make fantastic circumstances \n     seem plausble, combined with illustrator W.W. Denslow's \n     striking color plates and line drawings, produced a volume \n     that was innovative both in style and presentation. The first \n     edition of the book, along with the original copyright \n     application handwritten by Baum, will be on display along \n     with six of the black-and-white Denslow illustrations for the \n     book. Some of Baum's pre-Oz books will be shown, along with a \n     selection of other books set in the ``Land of Oz'' authored \n     by Baum.\n       Children especially will be fascinated with the selection \n     of Oz-related souvenirs and novelties including plates, \n     figurines, games, greeting cards, Christmas ornaments, music \n     boxes, paper dolls and coloring books.\n       For nearly 130 years, the Copyright Office in the Library \n     of Congress has served as America's ``national registry for \n     creative works.'' The 1870 law that centralized the copyright \n     function in the Library of Congress--and set up the copyright \n     deposit system that systematically brings two copies of every \n     item registered for copyright to the Library--helped to \n     create the unequaled national collections that form the core \n     of today's Library of Congress.\n       Through the copyright records, one can trace the career of \n     Frank Baum, America's great fantasist, who lived from 1856 to \n     1919, beginning with the 1882 copyright registration for \n     Baum's first theatrical venture, Maid of Arran, to the \n     publication of the last book in his Oz series, Glinda of Oz, \n     published in 1920.\n                                  ____\n\n\n New Book Features the Architecture of the Library's Thomas Jefferson \n                                Building\n\n       The Library of Congress: An Architectural Alphabet will be \n     published in April by the Library of Congress in cooperation \n     with Pomegranate Press. The publication is one of several \n     planned to celebrate the Library's Bicentennial on April 24, \n     2000.\n       Across the street from the United States Capitol in \n     Washington, D.C., stands the first of the three Library of \n     Congress buildings. The Thomas Jefferson Building, completed \n     in 1897 and named for the president in 1980, is a landmark in \n     the nation's capital as well as one of the country's great \n     architectural treasures.\n       ``At the heart of all our efforts stands the Jefferson \n     Building, a heroic structure that is at once celebratory, \n     inspirational, and educational,'' said Librarian of Congress \n     James H. Billington. ``Few places represent human aspiration \n     in such dramatic fashion.''\n       The Library of Congress: An Architectural Alphabet opens \n     doors into many of the extraordinary spaces and features that \n     rest within the 600,000 square feet enclosed by the \n     building's historic walls. The book offers an illustrated \n     tour of the Library's art, architecture, and sculpture, \n     created by some 50 artists and artisans. From A (for arch) to \n     Z (for zigzag), it explores the Jefferson Building's unusual \n     architectural details--egg-and-dart molding, helixes, jambs, \n     pilasters, quoins, spandrels, tripods, vaults, and even an X-\n     motif printer's mark. Illustrations and descriptions are \n     joined by a colorful alphabet drawn from the Library's \n     collection of rare books and manuscripts.\n                                  ____\n\n       Visitors must allot many hours to see all of this \n     landmark's 409,000 cubic feet of granite, 22 million red \n     bricks, 500,000 enameled bricks, 2,165 windows, 15 varieties \n     of marble, untold numbers of classical columns, and millions \n     of items.

For nearly 200 years, the Library has collected \n     and preserved our national cultural heritage. The collection \n     of nearly 119 million items housed in the Library represents \n     America's ``creative legacy,'' and ranges from books, maps \n     and manuscripts to photographs, motion pictures and music. \n     Copyright deposits have been a major source for the Library's \n     collections, yet the Library has also received a significant \n     portion of its unparalleled collections as special gifts from \n     donors, collectors and Americans who aspire to preserve our \n     national heritage for generations to come.\n       Without the generosity of such benefactors, the Library \n     would not have the diaries of Orville and Wilbur Wright, the \n     music of George and Ira Gershwin and Leonard Bernstein, the \n     outstanding Stern Collection of Abraham Lincoln materials, \n     the Rosenwald Collection of rare illustrated books from as \n     far back as the 15th century, or its largest manuscript \n     collection--from the NAACP.\n       The Library has identified additional materials that, \n     because of their significance to American life and learning, \n     belong in the national library, where they will be preserved \n     and made available for future generations of Americans. Gifts \n     to the Nation is an opportunity to support the acquisition of \n     these important cultural legacies.\n       A very special undertaking is the effort to rebuild the \n     original core of the Library--Thomas Jefferson's vast and \n     diverse personal collection--which he sold to Congress after \n     the British burned the U.S. Capitol, including the Library of \n     Congress, in 1814. Tragically, in 1851, nearly two-thirds of \n     Jefferson's library was destroyed in another Capitol fire. \n     Jefferson believed that there was ``no subject to which a \n     member of Congress may not have the occasion to refer,'' and \n     reconstructing his wide-ranging collection, the scope of \n     which is reflected in the current Library of Congress \n     holdings, will provide new insights into the mind of one of \n     our nation's greatest thinkers and reinforce the Jeffersonian \n     principle upon which the Library of Congress was built--that \n     free access of information and knowledge is one of the \n     cornerstones of democracy.\n       To enhance the research opportunities at the Library, the \n     Bicentennial celebration also includes giving opportunities \n     for Endowed Chairs, Endowed Curatorships and National Focal \n     Points of Scholarship. Support of these programs will ensure \n     that experts from diverse fields of study use and write about \n     the Library's collections as well as provide advice on \n     collection policies for future acquisitions.\n       How You Can Participate: If you would like to support Gifts \n     to the Nation, contact Winston Tabb, Associate Librarian for \n     Library Services, at (202) 707-6240 (wtab@loc.gov), or Norma \n     Baker, Director of the Development Office, at (202) 707-2777.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2719-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2719-S2720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  HONORING GEORGIA'S VIETNAM VETERANS\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as we approach the 25th \nAnniversary of the end of the Vietnam War, I rise today to pay tribute \nto those in my home state who answered the call of duty and were part \nof this great conflict.\n  The Vietnam War took place over the course of seventeen years, from \nthe first formal American involvement in 1958 to the fall of the South \nVietnamese government in 1975. Perhaps no other conflict in American \nhistory presented greater challenges to those who fought. A forbidding \nclimate, combined with a tenacious opponent and attempts by some back \nhome to undermine our effort, conspired to present our troops with \nnear-impossible challenges.\n  My home state has a fine military tradition forged over the last 225 \nyears. This legacy was upheld with honor throughout the Vietnam \nconflict. All told, Georgia sent 228,000 of its finest men and women to \nserve during the war. 1,584 were killed in action, and 8,534 were \nwounded. Twenty-one were held as prisoners of war, and to this day, \nthirty-nine remain missing in action. Youth from places like Snellville \nand Americus were thrown into an environment that was both unknown and \nvery deadly. To say they did their duty well and with honor would be an \nunderstatement.\n\n[[Page S2720]]\n\n  To honor its Vietnam veterans, my state dedicated a three-figure \nstatue on Veterans' Day, 1988. In 1997 the Georgia Vietnam Wall was \ndedicated, listing the names of the 1,584 Georgians who died in the \nwar.\n  Earlier this year the Georgia General Assembly passed a resolution \ncommending Vietnam veterans and their families for their outstanding \nservice to Georgia, America, southeast Asia, and the world. In \naddition, the General Assembly recognized that these brave troops did \nnot lose the war, but rather that they simply were not allowed to win, \nand that their duty was just and honorable. I could not agree more.\n  Georgians have long recognized that freedom is not free and that we \nmust always honor those who were willing to give their lives for it. As \nthis era in our nation's history fades ever farther into the past, it \nis our duty to ensure that the people of all ages recognize and honor \nthose who fought for the freedom they enjoy today. More so than winning \nor losing, the soldiers of the Vietnam war proved through their sweat \nand blood that we are willing to fight to defend the freedom we cherish \nand enjoy, no matter what the circumstances.\n  Mr. President, my state will observe the 25th Anniversary of the end \nof the Vietnam War on May 5-7, 2000.

Mr. President, I rise today to extend an invitation \nto the nation to join Massachusetts and the City of Boston in \ncelebrating the gathering of tall ships for Sail Boston 2000.\n  The tall ships represent a nautical history that stretches across the \nglobe. The International Sail Training Association, jointly with the \nAmerican Sail Training Association, is organizing the Tall Ships 2000 \nRace. I am proud to say that Boston Harbor has been granted the \nopportunity to be the only official United States Race Port.\n  Beginning in April 2000, two races will start from Southampton and \nGenoa, finishing in Cadiz. The second leg will be a transatlantic race \nto Bermuda, and from there, the fleet heads north to Boston. This \njourney will replicate the routes taken by mariners and explorers over \nthe last five centuries.\n  On July 11th, 2000, the Tall Ships will parade into Boston Harbor, \nand they will be led by the oldest ship in the U.S. Navy; America's Old \nIronsides; the U.S.S. Constitution. This national treasure was \noriginally built in Boston between 1794 and 1797, and was charged with \nthe task of defending a young American nation. This ship, the oldest \ncommissioned warship in the world, set to sea in 1798, and in July \n1999, the U.S.S. Constitution operated under her own sail for the first \ntime in 116 years.\n  This international fleet will be one of the finest gatherings of tall \nships. Among the Sail Boston 2000 fleet are historic ships such as: Mir \nof Russia; Concordia of Canada; Juan Sebastian De Elcano of Spain; \nPogoria of Poland; and the Amerigo Vespucci of Italy.\n  Massachusetts and the historic Boston Harbor, which offers the \nperfect setting for this occasion, will open itself up to visitors from \naround the world, and over six million spectators are expected to visit \nus and enjoy the festivities. The history that the Tall Ships represent \nbelongs to all of us, and it is my hope that visitors from every state \nin the nation will take the opportunity to visit Massachusetts and \nparticipate in this historic celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2720-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NATIONAL PARK WEEK\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak \nfor a few minutes about National Park Week and the value of National \nParks to our nation's citizens.\n  As families and individuals throughout our nation know, America's \nnational parks are the envy of the world and considered by many to be \nour national treasures. In our nation's parks, wildlife flourish, \nscenic beauty remains abundant, and families escape the pressures of \neveryday life. Our parks are truly one of our nation's best \ninvestments--an investment that will provide generations of Americans \nwith the same recreational and educational opportunities we now enjoy.\n  President Clinton has designated April 17-23, 2000, as National Park \nWeek. The National Park Service now estimates that over 285 million \nAmericans visit our 378 national parks every year. At each site, \nvisitors find themselves confronted with important moments in our \nnation's history, wonderful natural scenic sites, and cultural \ntreasures which remind us of our distinguished, and sometimes \ndifficult, past. Our parks, in many ways, are a microcosm of our nation \nand of ourselves, and they continue to document for future generations \nthose qualities about America which must be preserved for eternity.\n  In the 105th Congress, I was proud that Congress took a significant \nstep forward in updating the management of our Nation's parks and \nimproving visitor services by passing the ``Vision 2020 National Park \nSystem Restoration Act,'' a bill I cosponsored. The Vision 2020 Bill, \nauthored by Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming, is a commonsense approach \nto improving both the management and facilities of national parks by \nbringing everyone to the table and seeking consensus. The passage of \nthe Vision 2020 bill was an important first step toward bringing \naccountability to park management, addressing the tremendous backlog of \npark projects, and improving visitor services.\n  I was also proud to obtain $2 million in last year's appropriations \nbills for the National Park Service's portion of the Mississippi River \nNational Center in Minnesota's new Science Museum. The exhibit will \ninclude information on the importance of the Mississippi River to \nMinnesota's array of interests. This is a partnership between the Park \nService and the Science Museum that will give Minnesotans a greater \nappreciation for all aspects of recreation and commerce on the \nMississippi River.\n  My home state of Minnesota is home to five units of the National Park \nService. They are Voyageurs National Park, which on April 8 celebrated \nits 25th anniversary, Pipestone National Monument, Grand Portage \nNational Monument, the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, \nand the Saint Croix National Riverway. I've urged Minnesotans to visit \nthese sites during this week and to gain a greater appreciation for \nopportunities they offer.\n  Mr. President, our parks remain one of America's most important \nlegacies for future generations and a constant reminder of the \nprogress, splendor, and triumphs of our past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2720-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERT KERN\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN.

In nearly 35 years of teaching at UNM, he has \nearned a well-deserved reputation as a thoughtful professor and a \ndistinguished writer.\n  Believing that teaching is just about the noblest profession anyone \ncan undertake, and coming from a family of teachers myself, I admire \nmore than I can say what Professor Kern has done in this career. As a \nfather, I admire more than I can say the fine job he did raising his \nsons, one of whom, Josh, worked on my staff for several years. The \nlove, care, and attention Robert Kern gave his boys is reflected in \ntheir own lives and I suspect that of all of his achievements in a life \nwell-lived, they are his pride and joy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2720-4", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2720-S2721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMEMORATING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF VIETNAM VETERANS OF AMERICA'S \n                   FIRST CHAPTER IN RUTLAND, VERMONT\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President. Two years ago, I stood before you \nas the proud sponsor of a resolution commemorating the 20th anniversary \nof the Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA). Today I am here to honor the \n20th anniversary of VVA's first chapter--born and raised in my home \ntown of Rutland, Vermont.\n  Twenty years ago, Vietnam Veterans were suffering under the wave of \nanti-\n\n[[Page S2721]]\n\nVietnam sentiment that had swept the nation. Little recognition was \ngiven to their sacrifices during the war. And in fact, there was even a \ngreat deal of official denial about the extent of the price that had \nbeen paid by these veterans, both physical and emotional. It would be \nyears before Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder would be a recognized \ncondition for many veterans and years before the Federal Government \nwould admit that use of Agent Orange had left a terrible legacy of \ncontinued suffering for our veterans. The founders of the VVA felt that \nthey must have an organization to speak directly to those needs. The \noutpouring of enthusiasm from the veterans themselves demonstrated the \ndepth of these feelings.\n  In 1979, during a trip to Vermont, VVA founder Bobby Muller met Don \nBodette. Don supported the notion of an organization of and for Vietnam \nera veterans, but felt that it would only be truly successful if they \nmobilized locally and established chapters. The power of Don's logic \nand commitment persuaded Bobby Muller to adopt his model. On April 13, \n1980, VVA Chapter One was established in Rutland, Vermont. Taking up \nthe challenge, Don was joined by Jake Jacobsen, Albert and Mary \nTrombley, Mike Dodge, Dennis Ross and Mark Truhan, to name a few. \nToday, April 13, 2000, VVA Chapter One has 120 members hailing from 19 \nstates and 3 other countries.\n  I would like to add my voice to the multitudes both in and outside of \nVermont who are celebrating this auspicious anniversary. I join in \nrecognizing the tremendous work done by the VVA, both in Vermont and \nnationally. As a Vietnam era veteran myself, we all owe a debt of \ngratitude to VVA Chapter One's farsighted founders and the committed \nmembers who have followed their lead. Happy 20th Birthday, Chapter One! \nMay you have many more! \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2721-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF GREEN UP DAY\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, nearly 30 years ago, my predecessor, \nthe late Senator George D. Aiken, rose to report to the Senate on a new \nVermont initiative called ``Green Up Day.'' He described an effort, \nthen in its second year, in which thousands of Vermont citizen \nvolunteers of all ages combed the streets, highways, back roads, and \nvillage greens to pick up litter and beautify their state.\n  Another distinguished colleague of mine, Senator Robert Stafford, \nkept these same Vermonters' thoughts in mind when he courageously led \nthis Senate in the fight to build strong national environmental \npolicies--including Superfund--to protect public health, air, water, \nand land.\n  The very first Green Up Day was a simple initiative born on April 18 \nof 1970--a few days before the first Earth Day. Today it is an annual \nVermont tradition. On May 6, 2000, thousands of Vermonters will \ncelebrate the official 30th anniversary of ``Green Up Day'' just as \nthey have for so many years--by picking up trash bags and devoting \ntheir day to the beautification and clean up of our Green Mountain \nState.\n  Over the years, one organization, Vermont Green Up, has diligently \ncoordinated volunteers and spread the ideas of Green Up Day. Vermont \nGreen Up has sponsored annual poster contests for students, cleaned up \nseveral illegal dumps, and helped other states--and even other \ncountries--organize their own ``Green Up'' efforts.\n  In fact, my own daughter, Alicia, thought so much of Vermont Green Up \nthat she served as their Executive Director for a few years. Alicia had \nthe pleasure of serving in that position with Bob Stafford on the \nboard. She also made sure her father was out picking up trash with her \non Green Up Day!\n  I congratulate Vermont Green Up, the financial sponsors supporting \nGreen Up Day, and the thousands of Green Up Day volunteers. These are \nthe people who continue to make the first Saturday in May an \nextraordinary day for Vermont's environment. The fact that we are now \ncelebrating the 30th anniversary of Green Up Day is a testament to \nthese Vermonters untiring dedication to the environment of our Green \nMountain State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2721-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CALHOUN COUNTY CELEBRATES CHARACTER EDUCATION AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a very \nspecial event taking place next week in the State of Michigan. The city \nof Battle Creek and the greater Calhoun County are officially \nrecognizing April 17-21, 2000, as Character Education Awareness Week. \nCharacter Unlimited, a group which works to raise awareness of the \nimportance of good character and to train others to integrate character \ndevelopment in their organizations and areas of influence, and the \nBattle Creek Chamber of Commerce are cosponsors of the event.\n  Four goals have been set for the week: first, to inform the public \nabout character education initiatives throughout Calhoun County; \nsecond, to raise awareness and interest in the importance of mentoring \nand role modeling; third, to address youth about the importance of \ncharacter based decision making and non-violent conflict resolution; \nand, finally, to raise community awareness of Character Unlimited and \nthe work of the organization.\n  Increasingly, the notion of character has found a place in the \nnational dialogue, particularly in this, an election year. What is \ngetting lost in the debate, I feel, is a look at where character comes \nfrom, how it is developed within children and adults alike, and the \nrole communities can play in developing character within their youth. \nGood character is not innate, Mr. President, it requires conscientious \neducation, effort and role-modeling.\n  While it goes without saying that parents hold the most important \nrole in this process, they are not the only cog in the wheel. Schools, \nyouth organizations, churches, synagogues, temples, civic \norganizations, even governmental organizations, all of these groups \nhave the opportunity to set positive examples for children, and in \ndoing so provide them with a clear-cut example of what is right and \nwhat is wrong. More than this, though, for they also have the ability \nto teach them how to appropriately fight for what is right and against \nwhat is wrong. This is positive character development, and it is within \nall of our grasps.\n  Mr. President, good character in an individual is not automatic, but \nit is always attainable. What it requires is hard work by many people. \nThe more positive influences our communities are able to have available \nto children, the more children we will see developing a strong sense of \ncharacter. Continuing to use basic common sense as a guide, I think it \nis easy to imagine what kind of a positive effect this will have on our \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, I am truly excited about what is happening in Calhoun \nCounty April 17-21, 2000. I thank Character Unlimited and the Battle \nCreek Chamber of Commerce for sponsoring Character Education Awareness \nWeek. Also, I would like to recognize Mr. Erv Brinker, Chairman of \nCharacter Unlimited, and Ms. Pat Maliszewski, Program Director, whose \nhard work have been essential in making this event possible. On behalf \nof the entire United States Senate, I hope that Character Education \nAwareness Week is a huge success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2721-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2721-S2722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CELEBRATION OF CHOL CHNAM, CAMBODIAN NEW YEAR\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join Cambodian-\nAmericans in celebration of the Cambodian New Year, Chol Chnam, one of \nthe major celebrations of the Cambodian culture. Over the next three \ndays there will be gatherings across the United States to celebrate the \nbeginning of the Year of the Dragon. I take this opportunity to wish \nall of these people a very happy New Year.\n  The Cambodian New Year represents more than just a renewal of the \ncalendar and traditional end of the harvest, it is also a celebration \nof faith. Entry into the New Year, or Maha Sangkrant, is marked by the \nsounding of a bell. With the sounding, it is believed that the New \nAngel arrives. Throughout the day people participate in ceremonies and \nbring food to the Buddhist monks and religious leaders. The second day \nof celebration, or Vana Bat, is a time to show consideration for \nothers. Gifts are given to parents, grandparents and teachers as a show \nof respect and charity is offered to the less fortunate. The third day, \nor Loeng\n\n[[Page S2722]]\n\nSak, includes more religious ceremonies and rituals to bring good luck \nand happiness to families.\n  In my home state of Rhode Island there are numerous businesses owned \nby Cambodian-American families, most of them in the capital city \nProvidence. These establishments contribute much to the local economy.\n  The Cambodian New Year is an appropriate time to remind all Americans \nwhy we must support the political and economic stabilization of \nCambodia. As the nation continues to recover from three decades of \ncivil conflict, including the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge, \nit is critical that the United States and international community aid \nthe Cambodian people in their efforts to build a lasting democracy.\n  Therefore, on this day marking the beginning of Chol Chnam, I \nencourage all U.S. citizens to join in the spirit of this special \nholiday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2722-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMMENDATION FOR DR. JAMES BROWNFOX JONES, ESQ.\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity today to \ncall my colleagues' attention to the extraordinary efforts of Dr. James \nBrownfox Jones who has made countless contributions to his profession \nand to the community at large. Recently, Dr. Jones was selected as an \ninductee in the Washington D.C. Hall of Fame in the area of education. \nDr. Jones' selection to the Hall of Fame is a testament to his \ndependable and consistent standard of excellence as an educator and \nparticipant in his community. His career reflects his respect and \naffection for the young people who are our future leaders. And, his \nrecord reflects his predominate concern for the more vulnerable youth \nin this city.\n  Dr. Jones has distinguished himself in the District of Columbia as an \neducator and community activist with the mission of helping young \npeople reach their full potential At the Washington School of \nPsychiatry, Dr. Jones developed and operated an experimental \neducational program designed to address the educational needs of ``hard \ncore'' juvenile delinquents. And, as a public school teacher, he \ndeveloped a unique program for special education students.\n  With a distinguished career spanning more than 30 years, Dr. Jones \nassisted the mayor in initiating a wide range of innovative programs \nfor the children and youth of the city. These included a mobile \nrecreation wagon, a hot lunch program, a neighborhood youth corps, and \nthe building of go-kart tracks on lots left vacant by the 1968 riots.\n  Since 1983, Dr. Jones has designed and operated an Independent Living \nProgram for abused and neglected youth in foster care in the District \nof Columbia. As part of this program, he has sent over 250 young people \nto college.\n  Education is a top priority for this Congress, and for me personally. \nI have served as a tutor and my wife Linda has dedicated her career to \nteaching in public schools. Both of us have always been strong \nsupporters of public education. It is with that background that I want \nto express my support for the work of Dr. Jones and to congratulate him \non his selection for the Washington, DC Hall of Fame.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2722-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING THE HERMANN MONUMENT\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today \nto recognize the numerous contributions that millions German-Americans \nhave made to the United States, and introduce a resolution to designate \nthe Hermann Monument in New Ulm, Minnesota, a national monument.\n  German-Americans have been an integral part of American history, \nshaping our artistic, cultural, military and political foundations. \nFriedrich Muhlenbert, the first Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives, baseball great Babe Ruth, and artist Oscar Hammerstein \nare just three out of millions of German-Americans who have contributed \nto the creation of a diverse American culture. Today, German-Americans \ncompose nearly 25% of the American population, making them the largest \nethnic group in the United States. Despite this vast number of German-\nAmericans and the significant impact they have had on all facets of \nAmerican life, unfortunately there is no nationally recognized symbol \nhonoring German-Americans.\n  The Hermann Monument provides us with an opportunity as a nation to \nrecognize the contributions of German-Americans, past and present. The \nmonument is a unique copper statue of Hermann the Cheruscan, created in \n1889 as a tribute to the struggle and triumph of German immigrants who \ncame to the United States. The Hermann monument has become a symbol of \nunity and endurance to all American-Germans. It appropriately stands \ntall over New Ulm, Minnesota, a city where nearly 75 percent of the \npopulation is of German heritage.\n  Designating the Hermann Monument as a National German American \nMonument will re-enforce the important contributions that millions of \nGerman-Americans have made to our nation. It is with this goal that I \nintroduce this resolution, and urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2722-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION AWARDS PROGRAM\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I proudly rise today to pay tribute \nto the University of Minnesota women's hockey team on their recent \nnational championship victory. This is truly an accomplishment of which \nall Minnesotans can be proud.\n  In only its third season, the Golden Gopher program has become a \nnational powerhouse. In 1998, the Gopher's inaugural year, the team \nfinished fourth in the nation. Last year, they crept closer to the \nnational title with a third-place finish. This season's 32-6-1 record \nwas the best in the nation.\n  Under the leadership of coach Laura Halldorson, the Gopher women \ndefeated instate rival University of Minnesota-Duluth in the \nsemifinals, 3-2, after being down 2-0. This come-from-behind victory \ngave the Golden Gophers a berth in the American Women's College Hockey \nAlliance National Championship game versus top-seeded Brown University.\n  The March 25 championship game at Boston's Matthews Arena proved to \nbe a tough-fought contest. The Gopher women fell behind by a score of \n1-0 in the first period, but once again made a strong comeback. Led by \ngoalie Erica Killewald's 34 stopped shots, in the Gophers held off \nBrown for a 4-2 victory.\n  While this incredible season was clearly the result of phenomenal \nteamwork, there are individual efforts that should be recognized. \nGopher goalie Erica Killewald's spectacular performance earned her the \ntournament MVP\n\n[[Page S2723]]\n\nhonors. Also awarded all-tournament honors were Nadine Muzerall, Winny \nBrodt and Courtney Kennedy.\n  As the popularity of women's hockey spreads throughout the nation, \nMinnesotans have embraced the sport--and their Golden Gophers. Now the \nprogram is poised to lead the charge towards greater advancements in \nwomen's athletics. I commend the women's dedication and relentless hard \nwork. With only one graduating senior on this year's Gopher squad, I am \nhopeful for many more national championships.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2723-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         WITTMAN FAMILY WINS MILLENNIUM FARM/RANCH FAMILY AWARD\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

In 1988, the family \njoined forces with the nearby Valley Boys and Girls Clubs to build \n``Camp Wittman,'' a totally solar-powered destination where students \nand educators can share in a hands-on environmental experience to learn \nfarming practices in the mountain meadow environment of the Palouse.\n  The Wittman Family has given to our youth, our educators, our local \nand national governments, and broken ground for more than just the \npurposes of next year's crop.\n  In these tough times for farmers, agriculture needs leaders who \nindeed look to the future while learning from the past. I am proud to \nhonor the Wittman family as a Millennium Farm/Ranch Family Award \nwinners and proud to call them fellow Idahoans.\n  It is indeed my pleasure as an Idaho Senator to honor the Wittman \nfamily as agriculture pioneers for Idaho--and to thank them for \ncontributing so much to our next millennium in Agriculture. I know you \nand my colleagues in the Senate join me in offering our congratulations \nto the Wittman family.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2723-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DOVEY J. ROUNDTREE\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the American Bar Association \nCommission on Women in the Profession announced in February the winners \nof the 2000 Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement Awards.\n  Among those worthy recipients was Dovey J. Roundtree, General Counsel \nfor the National Council of Negro Women, whom I have been privileged to \nknow for many years.\n  As a former law clerk to Federal Circuit Judge Prettyman, then as an \nAssistant United States Attorney, followed by private practice in the \ngreater metropolitan area of Washington, DC, I came to know and admire \nthe professional achievements of Attorney Roundtree.\n  She is most deserving of this recognition for her tireless efforts to \nhelp others.\n  The award Mrs. Roundtree has earned is named for the first woman \nlawyer in America, Margaret Brent. She arrived in the Colonies in 1638, \nand was involved in 124 court cases over the course of eight years, \nwinning every case. In 1648, she formally demanded the right to vote in \nthe Maryland Assembly, but her petition was denied by the Governor.\n  These awards were established in 1991 to honor outstanding women \nlawyers who have achieved professional excellence in their area of \nspecialty and have actively worked to help other women lawyers.\n  Attorney Roundtree and her work have been admired for more than three \ndecades. She has been a leading civil rights lawyer, an Army veteran, \nan ordained minister and a resident of Spotsylvania.\n  She is a founding partner of the Washington, DC, law firm of \nRoundtree, Knox, Hunter and Parker, and she served for 35 years as \nGeneral Counsel to the National Council of Negro Women and as special \nconsultant for legal affairs to the African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n  Mrs. Roundtree attend Howard University Law School on the GI Bill and \nwent on to break legal ground in both civil and criminal law. Her 1955 \nbus desegregation victory before the Interstate Commerce Commission, \nSarah Keys versus Carolina Coach Company, was critically important in \nthe legal battle for civil rights.\n  She was the first black woman admitted to the Bar Association of the \nDistrict of Columbia and actively recruited other black women \nattorneys.\n  Dovey J. Roundtree is most deserving of this award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2723-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NATIONAL D.O. DAY\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, Thursday, April 13, is \nNational D.O. Day. I therefore want to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 45,000 osteopathic physicians (D.O.s) across the country \nfor their contributions to the American healthcare system. For more \nthan a century, D.O.s have made a difference in the lives and health of \nAmericans everywhere. They have treated presidents and Olympic \nathletes. They have helped to keep children well and have contributed \nto the fight against AIDS. Today, members of the osteopathic medical \nprofession serve as U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health \nAffairs, the chief medical officer for the U.S. Coast Guard, and the \nSurgeon General of the U.S. Army.\n  As fully licensed physicians able to prescribe medication and perform \nsurgery, D.O.s are committed to serving the health needs of rural and \nunderserved communities. They make up 15 percent of the total physician \npopulation in towns of 10,000 or less. In addition, 64 percent of D.O.s \npractice in the primary care areas of medicine, fulfilling a need for \nmore primary care physicians in an era marked by the growth of managed \ncare. Their contributions have been particularly important in rural \nstates like Maine.\n  More than 100 million patient visits are made each year to D.O.s. \nD.O.s approach their patients as ``whole people.'' They don't just \ntreat a specific illness or injury. D.O.s take into account home and \nwork environments, as well as lifestyle, when assessing overall health. \nThis approach provides Americans with high quality healthcare--patients \nseen as people, not just an illness or injury.\n  From the state-of-the-art healthcare facility in a major city to a \nclinic in a rural Maine community, D.O.s continue to practice the kind \nof medicine that Andrew Taylor Still envisioned over 100 years ago when \nhe founded the profession.\n  It was my pleasure to meet today with two representatives of the \nosteopathic medical profession visiting our Capitol from Maine. The \nUniversity of New England, College of Osteopathic Medicine (UNECOM), in \nBiddeford, is the only medical school in my home state. To the more \nthan 400 osteopathic physicians in Maine, the approximately 1,100 \ngraduates of UNECOM, and the 45,000 D.O.s represented by the American \nOsteopathic Association--congratulations on your contributions to the \ngood health of the American people. I look forward to working with you \nto further our mutual goal of improving our nation's health \ncare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2723-4", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2723-S2724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        MR. AND MRS. ROBERT VANMETER'S 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Mr. and \nMrs. Robert VanMeter, who on April 22, 2000, will celebrate their 50th \nwedding anniversary. The couple was married at a simple ceremony on a \nFriday evening by a clergyman named Grover W. Cleveland. Since that \nevening, the two have shared the highs and lows of life together, \nlending support and comfort to the other whenever there has been need.\n  Mr. Robert VanMeter served in the 82d Airborne in Italy. He loved his \njob, and was particularly fond of taking\n\n[[Page S2724]]\n\npictures of his jumps. Mrs. JoAnn VanMeter stayed at home, raising \ntheir four children. She baked everything from hamburger buns to apple \npie. The children never knew what ``store-bought'' bread and pastries \nwere until they were teenagers and Mrs. VanMeter returned to work.\n  Thirty-nine years ago, Mr. VanMeter completed the house that the \ncouple lives in to this day. It took him two years to build, in part \nbecause of his refusal to allow anyone to help him with any part of the \nprocess, including the electrical and plumbing.\n  Mr. and Mrs. VanMeter have five grandchildren, ages 12-25. As they \ndid their own children, they continue to show a patience and loyalty to \nthem. They instill into their grandchildren the same principles they \npassed to their children: hard work, patience, and a willingness to try \nnew things.\n  Mr. President, on this special occasion, I congratulate Mr. and Mrs. \nVanMeter. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish them a \nhappy 50th wedding anniversary, and best of luck in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2724-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2724-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:36 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of \nthe Senate:\n\n       H.R. 2328.

A bill to designate the Federal building located at 2201 C \nStreet, Northwest, in the District of Columbia, which serves as \nheadquarters for the Department of State, as the ``Harry S. Truman \nFederal Building''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n  legislation to rename the state department after president harry s. \n                                 truman\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is my great privilege to introduce a \nbill today, along with Senators Bond, Warner, DeWine, and Moynihan, \nthat will name the State Department's Headquarters in Washington, D.C., \nthe ``Harry S. Truman Federal Building.'' I truly appreciate the \nsupport of these distinguished colleagues and Secretary Albright to see \nthis idea become a reality.\n  Born in Lamar, Missouri, Harry S. Truman was a farmer, a national \nguardsman, a World War I veteran, a local postmaster, a road overseer, \nand a small business owner before turning to politics. Through these \nexperiences, he gained the courage, honesty, and dedication to freedom \nrequired of a greater leader. Truman went on to become one of the most \ninfluential Presidents of the modern era. His leadership and character, \nespecially in the area of foreign policy, have earned him well-deserved \npraise and respect throughout the world.\n  He established the Marshall Plan--creating a politically and \neconomically stable Western Europe. President Truman was instrumental \nin creating the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which kept Soviet \naggression at bay in Western Europe. He worked to contain the further \nspread of communism in Berlin, Greece, Turkey, and Korea. Clearly, \nPresident Truman was the architect of the strategy that won the Cold \nWar and is a prime reason the United States is currently the world's \nsole superpower.\n  Mr. President, the State Department should be named after a true \nleader in foreign policy--and President Harry S. Truman is the clear \nchoice. And through this choice, I hope the United States will continue \nPresident Truman's principled foreign policy as seen in his 1949 \nPresidential Inaugural Address:\n\n       Events have brought our American democracy to new influence \n     and new responsibilities. They will test our courage, our \n     devotion to duty, and our concept of liberty. But I say to \n     all men, what we have achieved in liberty, we will surpass in \n     greater liberty. Steadfast in our faith in the Almighty, we \n     will advance toward a world where man's freedom is secure. To \n     that end we will devote our strength, our resources, and our \n     firmness of resolve. With God's help, the future of mankind \n     will be assured in a world of justice, harmony, and peace.\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \njoin my colleagues--Senators Ashcroft, Warner, Bond, and DeWine--in \nthis effort to name the State Department building after our 33rd \nPresident, Harry S. Truman. It could be named for none other.\n  Harry S. Truman was, perhaps, the most unlikely of the Presidents. A \nfailed haberdasher, as he would say, without a college degree. It seems \nsomewhat paradoxical that this common man, who modeled himself along \nthe lines of the fabled Cincinnatus--returning to the field after \nrising to meet his country's needs--would leave so much behind.\n  Put simply, President Truman's foreign affairs accomplishments saved \nthe world from the chaos that followed the destruction of Europe in the \nSecond World War, and enabled the ultimate defeat of totalitarianism. \nTo list a few: the Berlin Airlift, the Marshall Plan, aid to Greece and \nTurkey, NATO, and the establishment of the United Nations--the vision \nof his only rival President Woodrow Wilson.\n  His greatness was not readily accepted while he served, or shortly \nthereafter. But over time, Harry S. Truman has been reevaluated through \nsuch scholarly biographies as those by David McCullough and Alonzo L. \nHamby. This son of Independence, Missouri, would surely have rejected \nthe high praise that his name now generates, but he would certainly \nconcur in the appreciation of the enduring success of the policies and \ninstitutions he created. McCullough's ``Truman'' contains this \nreflection:\n\n       I suppose that history will remember my term in office as \n     the years when the Cold War began to overshadow our lives.\n       I have had hardly a day in office that has not been \n     dominated by this all-embracing struggle. . . . And always in \n     the background there has been the atomic bomb. But when \n     history says that my term of office saw the beginning of the \n     Cold War, it will also say that in those eight years we have \n     set the course that can win it. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, few could dispute those sentiments.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire):\n  S. 2417. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nincrease funding for State nonpoint source pollution control programs, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n            Water Pollution Program Enhancements Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. I am pleased to introduce today, with my colleague Senator \nSmith of New Hampshire and Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon, the ``Water \nPollution Program Enhancements Act of 2000'' in response to a fast \ntrack rulemaking process undertaken by the Environmental Protection \nAgency with respect to the total maximum daily load, or TMDL, and \nNational Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, NPDES, permit programs \nunder the Clean Water Act. The concerns over this rule are far too \ngreat and EPA is moving far too quickly for Congress to stand aside and \nallow this regulation to move ahead. My disagreement with the proposed \nrule is not its basic objective, which is aimed at cleaning up our \nNation's waters--but the hurried approach EPA has elected to take, and \ntheir refusal to address the very numerous, very real concerns of \nstates, cities, and stakeholders.\n  Huge strides have been made in cleaning up our nation's waters since \nthe Clean Water Act was passed in 1972, particularly in the area of \npoint source pollutants. But clearly, our work is not finished in \ntrying to make our lakes, rivers and streams ``fishable and \nswimmable.'' More must be done to improve water quality, and more must \nespecially be done to provide additional resources to address nonpoint \nsource pollution, which, so far, has not received anywhere near the \nkind of funding that has been focused on discharges from point sources.\n  In the past month and a half, we have held two hearings on the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's proposed rule with respect to total \nmaximum daily loads and the NPDES permit programs. The same subject has \nbeen examined in four other Congressional hearings by three separate \ncommittees. What we have collectively learned in these hearings about \nEPA's proposed rule is nothing short of alarming. States have responded \nwith universal concern to this proposed rule that saddles them with \nenormous regulatory burdens and exorbitant costs in carrying out their \nwater quality management programs. Not only is this proposed onerous \nand costly to implement, but States have testified that it is not \nlikely to improve water quality, and, in fact, may have a detrimental \neffect on States with existing programs that have proven to be \nsuccessful.\n  We would prefer not to be introducing this bill today. We have been \nholding hearings. I have been communicating with EPA--as have dozens of \nother Members of Congress expressing their grave concern with the \nproposed rule. We would prefer that Congress be working through these \nvery important and challenging issues in collaboration with EPA. But \nholding hearings and attempting to work with EPA to resolve issues of \nconcern, or urging them to take a more thoughtful, even-handed approach \nis no longer a reasonable course of action when the EPA steadfastly \ncontinues to insist on fast tracking a rule that has been the subject \nof such widespread concern and criticism.\n\n[[Page S2730]]\n\n  When EPA issued this proposed regulation last August, we were all \nsurprised at the boldness of the agency to publish the rule:\n  During the Congressional recess; and\n  Provide only a 60-day comment period on such as massive and complex \nrulemaking.\n  Not only did the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee request an extension of the comment period, but \nCongress was actually forced to enact legislation to compel EPA to \nlisten. The EPA was forced to extend its comment period. EPA received \nmore than 30,000 public comments on the proposed rule, and, as I said \nearlier, this rule has been the subject of six Congressional hearings.\n  To date, I do not see any evidence that EPA is listening. As recently \nas last week, EPA communicated that it had negotiated a 60-day OMB \nreview--what is usually at least a 90-day review on major rulemaking \nefforts--and that it intends to finalize the rule by June 30.\n  The intransigence of the EPA is both unexplainable and unacceptable. \nIf EPA is serious about ramming this regulation through by June 30, it \nis our intention to send them a loud message--Congress insists instead \nthat they take a deep breath with respect to this rule.\n  The bill Senator Smith and I are introducing today--the Water \nPollution Program Enhancements Act--takes important steps toward \nachieving additional reductions in water pollution now, and providing \nthe science necessary for better implementation of the TMDL program in \nthe future.\n  In the hearings I held, witnesses raised three main concerns with \nrespect to the proposed rule. They cited:\n  States' lack of reliable data for developing their 303(d) list of \nimpaired waters;\n  The scarce public resources available for addressing nonpoint \npollution in particular; and\n  EPA's overreach of its statutory authority under the Clean Water Act \nin controlling water quality management programs administered by \nStates.\n\n  This bill addresses those three issues without amending current law \nor regulation.\n  The Water Pollution Program Enhancement Act authorizes significantly \nincreased funding for sections 106 and 319 under the Clean Water Act. \nFunding under section 106 would be made available to the States and \nspecifically directed to:\n  Collect reliable monitoring data;\n  Improve their lists of impaired waters;\n  Prepare TMDLs; and\n  Develop watershed management strategies.\n  Of the $500 million available for implementation of section 319, $200 \nmillion is required to be made available by the States for grants to \nprivate landowners to carry out projects that will improve water \nquality. These funds are specifically being made available to farmers, \nranches, family forestland managers and others, to conduct activities \non their lands that contribute to cleaning up rivers, lakes and \nstreams.\n  These significant increases in funding will achieve on-the-ground \nresults and have a very real effect in improving our nation's water \nquality.\n  Second, the bill directs the Environmental Protection Agency to \ncontract with the National Academy of Sciences to prepare a report on:\n  The quality of the science used to develop and implement TMDLs;\n  The costs associated with implementing TMDLs; and\n  The availability of alternative programs or mechanisms to reduce the \ndischarge of pollutants from point sources and nonpoint source \npollution.\n  If there is one message I have heard loud and clear, it is that we \nlack basic and necessary data about TMDLs and how to implement the TMDL \nprogram that achieves the goal of improving water quality, provides \nStates flexibility in administering their programs, and is cost \neffective. It is irresponsible of EPA to push ahead in finalizing this \nregulation when we do not have the answers to such basic questions \nabout this program.\n  Third, the bill provides for innovation and collaboration by \nestablishing a pilot program in which five states are selected to \nimplement a three-year program that examines alternative strategies and \nincentives to reduce the discharge of pollutants and TMDLs. This pilot \nprogram will provide us with valuable information about how we might \nthink outside the box to solve our water quality problems.\n  Finally, this legislation requires EPA to postpone its rulemaking and \nreview the National Academy of Sciences study before publishing its \nfinal rule on the TMDL program. Despite EPA's assertions to the \ncontrary, we know that the proposed rule would have enormous \nimplications for States, cities and stakeholders. It is absolutely \ncritical that we know more about the science of TMDLs before finalizing \nthis rule, and EPA has given Congress no other choice but to compel \nthem to do so. Congress has an obligation to intercede and resolve \nthese issues crucial to the health of our people and our environment.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cleaning up our nation's waters \nthrough the reasonable and balanced provisions included in the Water \nPollution Program Enhancements Act of 2000.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce \ntoday with my colleague from Idaho, Senator Mike Crapo, the ``Water \nPollution Program Enhancements Act of 2000.'' I believe this bill will \nsignificantly improve water quality and, over the long term, reform the \nway the Environmental Protection Agency and the States implement the \nTotal Maximum Daily Load, TMDL, program for impaired waters.\n  I emphasize at the outset that I strongly support the goals of the \nClean Water Act. I believe all Americans should be able to enjoy clean \nwater to drink, and that our rivers and lakes should be ``fishable'' \nand ``swimmable.'' And we have made substantial progress over the past \n25 years since the Clean Water Act was enacted in cleaning up our \nnations rivers, lakes and streams. According to EPA, 60-70 percent of \nour nation's waters are now safe for fishing and swimming. Certainly, \nthere's more work to be done. How we control runoff from agricultural \nand urban areas, and forests--so-called nonpoint source pollution--is \nour challenge for the future.\n  I also support the original concept underlying the TMDL program of \nhelping ensure that water quality standards are met on all of our \nnation's rivers and streams and lakes. However, I believe that there \nmay be other tools to help us achieve those laudable goals; TMDLs are \nnot the only answer. We should be looking to the States for \nalternative, innovative solutions, particularly in the area of \ncontrolling nonpoint source pollution. And I believe that if we look, \nwe will find that the States have better, more cost effective solutions \nto improving water quality. Is there a role for the Federal Government \nin addressing nonpoint source pollution? Absolutely. The Federal \nGovernment--EPA--should work in partnership with States and the private \nsector to achieve our shared goal of fishable and swimmable water.\n  EPA's approach to solving the nation's remaining water quality \nissues, however, continues to be based on more ``top-down'' regulations \nfrom Washington, D.C.; more confrontration, instead of collaboration; \nand more interference with State programs. We are taking the step of \nintroducing this legislation today because EPA has made it clear that \nit plans to expedite the process for finalizing two controversial rules \nthat it proposed last August that would make a number of significant \nchanges to the existing programs to control the discharge of pollutants \nand to improve water quality. The first rule would significantly expand \nthe requirements for establishing the total amount of pollutants that \ncan be discharged to a waterbody--so-called ``total maximum daily \nloads.'' The second rule would expand EPA's authority to revoke or \nreissue state-issued permits under the Clean Water Act to implement the \nnew TMDL requirements. The combined effect of these rules would be to \ndramatically expand EPA's authority over issues that have traditionally \nbeen within the jurisdiction of the States, such as farming, ranching \nand logging operations, and additionally to give EPA a potential new \nrole in local land management use decisions.\n  I have serious concerns about the substance of these rules. But I am \nalso\n\n[[Page S2731]]\n\ndeeply troubled by the process that EPA has adopted here. It began last \nsummer when EPA initially proposed the rules. At that time, it stated \nthat it would only accept public comments on the proposed rules for 60 \ndays. Such a short period of time for public review was obviously \ninadequate given the length of the proposed rules and their complexity. \nCongress intervened and EPA was ultimately compelled to extend the \ncomment deadline for an additional 90 days.\n  Even before the comment period had closed, however, EPA indicated \nthat nothing would stop it from pushing the proposed rules through the \nprocess as quickly as possible. Over the past month, EPA has announced \nits plans to issue final rules before the end of June in spite of the \nfact that it received over 30,000 comments in February, at least 27,000 \nof which were critical of the rule, and can hardly have had an \nopportunity to give these comments serious consideration. There have \nbeen at least six hearings on the proposed rules in both the House and \nSenate in which serious concerns were raised about: the legality and \npracticality of the rules; the lack of reliable science underlying the \nexisting TMDL program, not to mention any proposed expansion; the \npotential impact on successful State programs; the burdens that an \nexpanded TMDL program would impose on individual landowners and small \nbusinesses; and the lack of a completed cost assessment of the proposed \nrules.\n  Senator Crapo has held two hearings so far on EPA's proposed TMDL \nrules. Through that process, and in many meetings with stakeholders, I \nhave heard about all of the problems with EPA's proposed rules--the \nlack of science, the overly broad scope, practical problems in \nimplementing the rule, trampling of state programs, and the cost. Let \nme detail just a few of the comments that I heard.\n  On the question of the science underlying the TMDL program, GAO \nrecently issued a report, and provided testimony on the basis of the \nreport, that States do not have the data they need to accurately assess \nthe pollution problems in their waters and further, do not have the \ndata they need to develop TMDLs. In his statement to Senator Crapo's \nsubcommittee, Peter Guerrero noted specifically that the ``ability [of \nthe States] to develop TMDLs is limited by a number of factors. . . . \n[S]hortages in funding and staff [were cited] as the major limitation \nto carrying out [the States'] responsibilities, including developing \nTMDLs. In addition, states reported that they need additional \nanalytical methods and technical assistance to develop TMDLs for the \nmore complex, nonpoint sources of pollution.'' He went on to state that \nonly three states have the data they need to identify nonpoint sources \nof pollution, and only three States have the majority of the data they \nneed to develop TMDLs for nonpoint sources. To me, this information \nfrom GAO sends a clear signal that TMDLs are not the answer for \nnonpoint source pollution. The science just isn't there.\n  We also heard from a variety of businesses and landowners who told us \nof other substantive problems with EPA's proposed rules. For example, \nTom Thomson, a certified Tree Farmer from my home State of New \nHampshire and the owner of the Outstanding Northeastern Tree Farm of \n1997, testified that EPA's proposal to regulate tree farming as a point \nsource and impose TMDLs would just make it harder to do the job of \nimproving water quality. He explained that through aggressive, private \nand voluntary stewardship, private woodlot owners all over the country \nare doing a good job to address water quality issues related to \nforestry. Compliance rates now approach 90 percent in many of the \nStates where forestry best management practices, BMPs, are in place. \nTotal river and stream miles impaired due to silviculture declined 20 \npercent just between 1994 and 1996. The number of miles deemed to have \n``major impairment'' from silviculture fell 83 percent. In 1996, EPA \ndropped silviculture from its list of 7 leading sources of river and \nstream impairment. That same year, silviculture contributed only 7 \npercent of total stream impairment. In Tom's word's this seems to be a \nclassic case of ``if it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' In this case, it \nwould seem clear that water quality issues related to forestry are \nbeing addressed and progress is being made through State BMP programs \nand other voluntary, non-regulatory measures undertaken by landowners.\n\n  To his credit, EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office of Water, \nChuck Fox, has recognized that the proposed rule caused confusion and \ndoes have many problems. I met with Mr. Fox last week and was pleased \nto learn from him that EPA has heard at least some of the concerns that \nwere raised and is ready to make some changes to their rule. He \nindicated that in any final rule, EPA would ``drop threatened waters; \nallow more flexibility in setting priorities; drop the offset \nrequirements for new pollution; and revise the approach for forest \npollution.''\n  Some of the changes may be significant and that's good news, but as \nalways, ``the devil is in the details.'' I am still concerned that many \nof the major problems have not been addressed. I also wonder why, if \nEPA is willing to acknowledge that many of the concepts included in the \nproposed rule were indeed flawed, it hasn't been willing to withdraw \nthe August draft and reissue a new proposed rule that reflects its \ncurrent thoughts. Surely doing that and seeking public comment on a \nrevised rule would result in a better, more informed end product. It \nwould almost certainly enhance public confidence in EPA's process. \nHowever, EPA has consistently declined to consider this approach.\n  In my opinion, EPA simply hasn't done the work that must be done to \njustify and explain the rule to the public. States and the regulated \ncommunity deserve to have their comments and concerns considered \nseriously by EPA, as well as to have an opportunity to review and \nprovide comment on the cost assessment in the context of the proposed \nrule. Now apparently, EPA may be making significant changes that will \nnever have been subject to public comment. In its desire to rush to \njudgment on a final rule, EPA is effectively neutering the role of \npublic participation in the rulemaking process.\n  Therefore, Senator Crapo and I have drafted legislation that will \naddress several of the key problems with EPA's proposed rules and, in \naddition, defer any further EPA action on the rules until the National \nAcademy of Sciences has conducted a study of the scientific issues \nunderlying the development and implementation of the TMDL program.\n  Senator Crapo and I are taking the first step to not only address \nsome of the problems raised by EPA's proposed rules, but also to \nimprove water quality on the ground right now.\n  Our bill will do three fundamental things. First, it significantly \nincreases federal funding to $750 million for States to implement \nprograms to address nonpoint source pollution, to assess the quality of \ntheir rivers and streams, and to collect the data they need to develop \nbetter TMDLs. This will represent a significant increase from current \nfunding levels for Fiscal Year 2000 of $155 million for nonpoint source \nprograms under section 106 and section 319 of the Clean Water Act. More \nmoney now will enable landowners, businesses, and States to do things \nnow on the ground to improve water quality--things like putting in \nbuffer strips and water retention ponds. With this approach, we won't \nhave to wait 10 or 15 years for EPA to impose new regulatory \nrequirements on landowners after a lengthy and onerous TMDL process.\n  Second, the bill directs the National Academy of Sciences to conduct \na study on the science used to develop TMDLs and make recommendations \nabout how to improve it. The NAS will also evaluate existing State \nprograms to look at what works, particularly for nonpoint sources. \nBetter science will make for better TMDLs.\n  Third, it includes a pilot program for EPA to compare different State \napproaches to improving water quality. TMDLs should not be the only \ntool that we rely on to meet our water quality goals; they may be \nappropriate and effective for a chemical company, but not for a farmer \nor woodlot owner. There are better solutions out there, particularly to \ndeal with the problems associated with nonpoint source pollution. For \nexample, States are using their own authority and incentive-based \nprograms under the Safe Drinking Water Act and the farm bill to work \ntogether with farmers, ranchers,\n\n[[Page S2732]]\n\nloggers and their cities to substantially reduce runoff.\n  The bottom line is that States, public utilities, landowners, and \nbusinesses now are spending billions of dollars to improve water \nquality. If we are going to ask them to spend billions more--and we \nare--Congress and EPA have a responsibility to make sure that the \nprograms we create are based on good, reliable science, and make the \nbest use of limited resources.\n  Again, it's not a question of challenging the goals of the Clean \nWater Act; it's a question of seeking the best way to achieve them.\n  The bill also includes a provision to defer the finalization of EPA's \nproposed TMDL and related permit rules. We're serious when we say that \nwe want EPA to base its regulations on good science. And we're serious \nwhen we say that we want EPA to respect the role of the States in \nsolving the problem of nonpoint source pollution. That's why the bill \nprovides for the National Academy of Sciences to look into those \nissues. We believe that EPA also should welcome the NAS Study and look \nforward to the opportunity to use that Study to improve its rule. \nTherefore, the bill directs EPA to review the NAS Study and take into \nconsideration the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences \nbefore it finalizes any new TMDL rule. We believe that in the long run, \nwaiting 18 months for the NAS analysis will only improve the rule and \nincrease public confidence in it.\n  Mr. President, I know our critics will charge that we are undermining \nthe Clean Water Act. They could not be more wrong. This legislation \nwill enhance the Clean Water Act. By seeking better science and \nincreasing needed Federal funding, this bill will strengthen programs \non the ground that work--programs that improve water quality and help \nus achieve the fundamental goals of fishable and swimmable waters.\n  I commend Senator Crapo for his leadership on this issue. I believe \nthat in crafting this legislation, he is taking an important step in \nthe right direction. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2418. A bill to prohibit commercial air tour operations over the \nBlack Canyon National Park; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park Commercial Overflights Ban \n                                  Act\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould prohibit commercial tour overflight operators from flying in and \nover the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. The Black Canyon \nof the Gunnison National Park, our nation's 55th and newest national \npark is a breathtaking canyon of diverse magnitude, which is why I \nworked for over 13 years to get it dedicated as a national park.\n  I cannot imagine having the many visitors who tour my home state to \nview Colorado's newest national park enjoying the sound of airplanes or \nhelicopters buzzing overhead while they are trying to listen to the \nflowing river at the bottom of the canyon. Because of the deep, narrow \nnature of the canyon, rescue and recovery operations for aircraft that \nexperience problems would be extremely difficult, dangerous and costly.\n  My bill would amend the FAA reauthorization act of 2000 and would \nonly restrict overflights on the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National \nPark. I worked with my friend and colleague Senator Allard for over \nfive years in support of his effort to get commercial overflights \nbanned over the Rocky Mountain National Park. Similar action by \nCongress is now necessary for the Black Canyon of the Gunnison.\n  I believe National Park visitors seek peacefulness when they visit a \nnational park and my legislation would help provide that. We contacted \nthe Superintendent of the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park \nand he informed us that currently no commercial overflights are taking \nplace, but there may have been flights in the past.\n  My bill would amend already existing law and would not negatively \naffect the operation of emergency, military and commercial high-level \nairlines or private planes.\n  The Denver Post recently published an editorial supporting \nCongressional action on the issue of aircraft noise, citing how such \noperations would create noise which would echo terribly off the walls \nof the Canyon. As a member of the National Park and Historic \nPreservation Subcommittee, I have confronted these types of issues in \nthe past and know how important it is for the visitors to our national \nparks to have everlasting and fond memories when they take the time and \neffort to visit the natural wonders we are blessed with in this \ncountry.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Denver Post editorial and the bill \nbe printed in the Record. And, I ask my colleagues to support this \nneeded legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2418\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN COMMERCIAL AIR TOUR \n                   OPERATIONS.\n\n       Section 806 of the National Parks Air Tour Management Act \n     of 2000 is amended by inserting ``or the Black Canyon of the \n     Gunnison National Park'' after ``Rocky Mountain National \n     Park''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        Keep Planes Out of Parks\n\n       April 10--It took five years, but the wonderful quiet over \n     Rocky Mountain National Park has been permanently preserved. \n     However, the state's congressional delegation should take \n     steps to protect other national parks in Colorado from being \n     pestered by the constant drone of low-flying planes and the \n     thunderous whapping of helicopter blades. Of particular \n     concern is the Black Canyon of the Gunnison.\n       Aircraft noise has become a huge problem in some national \n     parks, such as the Grand Canyon.\n       So, when a helicopter tour company wanted to start scenic \n     flights over Rocky Mountain National Park in the mid-1990s, \n     Estes Park residents became alarmed.\n       A temporary ban on commercial flights over the park was put \n     in place, thanks to efforts by then-U.S. Rep. Wayne Allard, a \n     Republican who at the time represented the district that \n     includes Estes Park; then-U.S. Rep. David Skaggs, a Democrat \n     who at the time represented the district that includes \n     Boulder County, where part of the park is located; and then-\n     U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena, a former Denver \n     mayor.\n       But the ban wasn't really a done deal until this week. \n     Allard, now a U.S. senator, amended the Federal Aviation \n     Administration's authorization bill to include a permanent \n     ban on aircraft tours over Rocky Mountain National Park. U.S. \n     Rep. Bob Schaffer, another Republican who now represents \n     Colorado's Fourth Congressional District, co-sponsored a \n     similar amendment on the House side.\n       Unfortunately, their work may not yet be finished. In the \n     last several months, some outdoor recreation groups have \n     raised worries that commercial flights could become a problem \n     over the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. That \n     prospect could make it impossible for visitors to enjoy \n     standing on the rim and listening to the Gunnison River roar \n     thousands of feet below. Aircraft noise would echo terribly \n     off the rock walls, and the narrow canyon could present \n     safety problems.\n       The use of commercial aircraft is justifiable in a few \n     national parks. In Alaska, for example, airplanes are needed \n     to reach parts of Denali National Park, including the main \n     climbing route on Mount McKinley.\n       But in the national parks in Colorado, commercial tour \n     flights simply aren't appropriate. The state's congressional \n     delegation should continue to work on the issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 2419. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \nthe annual determination of the rate of the basic benefit of active \nduty educational assistance under the Montgomery GI Bill, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n              VETERANS' HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans \nHigher Education Opportunities Act. I am pleased to be joined by the \ndistinguished Senator Collins of Maine in bringing this important issue \nto the Senate floor today.\n  The 1944 GI Bill of Rights is one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation ever passed by Congress. No program has been more \nsuccessful in increasing educational opportunities for our country's \nveterans while also providing a valuable incentive for the best and \nbrightest to make a career out of military service. This bill has \nallowed eight million veterans to finish high school and 2.3 million \nservice members to attend college.\n\n[[Page S2733]]\n\n  Unfortunately, without this update the current GI Bill can no longer \ndeliver these results and fails in its promise to recruits and service \nmembers. The legislation that Senator Collins and I are introducing \ntoday will take an important first step in modernizing the GI Bill.\n  Over 96% of recruits currently sign up for the Montgomery GI Bill and \npay $1,200 out of their first year's pay to guarantee eligibility. But \nonly one-half of these military personnel use any of the current \nMontgomery GI Bill benefits. This is evidence that the current GI Bill \nsimply does not meet their needs.\n  GI Bill benefits have not kept pace with increased costs of \neducation. During the 1995-96 school year, the basic benefit paid under \nthe Montgomery GI Bill offset only 36% of average total education \ncosts.\n  There is wide consensus among national higher education and veterans \nassociations that at a minimum, the GI Bill should pay the costs of \nattending the average four-year public institution as a commuter \nstudent. The current Montgomery GI Bill benefit pays only 55% of that \ncost.\n  My legislation creates that benchmark by indexing the GI Bill to the \ncosts of attending the average four-year public institution as a \ncommuter student. For example, those costs for the 1999-2000 academic \nyear were $8,774. The Veterans Higher Education Opportunities Act would \nthereby require 36 monthly stipends of $975 for a total GI Bill benefit \nof $35,100. This benchmark cost will be updated annually by the College \nBoard in order for the GI Bill to keep pace.\n  I am pleased that my legislation has the bipartisan support of \nSenator Collins and the overwhelming support of the Partnership for \nVeterans' Education. This organization includes over 45 veterans groups \nand higher education organizations including the VFW, the American \nCouncil on Education, the Non Commissioned Officers Association, the \nNational Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, and \nThe Retired Enlisted Association.\n  Several proposals have been introduced in the House that would \naddress the shortfalls of the current GI Bill, and I look forward to \nworking with members of the House and my colleagues in the Senate on \nthis important issue.\n  As the parent of a son who served as a peacekeeper in Bosnia and who \nis currently deployed in Kosovo, these military ``quality of life'' \nchallenges are particularly apparent to me. Making the GI Bill pay for \nviable educational opportunity makes as much sense today as it did \nfollowing World War II.

Mr. President, I am delighted to join with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Johnson, in introducing the Veterans' Higher \nEducation Opportunities Act of 2000. This legislation will provide our \nveterans with expanded educational opportunities at a reasonable cost. \nEndorsed by the 47-member Partnership for Veterans Education, our \nlegislation provides a new model for today's GI bill that is logical, \nfair, and worthy of a nation that values both higher education and our \nveterans.\n  The original GI bill was enacted in 1944. As a result of this \ninitiative, 7.8 million World War II veterans were able to take \nadvantage of postservice education and training opportunities, \nincluding more than 2 million veterans who went on to college. My own \nfather was among those veterans who served bravely in World War II and \nthen came back home to resume his education with assistance from the GI \nbill.\n  Since that time, various incarnations of the G.I. Bill have continued \nto assist millions of veterans in taking advantage of the educational \nopportunities they put on hold in order to serve their country. New \nlaws were enacted to provide educational assistance to those who served \nin Korea and Vietnam, as well as to those who served during the period \nin-between. Since the change to an all-volunteer service, additional \nadjustments to these programs were made, leading up to the enactment of \nthe Montgomery G.I. Bill in 1985.\n  The value of the educational benefit assistance provided by the \nMontgomery G.I. Bill, however, has greatly eroded over time due to \ninflation and the escalating cost of higher education. Military \nrecruiters indicate that the program's benefits no longer serve as a \nstrong incentive to join the military; nor do they serve as a retention \ntool valuable enough to persuade men and women to stay in the military \nand defer the full or part-time pursuit of their higher education until \na later date. Perhaps most important, the program is losing its value \nas an instrument for readjustment into civilian life after military \nservice.\n  This point really hit home for me when I recently met with \nrepresentatives of the Maine State Approving Agency (SAA) for Veterans \nEducation Programs. They told me of the ever increasing difficulties \nthat service members are having in using the G.I. Bill's benefits for \neducation and training.\n  For example, the Maine representatives told me that the majority of \ntoday's veterans are married and have children. Yet, the Montgomery \nG.I. Bill often does not cover the cost of tuition to attend a public \ninstitution, let alone the other costs associated with the pursuit of \nhigher education and those required to help support a family.\n  In fact, in constant dollars, with one exception, the current G.I. \nBill provides the lowest level of assistance ever to those who served \nin the defense\n\n[[Page S2734]]\n\nof our country. The basic benefit program of the Vietnam Era G.I. Bill \nprovided $493 per month in 1981 to a veteran with a spouse and two \nchildren. Twenty years later, a veteran in identical circumstances \nreceives only $43 more, a mere 8% increase over a time period when \ninflation has nearly doubled, and a dollar buys only half of what it \nonce purchased.\n  To address these problems, we are offering a modern version of the \nMontgomery G. I. Bill. This new model establishes a sensible, \neasily understood benchmark for G.I. Bill benefits. The benchmark sets \nG.I. Bill benefits at ``the average monthly costs of tuition and \nexpenses for commuter students at public institutions of higher \neducation that award baccalaureate degrees.'' This commonsense \nprovision would serve as the foundation upon which future education \nstipends for all veterans would be based and would set benefits at a \nlevel sufficient to provide veterans the education promised to them at \nrecruitment.\n\n  The current G.I. Bill now provides nine monthly $536 stipends per \nyear for four years. The total benefit is $19,296. Under the new \nbenchmark established by this legislation, the monthly stipend for the \nthis academic year would be $975, producing a new total benefit of \n$35,100 for the four academic years.\n  Mr. President, today's G.I. Bill is woefully under-funded and does \nnot provide the financial support necessary for our veterans to meet \ntheir educational goals. The legislation that we are proposing would \nfulfill the promise made to our nation's veterans, help with recruiting \nand retention of men and women in our military, and reflect current \ncosts of higher education. Now is the time to enact these modest \nimprovements to the basic benefit program of the Montgomery G.I. Bill.\n  I urge all members of the Senate to join Senator Johnson and myself \nin support of the Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Collins, and Mr. \n        Cleland):\n  S. 2420.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives for farm relief and economic development, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            Farm Relief and Economic Development Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Farm Relief \nand Economic Development Act of 2000. We have farmers who are in the \ndeepest trouble they have been in in 50 years: the lowest prices in 50 \nyears, a series of natural disasters in many parts of the country, and \nan economic environment in which our major competitors are outgunning \nus 60 to 1 in agricultural export support, by 10 to 1 in internal \nsupport. The result is tens of thousands of farm families are faced \nwith failure unless we respond.\n  The Department of Agriculture has told us that farm income will drop \n$8 billion if we fail to act. As part of an overall response, today I \nam introducing legislation that I term the ``Farm Relief and Economic \nDevelopment Act of 2000.'' There is no question in my mind that the \nbest action Congress could take on farm policy would be to rewrite the \nfarm bill. But that is unlikely to happen this year.\n  There are parts of the Internal Revenue Code that create unnecessary \nproblems for farmers that we can address. The essential elements of \nthis bill are provisions to address farm and ranch risk management \naccounts. This proposal would allow farmers to make contributions to \ntax-deferred accounts, which would be known as farm and ranch risk \nmanagement accounts. Those accounts would provide farmers with a \nvaluable new tool for managing money in a way that best benefits each \nfarmer's own operations.\n  The second key element of this legislation is clarifying the self-\nemployment tax that applies to farm lease income. A farm landlord \nshould be treated no differently than small business operators and \nother commercial landlords when it comes to cash rent income.\n  As a result of a 1996 Tax Court decision, the IRS has now expanded \nthe reach of the self-employment tax to include all farm landlords, \nwhether or not they are active participants in the farming activity. My \nproposal would restore the pre-1996 status quo, turning back this \nunilateral action by the IRS. My proposal also includes language to \nclarify the Conservation Reserve Program payments are not subject to \nthe self-employment tax. Again, we have an interpretation by the \nInternal Revenue Service that we think is badly flawed and ought to be \nreversed.\n  This legislation provides capital gains relief on the sale of farm \nresidences and farmland. Farm families frequently cannot take full \nadvantage of the $500,000 capital gains tax exemption that we provide \nnonfarm residents. That is because the IRS separates the value of a \nfarmer's house from the contiguous land. The value of the home often \nturns out to be negligible because the IRS often judges homes located \nfar out in the country to have very little value. In fact, it is often \nthe case it has very little in the way of market value when it is \ndetached from the land that surrounds that farmstead. My proposal would \nallow the exclusion of $500,000 that we currently allow homeowners to \nbe applied to the sale of a farmer's home and up to 160 acres of \nsurrounding farmland.\n  The next element of my legislation is Aggie bonds. Finding ways to \nencourage people to start farming is not easy. Aggie bonds are helping \nby reducing the cost of credit and stimulating investment in \nagriculture. This proposal would exclude Aggie bonds from the State \nvolume cap. It would not change the loan limit, nor would it affect any \nadditional limitations or qualifications imposed by the 16 States which \nparticipate in the program.\n\n  My proposal provides capital gains tax relief for farmers leaving \nfarming. The farmer who decides to leave under enormous financial \npressure today often finds the IRS waiting with its hand out. When \nproperty is sold at auction in order to satisfy debt, the farmers will \noften realize a very significant capital gain, even though they really \nhave losses because the value of the property has gone up while the \ndebt may have gone up even more dramatically. This proposal would \nprovide a once-in-a-lifetime capital gains exclusion for farmers who \ndecide or are pressured to leave agriculture.\n  Next, this proposal addresses net operating losses of farmers. My \nproposal would lengthen the carryback period for net operating losses \nfor farmers to 10 years. Because of the volatility in the income of \nfarmers, we believe it makes sense to allow them a net operating loss \nover an extended period.\n  Next, this proposal I am offering today deals with estate valuation. \nWe\n\n[[Page S2737]]\n\nhave the special use valuation, in order to help farmers keep their \nfarms intact. The definitions that trigger the recapture, \nunfortunately, are too rigid. If the farm can remain a going concern by \nrenting some portion of it to other family members, I believe the \nfamily should be able to still enjoy the benefits of special use \nvaluation. My proposal would provide that an heir could rent the family \nfarm to family members for the purpose of farming without triggering \nthe recapture provisions.\n  Next, my proposal deals with farmer cooperatives. This proposal would \nprovide cooperatives with the same declaratory relief procedures \navailable to other tax-exempt entities when their tax-exempt status is \ndenied.\n  Finally, my proposal deals with income averaging for farmers and the \nalternative minimum tax. Because of interaction between the income \naveraging provisions of the code and the alternative minimum tax, some \nfarmers who elect to take advantage of income averaging are finding \nthemselves subject to alternative minimum tax. That was never intended. \nThis outcome should be changed so farmers receive the full benefit of \nincome averaging. This proposal would provide that a farmer who elects \nincome averaging would not then face an increase in AMT liability.\n  With that, Mr. President, I send the bill to the desk and ask for its \nreferral. I hope colleagues will support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 2423. A bill to provide Federal Perkins Loan cancellation for \npublic defenders; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n         federal perkins loan cancellation for public defenders\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nwith Senators Feinstein, Dodd, Wellstone, and Bingaman to include full-\ntime public defense attorneys in the Federal Perkins Loan forgiveness \nprogram for law enforcement officers. This amendment will provide \nparity to public defense attorneys and uphold the goals set forth by \nthe Supreme Court to equalize access to legal resources. Representative \nTom Campbell of California will be introducing a similar bill in the \nHouse.\n  Under section 465(a)(2)(F) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, a \nborrower with a loan made under the Federal Perkins Loan Program is \neligible to have the loan canceled for serving full-time as a law \nenforcement officer or corrections officer in a local, State, or \nFederal law enforcement or corrections agency. While the rules \ngoverning borrower eligibility for law enforcement cancellation have \nbeen interpreted by the Department of Education to include prosecuting \nattorneys, public defenders have been excluded from the loan \nforgiveness program. This policy must be amended.\n  Like prosecutors, public defense attorneys play an integral role in \nour adversarial process. This judicial process is the most effective \nmeans of getting at truth and rendering justice. The United States \nSupreme Court in a series of cases has recognized the importance of the \nright to counsel in implementing the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a \nfair trial and the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause requiring \ncounsel to be appointed for all persons accused of offenses in which \nthere is a possibility of a jail term being imposed.\n  Absent adequate counsel for all parties, there is a danger that the \noutcome may be determined not by who has the most convincing case but \nby who has the most resources. The Court rightly addressed this \npossible miscarriage of justice by requiring counsel to be appointed \nfor the accused. Public defenders fill this Court mandated role by \nrepresenting the interests of criminally accused indigent persons. They \ngive indigent defendants sufficient resources to present an adequate \ndefense, so that the public goal of truth and justice will govern the \noutcome.\n  The Department of Education's interpretation of the statue to exclude \npublic defenders from the loan forgiveness program undermines the goals \nset forth by the Supreme Court to equalize access to legal resources. \nIt creates an obvious disparity of resources between public defenders \nand prosecutors by encouraging talented individuals to pursue public \nservice as prosecutors but not as defenders. The criminal justice \nsystem works best when both sides are adequately represented. The \npublic interest is served when indigent defendants have access to \ntalented defenders. One of the ways to facilitate this goal is by \ngranting loan cancellation benefits to defense attorneys.\n  Moreover, public defense attorneys meet all the eligibility \nrequirements of the loan forgiveness program as set forth in current \nfederal regulations. They belong to publicly funded public defender \nagencies and they are sworn officers of the court whose principal \nresponsibilities are unique to the criminal justice system and are \nessential in the performance of the agencies' primary mission. In \naddition, like prosecuting attorneys, public defenders are law \nenforcement officers dedicated to upholding, protecting, and enforcing \nour laws. Without public defense attorneys, the adversarial process of \nour criminal justice system could not operate.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me, Senator Feinstein, Senator Dodd, \nSenator Wellstone, Senator Bingaman, and Representative Campbell in \nsupporting the goal of equalized access to legal resources, as set \nforth in the Constitution and elucidated by the Supreme Court, by \nproviding parity to public defenders and allowing them to join \nprosecutors in receiving loan cancellation benefits.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2423\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Energy Conservation and Production Act \nto make changes in the Weatherization Assistance Program for Low-Income \nPersons; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 Weatherization Improvement Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nWeatherization Improvement Act of 2000.\n  As this past winter has demonstrated, cold temperatures and high fuel \ncosts can result in severe hardship for many of our low-income \nhouseholds, particularly those with children, elderly, and disabled \nmembers. Preventative energy efficiency measures are vital to ensure \nthat low-income consumers spend less money keeping their families warm \non cold winter nights. It is estimated that investments in \nWeatherization can save a typical household $193 in annual gas energy \ncosts. While improving energy efficiency through work such as air-\n\n[[Page S2738]]\n\nsealing and insulation work is an admirable goal, the Weatherization \nAssistance Program also has become an important tool in addressing the \nhealth and safely of our low-income families.\n  The Weatherization Improvement Act of 2000 seeks to further this \ncommitment. The legislation will amend the average per dwelling unit \ncost to incorporate intensive costs, such as costs of furnace or \ncooling replacements, reducing the administrative burden of tracking \nthese costs separately; increase the average cost per home, beginning \nthis year, to $2,500 (up from $2,032 for 1999); and eliminate the \nstatutory requirement that at least 40 percent of funds be spent on \nmaterials. These changes are necessary to improve the effectiveness of \nthe Weatherization, and are long overdue.\n  Lastly, the legislation repeals the 25 percent state matching \nrequirement for the Weatherization Assistance Program set to begin in \nFY2001, which was included in the FY2000 Interior Appropriations \nlegislation. While many states, utilities, and private organizations \nhave leveraged large amounts of money in support of the Weatherization \nAssistance Program, not every state is in the same financial situation. \nThere needs to be national commitment to energy efficiency for low \nincome Americans and affordable housing. This is part of that \ncommitment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 2430. A bill to combat computer hacking through enhanced law \nenforcement and to protect the privacy and constitutional rights of \nAmericans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     Internet Security Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we head into the twenty-first century, \ncomputer-related crime is one of the greatest challenges facing law \nenforcement. Many of our critical infrastructures and our government \ndepend upon the reliability and security of complex computer systems. \nWe need to make sure that these essential systems are protected from \nall forms of attack. The legislation I am introducing today will help \nlaw enforcement investigate and prosecute those who jeopardize the \nintegrity of our computer systems and the Internet.\n  Whether we work in the private sector or in government, we negotiate \ndaily through a variety of security checkpoints designed to protect \nourselves from being victimized by crime or targeted by terrorists. For \ninstance, congressional buildings like this one use cement pillars \nplaced at entrances, photo identification cards, metal detectors, x-ray \nscanners, and security guards to protect the physical space. These \nsecurity steps and others have become ubiquitous in the private sector \nas well.\n  Yet all these physical barriers can be circumvented using the wires \nthat run into every building to support the computers and computer \nnetworks that are the mainstay of how we communicate and do business. \nThis plain fact was amply demonstrated by the recent hacker attacks on \nE-Trade, ZDNet, Datek, Yahoo, eBay, Amazon.com and other Internet \nsites. These attacks raise serious questions about Internet security--\nquestions that we need to answer to ensure the long-term stability of \nelectronic commerce. More importantly, a well-focused and more malign \ncyber-attack on computer networks that support telecommunications, \ntransportation, water supply, banking, electrical power and other \ncritical infrastructure systems could wreak havoc on our national \neconomy or even jeopardize our national defense. We have learned that \neven law enforcement is not immune. Just recently we learned of a \ndenial of service attack successfully perpetrated against a FBI web \nsite, shutting down that site for several hours.\n  The cybercrime problem is growing. The reports of the CERT \nCoordination Center (formerly called the ``Computer Emergency Response \nTeam''), which was established in 1988 to help the Internet community \ndetect and resolve computer security incidents, provide chilling \nstatistics on the vulnerabilities of the Internet and the scope of the \nproblem. Over the last decade, the number of reported computer security \nincidents grew from 6 in 1988 to more than 8,000 in 1999. But that \nalone does not reveal the scope of the problem. According to CERT's \nmost recent annual report, more than four million computer hosts were \naffected by the computer security incidents in 1999 alone by damaging \ncomputer viruses, with names like ``Melissa,'' ``Chernobyl,'' \n``ExploreZip,'' and by the other ways that remote intruders have found \nto exploit system vulnerabilities. Even before the recent headline-\ngrabbing ``denial-of-service'' attacks, CERT documented that such \nincidents ``grew at rate around 50% per year'' which was ``greater than \nthe  rate of growth of Internet hosts.''\n\n  CERT has tracked recent trends in severe hacking incidents on the \nInternet and made the following observations, First, hacking techniques \nare getting more sophisticated. That means law enforcement is going to \nhave to get smarter too, and we need to give them the resources to do \nthis. Second, hackers have ``become increasingly difficult to locate \nand identify.'' These criminals are operating in many different \nlocations and are using techniques that allow them to operate in \n``nearly total obscurity.''\n  We have been aware of the vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks of our \ncomputer networks for more than a decade. It became clear to me, when I \nchaired a series of hearings in 1988 and 1989 by the Subcommittee on \nTechnology and the Law in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the subject \nof high-tech terrorism and the threat of computer viruses, that merely \n``hardening'' our physical space from potential attack would only \nprompt committed criminals and terrorists to switch tactics and use new \ntechnologies to reach vulnerable softer targets, such as our computer \nsystems and other critical infrastructures. The government has a \nresponsibility to work with those in the private sector to assess those \nvulnerabilities and defend them. That means making sure our law \nenforcement agencies have the tools they need, but also that the \ngovernment does not stand in the way of smart technical solutions to \ndefend our computer systems.\n  Targeting cybercrime with up-to-date criminal laws and tougher law \nenforcement is only part of the solution. While criminal penalties may \ndeter some computer criminals, these laws usually come into play too \nlate, after the crime has been committed and the injury inflicted. We \nshould keep in mind the adage that the best defense is a good offense. \nAmericans and American firms must be encouraged to take preventive \nmeasures to protect their computer information and systems. Just \nrecently, internet providers and companies such as Yahoo! and \nAmazon.com Inc., and computer hardware companies such a Cisco Systems \nInc., proved successful at stemming attacks within hours thereby \nlimiting losses.\n  That is why, for years, I have advocated and sponsored legislation to \nencourage the widespread use of strong encryption. Encryption is an \nimportant tool in our arsenal to protect the security of our computer \ninformation and networks. The Administration made enormous progress \nearlier this year when it issued new regulations relaxing export \ncontrols on strong encryption. Of course, encryption technology cannot \nbe the sole source of protection for our critical computer networks and \ncomputer-based infrastructure, but we need to make sure the government \nis encouraging--and not restraining--the use of strong encryption and \nother technical solutions to protecting our computer systems.\n  Congress has responded again and again to help our law enforcement \nagencies keep up with the challenges of new crimes being executed over \ncomputer networks. In 1984, we passed the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, \nand  its amendments, to criminalize conduct when carried out by means \nof unauthorized access to a computer. In 1986, we passed the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act (ECPA), which I was proud to sponsor, to \ncriminalize tampering with electronic mail systems and remote data \nprocessing systems and to protect the privacy of computer users. In the \n104th Congress, Senators Kyl, Grassley, and I worked together to enact \nthe National Information Infrastructure Protection Act to increase \nprotection under federal criminal law for both government and private \ncomputers, and to address an emerging problem of computer-age blackmail \nin which a criminal threatens to harm or shut down a computer system \nunless their extortion demands are met.\n\n[[Page S2739]]\n\n  In this Congress, I have introduced a bill with Senator DeWine, the \nComputer Crime Enforcement Act, S. 1314, to set up a $25 million grant \nprogram within the U.S. Department of Justice for states to tap for \nimproved education, training, enforcement and prosecution of computer \ncrimes. All 50 states have now enacted tough computer crime control \nlaws. These state laws establish a firm groundwork for electronic \ncommerce and Internet security. Unfortunately, too many state and local \nlaw enforcement agencies are struggling to afford the high cost of \ntraining and equipment necessary for effective enforcement of their \nstate computer crime statutes. Our legislation, the Computer Crime \nEnforcement Act, would help state and local law enforcement join the \nfight to combat the worsening threats we face from computer crime.\n  Computer crime is a problem nationwide and in Vermont. I recently \nreleased a survey on computer crime in Vermont. My office surveyed 54 \nlaw enforcement agencies in Vermont--43 police departments and 11 \nState's attorney offices--on their experience investigating and \nprosecuting computer crimes. The survey found that more than half of \nthese Vermont law enforcement agencies encounter computer crime, with \nmany police departments and state's attorney offices handling 2 to 5 \ncomputer crimes per month.\n  Despite this documented need, far too many law enforcement agencies \nin Vermont cannot afford the cost of policing against computer crimes. \nIndeed, my survey found that 98% of the responding Vermont law \nenforcement agencies do not have funds dedicated for use in computer \ncrime enforcement.\n  My survey also found that few law enforcement officers in Vermont are \nproperly trained in investigating computer crimes and analyzing cyber-\nevidence. According to my survey, 83% of responding law enforcement \nagencies in Vermont do not employ officers properly trained in computer \ncrime investigative techniques. Moreover, my survey found that 52% of \nthe law enforcement agencies that handle one or more computer crimes \nper month cited their lack of training as a problem encountered during \ninvestigations. Proper training is critical to ensuring success in the \nfight against computer crime.\n  This bill will help our computer crime laws up to date as an \nimportant backstop and deterrent. I believe that our current computer \ncrime laws can be enhanced and that the time to act is now. We should \npass legislation designed to improve our law enforcement efforts while \nat the same time protecting the privacy rights of American citizens.\n  The bill I offer today will make it more efficient for law \nenforcement to use tools that are already available--such as pen \nregisters and trap and trace devices--to track down computer criminals \nexpeditiously. It will ensure that law enforcement can investigate and \nprosecute hacker attacks even when perpetrators use foreign-based \ncomputers to facilitate their crimes. It will implement criminal \nforfeiture provisions to ensure that cybercriminals are forced to \nrelinquish the tools of their trade upon conviction. It will also close \na current loophole in our wiretap laws that prevents a law enforcement \nofficer from monitoring an innocent-host computer with the consent of \nthe computer's owner and without a wiretap order to track down the \nsource of denial-of-service attacks. Finally, this legislation will \nassist state and local police departments in their parallel efforts to \ncombat cybercrime, in recognition of the fact that this fight is not \njust at the federal level.\n  The key provisions of the bill are:\n  Jurisdictional and Definitional Changes to the Computer Fraud and \nAbuse Act: The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030, is \nthe primary federal criminal statute prohibiting computer frauds and \nhacking. This bill would amend the statute to clarify the appropriate \nscope of federal jurisdiction. First, the bill adds a broad definition \nof ``loss'' to the definitional section. Calculation of loss is \nimportant both in determining whether the $5,000 jurisdictional hurdle \nin the statute is met, and, at sentencing, in calculating the \nappropriate guideline range and restitution amount.\n  Second, the bill amends the definition of ``protected computer,'' to \nexpressly include qualified computers even when they are physically \nlocated outside of the United States. This clarification will preserve \nthe ability of the United States to assist in international hacking \ncases. A ``Sense of Congress'' provision specifies that federal \njurisdiction is justified by the ``interconnected and interdependent \nnature of computers used in interstate or foreign commerce.''\n  Finally, the bill expands the jurisdiction of the United States \nSecret Service to encompass investigations of all violations of 18 \nU.S.C. Sec. 1030. Prior to the 1996 amendments to the Computer Fraud \nand Abuse Act, the Secret Service was authorized to investigate any and \nall violations of section 1030, pursuant to an agreement between the \nSecretary of Treasury and the Attorney General. The 1996 amendments, \nhowever, concentrated Secret Service jurisdiction on certain specified \nsubsections of section 1030. The current amendment would return full \njurisdiction to the Secret Service and would allow the Justice and \nTreasury Departments to decide on the appropriate work-sharing balance \nbetween the two.\n  Elimination of Mandatory Minimum Sentence for Certain Violations of \nComputer Fraud and Abuse Act: Currently, a directive to the Sentencing \nCommission requires that all violations, including misdemeanor \nviolations, of  certain provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act \nbe punished with a term of imprisonment of at least six months. The \nbill would change this directive to the Sentencing Commission so that \nno such mandatory minimum would be required.\n\n  Additional Criminal Forfeiture Provisions: The bill adds a criminal \nforfeiture provision to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, requiring \nforfeiture of physical property used in or to facilitate the offense as \nwell as property derived from proceeds of the offense. It also \nsupplements the current forfeiture provision in 18 U.S.C. 2318, which \nprohibits trafficking in, among other things, counterfeit computer \nprogram documentation and packaging, to require the forfeiture of \nreplicators and other devices used in the production of such \ncounterfeit items.\n  Pen Registers and Trap and Trace Devices: The bill makes it easier \nfor law enforcement to use these investigative techniques in the area \nof cybercrime, and institutes corresponding privacy protections. On the \nlaw enforcement side, the bill gives nationwide effect to pen register \nand trap and trace orders obtained by Government attorneys, thus \nobviating the need to obtain identical orders in multiple federal \njurisdictions. It also clarifies that such devices can be used on all \nelectronic communication lines, not just telephone lines. On the \nprivacy side, the bill provides for greater judicial review of \napplications for pen registers and trap and trace devices and \ninstitutes a minimization requirement for the use of such devices. The \nbill also amends the reporting requirements for applications for such \ndevices by specifying the information to be reported.\n  Denial of Service Investigations: Currently, a person whose computer \nis accessed by a hacker as a means for the hacker to reach a third \ncomputer cannot simply consent to law enforcement monitoring of his \ncomputer. Instead, because this person is not technically a party to \nthe communication, law enforcement needs wiretap authorization under \nTitle III to conduct such monitoring. The bill will close this loophole \nby explicitly permitting such monitoring without a wiretap if prior \nconsent is obtained from the person whose computer is being hacked \nthrough and used to send ``harmful interference to a lawfully operating \ncomputer system.''\n  Encryption Reporting: The bill directs the Attorney General to report \nthe number of wiretap orders in which encryption was encountered and \nwhether such encryption precluded law enforcement from obtaining the \nplaintext of intercepted communications.\n  State and Local Computer Crime Enforcement: The bill directs the \nOffice of Federal Programs to make grants to assist State and local law \nenforcement in the investigation and prosecution of computer crime.\n  Legislation must be balanced to protect our privacy and other \nconstitutional rights. I am a strong proponent\n\n[[Page S2740]]\n\nof the Internet and a defender of our constitutional rights to speak \nfreely and to keep private our confidential affairs from either private \nsector snoops or unreasonable government searches. These principles can \nbe respected at the same time we hold accountable those malicious \nmischief makers and digital graffiti sprayers, who use computers to \ndamage or destroy the property of others. I have seen Congress react \nreflexively in the past to address concerns over anti-social behavior \non the Internet with legislative proposals that would do more harm than \ngood. A good example of this is the Communications Decency Act, which \nthe Supreme Court declared unconstitutional. We must make sure that our \nlegislative efforts are precisely targeted on stopping destructive acts \nand that we avoid scattershot proposals that would threaten, rather \nthan foster, electronic commerce and sacrifice, rather than promote, \nour constitutional rights.\n  Technology has ushered in a new age filled with unlimited potential \nfor commerce and communications. But the Internet age has also ushered \nin new challenges for federal, state and local law enforcement \nofficials. Congress and the Administration need to work together to \nmeet these new challenges while preserving the benefits of our new era. \nThe legislation I offer today is a step in that direction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2430\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Internet Security Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against income tax for expenses incurred in teleworking; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                       TELEWORK TAX INCENTIVE ACT\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce \nlegislation that would help people who ``telework'' or work from home, \nto receive a tax credit. Teleworkers are people who work a few days a \nweek on-line from home by using computers and other information \ntechnology tools. Nearly 20 million Americans telework today, and \naccording to experts, 40 percent of the nation's jobs are compatible \nwith telework. At one national telecommunications company, nearly 25 \npercent of its workforce works from home at least one day a week. The \ncompany found positive results in the way of fewer days of sick leave, \nbetter retention, and higher productivity.\n  I am introducing the Telework Tax Incentive Act to provide a $500 tax \ncredit for telework. The purpose of my legislation is to provide an \nincentive to encourage more employers to consider telework for their \nemployees. Telework should be a regular part of the 21st century \nworkplace. The best part of\n\n[[Page S2742]]\n\ntelework is that it improves the quality of life for all. Telework also \nreduces traffic congestion and air pollution. It reduces gas \nconsumption and our dependency on foreign oil. Telework is good for \nfamilies--working parents have flexibility to meet everyday demands. \nTelework provides people with disabilities greater job opportunities. \nTelework helps fill our nation's labor market shortage. It can also be \na good option for retirees choosing to work part-time.\n  Last fall, a task force on telework initiated by Governor James \nGilmore of Virginia made a number of recommendations to increase and \npromote telework. One recommendation was to establish a tax credit \ntoward the purchase and installation of electronic and computer \nequipment that allow an employee to telework. For example, the cost of \na computer, fax machine, modem, phone, printer, software, copier, and \nother expenses necessary to enable telework could count toward a tax \ncredit, provided the person worked at home a minimum number of days per \nyear.\n  My legislation would provide a $500 tax credit ``for expenses paid or \nincurred under a teleworking arrangement for furnishings and electronic \ninformation equipment which are used to enable an individual to \ntelework.'' An employee must telework a minimum of 75 days per year to \nqualify for the tax credit. Both the employer and employee are eligible \nfor the tax credit, but the tax credit goes to whomever absorbs the \nexpense for setting up the at-home worksite.\n  I am pleased to work with Congressman Frank Wolf who has introduced \nidentical legislation in the House of Representatives, H.R. 3819. A \nnumber of groups have already endorsed the Telework Tax Incentive Act \nincluding the International Telework Association and Council (ITAC), \nCovad Communications, National Town Builders Association, Litton \nIndustries, Orbital Sciences Corporation, Consumer Electronic \nAssociation, Capnet, BTG Corporation, Electonic Industries Alliance, \nTelecommunications Industry Association, American Automobile \nAssociation Mid-Atlantic, Dimensions International Inc., Capunet, \nTManage, Science Applications International Corporation, AT, Northern \nVirginia Technology Council, Computer Associates Incorporated, and Dyn \nCorp.\n  On October 9, 1999, legislation which I introduced last year in \ncoordination with Representative Frank Wolf from Virginia was signed \ninto law by the President as part of the annual Department of \nTransportation appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2000. S. 1521, the \nNational Telecommuting and Air Quality Act, created a pilot program to \nstudy the feasibility of providing incentives for companies to allow \ntheir employees to telework in five major metropolitan areas including \nPhiladelphia, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. Houston and Chicago \nhave been added as well. I am pleased that the Philadelphia Area Design \nTeam has been progressing well with its responsibility of examining the \napplication of these incentives to the greater Philadelphia \nmetropolitan area. I am excited that this opportunity continues to help \nto get the word out about the benefits of telecommuting for many \nemployees and employers.\n  Telecommuting improves air quality by reducing pollutants, provides \nemployees and families flexibility, reduces traffic congestion, and \nincreases productivity and retention rates for businesses while \nreducing their overhead costs. It's a growing opportunity and option \nwhich we should all include in our effort to maintain and improve \nquality of life issues in Pennsylvania and around the nation. According \nto statistics available from 1996, the Greater Philadelphia area ranked \nnumber 10 in the country for annual person-hours of delay due to \ntraffic congestion. Because of this reality, all options including \ntelecommuting should be pursued to address this challenge.\n  The 1999 Telework America National Telework Survey, conducted by Joan \nH. Pratt Associates, found that today's 19.6 million teleworkers \ntypically work 9 days per month at home at home with an average of 3 \nhours per week during normal business hours. In this study, teleworkers \nor telecommuters are defined overall as employees or independent \ncontractors who work at least one day per month at home. These research \nfindings impact the bottom line for employers and employees. \nTeleworkers seek a blend of job-related and personal benefits to enable \nthem to better handle their work and life responsibilities. For \nemployers, savings just from less absenteeism and increased employee \nretention total more than $10,000 per teleworker per year. Thus an \norganization with 100 employees, 20 of whom telework, could potentially \nrealize a savings of $200,000 annually, or more, when productivity \ngains are added.\n  Work is something you do, not someplace you go. There is nothing \nmagical about strapping ourselves into a car and driving sometimes up \nto an hour and a half, arriving at a workplace and sitting before a \ncomputer, when we can access the same information from a computer in \nour homes. Wouldn't it be great if we could replace the evening rush \nhour commute with time spent with the family, or coaching little league \nor other important quality of life matters?\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to consider cosponsoring this \nlegislation which promotes telework and helps encourage additional \nemployee choices for the workplace.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Smith of Oregon (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 2432. A bill to permit the catcher vessel Hazel Lorraine to \nconduct commercial fishing activities; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n  eligibility of the fishing vessel hazel lorraine under the american \n                             fisheries act\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am introducing, \nwith my colleague from Oregon, legislation which will correct an \noversight in the American Fisheries Act of 1998. Some of my colleagues \nwill recall that the American Fisheries Act was passed as part of the \nOmnibus Appropriations Act in the closing days of the 105th Congress.\n  Let me speak briefly first to the American Fisheries Act, or AFA, \nitself. The AFA was a major revision of management policies for the \nvaluable Bering Sea pollock fishery, raising domestic vessel ownership \nstandards, while bringing greater stability to the pollock fishery by \nallowing fishers and processors to engage in limited cooperatives. \nMonths of intense negotiations between interested congressional offices \nand a number of Alaskan and West Coast fishing interests resulted in \nthe compromise that was passed into law.\n  Oregon certainly does not have as great an interest in the Bering Sea \npollock fishery as other states do. Nevertheless, Oregon-based vessels \ndo participate in this and other distant-water fisheries. Many of these \nvessel owner-operators pioneered the development of the Alaskan pollock \nfishery during the Americanization of the Exclusive Economic Zone in \nthe 1980s. The American Fisheries Act was supposed to allow these, and \nother fishing vessels with substantial history, to stay in the fishery \nwhile excluding new or speculative entrants. The language used in the \nAFA to achieve this purpose requires that qualified vessels must have \ndelivered at least 250 metric tons of pollock in 1996, 1997, or an \neight month period in 1998, to the shore-based processing plants that \ncompose the ``inshore sector'' of the Bering Sea pollock fishery. \nAlternatively, the AFA requires vessels to have delivered at least 250 \nmetric tons of pollock in 1997 and have had at least 75 percent of \ntheir catch delivered to the ``offshore sector'' of factory trawlers in \norder to qualify for that sector of the Bering Sea pollock fishery.\n  While it was thought that this qualification language in the American \nFisheries Act would carry over all vessels with a substantial history \nin the fishery, this has turned out not to be the case. An Oregon-based \nvessel named the Hazel Lorraine--a vessel with years of Bering Sea \npollock landings on record--has found itself locked out of both the \ninshore and offshore sectors of the Bering Sea pollock fishery due to \nthe way the qualifications are worded in the AFA. On the one hand, the \nHazel Lorraine does not qualify for the inshore sector. The fact that \nthe then-Tyson Seafood plant in Kodiak was destroyed by a fire in 1997 \nalso impacted the Hazel Lorraine's deliveries during this period. On \nthe other hand, the Hazel Lorraine does not qualify for the offshore \nsector either--also as a direct result of the Tyson fire.\n\n[[Page S2743]]\n\nIn short, the Hazel Lorraine does not meet the AFA requirements for \neither the inshore or offshore sector for Bering Sea pollock despite a \nsubstantial record of deliveries in the fishery that stretches back \nmore than fifteen years.\n  Ironically, the owners of the Hazel Lorraine actively supported the \nAmerican Fisheries Act as it had first been introduced in the 105th \nCongress. However the bill changed dramatically during a series of \nbackroom negotiations before being tucked into an omnibus \nappropriations package. The AFA that actually passed the Congress \ndiffered substantially from the drafts that had been widely circulated \nin the fishing industry earlier that year.\n  Nevertheless, the fact remains that the Hazel Lorraine is recognized \nin the North Pacific as a vessel that can legitimately claim a long \nhistory in the Bering Sea pollock fishery. It would be a terrible \nmistake if the Congress were to allow this vessel to continue to be \nshut out of its historic fishery. A number of industry leaders and \nassociations, such as United Catcher Boats and the Midwater Trawlers \nCooperative, have also recognized this and have stated their support \nfor restoring the right of the Hazel Lorraine to fish in this pollock \nfishery.\n  Over the course of the past year, Senator Wyden and I have discussed \nthis issue with our colleagues, and have come to the conclusion that \nthe best course of action is to introduce authorizing legislation that \nwould clearly place the Hazel Lorraine among those vessels eligible to \nparticipate in the inshore sector of the Bering Sea pollock fishery. \nThis legislation will do just that. I think my colleagues will find \nthat those in the North Pacific fisheries who know the circumstances \nsurrounding the Hazel Lorraine will be supportive of this legislation. \nI look forward to working with members of the Commerce Committee to \nbring this issue to a resolution during this session of the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2432\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF VESSEL AS AN ELIGIBLE VESSEL.\n\n       Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) through (3) of section \n     208(a) of the American Fisheries Act (title II of division C \n     of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act, 1999 (Public Law 105-277; 112 Stat. 2681-\n     624)), the catcher vessel HAZEL LORRAINE (United States \n     Official Number 592211) shall be considered to be a vessel \n     that is eligible to harvest the directed fishing allowance \n     under section 206(b)(1) of that Act pursuant to a Federal \n     fishing permit in the same manner as, and subject to the same \n     requirements and limitations on that harvesting as apply to, \n     catcher vessels that are eligible to harvest that directed \n     fishing allowance under section 208(a) of that Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 2433. A bill to establish the Red River National Wildlife Refuge; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                 red river national wildlife refuge act\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise, along with the \nsenior Senator from Louisiana, to introduce legislation which would \nestablish the Red River National Wildlife Refuge. Congressman McCreary \nis introducing identical legislation in the House of Representatives. \nMr. President, the Red River Valley located along the Red River \nWaterway in Caddo, Bossier, Red River, Natchitoches and Desoto parishes \nin Louisiana is of critical importance to over 350 species of birds, \naquatic life and a wide array of other species associated with river \nbasin ecosystems. It represents a historic migration corridor for \nmigratory birds funneling through the mid-continent from as far north \nas the Arctic Circle and as far south as South America. The Red River \nValley also represents the most degraded watershed in Louisiana. The \nbottomland hardwood forests of the Red River Valley have been almost \ntotally cleared. Reforestation and restoration of native habitat will \nbenefit a host of species.\n  There are no significant public sanctuaries for over 300 river miles \non this important migration corridor, and no significant Federal, State \nor private wildlife sanctuaries along the Red River north from \nAlexandria, Louisiana to the Arkansas-Louisiana state boundary. The Red \nRiver Valley offers extraordinary recreational, research and \neducational opportunities for students, scientists, bird watchers, \nwildlife observers, hunters, anglers, trappers, hikers and nature \nphotographers.\n  The bill Senator Breaux and I are introducing today would: restore \nand preserve native Red River ecosystems; provide habitat for migratory \nbirds; maximize fisheries on the Red River and its tributaries, natural \nlakes and man-made reservoirs; provide habitat for and population \nmanagement of native plants and resident animals including restoration \nof extirpated species; provide technical assistance to private land \nowners in the restoration of their lands for the benefit of fish and \nwildlife and provide the public with opportunities for hunting, \nangling, trapping, photographing wildlife, hiking, bird watching and \nother outdoor recreational and educational activities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2433\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Red River National Wildlife \n     Refuge Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The area of Louisiana known as the Red River Valley, \n     located along the Red River Waterway in Caddo, Bossier, Red \n     River, Natchitoches, and DeSoto Parishes, is of critical \n     importance to over 350 species of birds (including migratory \n     and resident waterfowl, shore birds, and neotropical \n     migratory birds), aquatic life, and a wide array of other \n     species associated with river basin ecosystems.\n       (2) The bottomland hardwood forests of the Red River Valley \n     have been almost totally cleared. Reforestation and \n     restoration of native habitat will benefit a host of species.\n       (3) The Red River Valley is part of a major continental \n     migration corridor for migratory birds funneling through the \n     mid continent from as far north as the Arctic Circle and as \n     far south as South America.\n       (4) There are no significant public sanctuaries for over \n     300 river miles on this important migration corridor, and no \n     significant Federal, State, or private wildlife sanctuaries \n     along the Red River north of Alexandria, Louisiana.\n       (5) Completion of the lock and dam system associated with \n     the Red River Waterway project up to Shreveport, Louisiana, \n     has enhanced opportunities for management of fish and \n     wildlife.\n       (6) The Red River Valley offers extraordinary recreational, \n     research, and educational opportunities for students, \n     scientists, bird watchers, wildlife observers, hunters, \n     anglers, trappers, hikers, and nature photographers.\n       (7) The Red River Valley is an internationally significant \n     environmental resource that has been neglected and requires \n     active restoration and management to protect and enhance the \n     value of the region as a habitat for fish and wildlife.\n\n     SEC. 3.

CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Thompson, and Mr. \n        Sarbanes):\n  S. 2434. A bill to provide that amounts allotted to a State under \nsection 2401 of the Social Security Act for each of fiscal years 1998 \nand 1999 shall remain available through fiscal year 2002; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n state children's health insurance program (schip) preservation act of \n                                  2000\n\n Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today \nby Senators Bryan, Thompson, and Sarbanes in introducing the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) Preservation Act of 2000.\n  This legislation addresses what I believe to be an unintended \nconsequence of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), which created the \nState Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to provide health \ninsurance coverage to millions of our nation's uninsured children. \nSpecifically, the BBA called for states to enroll 2.5 million uninsured \nchildren in SCHIP within three years of enactment of the bill. \nAccording to the Health Care Financing Administration, states enrolled \n1.98 million children in SCHIP in 1999. While this represents an \nincrease in states' enrollment efforts, we need to ensure that the \nfederal government is financially committed to this program, and thus \nto providing health insurance to our nation's children.\n  SCHIP was designed to allow states to spend each year's allotment \nover a three-year period; if a state began its program in 1998, it has \nuntil the end of 2000 to spend its 1998 allotment. The legislation we \nare introducing today will extend this year's looming deadline through \nthe end of Fiscal Year 2002, thus allowing states to keep their \nunexpended SCHIP allotments for up to a total of five years. Many \nstates have had difficulties conducting outreach and enrolling SCHIP-\neligible children. We must not penalize states that need more time to \nidentify and enroll children in this important program.\n  Without this bill, the result--whether intended or unintended--would \nbe a potential reduction of up to $4 billion for children's health \nprograms throughout the country. A reduction of this magnitude would \nundermine many critical programs that provide quality health coverage \nto needy children. It may also inhibit the ability of states to provide \nservices for children already enrolled in SCHIP, as well as encouraging \nsome states to scale back on outreach and enrollment efforts. For \nexample, under current statute, Rhode Island will lose approximately $8 \nmillion annually starting in Fiscal Year 2001. This loss will undermine \nthe efforts of the state to target and enroll every child who is \neligible for SCHIP in Rhode Island. Reductions in SCHIP allotments to \nstates will mean that SCHIP-eligible children who are not yet enrolled \nin the program may continue to go without health insurance.\n  Data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the number of children \nwithout health insurance increased from 9.8 million children in 1995 to \n11.1 million children in 1998. This increase in the uninsured rate \noccurred in spite of the enactment of SCHIP in 1997. We must not allow \nthis trend to continue. States need to be able to tap into their \nunexpended SCHIP funds to continue their outreach and enrollment \nefforts. At a time when our nation's uninsured rate continues to climb \nabove 44 million, it makes little sense to be reducing these much \nneeded SCHIP payments to states that are desperately trying to reach \nout to and enroll these vulnerable and needy children.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation, and ask unanimous consent that the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2434\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program (SCHIP) Preservation Act of 2000''.\n\n[[Page S2745]]\n\n     SEC. 2. AVAILABILITY OF FISCAL YEAR 1998 AND FISCAL YEAR 1999 \n                   ALLOTMENTS UNDER SCHIP.\n\n       Notwithstanding subsection (e) of section 2104 of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397dd), amounts allotted to a \n     State under that section for each of fiscal years 1998 and \n     1999 shall remain available through September 30, \n     2002.\n\n Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senators \nLincoln Chafee, Paul Sarbanes, and Fred Thompson as an original \ncosponsor of the State Children's Health Insurance Program Preservation \nAct of 2000, and I thank Senator Chafee for his leadership on this \nbill.\n  This important legislation provides that Federal funds allotted to \nStates under the state children's health insurance program for each of \nfiscal years 1998 and 1999 will remain available to the states through \nfiscal year 2002.\n  The enactment of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act's state children's \nhealth insurance program (CHIP was a seminal event in addressing the \nproblem of uninsured children in this nation. The $24 billion funding \nreflected the seriousness of the national commitment to ensuring \nchildren will have access to health care services. It provided my state \nof Nevada and the nation with an incredible opportunity to address a \nmost stubborn problem--the increasing number of children who have no \nhealth care insurance.\n  States were provided three options to provide child health care \nservices through the federal funding allotments: to expand Medicaid \ncoverage under enhanced Medicaid matching rates; to create or expand \nseparate child health insurance programs; or to use a combination of \nthe two. All options, rightly I believe, require the States to spend \nsome of their own funds as a condition of participating in the program.\n  The choices states face under the CHIP program reflect the \nflexibility they wanted to tailor these programs, within federal \nguidelines, to the specific needs of each state to reduce the number of \nuninsured children.\n  Nevada's CHIP program--``Nevada CheckUp''--was approved by HCFA in \nAugust 1998 and began operating in October 1998. The program is \nseparate from the Medicaid program, but the two are coordinated in the \napplication process to ensure those children eligible for Medicaid are \nenrolled in that program. The Nevada CheckUp program covers applicants \nup to 200% of the federal poverty level, and children up to age 18.\n  Since its October 1998 beginning, Nevada CheckUp has enrolled over \n9,000 children, representing almost 60% of the anticipated total \neligible children. But there are approximately 6,000 children in Nevada \nwho thus remain uninsured, who need health care coverage, and who must \nbe found and covered. We can and must do better.\n  It took the state some time to develop its program, create a state \nplan, get state and federal approval, hire and train the staff and \nbegin the marketing outreach and enrollment activities. In the one and \none-half years the program has been operating, the state has learned \nwhat has worked successfully, and what has not worked. They are in the \nprocess of developing a new marketing plan, which will allow us to \nreach more uninsured Nevada children. The new proposal will use more \nmedia and broadcast tools to target the low income population.\n  The CHIP program is still in its infancy, and states are still \nlearning how best to develop programs to provide children with much-\nneeded health insurance. I am hopeful as this program matures, we will \nsee a most successful effort to cover our nation's children, and ensure \ntheir health care needs are met into the next century.\n  Allow the states to keep their federal allotment for an additional \ntwo years should provide Nevada, and other States, the opportunity to \nreach the total number of eligible children, and increase the number of \nchildren with health insurance.\n  I sincerely hope Nevada will find the means to make its full match, \nso our state can draw 100 percent of its available federal funds. Wise \nuse of these Federal funds, with a continued commitment to our \nchildren, and with a 100-percent effort by our state will get the job \ndone. Our children simply deserve no less than a fully-funded \neffort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. \n        Dodd):\n  S. 2435. A bill to amend part B of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to crate a grant program to promote joint activities among Federal, \nState, and local public child welfare and alcohol and drug abuse \nprevention and treatment agencies; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           Child Protection/Alcohol and Drug Partnership Act\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Child \nProtection/Alcohol and Drug Partnership Act.'' I am pleased to be \njoined by my good friends, Senators Rockefeller, DeWine, and Dodd on \nthis exciting new proposal. Mr. President, this bill is an enormously \nimportant piece of legislation. It provides the means for states to \nsupport some of our most vulnerable families--families who are \nstruggling with alcohol and drug abuse, and the children who are being \nraised in these abusive homes.\n  It is obvious, both anecdotally and statistically, that child welfare \nis significantly impacted by parental substance abuse. And it makes a \nlot of sense to fund state programs to address these two issues in \ntandem. The real question in designing and supporting child welfare \nprograms is how can we--public policy makers, government officials, \nwelfare agencies--honestly expect to improve child welfare without \nappropriately and adequately addressing the root problems affecting \nthese children's lives?\n  We know that substance abuse is the primary ingredient in child abuse \nand neglect. Most studies find that between one-third and two-thirds--\nand some say as high as 80 percent to 90 percent--of children in the \nchild welfare system come from families where parental substance abuse \nis a contributing factor.\n  The Child Protection/Alcohol and Drug Partnership Act of 2000 creates \na new five-year $1.9 billion state block grant program to address the \nconnection between substance abuse and child welfare. Payments would be \nmade to promote joint activities among federal, state, and local public \nchild welfare and alcohol and drug prevention and treatment agencies. \nOur underlying belief, and the point of this bill, is to encourage \nexisting agencies to work together to keep children safe.\n  HHS will award grants to States and Indian tribes to encourage \nprograms for families who are known to the child welfare system and \nhave alcohol and drug abuse problems. These grants will forge new and \nnecessary partnerships between the child protection agencies and the \nalcohol and drug prevention and treatment agencies in States so they \nwill work together to provide services for this unique population. The \nprogram is designed to increase the capacity of both the child welfare \nand alcohol and drug systems to comprehensively address the needs of \nthese families to improve child safety, family stability, and \npermanence, and to promote recovery from alcohol and drug problems.\n  Statistics paint an unhappy picture for children of substance abusing \nparents: a 1998 report by the National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse \nfound that 36 states reported that parental substance abuse and poverty \nare the top two problems exhibited by families reported for child \nmaltreatment. And a 1997 survey conducted by the Child Welfare League \nof America found that at least 52 percent of placements into out-of-\nhome care were due in part to parental substance abuse.\n  Children whose parents abuse alcohol and other drugs are almost three \ntimes likelier to be abused and more than four times likelier to be \nneglected than children of parents who are not substance abusers. \nChildren in alcohol-abusing families were nearly four times more likely \nto be maltreated overall, almost five times more likely to be \nphysically neglected, and 10 times more likely to be emotionally \nneglected than children in families without alcohol problems.\n  A 1994 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found \nthat children prenatally exposed to substances have been found to be \ntwo to three times more likely to be abused than non-exposed children. \nAnd as many as 80 percent of prenatally drug exposed infants will come \nto the attention of child welfare before their first\n\n[[Page S2746]]\n\nbirthday. Abused and neglected children under age six face the risk of \nmore severe damage than older children because their brains and \nneurological systems are still developing.\n  Unfortunately, child welfare agencies estimate that only a third of \nthe 67 percent of the parents who need drug or alcohol prevention and \ntreatment services actually get help today.\n  Mr. President, this bill is about preventing problems. Senators \nRockefeller, DeWine, Dodd, and I know that what is most important here \nis the safety and well-being of America's children. We expect much of \nour youth because they are the future of our nation. In turn, we must \nbe willing to give them the support they need to learn and grow, so \nthat they can lead healthy and productive lives.\n  In 1997 Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act, authored \nby the late Senator John Chafee. The 1997 Adoption law promotes safety, \nstability, and permanence for all abused and neglected children and \nrequires timely decision-making in all proceedings to determine whether \nchildren can safely return home, or whether they should be moved to \npermanent, adoptive homes. Specifically, the law requires a State to \nensure that services are provided to the families of children who are \nat risk, so that children can remain safely with their families or \nreturn home after being in foster care.\n  The bill we are introducing today identifies a very specific area in \nwhich families and children need services--substance abuse. And it will \nensure that states have the funding necessary to provide services as \nrequired under the Adoption and Safe Families Act.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a serious look at our bill, to \nthink seriously about the future for kids in their states, and to work \nwith us in passing this very important piece of legislation. I ask \nunanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2435\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am here to talk about our \nNation's most vulnerable children--those innocent kids who are in the \nchild protection system because they have been abused or neglected by \nparents, many of whom have drug or alcohol problems. Over 500,000 \nchildren are in foster care nationwide and 3,000 children are in West \nVirginia. Each one deserves a safe, permanent home according to the \nfundamental guidelines set by the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act.\n  National statistics range between 40 percent and 80 percent of \nfamilies in the child welfare system struggling with alcohol or drug \nabuse, or both. One recent survey noted that 67 percent of the parents \ninvolved in child abuse or neglect cases needed alcohol or drug \ntreatment, but only one-third of those parents got the appropriate \ntreatment or services to deal with their addiction. In my own state of \nWest Virginia, over half of the children placed in foster care have \nfamilies with alcohol or drug abuse problems, and we know even more \nchildren are at risk of neglect, but are not in foster care yet because \nof their parent's substance abuse problems.\n  Another sad, stunning statistic is that children with open child \nwelfare cases whose parents have substance abuse problems are younger \nthan other children in foster care, and they are more likely to be the \nvictims of severe and chronic neglect. Once such children are placed in \nfoster care, they tend to stay in care longer than other children.\n  I believe the only way to achieve the critical goals of a safe, \nhealthy, and permanent home for every child is to tackle the problem of \nalcohol and drug abuse among parents. What happens to parents who abuse \nalcohol or drugs ultimately will decide that child's fate. To help the \nchild, we must address the addiction of their parents.\n  The issue of alcohol and drug abuse is difficult. Part of the 1997 \nAdoption and Safe Families Act required the Department of Health and \nHuman Services (HHS) to study this problem within the child welfare \nsystem. This important report, Blending Perspectives and Building \nCommon Ground, outlines our challenges. There is a lack of appropriate \ntreatment and services, especially services designed to meet the needs \nof parents in the child protection system. Unfortunately, there is poor \ncommunication and collaboration between alcohol and drug abuse agencies \nand child protection agencies. Issues such as confidentiality, \ndifferent definitions of who ``the client'' is, and different time \nframes for decisions make collaboration harder. For example, under the \n1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act, state agencies and courts are \nexpected to consider termination of parental rights if a child has been \nin foster care for 15 of 22 months. Treatment programs designed for \nsingle clients have different time frames.\n  To address the challenge, we must find new ways to encourage these \ntwo independent systems to work together on behalf of parents with an \nalcohol or drug problem and their children. In addition to treating the \npatient's addiction, we must also provide for the needs of their child.\n\n  Therefore, we need to create incentives for both agencies to consider \nthe total picture--What are the child's needs? What are the parent's \nneeds? How can we effectively serve both, and meet the fundamental \ngoals of the Adoption Law that every child deserves a safe, healthy, \npermanent home.\n  The HHS report sets five priorities. First, it calls for building \ncollaborative working relationships among agencies. It stresses that \naddiction is a treatable disease, but access to timely, comprehensive \nsubstance abuse treatment services is key. Keeping clients in treatment \nis crucial, but serving parents is harder because services must also be \navailable to their children. As mentioned, children of abusing parents \nneed special services. The final priority\n\n[[Page S2750]]\n\nin the HHS study is for research and more information on the \ninteraction between substance abuse and child maltreatment.\n  Today, I am proud to join with my colleagues, Senator Snowe, DeWine, \nand Dodd to introduce legislation to address this troubling issue. We \nhave worked for months with state officials, child advocates and \nofficials in the substance abuse community to develop the Child \nProtection/Alcohol and Drug Partnership Act of 2000. This bill builds \non the foundation of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997--\nfundamental goals of making a child's safety, health, and permanency \nparamount.\n  To accomplish these bold goals, we need to be bold by investing in \npartnerships that will respond to the needs and priorities outlined in \nthe comprehensive HHS study. I believe a new program and a new approach \nare essential. A new system is needed to address the special concerns \nof this unique population--parents with alcohol and drug problems who \nneglect their children. A program designed to serve a single male with \ndrug problems doesn't respond to the needs of a mother and her child.\n  To be effective, we must link child protection workers with those \ninvolved in alcohol and drug treatment programs. Forging new \npartnerships takes time--and it takes money. That is why our \nlegislation invests $1.9 billion over 5 years to combat the problems of \ndrugs and alcohol abuse in families in the child welfare system.\n  I understand this is a large sum, but alcohol and drug abuse is a \nhuge problem. Before reacting to the cost of the bill, consider what \nthe costs are if we do nothing.\n  If we do not invest in alcohol and drug abuse prevention and \ntreatment for such families, children will be neglected or abused. \nYoung children will be placed in foster care, at a wide range of costs, \nand they will linger there longer than other children without family \nsubstance abuse problems.\n  In 1997, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee received testimony \nfrom Professor Richard Barth who noted that many newborns in substance \nabuse cases already had siblings placed in foster care. Barth estimated \nthat if only one-third of the mothers with substance abuse problems got \nsuccessful, early treatment upon the birth of their first child, \ninstead of waiting until later, many years of foster care placements \ncould be prevented and millions of dollars could be saved.\n\n  Our bill is designed to tackle this tough issue so agencies do not \nwait too long to help vulnerable children. Our bill will promote \ninnovative approaches that serve both parents and children. It will \noffer funding for screening and assessment to enhance prevention. It \nwill support outreach to families and retention so that parents stay in \ntreatment. It can support joint training, and educate alcohol and drug \ncounselors about the special needs of children and the importance of a \nsafe, permanent home. It can support out-patient services or \nresidential treatment. It allows investments in after-care to keep \nfamilies and children safe.\n  If we do invest in such specialized alcohol and drug treatment \nprograms for families, we can achieve two things. For many families, I \nhope, treatment will be successful and children will return to a safe \nand stable home. But for others, we will have tried, and learned the \nimportant lesson that some children need an alternate place--some \nchildren need adoption. Under the Adoption and Safe Families Act, \ncourts cannot move forward on adoption until appropriate services have \nbeen provided to families. That is the law, and we must follow it. \nTherefore, to move some children towards adoption, services must be \ntried for their families.\n  We want a responsible approach that will include accountability. It \nrequires annual reports to assess how much progress is made each and \nevery year. Reports should measure success in treating parents, but \nequally important will be measures of children's safety and family \nstability.\n  Over the years, we have worked on child welfare issues in a positive, \nbipartisan manner. I am proud to continue the bipartisan approach as we \ngrapple with such tough controversial issues as alcohol and drug abuse \namong parents in the child welfare system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a fact sheet and section-\nby-section analysis of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Section-by-Section--Child Protection/Alcohol and Drug Partnership Act \n                                of 2000\n\n   (A bill to amend part B of title IV of the Social Security Act to \n   create a grant program to promote joint activities among Federal, \n   State, and local public child welfare and alcohol and drug abuse \n                   prevention and treatment agencies)\n\n\n  grants to promote child protection/alcohol and drug partnership for \n                                children\n\n       In an effort to improve child safety, family stability, and \n     permanence, as well as promote recovery from alcohol and drug \n     abuse problems, the Secretary may award grants to eligible \n     States and Indian tribes to foster programs for families who \n     are known to the child welfare system to have alcohol and \n     drug abuse problems. The Secretary shall notify States and \n     Indian tribes of approval or denial not later than 60 days \n     after submission.\n\n\n                        state plan requirements\n\n       In order to meet the prevention and treatment needs of \n     families with alcohol and drug abuse problems in the child \n     welfare system and to promote child safety, permanence, and \n     family stability, State agencies will jointly work together, \n     creating a plan to identify the extent of the drug and \n     alcohol abuse problem.\n       Creation of plan.--State agencies will provide data on \n     appropriate screening and assessment of cases, consultation \n     on cases involving alcohol and drug abuse, arrangements for \n     addressing confidentiality and sharing of information, cross \n     training of staff, co-location of services, support for \n     comprehensive treatment for parents and their children, and \n     priority of child welfare families for assessment or \n     treatment.\n       Identify activities.--A description of the activities and \n     goals to be implemented under the five-year funding cycle \n     should be identified, such as: identify and assess alcohol \n     and drug treatment needs, identify risks to children's safety \n     and the need for permanency, enroll families in appropriate \n     services and treatment in their communities, and regularly \n     assess the progress of families receiving such treatment.\n       Implement prevention and treatment services.--States and \n     Indian tribes should implement individualized alcohol and \n     drug abuse prevention and treatment services that are \n     available, accessible, and appropriate that include the \n     following components:\n       (A) Preventive and early intervention services for the \n     children of families with alcohol and drug abuse problems \n     that integrate alcohol and drug abuse prevention services \n     with mental health and domestic violence services, as well as \n     recognizing the mental, emotional, and developmental problems \n     the children may experience.\n       (B) Prevention and early intervention services for parents \n     at risk for alcohol and drug abuse problems.\n       (C) Comprehensive home-based, our-patient and residential \n     treatment options.\n       (D) Formal and informal after-care support for families in \n     recovery.\n       (E) Services and programs that promote parent-child \n     interaction.\n       Sharing information among agencies.--Agencies should \n     eliminate existing barriers to treatment and to child safety \n     and permanence by sharing information among agencies and \n     learning from the various treatment protocols of other \n     agencies such as:\n       (A) Creating effective engagement and retention strategies.\n       (B) Encouraging joint training of child welfare staff and \n     alcohol and drug abuse prevention agencies, and judges and \n     court staff to increase awareness and understanding of drug \n     abuse and related child abuse and neglect and more accurately \n     identify abuse in families, increase staff knowledge of the \n     services and resources that are available in the communities, \n     and increase awareness of permanence for children and the \n     urgency for time lines in making these decisions.\n       (C) Improving data systems to monitor the progress of \n     families, evaluate service and treatment outcomes, and \n     determine which approaches are most effective.\n       (D) Evaluation strategies to identify the effectiveness of \n     treatment that has the greatest impact on families in \n     different circumstances.\n       (E) Training and technical assistance to increase the \n     State's capacity to perform the above activities.\n       Plan descriptions and assurances.--States and Indian tribes \n     should create a plan that includes the following descriptions \n     and assurances:\n       (A) A description of the jurisdictions in the State whether \n     urban, suburban, or rural, and the State's plan to expand \n

jointly \n     conduct an evaluation of the results of the activities.\n       (C) A description of the input obtained from staff of State \n     agencies, advocates, consumers of prevention and treatment \n     services, line staff from public and private child welfare \n     and drug abuse agencies, judges and court staff, \n     representatives of health, mental health, domestic violence, \n     housing and employment services, as well as a representative \n     of the State agency in charge of administering the temporary \n     assistance to needy families program (TANF).\n\n[[Page S2751]]\n\n       (D) An assurance of coordination with other services \n     provided under other Federal or federally assisted programs \n     including health, mental health, domestic violence, housing, \n     employment programs, TANF, and other child welfare and \n     alcohol and drug abuse programs and the courts.\n       (E) An assurance that not more than 10% of expenditures \n     under the State plan for any fiscal year shall be for \n     administrative costs. However, Indian tribes will be exempt \n     from this limitation and instead may use the indirect cost \n     rate agreement in effect for the tribe.\n       (F) An assurance from States that Federal funds provided \n     will not be used to supplant Federal or non-Federal funds for \n     services and activities provided as of the date of the \n     submission of the plan. However, Indian tribes will be exempt \n     from this provision.\n       Amendments.--A State or Indian tribe may amend its plan, in \n     whole or in part at any time through a plan amendment. The \n     amendment should be submitted to the Secretary not later than \n     30 days after the date of any changes of activities. Approval \n     from the Secretary shall be presumed unless, the State has \n     been notified of disapproval within 60 days after receipt.\n       Special Application to Indian tribes.--The Indian tribe \n     must submit a plan to the Secretary that describes the \n     activities it will undertake with both the child welfare and \n     alcohol and drug agencies that serve its children to address \n     the needs of families who come to the attention of the child \n     welfare agency who have alcohol and drug problems. The Indian \n     tribe must also meet other applicable requirements, unless \n     the Secretary determines that it would be inappropriate based \n     on the tribe's resources, needs, and other circumstances.\n\n\n                         appropriation of funds\n\n       Appropriations.--A total of 1.9 billion dollars will be \n     appropriated to eligible States and Indian tribes at the \n     progression rate of:\n       (1) for fiscal year 2001, $200,000,000;\n       (2) for fiscal year 2002, $275,000,000;\n       (3) for fiscal year 2003, $375,000,000;\n       (4) for fiscal year 2004, $475,000,000; and\n       (5) for fiscal year 2005, $575,000,000.\n       Territories.--The Secretary of HHS shall reserve 2% of the \n     amount appropriated each fiscal year for payments to Puerto \n     Rico, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa, \n     and the Northern Mariana Islands. In addition, the Secretary \n     shall reserve from 3 to 5 percent of the amount appropriated \n     for direct payment to Indian tribes.\n       Research and Training.--The Secretary shall reserve 1% of \n     the appropriated amount for each fiscal year for practice-\n     based research on the effectiveness of various approaches for \n     screening, assessment, engagement, treatment, retention, and \n     monitoring of families and training of staff in such areas. \n     In addition, the Secretary will also ensure that a portion of \n     these funds are used for research on the effectiveness of \n     these approaches for Indian children and the training of \n     staff.\n       Determination of use of funds.--Funds may only be used to \n     carry out a specific research agenda established by the \n     Secretary, together with the Assistant Secretary of the \n     Administration for Children and Families and the \n     Administrator of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration with input from public and private nonprofit \n     providers, consumers, representatives of the Indian tribes \n     and advocates.\n\n\n                           payments to states\n\n       Amount of grant to State and territories.--Each eligible \n     State will receive an amount based on the number of children \n     under the age of 18 that reside in that State. There will be \n     a small state minimum of .05% to ensure that all States are \n     eligible for sufficient funding to establish a program.\n       Amount of grant to Indian tribes or tribal organizations.--\n     Indian tribes shall be eligible for a set aside of 3% to 5%. \n     This amount will be distributed based on the population of \n     children under 18 in the tribe.\n       State matching requirement.--States shall provide, through \n     non-Federal contributions, the following applicable \n     percentages for a given fiscal year:\n       (A) for fiscal years 2001 and 2002, 15% match;\n       (B) for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, 20% match; and\n       (C) for fiscal year 2005, 25% match.\n       Source of match.--The non-Federal contributions required of \n     States may be in cash or in-kind, including plant equipment \n     or services made directly from donations from public or \n     private entities. Amounts received from the Federal \n     Government may not be included in the applicable percentage \n     of contributions for a given fiscal year. However, Indian \n     tribes may use three Federal sources of matching funds: \n     Indian Child Welfare Act funds, Indian Self-Determination and \n     Education Assistance Act funds, and Community Block Grant \n     funds.\n       Waiver.--The Secretary may modify matching funds if it is \n     determined that extraordinary economic conditions in the \n     State justify the waiver. Indians tribes' matching funds may \n     also be modified if the Secretary determines that it would be \n     inappropriate based on the resources and needs of the tribe.\n       Use of Funds and Deadline for Request of Payment.--Funds \n     may only be used to carry out activities specified in the \n     plan, as approved by the Secretary. Each State or Indian \n     tribe shall apply to be paid funds not later than the \n     beginning of the fourth quarter of a fiscal year or they will \n     be reallotted.\n       Carryover and Reallotment of funds.--Funds paid to an \n     eligible State or Indian tribe may be used in that fiscal \n     year or the succeeding fiscal year. If a State does not apply \n     for funds allotted within the time provided, the funds will \n     be reallocated to one or more eligible States on the basis \n     of the needs of that individual state. In the cases of \n     Indian tribes, funds will be reallotted to remaining \n     tribes that are implementing approved plans.\n\n\n                        performance measurement\n\n       Establishment of Indicators.--The Secretary, in \n     consultation with the Assistant Secretary for the \n     Administration for Children and Families, the Administrator \n     of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration within HHS, and with state and local \n     government, public officials responsible for administering \n     child welfare and alcohol and drug abuse prevention and \n     treatment programs, court staff, consumers of the services, \n     and advocates for these children and parents will establish \n     indicators within 12 months of the enactment of this law \n     which will be used to assess the performance of States and \n     Indian tribes. A State or Indian tribe will be measured \n     against itself, assessing progress over time against a \n     baseline established at the time the grant activities were \n     undertaken.\n       Illustrative Examples.--Indicators of activities to be \n     measured include:\n       (A) Improve screening and assessment of families;\n       (B) Increase availability of comprehensive individualized \n     treatment;\n       (C) Increase the number/proportion of families who enter \n     treatment promptly;\n       (D) Increase engagement and retention;\n       (E) Decrease the number of children who re-enter foster \n     care after being returned to families who had alcohol or drug \n     problems;\n       (F) Increase number/proportion of staff trained; and\n       (G) Increase the proportion of parents who complete \n     treatment and show improvement in their employment status.\n       Reports.--The child welfare and alcohol and drug abuse and \n     treatment agencies in each eligible state, and the Indian \n     tribes that receive funds shall submit no later than the end \n     of the first fiscal year, a report to the Secretary \n     describing activities carried out, and any changes in the use \n     of the funds planned for the succeeding fiscal year. After \n     the first report is submitted, a State or Indian tribe must \n     submit to the Secretary annually, by the end of the third \n     quarter in the fiscal year, a report on the application of \n     the indicators to its activities, an explanation of why these \n     indicators were chosen, and the results of the evaluation to \n     date. After the third year of the grant all of the States \n     must include indicators that address improvements in \n     treatment. A final report on evaluation and the progress made \n     must be submitted to the Secretary not later than the end of \n     each five year funding cycle of the grant.\n       Penalty.--States or Indian tribes that fail to report on \n     the indicators will not be eligible for grant funds for the \n     fiscal year following the one in which it failed to report, \n     unless a plan for improving their ability to monitor and \n     evaluate their activities is submitted to the Secretary and \n     then approved in a timely manner.\n       Secretarial reports and evaluations.--Beginning October 1, \n     2002, the Secretary, in consultation with the Assistant \n     Secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, \n     and the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental \n     Health Services Administration, shall report annually, to the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the House of the \n     Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate on \n     the joint activities, indicators, and progress made with \n     families.\n       Evaluations.--Not later than six months after the end of \n     each 5 year funding cycle, the Secretary shall submit a \n     report to the above committees, the results of the \n     evaluations as well as recommendations for further \n     legislative actions.\n\n                               Fact Sheet\n\n       The Child Protection/Alcohol and Drug Partnership Act of \n     2000 is a bill to create a grant program to promote joint \n     activities among Federal, State, and local public child \n     welfare and alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment \n     agencies to improve child safety, family stability, and \n     permanence for children in families with drug and alcohol \n     problems, as well as promote recovery from drug and alcohol \n     problems.\n       Child welfare agencies estimate that only a third of the \n     67% of the parents who need drug or alcohol prevention and \n     treatment services actually get help today. This bill builds \n     on the foundation of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of \n     1997 which requires States to focus on a child's need for \n     safety, health and permanence. The bill creates new funding \n     for alcohol and drug treatment and other activities that will \n     serve the special needs of these families to either provide \n     treatment for parents with alcohol and drug abuse problems so \n     that a child can safely return to their family or to promote \n     timely decisions and fulfill the requirement of the 1997 \n     Adoption Act to provide services prior to adoption.\n\n\n    grants to promote child protection/alcohol and drug partnerships\n\n       In an effort to improve child safety, family stability, and \n     permanence as well as promote recovery from alcohol and drug \n     abuse problems, HHS will award grants to States and\n\n[[Page S2752]]\n\n     Indian tribes to encourage programs for families who are \n     known to the child welfare system and have alcohol and drug \n     abuse problems. Such grants will forge new and necessary \n     partnerships between the child protection agencies and the \n     alcohol and drug prevention and treatment agencies in States \n     so they can together provide necessary services for this \n     unique population.\n       These grants will help build new partnerships to provide \n     alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment services that \n     are timely, available, accessible, and appropriate and \n     include the following components:\n       (A) Preventive and early intervention services for the \n     children of families with alcohol and drug problems that \n     combine alcohol and drug prevention services with mental \n     health and domestic violence services, and recognize the \n     mental, emotional, and developmental problems the children \n     may experience.\n       (B) Prevention and early intervention services for families \n     at risk of alcohol and drug problems.\n       (C) Comprehensive home-based, out-patient and residential \n     treatment options.\n       (D) Formal and informal after-care support for families in \n     recovery that promote child safety and family stability.\n       (E) Services and supports that promote positive parent-\n     child interaction.\n\n\n                        forging new partnerships\n\n       GAO and HHS studies indicate that the existing programs for \n     alcohol and drug treatment do not effectively service \n     families in the child protection system. Therefore, this new \n     grant program will help eliminate barriers to treatment and \n     to child safety and permanence by encouraging agencies build \n     partnerships and conduct joint activities including:\n       (A) Promote appropriate screening and assessment of alcohol \n     and drug problems.\n       (B) Create effective engagement and retention strategies \n     that get families into timely treatment.\n       (C) Encourage joint training for staff of child welfare and \n     alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment agencies, and \n     judges and other court personnel to increase understanding of \n     alcohol and drug problems related to child abuse and neglect \n     and to more accurately identify alcohol and drug abuse in \n     families. Such training increases staff knowledge of the \n     appropriate resources that are available in the communities, \n     and increases awareness of the importance of permanence for \n     children and the urgency for expedited time lines in making \n     these decisions.\n       (D) Improve data systems to monitor the progress of \n     families, evaluate service and treatment outcomes, and \n     determine which approaches are most effective.\n       (E) Evaluate strategies to identify the effectiveness of \n     treatment and those parts of the treatment that have the \n     greatest impact on families in different circumstances.\n\n\n                       new, targeted investments\n\n       A total of $1.9 billion will be available to eligible \n     States with funding of $200 million in the first year \n     expanding to $575 million by the last year. The amount of \n     funding will be based on the State's number of children under \n     18, with a small State minimum to ensure that every State \n     gets a fair share. Indian tribes will have a 3%-5% set aside. \n     State child welfare and alcohol and drug agencies shall have \n     a modest matching requirement for funding beginning with a \n     15% match and gradually increasing to 25%. The Secretary has \n     discretion to waive the State match in cases of hardship.\n\n\n               accountability and performance measurement\n\n       To ensure accountability, HHS and the related State \n     agencies must establish indicators within 12 months of the \n     enactment of this law which will be used to assess the \n     State's progress under this program. Annual reports by the \n     States must be submitted to HHS. Any state hat fails to \n     submit its report will lose its funding for the next year, \n     until it comes into compliance. HHS must issue an annual \n     report to Congress on the progress of the Child Protection/\n     Alcohol and Drug Partnership grants.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM:\n  S. 2436. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe targeted area limitation on the expense deduction for environmental \nremediation costs and to extend the termination date of such deduction; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  brownfield cleanup cost recovery act\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nBrownfield Cleanup Cost Recovery Act. This legislation would repeal the \ntargeted area limitation on the expense deduction for environmental \nremediation costs and extend the termination date of such deduction to \n2004.\n  Mr. President, the Environmental Protection Agency's brownfields \nprogram is designed to help communities restore less seriously \ncontaminated sites that have the potential for economic development. \nBrownfields are defined as abandoned, idled, or under-used industrial \nand commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is \ncomplicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.\n  In general, costs incurred for new buildings or for permanent \nimprovements to increase the value of a property must be capitalized--\nthe cost must be deducted over a period of years. Some expenses, such \nas repairs, are currently deductible--deductible in the year in which \nthe cost is incurred. This is also called expensing. It is a \nconsiderable financial advantage to be able to fully deduct an expense \nin one year rather than over many. The brownfields tax provision would \ninclude environmental remediation costs as allowable costs for \nexpensing. This would create the financial incentive needed to bring \ncompanies in to remediate brownfields.\n  Prior to the passage of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the tax code \ndiscouraged the remediation of environmentally damaged property. In \n1996, I introduced legislation to eliminate this bias. This legislation \nultimately was included as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, \nwhich is now law. However, the incentive expires at the end of this \nyear. As part of the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999, Congress \npassed provisions expanding upon this important community development \nlegislation. This bill contains the same provisions that were included \nin the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999, which Congress passed, \nbut President Clinton vetoed.\n  In addition, Mr. President, current law limits expensing of \nbrownfield sites to those sites within ``targeted'' areas--defined as \nbeing a renewal community under section 198. This bill would eliminate \nthe ``targeted area'' limitation, allowing for increased remediation in \nall areas, not just federal designated zones.\n  Mr. President, encouraging community renewal has long been a very \nimportant issue to me. In 1995, my first year as a Senator, I joined \nwith Senators Lieberman, Santorum, DeWine and Moseley-Braun, to \nintroduce the Enhanced Enterprise Zones Act, to stimulate job creation \nand residential growth in America's most distressed rural and urban \ncommunities. More recently, Senator Lieberman and I introduced the \nAmerican Community Renewal Act. The ACRA would provide benefits to 100 \ndistressed communities around the country, including tax benefits \ndesigned to attract businesses and employers to Renewal Zones. It is my \nhope that this bill will become law this year.\n  In my opinion, Mr. President, brownfield remediation is a crucial \ncomponent of any policy for community renewal if that policy is to be \nsuccessful. The provisions provided in this legislation will make such \nremediation more likely and more common. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to give it their strong support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 2437.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2437\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DEFINITION OF SECRETARY.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n     the Army.\n\n     SEC. 3. COMPREHENSIVE EVERGLADES RESTORATION PLAN.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section, the following \n     definitions apply:\n       (1) Central and southern florida project.--The term \n     ``Central and Southern Florida Project'' means the project \n     for Central and Southern Florida authorized under the heading \n     ``Central and southern florida'' in section 203 of the Flood \n     Control Act of 1948 (62 Stat. 1176), any modification to the \n     project authorized by law, or modified by the Comprehensive \n     Everglades Restoration Plan.\n       (2) South florida ecosystem.--The term ``South Florida \n     ecosystem'' means the area consisting of the lands and waters \n     within the boundary, existing on July 1, 1999, of the South \n     Florida Water Management District, including the Everglades \n     ecosystem, the Florida Keys, Biscayne Bay, Florida Bay, and \n     other contiguous near-shore coastal waters of South Florida.\n       (3) Comprehensive everglades restoration plan.--The term \n     ``Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan'' means the plan \n     contained in the ``Final Feasibility Report and Programmatic \n     Environmental Impact Statement,'' April 1999, as transmitted \n     to the Congress by the July 1, 1999, letter of the Assistant \n     Secretary of the Army for Civil Works pursuant to Section 528 \n     of the Water Resources Development Act of 1996 (110 Stat. \n     3767).\n       (4) Natural system.--The term ``natural system'' means all \n     Federally or state managed lands and waters within the South \n     Florida ecosystem, including the water conservation areas, \n     Everglades National Park, Big Cypress National Preserve, and \n     other federally or state designated conservation lands, and \n     other lands that create or contribute to habitat supporting \n     native flora and fauna.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1) The Everglades is an American treasure. In its natural \n     state, the South Florida ecosystem was connected by the flow \n     of fresh water from the Kissimmee River to Lake Okeechobee--\n     south through vast freshwater marshes known as the \n     Everglades--to Florida Bay, and on to the coral reefs of the \n     Florida Keys. The South Florida ecosystem covers \n     approximately 18,000 square miles and once included a unique \n     and biologically productive region, supporting vast colonies \n     of wading birds, a mixture of temperate and tropical plant \n     and animal species, and teeming coastal fisheries and North \n     America's only barrier coral reef. The South Florida \n     ecosystem is endangered as a result of adverse changes in the \n     quantity, distribution, and timing of flows and degradation \n     of water quality. The Everglades alone has been reduced \n     in size by approximately 50 percent. Restoration of this \n     nationally and internationally recognized ecosystem, \n     including America's Everglades, is in the Nation's \n     interest.\n       (2) The Central and Southern Florida Project plays an \n     important role in the economy of south Florida by providing \n     flood protection and water supply to agriculture and the \n     residents of south Florida and providing water to the water \n     conservation areas, Everglades National Park and other \n     natural areas for the purpose of preserving fish and wildlife \n     resources. The population of the region is expected to \n     continue to grow, further straining the ability of the \n     existing Central and Southern Florida Project to meet the \n     needs of the natural system and the people of south Florida.\n       (3) Modifications to the Central and Southern Florida \n     Project are needed to restore, preserve, and protect the \n     South Florida ecosystem, including the Everglades, while \n     continuing to provide for the water related needs of the \n     region, including flood protection and other objectives \n     served by the Project.\n       (4) The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is a \n     scientifically and economically sound plan that modifies the \n     Central and Southern Florida Project to restore, preserve and \n     protect the South Florida ecosystem. By storing most of the \n     water currently discharged to the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of \n     Mexico, ensuring the quality of water discharged into the \n     South Florida ecosystem from project features, and removing \n     internal levees and canals in the Everglades, the \n     Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan provides the \n     roadmap for the recovery of a healthy, sustainable ecosystem \n     as well as providing for the other water-related needs of the \n     region, including flood protection, the enhancement of water \n     supplies, and other objectives served by the Central and \n     Southern Florida Project.\n       (5) The comprehensive, system-wide nature of the \n     Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and the linkage of \n     the elements of the plan to each other must be preserved not \n     only during the over 25-year period that will be necessary \n     for its implementation, but for as long as the project \n     remains authorized. Implementation must proceed in a \n     programmatic manner using the principles of adaptive \n     assessment as outlined in the Comprehensive Everglades \n     Restoration Plan.\n       (6) The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan contains \n     a number of components that will benefit Everglades National \n     Park, Biscayne National Park, Florida Keys National Marine \n     Sanctuary, Big Cypress National Preserve, Ten Thousand \n     Islands National Wildlife Refuge, and Loxahatchee National \n     Wildlife Refuge by significantly improving the quantity, \n     quality, timing, and distribution of waste delivered to these \n     Federal areas. Improved water deliveries will also provide \n     benefits to federally-listed threatened and endangered \n     species.\n       (7) The Congress, the Federal government, and the State of \n     Florida have, in prior legislation, recognized the need to \n     restore, preserve, and protect the South Florida ecosystem, \n     These on-going efforts are important to the success of the \n     Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Since the creation \n     of the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force in \n     1993, the Federal government has been working in partnership \n     with tribal, state, and local governments, the private \n     sector, and individual citizens to accomplish restoration of \n     the South Florida ecosystem. It is important for the long-\n     term restoration of this ecosystem that these efforts, \n     including the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, \n     be continued and strengthened. The state, with its financial \n     responsibilities for project implementation and capabilities \n     in the planning, design, construction, and operation of the \n     Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, must be a full \n     partner with the Federal government.\n       (c) Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.--\n       (1) In general.--Congress hereby approves the Comprehensive \n     Everglades Restoration Plan to modify the Central and \n     Southern Florida Project to restore, preserve, and protect \n     the South Florida ecosystem. These changes are necessary in \n     order to ensure that the Central and Southern Florida Project \n     as amended provides for the improvement and protection of \n     water quality in, and the reduction of the loss of fresh \n     water from, the South Florida ecosystem, as well as providing \n     for the water related needs of the region, including flood \n     protection, the enhancement of water supplies, and other \n     objectives served by the Central and Southern Florida \n     Project.\n       (2) Specific authorizations.--\n       (A) In general.--Those projects included in the \n     Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and specified in \n     paragraphs (B) and (C) are authorized to be carried out by \n     the Secretary substantially in accordance with the plans, and \n     subject to the conditions described in the Central and \n     Southern Florida Project: Comprehensive Review Study Report \n     of the Chief of Engineers dated June 22, 1999.\n       (B) Pilot projects.--The following pilot projects are \n     authorized for implementation, after review and approval by \n     the Secretary, at a total cost of $69,000,000, with an \n     estimated Federal cost of $34,500,000 and an estimated non-\n     Federal cost of $34,500,000:\n       (1) Caloosahatchee River (C-43) Basin ASR ($6,000,000);\n       (2) Lake Belt In-Ground Reservoir Technology ($23,000,000);\n       (3) L-31N Seepage Management (10,000,000); and,\n       (4) Wastewater Reuse Technology ($30,000,000).\n       (C) Other projects.--The following projects are authorized \n     at a total cost of $1,100,918,000, with an estimated Federal \n     cost of $550,459,000 and an estimated non-Federal cost of \n     $550,459,000. Prior to implementation of projects (1) through \n     (10), the Secretary shall review and approve a Project \n     Implementation Report prepared in accordance with subsection \n     (g).\n       (1) C-44 Basin Storage Reservoir ($112,562,000);\n       (2) Everglades Agricultural Area Storage Reservoirs--Phase \n     I ($233,408,000);\n       (3) Site 1 Impoundment ($38,535,000);\n       (4) Water Conservation Areas 3A/3B Levee Seepage Management \n     ($100,335,000);\n       (5) C-11 Impoundment and Stormwater Treatment Area \n     ($124,837,000);\n       (6) C-9 Impoundment and Stormwater Treatment Area \n     ($89,146,000);\n       (7) Taylor Creek/Nubbin Slough Storage and Treatment Area \n     ($104,027,000);\n       (8) Raise and Bridge East Portion of Tamiami Trail and Fill \n     Miami Canal within Water Conservation Area 3 ($26,946,000);\n       (9) North New River Improvements ($77,087,000);\n       (10) C-111 Spreader Canal ($94,035,000); and\n       (11) Adaptive Assessment and Monitoring Program (10 years) \n     ($100,000,000).\n       (d) Additional Program Authority.--In order to expedite \n     implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration \n     Plan, the Secretary is authorized to implement modifications \n     to the Central and Southern Florida Project that are \n     consistent with the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan \n     and that will produce independent and substantial \n     restoration, preservation, or protection benefits to the \n     South Florida ecosystem; provided that the total Federal \n     cost of each project accomplished under this authority \n     shall not exceed $35,000,000; and provided further that \n     the total Federal cost of all the projects accomplished \n     under this authority shall not exceed $250,000,000. Prior \n     to implementation of any project authorized under this \n     subsection, the Secretary shall review and approve a \n     Project Implementation\n\n[[Page S2754]]\n\n     Report prepared in accordance with subsection (g).\n       (e) Authorization of Future Project Features.--Except for \n     those projects authorized in subsections (c) and (d), all \n     future projects included in the Comprehensive Everglades \n     Restoration Plan shall require a specific authorization of \n     Congress. Prior to authorization, the Secretary shall \n     transmit such projects to Congress along with a Project \n     Implementation Report prepared in accordance with subsection \n     (g). Further, such projects, if authorized, shall be \n     implemented pursuant to subsection (i) of this section.\n       (f) Cost Sharing.--\n       (1) In general.--The non-Federal share of the cost of \n     implementing projects authorized under subsections (c), (d), \n     and (e) shall be 50 percent. The non-Federal sponsor shall be \n     responsible for all lands, easements, rights-of-way, and \n     relocations and shall be afforded credit toward the non-\n     Federal share in accordance with paragraph (3)(A).

A bill to provide for enhanced safety, public awareness, and \nenvironmental protection in pipeline transportation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n     the king and tsiorvas pipeline safety improvement act of 2000\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the King and \nTsiorvas Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000. This bill proposes to \nreauthorize the Pipeline Safety Act, which expires at the end of this \nfiscal year (FY), through fiscal year 2003. It is intended to \nstrengthen and improve both federal and state pipeline safety efforts \nand heighten public awareness of pipeline safety. I am pleased to be \njoined in sponsoring this bill by Senator Murray and Senator Gorton.\n  Many of these issues came to the forefront as a result of a tragic \naccident that occurred in Bellingham, Washington, last June 10, 1999. \nAn underground hazardous liquid pipeline ruptured and 277,000 gallons \nof gasoline leaked into a creek. Two 10-year-old boys, Wade King and \nStephen Tsiorvas, had been playing by the creek into which the gasoline \nflowed. The gasoline was accidently ignited and a massive fire ensued. \nBoth boys died as a result of their injuries. Another young man, Liam \nWood, was fishing at the creek the same day. He was overcome by the \ngasoline fumes, slipped into unconsciousness, and subsequently drowned.\n  Mr. President, in addition to these needless deaths, the pipeline \naccident caused destructive fires and environmental damage for miles. \nSince the June accident, many concerned individuals have come forward \nand dedicated themselves to finding ways to improve and strengthen the \nDepartment of Transportation pipeline safety program. The Senators from \nWashington State have introduced one bill. Other pipeline safety \nmeasures have been introduced in the House. Yesterday, the \nAdministration submitted its own pipeline safety reauthorization \nproposal. These bills contain many provisions I believe merit \nCongressional consideration and some of those provisions are included \nin the legislation I am introducing today.\n  It is my intention, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation, to chair a full Committee hearing on \nPipeline Safety in the near future. I hope to report a reauthorization \nmeasure to the full Senate before the Memorial Day Recess. In that \neffort, I will be seeking input from public safety advocates, the \nNational Transportation Safety Board, the DOT-Inspector General, the \nDepartment of Transportation, industry and others interested in \npromoting pipeline safety.\n  Mr. President, currently the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) within \nthe Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) oversees the \ntransportation of about 65 percent of the petroleum and most of the \nnatural gas transported in the United States. OPS regulates the day-to-\nday safety of 2,000 gas pipeline operators with more than 1.9 million \nmiles of pipeline, as well as more than 200 hazardous liquid operators \nand 165,000 miles of pipelines. Given the immense array of pipelines \nthat traverse our nation, reauthorization of the pipeline safety \nprogram is, quite simply, critical to public safety.\n\n[[Page S2758]]\n\n  The safety record of pipeline transportation is generally quite good. \nHowever, accidents do occur and when they occur, they can be \ndevastating, as was the case last June.\n  Last month, the Senate Commerce Committee held a field hearing on \nthis accident in Bellingham, Washington, and the Committee, as I \nmentioned, is committed to moving a reauthorization bill through the \nlegislative process as soon as possible. We must act to help improve \npipeline safety and prevent tragedies like that which occurred in \nBellingham.\n  The bill I am introducing includes a number of provisions intended to \nstrengthen and improve pipeline safety. It also is designed to increase \nState oversight authority and facilitate greater public information \nsharing at the local community level.\n  Two areas that warrant DOT's immediate attention, in my view, concern \nsafety recommendations that have already been issued by the National \nTransportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Inspector General (IG). The \nDepartment's responsiveness to NTSB pipeline safety recommendations for \nyears has been poor at best. While current law requires the Secretary \nto respond to NTSB recommendations within 90 days from receipt, there \nare no similar requirements at RSPA. The problem is serious, Mr. \nPresident. I am aware of one case in particular where a NTSB \nrecommendation sat at DOT's pipeline office for more than 900 days \nbefore even a letter so much as acknowledging receipt was sent. Such \nblatant disregard for the important work of the NTSB is intolerable. \nTherefore, this legislation statutorily requires RSPA and OPS to \nrespond to each pipeline safety recommendation it receives from the \nNTSB and to provide a detailed report on what action it plans to \ninitiate to adopt the recommendation.\n  In addition, the bill would require the Department to implement the \nrecommendations made last month by the IG to further improve pipeline \nsafety. The DOT IG found several glaring safety gaps at OPS and it is \nincumbent upon us all to do all we can to insure that the Department \naffirmatively acts on these critical problems.\n  The bill would also address the issue of training of pipeline \noperators. A number of safety interests, including the NTSB, have long \nemphasized the need to improve operator training. In recognition that a \none-size-fits-all approach on this issue is not feasible due to the far \ndifferent operating and maintenance requirements governing pipeline \noperations, this bill would require each operator to submit a training \nplan to the Secretary keyed to his or her particular operation. The \nSecretary would be expected to review the plans and work with operators \nto ensure a consistent safety level is maintained. The bill also \ndirects the Secretary to issue regulations to ensure periodic \ninspections of pipelines and provides authority to the Secretary to \nshut down operations which are determined to pose an imminent hazard.\n  Another critical component of this reauthorization bill focuses on \nincreased public education efforts, enhanced emergency response \npreparedness, and community right to know. It also includes provisions \nto increase state oversight of pipeline safety concerns. While some may \nprefer to reduce the federal role over pipeline safety and \nsubstantially increase the authority of State regulation, I believe \nsuch an approach would be short-sighted. While the concept of \npreemption by states may seem an attractive solution for some pipeline \nsafety concerns, it is not the best approach. After all, pipelines play \na vital role in both interstate and international commerce. A mishmash \nof state laws regarding the construction, maintenance, training, and \noperation of pipelines would certainly hamper commerce and would likely \nnot improve safety. In fact, accident records show that more than 70 \npercent of pipeline transportation injuries and fatalities have \noccurred on intrastate lines, pipelines under the direct responsibility \nof the States.\n\n  Recently, the U.S. Courts have upheld the need for consistent \nstandards in interstate and international commerce. However, in the \nCourts ruling, they did not restrict the right of the states to take \naction altogether. In fact, states already have considerable power to \nregulate pipelines and promote safety through the Federal/State \nPartnership program. Additionally, the states ability to promulgate \nlaws regarding ``one call'' can do more to prevent accidents than any \nother action. States already play an important role and my bill would \nbuild on that role and permit the states to join the Secretary in \nefforts to oversee interstate pipeline transportation and promote \nemergency preparedness and accident prevention.\n  The bill also addresses the need to improve data collection and \nanalysis. For more than 25 years, the NTSB has identified major \ndeficiencies and recommended changes to RSPA's pipeline accident data \ncollection process. This bill would ensure RSPA take the action \nnecessary to address these identified problems and improve its data \ncollection and use.\n  In addition, the bill calls attention to the critical role of \ninnovative technology in promoting safety. Specifically, the bill \ndirects the Secretary to focus the department's research and \ndevelopment programs to address technology that can detect pipe \nmaterial defects and alternative pipeline inspection and monitory \ntechnologies that cannot accommodate current technologies. Finally, the \nbill would increase funding to carry out pipeline safety and state \ngrant programs through fiscal year 2003.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues attention to this important \nsafety issue and look forward to bringing a reauthorization bill to the \nfull Senate for consideration in the near future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 2439. A bill to authorize the appropriation of funds for the \nconstruction of the Southeastern Alaska Intertie system, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  southeastern alaska intertie system\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill \nwith my colleague, Senator Ted Stevens, to provide a tremendously \nimportant authorization for an electrical intertie for an isolated \nregion of my State of Alaska. As many of my colleagues know, Alaska has \nmany unique problems. We are over twice the size of Texas, with fewer \nmiles of paved roads than the District of Columbia. Most of our \ncommunities are unconnected. The results of this are stark for those in \nunconnected communities, and have significant impacts on their lives. \nEnergy costs and reliance upon fossil fuels for power generation are \njust some of these impacts.\n  The vast majority of these towns and villages pay very high energy \ncosts. In some instances, these costs exceed 38 cents per kilowatt \nhour. This makes the cost of living almost unbearable for many local \nresidents. For example, the village of Kake, Alaska pays 38 cents per \nkilowatt hour and has 38 percent unemployment. Unlike in the rest of \nthe country, when unemployment strikes a particular unconnected \ncommunity in Alaska, the option to drive to employment in a neighboring \ncommunity does not exist. One either stays in a devastated community or \nsells one's home in a market of sellers under duress. With electrical \nrates running three times and above those in most of the U.S., few will \ninvest in these communities.\n  Mr. President, I refer Members to the latest study of economic \nsituation in Southeast Alaska. The report deals with the economic \nimpact of declining timber harvests in Southeast Alaska. This is not \nintended to restart the debate over that issue. That is for another \nforum. However, what the report vividly describes is the drastic  \ndecline in the economy of this region. In the last decade, known by \nmost of the country as the greatest boom in the century, Southeast \nAlaska has lost 2900 jobs and over $100 million in payroll. Many of \nthese communities have suffered losses in population. For example, the \nWrangell/Petersburg area has suffered a 13 percent loss in wage and \nsalary income; my hometown of Ketchikan suffered a similar 12 percent \nloss. Personal income is down from 5 to 11 percent in the region \ngenerally. The problem for Southeast Alaska is that it has no viable \noption for a replacement industry.\n\n  In other areas of the country, such as the Pacific Northwest, \nalternative employment such as high tech companies\n\n[[Page S2759]]\n\nin Oregon and Washington have replaced honorable livelihoods in \nresource-based industries. There has been no comparable replacement \nindustry for Southeast Alaska. There are a number of reasons, but the \nbiggest reason is lack of affordable power for most communities.\n  Mr. President, in the Pacific Northwest, power costs are reasonable \nand the Bonneville Power Administration has an efficient and modern \ndistribution system. In the lower 48 generally, every village and town \nis connected by power grid to the rest of the nation. That is not the \ncase in Southeast Alaska. This lack of connection exacerbates the \nsituation.\n  However, what can be done is to interconnect the region. By doing \nthis, the existing and potential clean energy sources can be maximized \nand the power can be managed between communities and other users. Right \nnow, one hydroelectric facility, Lake Tyee has tremendous excess \ncapacity to bring clean and cheaper energy to many villages. This has \nbeen proven in a study conducted by the Southeast Conference. The \nSoutheast Conference is the group of Mayors representing communities \nthroughout Southeast Alaska. This study, entitled the Southeast Alaska \nElectrical Intertie System Plan, outlines the regional grid which this \nbill authorizes.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear, this is only an authorization. The \nbill provides no obligation to the Federal government to be involved in \nthe construction of this intertie system whatsoever.\n  The bill also does not authorize nor does it contemplate that the \nfederal government will exercise any ownership or management \nresponsibility over this system. In fact, the Southeast communities \nwhich have asked me to introduce this bill seek to manage this project \nthemselves.\n  It simply provides an authorization for the Congress to assist the \ncommunities in assemblying funding for the project. There is ample \nprecedent for this. In fact, this very process was used successfully in \nArizona and Utah with the Central Arizona and Central Utah projects. \nThe era of the federal government constructing, owning and operating \nnew power generation facilities has passed. However, the federal \ngovernment can provide valuable assistance to a group of communities \nwhich seek to get their region back on the road to economic recovery. \nThis is a good bill because it encourages local self reliance.\n  Mr. President, an intertie can do so much to assist this region. \nRight now, we have a series of isolated communities which cannot even \nwork with each other on power issues. Each must provide its own \ngeneration and transmission facilities. And almost all of these \nfacilities use diesel oil-fired generation because that is the only \ntype of self-contained transmission facility which these communities \ncan afford. Instead with an intertie, these generators can be put in \nmothballs and used only for isolated emergency backup. The intertie \nwill provide reliable and clean sources of energy for all these \ncommunities.\n  I am informed by the communities that they intend to form a state \nchartered regional power authority to manage this Intertie. It will \nhave no federal budgetary obligation. Additionally, the intertie will \nhelp the environment by shifting these small villages from their diesel \ngeneration and pointing them towards clean, renewable fuel sources. All \nof these facilities will be subject to all federal, state, and local \nlaws including environmental laws. Just to make sure that this is \nclear, I have included a specific provision in the bill that reaffirms \nthat this simple authorization will not affect, change, or alter any \nobligations under federal laws such as the National Environmental \nPolicy Act (NEPA). All of the facilities will be subject to normal \npermitting.\n  There will undoubtedly be environmental studies required for the \ndifferent components. For example, part of phase 1 of the Intertie \nincludes the Swan Lake-Lake Tyee project which will connect my hometown \nof Ketchikan to its neighbors to the north, Wrangell and Petersburg. \nThe permits for this project are already in place and were issued by \nthe Forest Service as a result of a laborious 2 year NEPA study. The \nForest Service issued a full Environmental Impact Statement which \nresulted in a favorable record of decision. No corners were cut and the \nproject was approved by the Forest Service and permits issued. This \nbill will have no effect on that process. Any other phases will have to \nundergo close scrutiny, although I am convinced that connecting \ncommunities together using renewable hydropower will be much better \nenvironmentally than continued reliance on transporting, storing and \nburning high-priced diesel.\n  Mr. President, Alaska was not even a state when the major \ntransmission systems were built in this country in the 1930's, 1940's \nand 1950's. Until World War II compelled the heroic construction of the \nAlcan Highway. Alaska was not even connected by road to the rest of the \ncountry. Alaska was never even considered as a candidate for the \nconstruction of a transmission system. Alaska's economic development is \nin its infancy even today. A project like the Southeast Regional \nIntertie is necessary to give that region of Alaska the opportunity to \nrecover from the economic disaster outlined in the McDowell report. It \nis my intention to have this bill considered by my committee soon and I \nhope to report it favorably to the Senate floor in the near future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Gorton, Mr. \n        Inouye, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 2440. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to improve \nairport security; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                airport security improvement act of 2000\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Aviation \nSecurity Improvement Act of 2000. I would like to recognize the efforts \nof Commerce Committee Chairman McCain and Aviation Subcommittee \nChairman Gorton who have agreed to cosponsor this legislation. I am \nalso joined by Senators Inouye, Rockefeller, and Bryan in this effort \nto improve the security of the flying public.\n  Approximately 500 million passengers will pass through U.S. airports \nthis year. Protecting their safety in an incredible challenge to the \nmen and women of the aviation industry. The Federal Government, through \nthe Federal Aviation Administration and Industry together, must do \neverything within our power to protect the public from the menace of \nterrorism and other security threats.\n  In 1996, soon after the tragedy of TWA flight 800, I proposed new \nrequirements to improve security at the nation's airports. Congress \nadopted these requirements as part of the Federal Aviation \nReauthorization Act of 1996. This legislation tried to improve the \nhiring process and enhance the professionalism of airport security \nscreeners. The act also directed the FAA to upgrade security technology \nwith regard to baggage screening and explosive detection.\n  In my view, the FAA has been slow to implement these vital security \nimprovements. The FAA does not plan to finalize the regulation to \nimprove training requirements for screeners and certification for \nscreening companies until May 2001. Five years is too long to wait. \nTechnology upgrades have also been slow in coming, even though the \nupgraded technology is readily available. The traveling public should \nnot have to wait yet another year before these improvements are \nimplemented.\n  The FAA must modernize its procedure for background checks of \nprospective security-related employees. An FAA background check \ncurrently takes 90 days. That is too long. Under current procedures, \nthe FAA is required to perform these checks only when an applicant has \na gap in employment history of 12 months or longer, or if preliminary \ninvestigation reveals discrepancies in an applicant's resume. But 43% \nof violent felons serve an average of only seven months. This gap \nshould be closed.\n  My legislation, the Airport Security Improvement Act, would direct \nFAA to require criminal background checks for all applicants for \npositions with security responsibilities, including security screeners. \nThe bill will also require that these checks be performed \nexpeditiously.\n  My legislation also directs FAA to improve training requirements for \nsecurity screeners by September 30 of\n\n[[Page S2760]]\n\nthis year. FAA should require a minimum of 40 hours of classroom \ninstruction and 40 hours of practical on-the-job training before an \nindividual is deemed qualified to provide security screening services. \nThis standard would be a substantial increase over the 8 hours of \nclassroom training currently required for most screening positions in \nthe U.S. The 40 hour requirement is the prevailing standard in most of \nthe industrialized world.\n  Finally, my bill would require FAA to work with air carriers and \nairport operators to strengthen procedures to eliminate unauthorized \naccess to aircraft. Employees who fail to follow access procedures \nshould be suspended or terminated. I understand that FAA is currently \nworking on improving access standards. I hope this bill will encourage \nthem to do so in a timely fashion.\n  We are privileged to have with us today a distinguished panel of \nwitnesses who are well-versed in the area of airport security. I want \nto welcome them to the hearing and I am looking forward to their \ntestimony.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor of Senator \nHutchison's bill to improve aviation security. Our colleague from Texas \nbrings unique expertise to this issue as a former member of the \nNational Transportation Safety Board. I want to thank her for her \ndiligence in this area over the past several years as a member of the \nCommerce Committee Aviation Subcommittee.\n  Among other things, the Airport Security Improvement Act of 2000 \nwould make pre-employment criminal background checks mandatory for all \nbaggage screeners at airports, not just those who have significant gaps \nin their employment histories. It would require screeners to undergo \nextensive training requirements, since U.S. training standards fall far \nshort of European standards. The legislation would also seek tighter \nenforcement against unauthorized access to airport secure areas.\n  I cannot overemphasize the importance of adequate training and \ncompetency checks for the folks who check airline baggage for weapons \nand bombs. The turnover rate among this workforce is as high as 400 \npercent at one of the busiest airports in the country! The work is \nhard, and the pay is low. Obviously, this legislation does not \nestablish minimum pay for security screeners. By asking their employers \nto invest more substantially in training, however, we hope that they \nwill also work to ensure a more stable and competent workforce.\n  Several aviation security experts appeared before the Aviation \nSubcommittee at a hearing last week. They raised additional areas of \nconcern that I expect to address as this bill proceeds through the \nlegislative process. For instance, government and industry officials \nalike agree that the list of ``disqualifying'' crimes that are \nuncovered in background checks needs to be expanded. Most of us find it \nsurprising that an individual convicted of assault with a deadly \nweapon, burglary, larceny, or possession of drugs would not be \ndisqualified from employment as an airport baggage screener.\n  Fortunately, this bill is not drafted in response to loss of life \nresulting from a terrorist incident. Even so, it is clear that even our \nmost elementary security safeguards may be inadequate, as evidenced by \nthe loaded gun that a passenger recently discovered in an airplane \nlavatory during flight.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Hutchison, as well as experts \nin both government and industry circles, to make sure that any \nlegislative proposal targets resources in the most effective manner. By \nand large, security at U.S. airports is good, and airport and airline \nefforts clearly have a deterrent effect. What is also clear, however, \nis that we cannot relax our efforts as airline travel grows, and \nweapons technologies become more sophisticated.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 2441. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nestablish a program for fisheries habitat protection, restoration, and \nenhancement, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n                          fishable waters act\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nFishable Waters Act with my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Lincoln. \nThis is consensus legislation from a uniquely diverse spectrum of \ninterests to establish a comprehensive, voluntary, incentive-based, \nlocally-led program to improve and restore our fisheries.\n  Put simply, this legislation enables local stakeholders to get \ntogether to design water quality projects in their own areas that will \nbe eligible for some $350 million federal assistance to implement for \nthe benefit of our fisheries and water quality. It does not change any \nexisting provisions, regulatory or otherwise, of the Clean Water Act.\n  The Fishable Waters Act compliments existing clean water programs \nthat are designed to encourage, rather than coerce the participation of \nlandowners. This legislation will work because it will empower people \nat the local level who have a stake in its success and who will have \nhands-on involvement in its implementation.\n  It is supported by members of the Fishable Waters Coalition which \nincludes the American Sportfishing Association, Trout Unlimited, the \nIzaak Walton League of America, the National Corn Growers Association, \nthe National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, the Bass Anglers Sportsman \nSociety, the American Fisheries Society, the International Association \nof Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and the Pacific Rivers Council. These \ngroups have labored quietly but with great determination for several \nyears to produce this consensus proposal to build on the success of the \nClean Water Act.\n  As my colleagues understand, it is at great peril that anyone in this \ntown undertakes to address clean water-related issues but the need is \ntoo great and this approach too practical to not embrace it, introduce \nit, and work to achieve the wide-spread support it merits.\n  A companion bill is being introduced by Congressman John Tanner in \nthe House. That measure is being cosponsored by Representatives Roy \nBlunt, John Dingell, Nancy Johnson, Charles Stenholm, Sherwood \nBoehlert, Wayne Gilchrest, Pat Danner, Phil English, Christopher John \nand Jim Saxton.\n  Joining us yesterday for the kickoff were representatives of the \nFisable Waters Coalition and a special guest, a fishing enthusiast who \nsome may know otherwise as a top-ranked U.S. golfer, David Duval. ``Why \nam I here? I like to fish. I've done it as long as I can remember,'' \nDuval said. ``I want my kids to be able to have healthy habitats for \nfish. I want my grandkids and my great-grandkids to be able to do what \nI enjoy so much, and I think this could make a big difference.''\n  This bipartisan and consensus legislation is intended to capture \nopportunities to build on the success of the Clean Water Act. It \nenables local stakeholders to get together with farmers who own 70 \npercent of our nation's land to design local water quality projects \nthat will be eligible for some $350 million in federal assistance for \nthe benefit of our fisheries and water quality.\n  Instead of Washington saying, ``you do this and you pay for it'' and \ninstead of Washington saying, ``you do this but we'll help you pay for \nit'', this legislation lets local citizens design projects that can be \neligible for federal assistance. For farmers, the idea of protecting \nland for future generations is not an abstract notion because the \nfarmers in my State know that good stewardship is good for them and \ntheir families. Their challenge is that while they feed this nation and \nprovide some $50 billion in exports, they do not have the ability to \npass additional costs onto consumers like corporations do. For the 2 \nmillion people who farm to provide environmental benefits for \nthemselves and the rest of the nation's 270 million people, they need \npartners because they cannot afford to do it by themselves. This \nlegislation recognizes that reality.\n  While one can expect a great deal of controversy surrounding any \ncomprehensive Clean Water effort, the consensus that has built around \nthis approach is cause for great optimism that this legislation will be \nthe vehicle to make significant additional progress in improving water \nquality.\n  I congratulate members of the Coalition for producing and supporting \nthis consensus legislation and I look forward to working with Senator \nLincoln\n\n[[Page S2761]]\n\nand my other Senate colleagues to move this legislation forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a one-page \nsummary of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               Fishable Waters Act Bill Summary in Brief\n\n\n                                purpose\n\n       This legislation begins with the premise that while great \n     progress has been made in improving water quality under the \n     Clean Water Act, more opportunities remain. The particular \n     emphasis on this legislation is on opportunities to address \n     fisheries habitat and water quality needs.\n       The findings include that it shall be the policy of the \n     United States to protect, restore, and enhance fisheries \n     habitat and related uses through voluntary watershed planning \n     at the state and local level that leads to sound fisheries \n     conservation on an overall watershed basis.\n       To carry out this objective, a new section is added to the \n     Clean Water Act.\n\n\n                                program\n\n       The legislation authorizes the establishment of voluntary \n     and local Watershed Councils to consider the best available \n     science to plan and implement a program to protect and \n     restore fisheries habitat with the consent of affected \n     landowners.\n       Each comprehensive plan must consider the following \n     elements: characterization of the watershed in terms of \n     fisheries habitat; objectives both near- and long-term; \n     ongoing factors affecting habitat and access; specific \n     projects that need to be undertaken to improve fisheries \n     habitat; and any necessary incentives, financial or \n     otherwise, to facilitate implementation of best management \n     practices to better deal with non-point source pollution \n     including sediments impairing waterways.\n       Projects and measures that can be implemented or \n     strengthened with the consent of affected landowners to \n     improve fisheries habitat including stream side vegetation, \n     instream modifications and structures, modifications to flood \n     control measures and structures that would improve the \n     connection of rivers to low-lying backwaters, oxbows, and \n     tributary mouths.\n       With the consent of affected landowners, those projects, \n     initiatives, and restoration measures identified in the \n     approved plan become eligible for funding through a Fisheries \n     Habitat Account.\n       Funds from the Fisheries Habitat Account may be used to \n     provide up to 15 percent for the non-federal matching \n     requirement under including the following conservation \n     programs: The Wetlands Reserve Program; The Environmental \n     Quality Incentives Program; The National Estuary Program; The \n     Emergency Conservation Program; The Farmland Protection \n     Program; The Conservation Reserve Program; The Wildlife \n     Habitat Incentives Program; The North American Wetlands \n     Conservation Program; The Federal Aid in Sportfish \n     Restoration Program; The Flood Hazard Mitigation and Riverine \n     Ecosystem Restoration Program; The Environmental Management \n     Program; and The Missouri and Middle Mississippi Enhancement \n     Project.\n       The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to develop an \n     urban waters revitalization program ($25m/yr) to improve \n     fisheries and related recreational activities in urban waters \n     with priority given to funding projects located in and \n     benefitting low-income or economically depressed areas.\n       $250 million is authorized annually through Agriculture for \n     the planning and implementation of projects contained in \n     approved plans.\n       States with approved programs may, if they choose, transfer \n     up to 20 percent of the funds provided to each state through \n     the Clean Water Act's $200 million Section 319 non-point \n     source program to implement planned projects.\n       Up to $25 million is authorized annually through Interior \n     for measures to restrict livestock assess to streams and \n     provide alternative watering opportunities and $50 million is \n     authorized annually to provide, with the cooperation of \n     landowners, minimum instream flows and water \n     quantities.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nMissouri, Kit Bond, in introducing the Fishable Waters Act. This bill \nis aimed at restoring and maintaining clean water in our Nation's \nrivers, lakes, and streams. This bill will provide funding for programs \nwith a proven track record of conserving land, cleaning up the \nenvironment, and promoting clean and fishable waters. This legislation \ntakes the right approach to reducing non-point source pollution. It's \nvoluntary. It's incentive-based. And if encourages public-private \npartnerships.\n  Our State Motto, ``The Natural State,'' reflects our dedication to \npreserving the unique natural landscape that is Arkansas. We have \ntowering mountains, rolling foothills, an expansive Delta, countless \npristine rivers and lakes, and a multitude of timber varieties across \nour state. From expansive evergreen forests in the South, to the \nnation's largest bottomland hardwood forest in the East, as well as one \nof this nation's largest remaining hardwood forests across the Northern \none-half of the state, Arkansas has one of the most diverse ecosystems \nin the United States. Most streams and rivers in Arkansas originate or \nrun through our timberlands and are sources for water supplies, prime \nrecreation, and countless other uses. We also have numerous outdoor \nrecreational opportunities and it is vital that we take steps to \nprotect the environment.\n  This bill utilizes current programs within the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture that have a proven track record of reducing non-point \nsources of pollution and promoting clean and fishable water through \nvoluntary conservation measures. Existing USDA programs like the \nWetlands Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, \nConservation Reserve Program, and Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, \nassist farmers in taking steps towards preserving a quality \nenvironment.\n  CRP and WRP are so popular with farmers, that they will likely reach \ntheir authorized enrollment cap by the end of 2001. Mr. President, \nfarmers wouldn't flock to these programs unless there was an inherent \ndesire to ensure that they conserved and preserved our Nation's water \nresources.\n  Arkansas ranks third in the number of enrolled acres in USDA's \nWetlands Reserve Program because our farmers have recognized the vital \nrole that wetlands play in preserving a sound ecology.\n  WRP is so popular in AR that we have over 200 currently pending \napplications that we cannot fill because of lack of funding. That's \nover 200 farmers that want to voluntarily conserve wetland areas around \nrivers, lakes, and streams. We need to fill that void in funding for \nthese beneficial programs. This bill will help farmers in Arkansas and \nacross the nation to voluntarily conserve sensitive land areas and \nprovide buffer strips for runoff areas.\n  Farmers make their living from the soil and water. They have a vested \ninterest in ensuring that these resources are protected. I don't \nbelieve that our nation's farmers have been given enough credit for \ntheir efforts to preserve a sound environment.\n  As many of you know, farming has a special place in my heart because \nI was raised in a seventh generation farm family. I know first hand \nthat farmers want to protect the viability of their land so they can \npass it on to the next generation. This bill is about more than \nagriculture though. It strikes the right balance between our \nagricultural industry and another pastime that I feel very strongly \nabout, hunting and fishing.\n  Over the years many people have been surprised when they learn that I \nam an avid outdoorsman. I grew up in the South where hunting and \nfishing are not just hobbies, they're a way of life. My father never \ndifferentiated between taking his son or daughters hunting or fishing, \nit was just assumed that we would all take part. For this, I will be \nforever grateful because I truly enjoy the outdoors, and the time I \nspent hunting and fishing is a big part of who I am today.\n  We are blessed in Arkansas to have such bountiful outdoor \nopportunities. For these opportunities to continue to exist we must \ntake steps to ensure that our nation's waters are protected. Trout in \nArkansas' Little Red River and mallards in the riverbottoms of the \nMississippi Delta both share a common need of clean water. And that is \nwhat we are ultimately striving for with this legislation: an \neffective, voluntary, incentive based plan to provide funding for \nprograms that promote clean water.\n  Mr. President, I want to again stress the importance of voluntary \nprograms.\n  We cannot expect to have success by using a heavy-handed approach to \nregulate our farmers, ranchers, and foresters into environmental \ncompliance. Trying to force people into a permitting program to reduce \nthe potential for non-profit runoff may actually discourage responsible \nenvironmental practices.\n  I agree with the EPA's objective of cleaning up our nation's impaired \nrivers, lakes, and streams, but firmly believe that a permitting \nprogram is not the best solution to the problem of maintaining clean \nwater. Placing another unnecessary layer of regulation\n\n[[Page S2762]]\n\nupon our nation's local foresters will only slow down the process of \nresponsible farming and forestry and the implementation of voluntary \nBest Management Practices.\n  Mr. President, this legislation takes the right approach to clean and \nfishable waters. It's voluntary. It's incentive-based. And it \nencourages public-private partnerships to clean up our Nation's rivers, \nlakes, and streams.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join us in the fight for clean and \nfishable waters.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 2442. A bill to amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development \nAct to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to provide long-term, \nlow-interest loans to apple growers; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                   apple orchard diversification act\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nApple Orchard Diversification Act of 2000.\n  Mr. President, I am proud that Washington state produces more apples \nthan any other state in the nation. The apple industry is an \nindependent group. It has made Washington state and U.S. apples and \napple products popular in many corners of the world. In the mid-1990s, \ngrowers were doing well, markets were opening and expanding, and the \nfuture looked bright.\n  But in 1998 and 1999, the bottom fell out from under them. Low prices \nand weather-related disasters devastated apple producers, and growers \nof hundreds of other commodities nationwide. In northeastern and mid-\nAtlantic states, fruit and vegetable growers were hit hard by freezing \ntemperatures and drought. In the Pacific Northwest, some growers were \nhurt by bad weather.\n  But the biggest problem is low prices. These low prices are caused by \nthe Asian financial crisis; by market access problems; by below-cost \napple juice concentrate dumping by China; by record world-wide \nproduction and oversupply; and other factors.\n  The results are devastating, especially in my home state of \nWashington. Nationwide, the industry lost an estimated $300 million on \nthe 1998 crop. In Okanogan County in Washington state, some \norganizations have estimated that 90 percent of apple growers will not \nrecover their 1999 expenses. Okanogan County already experiences high \nunemployment. It cannot afford a long-term, depressed farm economy. The \ncounty declared an economic disaster and urged the state to do the \nsame. Meanwhile, other counties, especially in north central \nWashington, are trying to respond to this disaster. Many growers will \ngo out of business. Others will not be able to get commercial lending \nthis year.\n  The Administration and members of this Congress are working to \nresolve some of the issues facing the industry and rural communities.\n  Last year, Congress passed a large disaster relief package for \nagriculture. I supported this package because it kept many producers \nabove water for another year. However, like many of my colleagues, I \nwas frustrated this package did not do more for specialty crop \nproducers. Congress provided $1.2 billion in crop loss assistance. \nSpecialty crop producers, including apple growers, were eligible to \nreceive assistance to address weather-related disasters, and some \ngrowers did. But, in states like Washington, the aid package did too \nlittle.\n  Fortunately, action is occurring on the most important issue facing \nthe apple industry. Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Commerce \nlevied anti-dumping duties of 51.74 percent on the majority of imports \nof below-cost apple juice concentrate from China. The Administration's \npreliminary anti-dumping duty ruling in November 1999 helped our \nproducers by raising the price of both juice apples and concentrate. By \nMay 22, the U.S. International Trade Commission will make its final \ninjury ruling. If an injury determination is made, the Administration \nwill implement anti-dumping duties at the levels prescribed by the \nCommerce Department.\n\n  Our second victory was to address pest control in abandoned orchards. \nDuring my trip to central Washington last August, I heard from \ncommunity leaders that this was a real problem.\n  Low prices have caused many producers to abandon their orchards, and \nsome of these orchards became infested. Infested orchards impact the \noperations of other producers and create potential trade problems. In \nresponse, counties tore out trees and sprayed orchards. But last year, \nfunds in many counties were running low.\n  USDA holds defaulted loans on some of these abandoned orchards. Last \nyear, I urged the agency to take responsibility for pest control on \nthose properties. The Farm Service Agency in Washington state created a \nstrategy for reimbursing counties for pest control In October 1999, I \nwrote to Secretary Glickman to urge him to approve FSA's reimbursement \nstrategy. Shortly thereafter, USDA implemented this initiative so \ncounties could continue to control pests.\n  The third victory for apple and specialty crop producers may come \nsoon, when President Clinton signs risk management reform legislation \ninto law. The bill passed by the Senate would make major changes to \nfederal crop insurance policy to ensure that all producers, including \nspecialty crop growers, will have access to more viable risk management \nproducts.\n  But more needs to be done. My highest priorities for agriculture \nremain investing in research, expanding trade, and providing a safety \nnet when economic and natural disasters strike.\n  Last November, I introduced S. 1983, the Agricultural Market Access \nand Development Act. My bill would authorize the Secretary of \nAgriculture to spend up to $200 million--but not less than the current \n$90 million--for the Market Access Program. And it would set a floor of \n$35 million for spending on the Foreign Market Development \n``Cooperator'' Program. Senators Craig, Boxer, Feinstein, Gordon Smith, \nGorton, Wyden, Cleland, and Coverdell have all cosponsored this \nlegislation, and I appreciate their support.\n  The USDA Foreign Agricultural Service has reported that in 1999 we \nexperienced our first agricultural trade deficit with the European \nUnion. We imported $7.7 billion of EU agricultural products and \nexported $6.8 billion. Our competitors have increased market promotion \nspending by 35 percent, or $1 billion, over the past three years. Our \nspending, however, has decreased one percent.\n  Agricultural exports are key to maintaining a reasonable trade \nbalance. Other nations have invested in market development, and it's \nworked. We need to enhance our trade programs to give our producers a \nmore level playing field and a fighting chance.\n  Besides expanding trade, we must strengthen the safety net for \nproducers. We should not go back to our old Federal farm policies. Our \nprogram commodity growers do not want that, and our specialty crop \nproducers do not want a new, permanent relationship with the federal \ngovernment.\n  But I believe this farm crisis has taught us that we need flexible \ntools available for all producers when economic or natural disasters \nstrike. For some commodities this may mean counter-cyclical payments. \nOr it may mean a variety of flexible loans that meet the needs of all \nproducers or specific commodities. As we debate the next farm bill, we \nshould give USDA flexibility, within fiscally-responsible guidelines, \nto respond to crises in agriculture.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to create a one-time Apple \nOrchard Diversification Program. I have heard from growers that they \ncould very much use a loan program to diversify their orchards into \nmore commercially-viable varieties. Many of our producers invested \nheavily in Red and Golden Delicious apples, which are the varieties \nhardest hit by the economic crisis. We need a mechanism to allow these \ngrowers to diversify their orchards.\n  My bill would do just that. It would authorize USDA to provide up to \n$75 million in long-term, low-interest loans to apple producers. The \nloans could be used by producers to purchase trees for converting \nexisting apply orchards into more profitable apple varieties.\n  My bill waives much of the regulatory process. USDA has been \noverwhelmed with managing disaster programs, and that has delayed \nrelief. Instead, my bill bill requires USDA to conduct a stakeholder \nprocess, which\n\n[[Page S2763]]\n\nwould include three hearings around the country. The industry would \nhelp develop the program, and address issues such as income and acreage \nqualifications for growers who receive loans, and parameters on \npayments, acreage and varietal stock quality.\n  The concept of orchard diversification was born when Under Secretary \nGus Schumacher visited Quincy, Washington, in July 1999. The Under \nSecretary has spent a great deal of time in apply producing regions \naround the country. Mr. Schumacher has been criticized by some elected \nofficials and individuals for holding the listening session in \nWashington state. But I appreciate, and I know many of our family \nfarmers appreciate, his interest in these issues.\n  In conclusion, my grandfather moved to the Tri-Cities in the early \n1990s to work for Welch's. As a young child, I remember many trips to \ncentral Washington at harvest time to visit my grandmother, who \nremained in the area after my grandfather's death. To this day, the \nsmell of fresh picked peaches and apples remind me of my childhood. To \nmy Dad, it meant much more; it meant how his family put food on the \ntable and paid the mortgage. We grew up understanding how important \nfamily-run orchards were to our state's economy.\n  As I raised my own family, I always made sure we had a fruit tree in \nour yard. I wanted to remind myself of my years growing up and also to \nshow my kids what a resource we have in our state. I could not imagine \ndiscussing Washington's economy without a box of apples being part of \nthe picture. I want to make sure it stays that way for many generations \nto come.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and help pass this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Reed, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 2443.

Mr. President, as National Immunization Week approaches, \nI rise today to introduce legislation addressing childhood \nimmunizations. National Immunization Week (April 17-21) recognizes one \nof the most powerful health care and public health achievements in this \ncentury. Remarkable advances in the science of vaccine development and \nwidespread immunization efforts have led to a substantial reduction in \nthe incidence of infectious disease. Today, vaccination coverage is at \nrecord high levels. Smallpox has been eradicated; polio has been \neliminated from the Western Hemisphere; and measles and Hib invasive \ndisease, the leading cause of childhood meningitis and postnatal \nretardation, have been reduced to record lows.\n  The two bills I introduce today build on these successes. One \nproposal, ``The State Immunization Funding and Infrastructure Act of \n2000,'' ensures that state and local health departments are adequately \nfunded to continue successful efforts to immunize children and improve \ntheir ability to reach pockets of underimmunized populations. The \nother, ``The Comprehensive Insurance Coverage of Childhood Immunization \nAct of 2000,'' requires all health plans to cover recommended childhood \nand adolescent immunizations.\n  In spite of our successes, we must remain vigilant. Every day, nearly \n11,000 infants are born and each baby will need up to 19 doses of \nvaccine by age two. New vaccines continue to enter the market. Although \na significant proportion of the general population may be fully \nimmunized at a given time, coverage rates in the United States are \nuneven and life-threatening disease outbreaks do occur. In fact, in \nmany of the Nation's urban and rural areas, rates are unacceptably low \nand are actually declining.\n  Unfortunately, one of the areas most in need of attention is in my \nown home State of Illinois. Childhood immunization coverage rates in \nChicago have dropped each year since 1996 when they peaked at 76 \npercent. The most recent National Immunization Survey indicates that \nChicago's coverage rate is now 66.7 percent--one of the lowest rates in \nthe United States. Coverage rates for African American children in \nChicago are the worst in the Nation.\n  It is notable, however, that during this same period when Chicago has \nstruggled to improve vaccination rates, Federal financial assistance to \nstate and local health departments for immunization outreach activities \nhas been significantly reduced. In 1999, Chicago received a 38 percent \nreduction in Federal funds for the operation of their immunization \nprogram. In 2000, Chicago suffered another 37.5 percent reduction. The \nState of Illinois suffered a 58 percent reduction in 1999 and a further \n16 percent reduction in the year 2000. And the story in my State is not \nthat different from other areas of the country. Federal support for \nvaccine delivery activities has declined by more than 30 percent since \n1995.\n  Purchasing vaccines is not enough. The Section 317 immunization \nprogram administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nprovides grants to state and local public health departments for \n``operations and infrastructure'' activities. These grants are a \ncritical source of support, indeed the sole source of Federal support, \nfor essential efforts to get children immunized. They fund immunization \nregistries, provider education programs, outreach initiatives to \nparents, outbreak control, and linkages with other public health and \nwelfare services. These grants get the vaccine from the warehouse to \nour children.\n  The State Immunization Funding And Infrastructure Act of 2000 \nauthorizes an increase in Federal support for Section 317 grants to \nstates by $75 million for a total of $214 in FY2001. This restores \nfunding to the levels States and localities received in the mid-1990's \nand will help to stabilize many of the key functions that have been cut \nback in the face of steep funding reductions. In the past few years, \nmany states have already had to reduce clinic hours, cancel contracts \nwith providers, suspend registry development and implementation, limit \noutreach efforts and discontinue performance monitoring. The bill also \nprovides a $20 million increase over last year's funding level ($10 \nmillion over the President's budget) for vaccine purchase. This will \nensure that States are able to purchase adequate amounts of all \ncurrently licensed and recommended vaccines.\n  The other proposal I am introducing today, The Comprehensive \nInsurance Coverage of Childhood Immunization Act of 2000, will require \nthat all health plans cover all immunizations in accordance with the \nmost recent version of the Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule \nissued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These \nvaccinations must be provided without deductibles, coinsurance or other \ncost-sharing for all children and adolescents under the age of 19.\n  I was shocked to learn that, according to a recent survey of \nemployer-sponsored health plans conducted by William M. Mercer, Inc. \nand Partnership for Prevention, one out of five employer-sponsored \nplans do not cover childhood immunizations and one out of four fail to \ncover adolescent immunizations. Not only is this a significant gap in \nour health system, but it is simply financially illogical. Childhood \nand adolescent immunizations have been proven to save money. They \ndecrease the direct medical costs due to vaccine-preventable illnesses \nand reduce the time parents spend off the job, tending sick children.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in these efforts to maintain and \nimprove our nation's national immunization record and to ensure that \nall areas of the country and all populations benefit from the advances \nwe have made over the last century. Despite remarkable progress, many \nchallenges still face the U.S. vaccine delivery system. Approximately \none million children are still not adequately immunized. Our \ninfrastructure must be capable of successfully implementing an \nincreasingly complex vaccination schedule. Pockets\n\n[[Page S2764]]\n\nof underserved children still leave us vulnerable to deadly disease \noutbreaks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB (for himself, Mr. Edwards, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 2445. A bill to provide community-based economic development \nassistance for trade-affected communities; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               assistance development for communities act\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'm pleased to introduce the Assistance in \nDevelopment to Communities Act. This bill addressed the importance--and \nneed--for community-based, economic development to assist areas in \ntrade-related, economic transitions.\n  Despite the increased globalization of our economy, many communities \nnationwide are still one-company or one-industry towns. If that company \nor industry is adversely affected by trade, the entire community faces \neconomic strain. When these communities lose a major employer or \nindustry, they sadly also lose something far more valuable--they lose \ntheir way of life, and too often their strong sense of community.\n  Currently, when an individual loses a job because of the effects of \ntrade, the federal government provides Trade Adjustment Assistance or \nNAFTA-Trade Adjustment Assistance to help with income support and \nworker retraining. But what good is that training without jobs?\n  While we continue to open new avenues of free trade, the federal \ngovernment has an obligation to help trade affected communities attract \ngood jobs. Unfortunately, prospective employers don't automatically \nappear on the community's doorstep. Workers have mortgages, car \npayments, health concerns, family obligations and ties to the \ncommunity, so relocation isn't always feasible. Local officials must \nfind a way to lure industries to the area. Yet, they are caught in \nvicious cycle--employers are reluctant to move to economically \ndepressed areas, but without jobs, communities will never recover.\n  This is an on-going reality in the Martinsville/Henry County region \nof Virginia. In January, I spoke with local officials about the steady \nstream of job losses they've endured, including the loss of the number \ntwo employer in Martinsville. They've faced double-digit unemployment--\nsomething that's virtually unheard of in this strong economy. They told \nme they need help.\n  This legislation is borne from their ideas. The AID to Communities \nbill give local communities the resources they need to implement their \nown ideas for attracting new employers--quickly and easily. It does \nthis by providing an automatic, one-time grant to help affected \ncommunities formulate an economic development plan. This grant, up to \n$100,000, gives communities the resources they need to develop a long-\nterm plan to readjust their economic base. Once that plan has been \ndeveloped, the AID to Communities bill establishes a second, \ncompetitive grant program to help affected areas implement their plans. \nThese grants can be used in a variety of ways, from expanding \ncommercial infrastructure to establishing small business incubators.\n  My bill also offers two incentives to attract prospective employers. \nThe first incentive would expand the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) \nto provide employers with a tax credit if they hire someone who lives \nin an affected community and has lost a job due to trade. My bill would \nalso make explicit that the New Markets Tax Credit, which provides \nincentives for private sector investment and capital access in certain \nareas, is available for trade-affected communities.\n  Finally, the bill makes the federal government a better partner be \ncreating a one-stop, easily accessible clearinghouse of economic \ndevelopment information. This clearinghouse would provide access to \ncross-agency economic development tools, such as grants or low-interest \nloans, for affected communities so local officials don't have to hunt \nthrough each federal agency for the information they need.\n  Our neighbors in places like Martinsville/Henry County, Virginia are \neager to enjoy the economic prosperity that the rest of the country \nenjoys, yet has so far eluded them. The AID to Communities bill is one \nway to help. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure \nthat this bill becomes law and that the people of Martinsville/Henry \nCounty, and in so many other small towns across America, get the help \nwe owe them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 2446. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nassistance to homeowners and small businesses to repair Formosan \ntermite damage; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      Formosan Termite Tax Credit\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention \nof the Senate a plague that has been afflicted upon our country--\nformosan termites. Clearly, any termite is bad news for home and \nbuilding owners, but the formosan termite is especially a problem. This \naggressive termite species is becoming even more prevalent than native \ntermite species in some areas. While native species generally feed on \ndead trees and processed wood, formosan termites have an unbelievably \nhorrific appetite with a diet that consists of anything that contains \nwood fiber including homes, buildings and live trees as well as crops \nand plants. Believe it or not, formosan termites can even penetrate \nplaster, plastic and asphalt to get to a new food source.\n  Coptotermes formosanus (otherwise known as the formosan termite), \nhave invaded port cities in the United States and are spreading rapidly \nacross the rest of the country. Right now this exotic species is \nwrecking their special brand of havoc in 14 states including \nCalifornia, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, \nMississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, \nVirginia, and Hawaii with their map of destruction growing wider daily. \nExperts have estimated that it costs Americans an astonishing $1 \nbillion each year to repair the harm, with each new case costing \nhomeowners an average of $20,000.\n  Since the formosan termites was first brought to the United States it \nhas spread like a plague through the Southeast. The infestation is most \nsevere in New Orleans, where these pests have caused more damage than, \n``tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods combined'' and the total annual \ncost of termite damage and treatment is estimated at $217,000,000. In \nareas like the famed historic French Quarter, where close-packed houses \nshare common walls, entire city blocks must be treated--a procedure \nthat is costly and complicated. Outside the Quarter, officials fear \nthat infestation may have hit as many as one-third of the beloved live \noaks that shade historic thoroughfares such as St. Charles Avenue. A \nvoracious blind creature that eats history--it sounds like something \nfrom a science-fiction nightmare, but it's real.\n  Unfortunately, the only explanation for how this pest came to exist \nin the United States is that it was introduced from east Asia in the \n1940s through the mishandling of U.S. military cargo and troops \nreturning home from World War II--I believe that since the government \ncaused the damage, the government should do something to relieve the \nburden.\n  The bill I am introducing today seeks to provide the victims of \nFormosan Termites with some much needed relief. Under current law, \nsmall business owners are allowed to deduct the cost to repair Formosan \nTermite damage as a capital loss under IRS code Section 165. For some \nreason, individual homeowners have been denied this same right, \nalthough they can deduct the cost to repair damages caused by disasters \nwhich are defined as casualty losses, such as flood and fire. My bill \nsimply changes the definition of casualty loss to include Formosan \nTermites so that homeowners are allowed the same deduction that \nbusiness owners are already getting.\n  This measure also seeks to make low interest loans financed by the \nissuance of ``qualified'' private activity tax exempt bonds more \naccessible for homeowners and small businesses seeking to repair the \nexpensive damage which was inflicted upon their homes by formosan \ntermite damage. It does this by expanding current mortgage revenue bond \nprovisions to permit homeowners to receive up to a $25,000 home \nimprovement loan to repair this damage and also allows small businesses \nand landlords to use issue revenue bonds to finance loans for this same \npurpose. As\n\n[[Page S2765]]\n\nan added incentive, as long as the proceeds are used to purchase tax \nexempt bonds to finance the repair of Formosan Termite damage, banks \nwill be allowed to deduct the interest payments on these loans.\n  Obviously this legislation will not solve all of the problems \nformosan termites have caused. However, I do believe it is a good first \nstep towards alleviating the burden these pests bring upon homeowners \nacross the country. I urge everyone to join with me and give the \nvictims of this plague a little relief. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2446\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development \nAct to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to make competitive \ngrants to establish National Centers for Distance Working to provide \nassistance to individuals in rural communities to support the use of \nteleworking in information technology fields; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                          telework act of 2000\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenators Daschle and Baucus to introduce the Rural Telework Act of \n2000, a bill that is designed to make information technology (IT) \nindustries a part of diverse, sustainable rural economies while helping \nIT employers find skilled workers. The goal of this bill is to link \nunemployed and underemployed individuals in rural areas and on Indian \nreservations with jobs in the IT industry through telework.\n  We are in the midst of an information revolution which has the \npotential to be every bit as significant to our society and economy as \nthe industrial revolution two hundred years ago. But in recent months \nthere has been much discussion of the ``digital divide,'' the idea that \none America is not able to take advantage of the promise of new \ntechnologies to change the way we learn, live, and work while the other \nAmerica speeds forward into the 21st Century. As advanced \ntelecommunications and informaiton technology become the new engines of \nour economy, it is critical that all no communities are left behind.\n  Many rural communities and Indian reservations are already facing \nsevere unemployment underemployment, and population loss due to a lack \nof economic opportunities. A study last year by the Center for Rural \nAffairs reports that widespread poverty exists in agriculturally based \ncounties in a six-state region including Minnesota. Over one-third of \nhouseholds in farm counties have annual income less than $15,000 and, \nin every year from 1988 to 1997, earnings in farm counties \nsignificantly trailed other counties. Unemployment on many Indian \nreservations exceed 50% and remote locations make traditional \nindustries uncertain agents for economic development.\n  There are troubles ahead for the new economy as well: the information \ntechnology industry reports that it faces a dramatic shortage of \nskilled workers. The Minnesota Department of Economic Security projects \nthat over the next decade, almost 8,800 workers will be needed each \nyear to fill position openings in specific IT occupations. \nApproximately 1,000 students graduate each year from IT-related post-\nsecondary programs in Minnesota, not anywhere near enough to fill the \ndemand, according to this same state agency. This shortage is reflected \nnation wide, with industry projecting\n\n[[Page S2766]]\n\nshortfalls of several hundred of thousand IT workers per year in coming \nyears.\n  Rural workers need jobs. High tech employers need workers. This \nlegislation would create models of how to bring these communities \ntogether to find a common solution to these separate challenges.\n  The Rural Telework Act of 2000 would authorize the Department of \nAgriculture to make competitive grants to qualified organizations to \nimplement five year projects to train, connect, and broker employment \nin the private sector, through telework, a population of rural workers \nin their community. A grant recipient would be desgnated as a National \nCenter for Distance Working. The National Centers for Distance Working, \nlocated in rural areas, are intended to be locally developed and \nimplemented national models of how telework relationships can meet the \nneeds of rural communities for new economic opportunities and the need \nof IT intensive industries for new workers.\n\n  Mr. President, telework is a new term that may be unfamiliar to \ncolleagues so I want to take a moment to explain what it is. According \nto the International Telework Association and Council (ITAC), telework \nis defined as using information and communications technologies to \nperform work away from the traditional work site typically used by the \nemployer. For example, a person who works at home and transmits his or \nher work product back to the office via a modern is a teleworker, also \nknown as a telecommuter; as is someone who works from a telework \ncenter, which is a place where many teleworkers work from--often for \ndifferent companies.\n  The nature of IT jobs allow them to be performed away from a \ntraditional work site. As long as workers have the required training, \nand a means of performing work activities over a distance--through the \nuse of advanced telecommunications--there is no reason that skilled IT \njobs cannot be filled from rural communities.\n  Because it essentially allows distance to be erased, telework is a \npromising tool for rural development and for making rural and \nreservation economies sustainable. Very soon, a firm located in another \ncity, another state or even another country need not be viewed as a \ndistant opportunity for rural residents, but as a potential employer \nonly as far away as a home computer or telework center. Likewise, \ntelework arrangements allow employers to draw from a national labor \npool without the hassles and cost associated with relocation.\n  Many businesses and organizations are already using telework or \ntelecommuting as a tool to reduce travel and commuting times and to \naccommodate the needs and schedules of employees. Many metropolitan \ncommunities with high concentrations of IT industries are already \nlooking to telework as a means of addressing urban and suburban ills \nsuch as housing shortages, traffic congestion, and pollution.\n  However, the IT industry does not currently view rural America as a \npotential source of skilled employees. Nor do many rural communities \nknow how to turn IT industries into a viable source of good jobs to \nrevitalize local economies. Moreover, many rural community leaders fear \nthat providing IT job skills to rural residents--when there are no \nopportunities for using those skills in the community--will lead to \nfurther population losses as retrained workers seek opportunities in \nmetropolitan areas. At the same time, management of off-site employees \nrequires new practices to be developed by employers and in some cases, \ndramatic paradigm shifts. Rural areas and Indian reservations are in \ndanger of being left behind by a revolution which actually holds the \nmost promise for those communities which are the most distant. IT \nemployers risk missing a pool of potential employees with a strong work \nethic.\n  Establishment of a National Center for Distance Working in a rural \ncommunity or Indian reservation will give that community access to \nfederal resources to implement a locally designed proposal to employ \nrural residents in IT jobs through telework relationships, linking \nprospective employers with rural residents. Successful National Centers \nfor Distance Work would be locally  developed and implemented national \nmodels for how telework can be used as a tool for rural development.\n\n  The Department of Agriculture's Rural Utility Service (RUS) would \nadminister the program which would have a $11 million annual \nauthorization level. At least $10 million of authorized funds would be \nused for the purpose of making competitive grants to establish National \nCenters for Distance Working.\n  Grant money made available under the program would be highly \nflexible, and would need to be leveraged with private, local and state \nresources. For example, they could be used to provide or enhance the \nquality of: IT skills training and education, technology and \ntelecommunications, promotion of teleworking, brokering employment for \nrural IT workers, and other necessary elements to establish IT work \nopportunities in that rural community.\n  The funds are not intended to duplicate existing federal training and \nconnectivity programs. Nor is it intended that Centers use these funds \nto supplant existing telecommunications providers who offer appropriate \nservices to make telework a reality in rural communities. Rather, the \nfederal investment is targeted to augment these existing sources of \nfunding and allow rural communities to fill in the gaps in existing \npublic and private resources and services. Prospective grant recipients \nwould need to form partnerships with local, state, and private \nentities, including potential employers.\n  The grants made available under this program would not be sufficient \nto cover the full cost of training, connecting, and employing rural \nworkers, but are intended to be ``seed money'' leveraged with dollars \nfrom other sources. Grant recipients would be required to match the \nfunds provided under this program with funds from non-federal sources.\n  Finally, up to $1 million of the $11 million could be used by RUS to \nmake grants for the purpose of promoting the development of teleworking \nin rural areas by making grants to entities to conduct research on \neconomics, operational, social, and policy issues related to \nteleworking in rural areas, including the development of best practices \nfor businesses that employ teleworkers.\n  The necessary vision of how to make telework a reality already exists \nin some employers and in some rural communities. In Sebeka, Minnesota--\na town with a population of little more than 600 people--a small firm \ncalled Cross Consulting was founded. That company employs over 20 \npeople through a contract with Northwest Airlines to provide do \nprogramming on Northwest's mainframe computers. These people are rural \nteleworkers. The new economy is not leaving Sebeka behind and we need \nto incubate that kind of innovation in rural areas and Indian \nreservations across the country.\n  Mr. President, for many jobs, in many industries, telework may be the \nfuture of work. It may also be the future of diverse, sustainable rural \neconomies. This legislation offers an early opportunity to invest in \nlocal innovation to harness this potential.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2447\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Telework Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) many rural communities and Indian reservations have not \n     benefited from the historic economic expansion in recent \n     years, and high levels of unemployment and underemployment \n     persist in the rural communities and reservations;\n       (2) many economic opportunities, especially in information \n     technology fields, are located away from many rural \n     communities and reservations;\n       (3) the United States has a significant and growing need \n     for skilled information technology workers;\n       (4) unemployed and underemployed rural employees represent \n     a potential workforce to fill information technology jobs;\n       (5) teleworking allows rural employees to perform skill \n     intensive information technology jobs from their communities \n     for firms located outside rural communities; and\n       (6) employing a rural teleworkforce in information \n     technology fields will require--\n\n[[Page S2767]]\n\n       (A) employers that are willing to hire rural residents or \n     contract for work to be performed in rural communities;\n       (B) recruitment and training of rural residents appropriate \n     for work in information technology fields;\n       (C) means of connecting employers with employees through \n     advanced telecommunications services; and\n       (D) innovative approaches and collaborative models to \n     create rural technology business opportunities and facilitate \n     the employment of rural individuals.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to make \n     competitive grants to establish National Centers for Distance \n     Working in rural areas to provide assistance to individuals \n     in rural communities to support the use of teleworking in \n     information technology fields;\n       (2) to promote teleworking arrangements, small electronic \n     business development, and creation of information technology \n     jobs in rural areas for the purpose of creating sustainable \n     economic opportunities in rural communities;\n       (3) to promote the practice of teleworking to information \n     technology jobs among rural, urban, and suburban residents, \n     Indian tribes, job training and workforce development \n     providers, educators, and employers;\n       (4) to meet the needs of information technology and other \n     industries for skilled employees by accelerating the training \n     and hiring of rural employees to fill existing and future \n     jobs from rural communities and Indian reservations;\n       (5) to promote teleworking and small electronic business as \n     sustainable income sources for rural communities and Indian \n     tribes; and\n       (6) to study, collect information, and develop best \n     practices for rural teleworking employment practices.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to combat trafficking of persons, especially into the \nsex trade, slavery, and slavery-like conditions, in the United States \nand countries around the world through prevention, prosecution, and \nenforcement against traffickers, and through protection and assistance \nto victims of trafficking; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n[[Page S2768]]\n\n             The International Anti-Trafficking Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation \nentitled the International Anti-Trafficking Act of 2000 which combats \nthe insidious practice of trafficking of persons worldwide.\n  As we begin the 21st Century, the degrading institution of slavery \ncontinues throughout the world. Sex trafficking is a modern day form of \nslavery, and it is the largest manifestation of slavery in the world \ntoday.\n  Every year, approximately 1 million women and children are forced \ninto the sex trade against their will, internationally. They are \nusually transported across international borders so as to ``shake'' \nlocal authorities, leaving the victims defenseless in a foreign \ncountry, virtually held hostage in a strange land. It is estimated that \nat least 50,000 women and children are brought into the United States \nannually, for this purpose. The numbers are staggering, and growing \nrapidly. Some report that over 30 million women and children have been \nenslaved in this manner since the 1970's. I believe this is one of the \nmost shocking and rampant human rights abuses worldwide.\n  One of two methods, fraud or force, is used to obtain victims. The \nmost common method, ``fraud,'' is used with villagers in under-\ndeveloped areas. Typically the ``buyer'' promises the parents that he \nis taking their young daughter to the city to become a nanny or \ndomestic servant, giving the parents a few hundred dollars as a ``down \npayment'' for the future money she will earn for the family. Then the \ngirl is transported across international borders, deposited in a \nbrothel and forced into the trade, until she is no longer useful \n(becoming sick with AIDS). She is held against her will under the \nrationale that she must ``work off'' her debt which was paid to the \nparents, which typically takes several years. The second method used \nfor obtaining victims is ``force'' which is used in the cities, where a \ngirl is physically abducted, beaten, and held against her will, \nsometimes in chains. The routes are specific and definable, and include \nBurma to Thailand, Eastern Europe to the Middle East, and Nepal to \nIndia, among numerous other routes, through which victims of this \npractice are channeled.\n  Presently, no comprehensive legislation has been adopted, yet, which \nholistically challenges the practice of trafficking and assists the \nvictims. I am introducing this legislation, the International Anti-\nTrafficking Act of 2000, today as a companion to the legislation \nintroduced by Congressman Chris Smith and Congressman Sam Gejdenson, \nknown as the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (H.R. 3244). \nSenator Wellstone has also introduced legislation which closely mirrors \nthe Smith-Gejdenson bill. Our primary difference is the methods for \nenforcement. Unless the President implements one of the broad waivers \ngranted to him in this legislation, non-humanitarian, non-trade foreign \nassistance (listed under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961) to \ncountries will be suspended if countries fail to meet the minimum \nstandard to stop the flow of traffickers in their own countries. Please \nnote that there is an extremely broad national interest waiver \nprovision granted to the President which allows him to exempt any and \nall programs, as well as an additional waiver which allows the \nPresident to guard against any adverse effect on vulnerable victims of \ntrafficking, including women and children.\n  This bill presents a comprehensive scheme to ``penalize the full \nrange of offenses'' involved in elaborate trafficking networks. It also \nprovides a doorway of freedom for those who are presently enslaved \nthroughout the world and promotes their recovery in civil society. Some \nof the provisions include: establishment of an Interagency Task Force \nto Monitor and Combat Trafficking, enhanced reporting by the State \nDepartment on this practice, protection and assistance for victims of \ntrafficking, changes in immigration status allowing victims to stay to \ntestify in prosecutions, strengthens prosecution and punishment of \ntraffickers, among other provisions.\n  In short, we believe it's time to challenge this evil slavery \npractice known as trafficking, and I believe this legislation is a \nfirst step to gaining freedom for those who are presently bound.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL:\n  S. 2452. A bill to reduce the reading deficit in the United States by \napplying the findings of scientific research in reading instruction to \nall students who are learning to read the English language and to amend \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to improve literacy \nthrough family literacy projects and to reauthorize the inexpensive \nbook distribution program; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                READING DEFICIT ELIMINATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, America has a reading deficit! \nAccording to the National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS), 41 million \nadults are unable to perform even the simplest literacy tasks. The most \nrecent National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) conducted in \n1998 continues to show that almost 70 percent of 4th grade students \ncannot read at a proficient level. Even worse, 40 percent of those 4th \ngraders could not read at even a basic level for their grade.\n  In short, Mr. President, unless we treat this situation as the \nnational emergency that it is--and soon--the next decade will see an \nastonishing 70 percent of our 4th grade students joining the ranks of \nthose 41 million American adults who are unable to perform simple \nliteracy tasks.\n  The ability to read the English language with fluency and \ncomprehension is essential if individuals, old and young, are to reach \ntheir full potential in any field of endeavor. As the saying goes, \n``reading is fundamental.''\n  And the statistics bear that out as well. Workers who lack a high \nschool diploma earn a mean monthly income of $452, compared to $1,829 \nfor those with a bachelor's degree. Forty three percent of people with \nthe lowest literacy skills live in poverty, 17 percent receive food \nstamps, and 70 percent have no job or a part-time job.\n  And make no mistake that the nation itself and not just individuals \nwill suffer. If our children are not taught to read, who will man our \nhigh tech defenses or fill the high tech jobs in America's future?\n  Compounding these astounding statistics, Mr. President, the 1998 NAEP \nalso found that minority students on average continue to lag far behind \nin reading proficiency, even though many of them are in Title I \nprograms of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act or participated \nin Head Start programs.\n  Clearly, throwing taxpayer money at the problem does not work. Our \nchildren's reading scores continue to decline or remain stagnant, even \nthough Congress has spent more than $120 million over the past 30 years \nfor academic enrichment programs under Title I and other federal \nefforts ostensibly with the primary purpose of improving reading skills \namong disadvantaged children.\n  It should also be pointed out that more than half of the students \nbeing placed in the special learning disabilities category of our \nSpecial Education programs are there in large part because they have \nnot learned to read. The national cost of special education at the \nfederal, state, and local levels now exceeds $60 billion each year. The \nNational Institute for Child Health and Human Development says that 90-\n95 percent of these students could learn to read and be returned to \ntheir regular classrooms if they were given instruction using \nscientifically based reading principles. This would result in over $12 \nbillion in savings nationwide every year by eliminating the need for \nspecial education for these children.\n  In response to these disturbing national statistics concerning the \ninability of so many children to read, I worked with Representative \nBill Goodling--Chairman of the Education Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives--to develop the Reading Deficit Elimination Act of \n2000, which I am introducing today.\n  By providing funds for teacher training, textbook and curriculum \npurchases, student assessments, teacher bonuses, and tuition assistance \ngrants to parents, this legislation offers the States a helping hand in \nteaching students nationwide to read. Unlike the unfunded mandates that \nhave failed in the past, this legislation will give states and \ncommunities funds to institute reading instruction based on years\n\n[[Page S2769]]\n\nof federally sponsored research, giving them the ability and the \nflexibility to help our children succeed.\n  The National Reading Panel--requested by Congress and created by the \nNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development--released its \nreport just this morning on scientifically-based reading instruction \nand research in a hearing of the Senate's Labor/HHS Appropriations \nSubcommittee chaired by Senator Cochran.\n  The report clearly articulates the most effective approaches to \nteaching children to read, the status of the research on reading, \nreading instruction practices that are ready to be used by teachers in \nclassrooms around the country, and a plan to rapidly disseminate the \nfindings to teachers and parents. The report also constitutes the most \ncomprehensive review of existing reading research to be undertaken in \nAmerican education history. Panel members identified more than 100,000 \nresearch studies completed since 1966, developed and submitted them to \nrigorous criteria for their review.\n  A major finding of the report was that systematic phonics instruction \nis one of the necessary components of a total reading program. \nSimilarly, the NRP also found that the sequence of reading instruction \nthat obtains maximum benefits for students should include instruction \nin phonemic awareness, systematic phonics, reading fluency, spelling, \nwriting and reading comprehension strategies. We must use the knowledge \nof reading skills and the principles for teaching reading skills gained \nfrom these studies from the government and the private sector to reduce \nthe number of individuals and students who cannot read.\n  The programs and provisions in the Reading Deficit Elimination Act of \n2000 are based on these finding by the National Reading Panel.\n  Mr. President, Frederick Douglass, arguably the most influential \nAfrican American of the nineteenth century said, ``Once you learn to \nread, you will be forever free.'' Douglass knew the importance of \nfreedom, and he knew the importance of literacy. The ability to read \nthe English language with fluency and comprehension is essential if \nindividuals are to reach their full potential in any endeavor. Again, \nas the saying goes: ``Reading is fundamental.'' No one should be left \nbehind because they can't read. We must not limit the success of the \nnext generation by allowing them to continue down the path of \nilliteracy. We must teach them to read and give them this fundamental \ntool they need to succeed in life as well as in school.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 2454.

A bill to authorize the President to award a gold medal on \nbehalf of Congress to Pope John Paul II in recognition of his \noutstanding and enduring contributions to humanity, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n             congressional gold medal for pope john paul ii\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nawarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Pope John Paul II.\n  Mr. President, Pope John Paul II is the most recognized person in the \nworld, having personally visited tens of millions, in almost every \ncontinent and country. He has been one of the greatest pastoral leaders \nof this century, fearlessly guiding the Catholic Church into the new \nmillennium. Due to his tremendous faith and leadership he was elected \nbishop at a very early age, and elected to the papacy on October 16, \n1978, at the age of 58.\n  Though many people see the Pope as an important statesman, diplomat, \nand political figure, Pope John Paul II is much more than that. As \nspiritual leader to the world's 1 billion Catholics, the Pope has \ncommenced a great dialog with modern culture, one that transcends the \nboundaries of political or economic ideology.\n  As have his predecessors of happy memory, he stands boldly as an ever \nvigilant sign of contradiction to a culture that is darkened by the \nclouds of death. In the face of this mounting storm, he has tirelessly \nproclaimed the need for a culture of life.\n  In what is now one of the Pope's most famous encyclicals, and the one \nwhich he regards to be the most significant of this pontificate, \nEvangelium Vitae (the Gospel of Life), the argues powerfully for an \nincreased respect for all human life:\n\n       Thirty years later, taking up the words of the Council and \n     with the same forcefulness I repeat that condemnation in the \n     name of the whole Church, certain that I am interpreting the \n     genuine sentiment of every upright conscience: ``Whatever is \n     opposed to life itself, such as any type of murder, genocide, \n     abortion, euthanasia, or willful self-destruction, whatever \n     violates the integrity of the human person, such as \n     mutilation, torments inflicted on body or mind, attempts to \n     coerce the will itself; whatever insults human dignity, such \n     as subhuman living conditions, arbitrary imprisonment, \n     deportation, slavery, prostitution, the selling of women and \n     children; as well as disgraceful working conditions, where \n     people are treated as mere instruments of gain rather than as \n     free and responsible persons; all these things and others \n     like them are infamies indeed. They poison human society, and \n     they do more harm to those who practice them than to those \n     who\n\n[[Page S2770]]\n\n     suffer from the injury. Moreover, they are a supreme dishonor \n     to the Creator.''\n\n  That is from the Pope's Evangelium.\n  Mr. President, the urgency of this message--the Pope's message--\nbecomes more acute by the day; particularly at the beginning of the new \nmillennium.\n  The Pope, having witnessed first-hand the brutal inhumanity of Nazi \nand Communist regimes, understands, in a way few of us can appreciate, \nthe true dignity of each and every human being. He is a crusader \nagainst the offenses against human dignity that have transpired in the \n20th century. More than any other single person this century, Pope John \nPaul II has worked to protect the rights of each individual.\n  As well, John Paul II has addressed almost every major question posed \nby the modern mind at the turn of the millennium.\n  As noted by the biographer of the Pope, George Weigel, the Pope has \nprovided answers to the questions and desires facing today's world: The \nhuman yearning for the sacred, the meaning of freedom, the quest for a \nnew world order, the nature of good and evil, the moral challenge of \nprosperity, and the imperative of human solidarity in the emerging \nglobal civilization. Through his teaching, the Pope has brought the \ntimeless principles of truth contained in the gospel into \nactive conversation with contemporary life and thought. The Pope has \nstarted a peaceful dialogue between ideas of the modern world and the \nage-old truths contained in the Gospel message.\n\n  One of the gospel messages emphasized by the Pope is the need for \nforgiveness and reconciliation with God, and with our sisters and \nbrothers. A week before his historic personal pilgrimage to the Holy \nLand the Pope asked forgiveness from God on behalf of Christians who \nwere inactive, or who were not active enough in opposing the forces of \nevil that have ravaged humanity during the past century.\n  This apology preceded his recent personal pilgrimage to the Holy \nLand; a pilgrimage in which the Pope opened up yet another dialog--this \ntime with the people of the Middle East--a region ripped apart by \ncenturies old conflict, bitterness, and war. Again, in the Holy Land, \nhe empathized with those who suffered under the tyranny of the Nazi \nregime. The Pope highlighted during his trip, and he has on other \noccasions, his deep compassion for those who suffered under the \nbrutality of Hitler's Germany and their genocidal war.\n  In the midst of the conflict in the Holy Land, the Pope again shone \nthrough as a beacon of light and peace as he proclaimed yet again to \nthe people of the Middle East and the World, the universal calls to \nholiness.\n  As the New York Times so eloquently noted after the Pope's visit to \nJerusalem's Yad Vashem:\n\n       John Paul has done more than any modern pope to end the \n     estrangement between Catholics and Jews. He was the first \n     pope to pray in a synagogue, the first to acknowledge the \n     failure of individual Catholics to deter the Holocaust and \n     the first to call anti-Semitism a sin ``against God and \n     man.''\n       There is a valedictory quality to the Pope's actions and \n     travels as the church approaches its third millennium. He \n     seems determined to trace the birth of Christianity in this \n     epochal year, to right the wrongs of the church and to bring \n     a spirit of conciliation to the Middle East. Not long ago he \n     went to Egypt and visited Mount Sinai, where Moses received \n     God's law. This week he stood atop Mount Nebo in Jordan and \n     looked across the Promised Land. He prayed in silence near \n     the places where Jesus was born and baptized. Most people as \n     infirm as John Paul would not dare make such strenuous trips. \n     But he seems to be a man on a mission, and the world is \n     better for it.\n\n  That was from the New York Times.\n  He is indeed a man on a mission. His message was peacefully conveyed \nin the Middle East to peoples with whom he has obvious deep religious \ndifferences. His serenity in the midst of such turmoil, as well as his \nobvious love for all people should be a model for us all as we \nencounter people in our daily life with whom we radically disagree, or \nwith whom we have had a difficult relationship.\n  His epoch journey to the Holy Land will be remembered by history. \nAnd, I have no doubt that his presence there will leave a lasting \nimpression, and I hope that it will work to bring about true peace as \nwell.\n  His trip to the Middle East is just one particular example. The \nPope's dialog with the modern era has taken him across the world, and \nhas brought the Church into active conversation with people that many \nin the modern world have chosen to either forget or to ignore. It is a \ndialog that is ultimately a challenge to the people of the United \nStates as well.\n  For example, his trip to Cuba initiated a dialog between politically \nopposed forces both here in America and in Cuba.\n  Also, Pope John Paul II's recent call to forgive the debt incurred by \nThird World countries during the past century, was and is, a challenge \nto the industrialized nations of the world to join hands in an effort \nto begin lifting the forgotten people of heavily indebted countries \ninto the next millennium by providing some of the economic relief that \nthey need. This is the challenge presented to those in industrialized \ncountries, to remember and to help those who are less fortunate.\n  The legislation I just introduced has been cosponsored by 66 of my \nSenate colleagues, and I am hopeful that we can pass this legislation \nquickly in order to honor so great a man who has done such great \nthings.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S.J. Res. 45. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to allow the States to limit the \nperiod of time United States Senators and Representatives may serve; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\namendment to constitution of the united states to allow states to limit \nthe period of time united states senators and representatives may serve\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a joint \nresolution proposing a constitutional amendment regarding Congressional \nterm limits and the ability of States to set term limits for members of \nthe United States Congress. Mr. President, I would like to summarize \nthe history of this proposed constitutional amendment.\n  On November 29, 1994, the Clinton administration argued before the \nSupreme Court of the United States that States should not have the \nright to limit congressional terms. Thus, the executive branch has \nspoken against the right of the states and of the people to limit the \nnumber of terms individuals may serve in the U.S. Congress.\n  On May 23rd, 1995, in U.S. Term Limits v. Thorton (514 U.S. 779), the \nSupreme Court denied the people the right to limit congressional terms. \nBefore the court ruling, 23 states, including my home state of \nMissouri, had some limit on the number of terms members of Congress \ncould serve.\n  In a 5-4 decision, the Court invalidated measures which represented \nover five years of work and were supported by 25 million voters. These \nvoters wanted nothing more than to rein in congressional power, restore \ncompetitive elections, and create a Congress that looked, and \nlegislated, like America.\n  Both the executive branch, through the Clinton administration, and \nthe judicial branch, have spoken against the right of States and of the \npeople to limit the terms of individuals who represent them in \nCongress.\n  There has been limited debate on terms limits in this Congress. In \n1995, the House of Representatives fell well short of the two-thirds \nmajority required to forward to the people a constitutional amendment \non term limits. Of the 290-vote margin required for a constitutional \namendment, they mustered only 227 votes. What would normally be a \nsignificant majority vote in the House, was clearly not enough to \nensure that States would have the opportunity to vote on a \nconstitutional amendment permitting term limits.\n  One hope for the overwhelming number of people in this country who \nendorse term limits is for Congress to extend them the opportunity to \namend the Constitution in a way that would allow individual States to \nlimit the terms members of Congress may serve. More than 3 out of 4 \npeople in the United States endorse the concept of term limits. They \nhave watched individuals come to Washington and spend time here, \ncaptivated by the Beltway logic, the spending habits and the power that \nexists in this city. The people of America know that the talent pool in \nAmerica is substantial and there are many who ought to have the \nopportunity to serve in Congress. Furthermore, they know that term \nlimits\n\n[[Page S2771]]\n\nwould ensure that individuals who go to Washington return someday to \nlive under the very laws that they enact.\n  In January of 1995, Senator Thompson and I introduced a \nconstitutional amendment that would have limited members of Congress to \nthree terms in the House and two terms in the Senate. As a result of \nits defeat and of the administration's refusal to recognize the will of \nthe people, in May of 1995, I introduced S.J. Res. 36, a different kind \nof constitutional amendment. This amendment simply would give States \nthe explicit right to limit congressional terms. It would not mandate \nthat any State limit the nature or extent of the terms of the \nindividuals who represent it in the Congress. Instead, it would give \nthe States, if they chose to do so, the right to limit the members' \nterms who represent that State. I am reintroducing that amendment \ntoday.\n  In the Thornton case, Justice Thomas wrote, ``Where the Constitution \nis silent it raises no bar to action by the States or the people.'' I \nbelieve he is correct. This is the concept embodied in the often \nforgotten Tenth Amendment that would not cede all power to the federal \ngovernment, only to have it doled back to us where the federal \ngovernment thinks it appropriate. This proposed amendment is offered to \nrectify that situation.\n  The people of this Republic should have the opportunity to limit the \nterms of those who serve them in Congress. In light of the fact that \nthe administration has argued against term limits, the executive branch \nis not going to support term limits, and because the judicial branch \nhas ruled conclusively now that the States have no constitutional \nauthority to act in this area, it is up to those of us in Congress to \ngive the people the opportunity to be heard on this issue.\n  We must, at least, give them the opportunity to vote on that right by \nsending to them this joint resolution on the right of States and \nindividuals to limit members' terms who serve the States and the \ndistricts of those States in the U.S. Congress.\n  It is a profoundly important expression of our confidence in the \npeople of this country to extend to them the right to be involved in \nmaking this judgment. I submit this joint resolution today in the hopes \nthat democracy will continue to flourish as people have greater \nopportunities to be involved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2771-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2771-S2772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 311\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. L.

(for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \nLieberman, and Mr. Feingold) submitted the following concurrent \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 104\n\n       Whereas on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Passover in \n     1999, 13 Jews, including community and religious leaders in \n     the cities of Shiraz and Isfahan, were arrested by the \n     authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran and accused of \n     spying for the United States and Israel;\n       Whereas no evidence has been brought forth to substantiate \n     these arrests, and no formal charges have been lodged after \n     more than a year of consideration;\n       Whereas the Secretary of State has identified the case of \n     the 13 Jews in Shiraz as ``one of the barometers of U.S.-Iran \n     relations'';\n       Whereas countless nations have expressed their concern for \n     these individuals and especially their human rights under the \n     rule of law;\n       Whereas Iran must show signs of respecting human rights as \n     a prerequisite for improving its relationship with the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas President Khatami was elected on a platform of \n     moderation and reform: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that the \n     Clinton Administration should--\n       (1) condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the arrest \n     and continued prosecution of the 13 Iranian Jews;\n       (2) demand that these fabricated charges be dropped \n     immediately and individuals released forthwith; and\n       (3) ensure that Iran's treatment of this case is a \n     benchmark for determining the nature of current and future \n     United States-Iran relations.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise on the eve of the trial of 13 \nIranian Jews charged with spying on behalf of the United States and \nIsrael to ask my colleagues to support a Concurrent\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\nResolution urging President Clinton to do everything possible to ensure \nthat the accused men receive a fair and open trial. As it stands right \nnow, the Revolutionary Court judge has made a mockery of any pretense \nthat the men will receive a fair hearing. Ten of the 13 have, for \nnearly a year, been denied their legal right to choose their own \nlawyers, and have only recently been appointed lawyers by the judge in \nthe case--just days before the trial was set to begin. Furthermore, the \ntrial is scheduled to be closed to any outside observers or media.\n  These facts do not bode well for the accused. However, I believe that \nstrong pressure from the United States will help convince the Iranian \ngovernment that should these men experience anything less than a fair \noutcome in this preposterous case, Teheran would face serious \nconsequences.\n  The 13 Iranian Jews, mostly community and religious leaders in the \ncities of Shiraz and Isfahan, were arrested one year ago by the Iranian \nauthorities and accused of spying. No evidence has been brought forth \nto substantiate the arrests. Indeed, how could it be? Jews in Iran are \nprohibited from holding any positions that would grant them access to \nstate secrets.\n  What I find most troubling is that the United States recently \npresented Iran with goodwill overtures, such as lifting restrictions on \nmany Iranian imports and easing travel restrictions between our two \ncountries, but we receive no assurances that these gestures would be \nreciprocated in any way. In fact, Iran has continued to display nothing \nbut hostility and contempt for the United States and everything for \nwhich we stand. At a minimum, Iran must show signs of respecting human \nrights as a prerequisite for our improving relations with them. In \nfact, Secretary of State Albright has identified the case of the 13 \nJews in Iran as ``one of the barometers of United States-Iran \nrelations.'' I urge the President to make perfectly clear to Iran that \nthe stakes in this trial are exceedingly high, and need to be taken \nvery seriously.\n  Now, much has been made of President Mohammad Khatami's popular \nreform movement, and there is significant optimism that a kinder, \ngentler Iran is slowly emerging for the darkness of a 20-year hardline \nclerical dictatorship. Indeed, Khatami has received a huge mandate from \nthe people of Iran over the past four years. However, Iran must fully \nunderstand that normalized relations with the United States is only a \npipedream if persecution such as that enacted upon the 13 Jews accused \nof spying goes unchallenged. If it does not, then what kind of reform \nmovement are we really witnessing?\n  Colleagues, I strongly urge you to join me in co-sponsoring this \nResolution to send a message to the President that he must use all his \nresources to convince President Khatami that a farcical trial leading \nto a pre-ordained outcome would send US-Iran relations back to ground \nzero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2773-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2773-S2774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 105--DESIGNATING APRIL 13, 2000, AS A DAY \n       OF REMEMBRANCE OF THE VICTIMS OF THE KATYN FOREST MASSACRE\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 105\n\n       Whereas 60 years ago, the Katyn Forest crime was committed, \n     resulting in the death of 21,000 Polish military officers of \n     all armed services, and justice and administration personnel;\n       Whereas, on the occasion of 60th anniversary of the Katyn \n     crime, the Lower Chamber of the Polish Parliament (Sejm) will \n     pay homage to all those murdered--the ``best sons of the \n     nation'', those who had not given in to Soviet ideology and \n     physical pressure, and remained loyal to the Republic of \n     Poland and the values they were taught to uphold;\n       Whereas Congress joins the Sejm in condemning all forms of \n     genocide, murder, deportation, and violation of human rights;\n       Whereas Congress joins the Sejm in its appreciation to all \n     scholars, researchers, and writers, especially those under \n     Soviet domination, who had the courage to tell the truth \n     about the Katyn crime;\n       Whereas Congress acknowledges with gratitude the Sejm's \n     recognition of the pioneering work of Congress and the House \n     of Representatives for the establishment in 1951 of a Select \n     Committee to conduct an investigation of the Katyn crime;\n       Whereas Congress is pleased to join the Sejm in thanking \n     those citizens of Russia who, guided by their sense of honor \n     and dignity, contributed to the disclosure of the basic Katyn \n     crime and the confirming, related documents; and\n       Whereas Congress continues to recognize the importance of \n     remembering the victims of communism as when it passed H.R. \n     3000 in 1993 calling for a Victims of Communism Memorial, and \n     commends the work of the Victims of Communism Memorial \n     Foundation in working toward this objective: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress joins the Polish Sejm in \n     designating April 13, 2000, as a day of remembrance to the \n     victims of the Katyn Massacre that occurred 60 years ago and \n     urges citizens of the United States to join their Polish \n     counterparts in learning about and understanding what \n     happened in the Katyn Forest.\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to submit a concurrent \nresolution commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Katyn Forest \nmassacre. For too long, Mr. President, too much of the world has been \nsilent concerning this horrible crime against humanity, committed by \nthe forces of communism. Through this resolution we may join with the \nPolish people in reminding the world of the horrors suffered by that \nnation's people at the hands of Soviet forces.\n  Now that the forces of Soviet communism have been defeated, Mr. \nPresident, it is too easy to forget those whose suffering has never \nbeen properly recognized. And few suffered as did the Poles. This proud \nnation, so often torn apart by opposing forces through the centuries, \nhad once again achieved independence after World War I. The infamous \nHitler/Stalin pact put an end to that independence, splitting the \nPolish nation in half, with each half being enslaved to a separate \ntotalitarian dictatorship.\n  The horrors visited upon the Polish people by Hitler's Nazi regime \nare well known, they are rightly commemorated in monuments and \ndeclarations. But the victims of Soviet communism in Poland have not \nhad their story told. For the sake of humanity and freedom around the \nglobe, that story must be told. This resolution is a beginning to that \nprocess. It is a first step in telling the world the full, awful truth \nof what was done to real people in the name of an abstract, unreal \nvision of Soviet humanity.\n  Sixty years ago, 21,000 Polish military officers, justice and \nadministration personnel were slaughtered in the Katyn Forest. Today \nthe Lower House of the Polish Parliament, the Sejm, is paying homage to \nthese murdered patriots. These ``best sons of the nation,'' as the Sejm \ncalls them, those who refused to give in to Soviet ideology and \nphysical intimidation, remained loyal to the Republic of Poland, and to \nthe values of freedom, faith and nation, to which that Republic was \ndedicated. They paid for their patriotism with their lives.\n  For too long, Mr. President, the awful story of this massacre has \nbeen kept from the light of day. As we pay tribute to the patriots \nslain in the Katyn Forest, it is only right that we pay tribute to the \nbrave citizens of the then-Soviet Union who risked their own lives and \nfreedom in helping disclose the events we mark today. We also should be \ngrateful to those who, after the fall of Soviet communism, have obeyed \ntheir own sense of honor in contributing to the confirmation and \ndocumentation of this crime.\n  Now the full story of the Katyn Forest can be told. It is my hope \nthat this story will be told throughout the United States, Europe and \nthe rest of the world as a reminder of the inhumanities perpetrated by \nthose enthralled to the ideology of communism. By telling this story, \nwe can help open the hearts and minds of people everywhere to the \ndangers of armed ideologies. The U.S. Congress itself has recognized \nthe importance of remembering the victims of communism. That is why, in \n1993, we passed a Resolution calling for a Victims of Communism \nMemorial and commending the work of the Victims of Communism Memorial \nFoundation for its work toward that objective.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that this resolution can serve to bring \nus closer to our brethren in Poland and to people around the world who \nlove freedom. The price paid by the Polish people for their liberty is \none for which all of us owe them a great debt of gratitude and\n\n[[Page S2774]]\n\nrespect. The blood of martyrs was spilled in the Katyn Forest. Martyrs \nto freedom and humanity. We have a duty, in my view, to pay tribute to \nthe sacrifice they made for us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2774-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 106--RECOGNIZING THE HERMANN MONUMENT AND \nHERMANN HEIGHTS PARK IN NEW ULM, MINNESOTA, AS A NATIONAL SYMBOL OF THE \n             CONTRIBUTIONS OF AMERICANS OF GERMAN HERITAGE\n\n  Mr. GRAMS (for himself and Mr. Wellstone) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 106\n\n       Whereas there are currently more than 57,900,000 \n     individuals of German heritage residing in the United States, \n     who comprise nearly 25 percent of the population of the \n     United States and are therefore the largest ethnic group in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas those of German heritage are not descendants of \n     only 1 political entity, but of all German-speaking areas;\n       Whereas Americans of German heritage have made countless \n     contributions to American culture, arts, and industry, the \n     American military, and American government;\n       Whereas there is no nationally recognized tangible symbol \n     dedicated to German Americans and their positive \n     contributions to the United States;\n       Whereas the story of Hermann the Cheruscan parallels that \n     of the American Founding Fathers, because he was a freedom \n     fighter who united ancient German tribes in order to shed the \n     yoke of Roman tyranny and preserve freedom for the territory \n     of present-day Germany;\n       Whereas the Hermann Monument located in Hermann Heights \n     Park in New Ulm, Minnesota, was dedicated in 1897 to honor \n     the spirit of freedom and was later dedicated to all German \n     immigrants who settled in New Ulm and elsewhere in the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas the Hermann Monument has been recognized as a site \n     of special historical significance by the United States \n     Government, by inclusion on the National Register of Historic \n     Places: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Hermann Monument and Hermann Heights \n     Park in New Ulm, Minnesota, is recognized by Congress as a \n     national symbol of the contributions of Americans of German \n     heritage.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to submit a \nconcurrent resolution designating Hermann Monument and Hermann Heights \nPark in New Ulm, Minnesota, as national symbols of the contributions of \nAmericans of German Heritage. I would like to thank Congressman David \nMinge and the other members of the Minnesota Congressional Delegation \nfor introducing a similar resolution in the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, I'd be surprised if anyone in this chamber has heard \nof Hermann Monument, but I would like to take a few minutes to explain \nits significance to the City of New Ulm, the State of Minnesota, and \nAmericans of German Heritage across the United States.\n  The Hermann Monument was erected in 1889 as a tribute to German \nimmigrants to the United States. It honors Hermann the Cheruscan, who \nforged the creation of a united Germany by defeating three Roman \nLegions who had occupied the area now known as Germany. Hermann remains \na symbol of German history, culture, dedication, and perseverance.\n  The Hermann Monument, made of copper sheeting riveted to a steel \ninterior frame, was dedicated in New Ulm, Minnesota, on September 25, \n1897. It stands 102 feet tall and is the second largest copper statue \nin the United States, behind only the Statue of Liberty. The Hermann \nmonument remains the only memorial in the United States dedicated to \nGerman heritage and the contributions to American culture, arts, \nindustry, and government.\n  I believe it's also important to note that there are now almost \n58,000,000 individuals of German heritage living in the United States, \ncomprising nearly 25 percent of our nation's population. That number \nmakes German-Americans the largest ethnic group in the United States. \nIn Minnesota, the number doubles to roughly 50 percent of Minnesotans \nbeing of German heritage.\n  Today, however, the Hermann Monument faces a serious threat from over \n100 years of rain, wind, heat, humidity, hail and other challenges that \nhave rendered the monument in need of restoration. Thankfully, the \npeople of New Ulm have formed the Hermann Monument Renovation Project \nto raise the roughly $1.75 million needed to restore the monument and \nconstruct an Interpretive Center at its base.\n  Mr. President, the legislation Senator Wellstone and I are \nintroducing provides no funding for the restoration of the Hermann \nMonument. In fact, the Resolution costs the Federal Government nothing. \nInstead, our Resolution simply recognizes the Hermann Monument as a \nnational symbol of the contributions of German Americans and gives the \nrestoration project a boost in the arm. Our Resolution is a way for \nevery member of the Senate to recognize the contributions of German \nAmericans across the country. It doesn't preclude another such \ndesignation in the United States nor does it designate the Hermann \nMonument as the only National symbol for German Americans.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me, Senator Wellstone, \nthe Minnesota Congressional Delegation, the Society of German-American \nStudies, the Steuben Society of America, the City of New Ulm, and the \npeople of Minnesota in supporting this Resolution recognizing the \ncontributions of German Americans and the national significance of New \nUlm's Hermann Monument.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2774-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2774-S2775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 107--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \n    CONCERNING SUPPORT FOR THE SIXTH NONPROLIFERATION TREATY REVIEW \n                               CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Roth, and Mr. \nBingaman) submitted the following concurrent resolution, which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Concurrent \nResolution expressing the sense of the Congress concerning support for \nthe Sixth Nonproliferation Treaty Review Conference.\n  The Sixth Nonproliferation Treaty Review Conference will begin on \nApril 24th in New York City. For the first time since the member \nparties agreed five years ago to a permanent extension to this \nimportant arms control agreement, states will be meeting to discuss \nadditional efforts to strengthen the treaty.\n  Thirty years ago, this treaty entered into force with 43 signatories. \nThe number of parties to the agreement has increased to 187. Only four \nstates--India, Pakistan, Israel, and Cuba--are not members.\n  At the time of the last review conference in 1995, members agreed to \nhold review meetings every five years to assess progress in \nimplementing efforts to attain the treaty's objectives.\n  The resolution that I am introducing today, along with Senators \nBaucus,\n\n[[Page S2775]]\n\nKerry, Roth and Bingaman, reaffirms Congressional support for the \nobjectives of the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and calls on all \nparties participating in the review conference to make a good faith \neffort to ensure the conference's success. A similar resolution is \nbeing introduced in the House of Representatives.\n  Many states have called into question American commitment to the \ncontrol of nuclear weapons because of the Senate vote last year on the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty and because of fears that the American \ndevelopment of a national missile and theater missile defense systems \nare efforts to negate the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM).\n  I believe that Congressional support for the NPT and for other \nworkable arms control agreements that achieve serious reductions in \nweapons of mass destruction is as strong as ever. The Congress will be \nlooking very closely at this conference for reassurance that the other \nparties to the NPT, most especially the other nuclear weapons states \nsuch as China and Russia, share an equal commitment to attaining the \nobjectives of the NPT.\n  There have been suggestions that states will attempt to disrupt the \nconference by walking out or by proposing resolutions critical of the \nUnited States and other states. Such efforts will damage the treaty and \ngive satisfaction only to those countries, such as Iraq and Iran, who \nstill appear to desire nuclear weapons.\n  Our resolution also expresses support for strengthening the \ninternational verification system operated by the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency (IAEA). When the NPT was negotiated in 1970, the IAEA \nsafeguards system was designated as its global verification mechanism. \nIAEA inspectors review the nuclear programs of all non-nuclear weapon \nmembers and, while the five legally recognized nuclear weapons states--\nBritain, France, China, Russia, United States--are not obligated to \npermit inspections, in practice IAEA has some access to their \nfacilities.\n  The Gulf War revealed inadequacies in the IAEA safeguard system. The \ndiscovery of Iraq's secret nuclear program demonstrated the need for \nadditional IAEA powers of information collection and inspection. \nEfforts are now underway to develop a Strengthened Safeguards system of \nwhich a critical part will be a new inspection protocol providing IAEA \ninspectors additional authority to collect more information about a \nwider range of activities.

Res. 291\n\n       Whereas the participation of the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration in the seizures of methamphetamine \n     laboratories has increased drastically since 1994;\n       Whereas in 1994, the Drug Enforcement Administration \n     participated in the seizure of only 306 clandestine \n     laboratories, 86 percent of which were methamphetamine \n     laboratories;\n       Whereas in 1999, a total of 6,325 methamphetamine and \n     amphetamine laboratories were seized in the United States, \n     and the Drug Enforcement Administration participated in 1,948 \n     of those seizures;\n       Whereas the Drug Enforcement Administration and State and \n     local law enforcement agencies spend millions of dollars \n     every year cleaning up the pollutants and toxins created and \n     left behind by operators of clandestine methamphetamine and \n     amphetamine laboratories;\n       Whereas methamphetamine manufacturing poses serious dangers \n     to human life and the environment;\n       Whereas the chemicals and substances used in \n     methamphetamine manufacturing are unstable, volatile, and \n     highly combustible, and the smallest amounts of such \n     chemicals, when mixed improperly, can cause explosions and \n     fire;\n       Whereas most clandestine methamphetamine and amphetamine \n     laboratories are situated in residences, motels, trailers, \n     and vans, thereby increasing the danger posed by such \n     explosions and fire;\n       Whereas for every pound of methamphetamine that is \n     produced, more than five pounds of toxic waste is produced \n     and left behind;\n       Whereas the Drug Enforcement Administration has been \n     assisting State and local law enforcement agencies in \n     cleaning up methamphetamine laboratory sites;\n       Whereas State and local agencies lack the financial \n     ability, equipment, and training to cleanup these sites, and \n     therefore rely predominately, if not entirely, on the Drug \n     Enforcement Administration to clean up methamphetamine \n     laboratories;\n       Whereas the funds appropriated to the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration for fiscal year 2000 for the cleanup of State \n     and local methamphetamine laboratories were exhausted in \n     March 2000, though the number of methamphetamine laboratories \n     has continued to increase dramatically;\n       Whereas the exhaustion of Drug Enforcement Administration \n     funds to assist State and local methamphetamine laboratory \n     cleanup efforts results in a great increase in the risk of \n     harm to State and local law enforcement officers, the public, \n     and the environment; and\n       Whereas it is imperative that sufficient funding be \n     provided to the Drug Enforcement Administration for \n     methamphetamine laboratory cleanup, and the Department of \n     Justice has suggested that $10,000,000 be reprogrammed in its \n     budget for this purpose: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that of the \n     funds appropriated or otherwise made available for the \n     Department of Justice for fiscal year 2000, $10,000,000 \n     should be reprogrammed for the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration in order to permit the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration to assist State and local efforts to clean up \n     methamphetamine laboratories in fiscal year 2000.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Grassley, \nHatch, Craig, Thomas, and Frist to submit a resolution which states \nthat it is the Sense of the Senate that $10 million should be \nimmediately reprogrammed within the United States Department of \nJustice's (DOJ) budget to allow the Drug Enforcement Administration \n(DEA) to support the cleanup of State and local methamphetamine \nlaboratories in Fiscal Year 2000. I do so with a sense of urgency as my \nhome State of Arkansas has suffered a terrible and great increase in \nthe production, distribution, and use of methamphetamine and is \ndesperately in need of federal assistance to bear the financial burden \ninherent in the cleanup of methamphetamine laboratories.\n  In March, Governor Huckabee informed me that the DEA had exhausted \nall of the funding available to cleanup State and local methamphetamine \nlabs and that the State of Arkansas was paying over $7,500 a day \ndespite the much-appreciated efforts undertaken by ENSCO, an El Dorado, \nArkansas company, to dispose of methamphetamine labs at no cost to the \nState. As the costs associated with the cleanup of a single lab range \nanywhere from $3,000 to $100,000 and average about $5,000 and, with \nover 200 labs seized to date, Arkansas will seize over 800 labs this \nyear, it is imperative that funding be provided to the DEA so that it \nmay continue to assist in State and local methamphetamine lab cleanups.\n  On March 28, 2000, Senators Grassley, Kyl, Craig, Ashcroft, and I \nasked United States Attorney General Reno to identify $10 million in \nfunding within the DOJ's budget which could be reprogrammed to provide \nthe DEA with the monies necessary for it to administer the cleanup of \nlabs seized by State and local law enforcement agencies. I was greatly \nencouraged and highly appreciative when she quickly responded by \nrequesting that $10 million in Community Orientated Policing Service \n(COPS) recovery funds be reprogrammed. Despite an April 3, 2000, letter \nfrom Senators Inhofe, Craig, Thomas, Thompson, Frist, Ashcroft, Hatch, \nEnzi, and I supporting this request, the Office of Management and \nBudget (OMB) has informed me that a determination has not been made. \nWhile I appreciate the fact that Director Lew and the OMB continue to \nlook for this critical funding, I ask them to put aside politics and \nact quickly to meet this need.\n\n[[Page S2776]]\n\n  This Resolution is intended to make it clear to this Administration \nthat the United States Congress is serious about solving this problem. \nI implore the President to take a firm stand against methamphetamine \nand establish an effective policy to address this exponentially \nincreasing problem. I am firmly convinced that we can solve this \nproblem with Congressional support and Presidential leadership. \nAccordingly, I ask my colleagues to take the first step toward a \nsolution by joining me in supporting this Resolution.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Hutchinson in sponsoring this resolution. We have been working \nclosely together to find a solution to this growing problem. \nUnfortunately it seems the White House fails to grasp the urgency.\n  Mr. President, the DEA, who has for several years reimbursed state \nand local law enforcement agencies for the costs they have incurred in \ncleaning up drug laboratories, has run out of clean-up money. This has \nhappened at a time when the number of these labs are growing rapidly, \nand springing up in towns and counties where there has never been a \nproblem in the past. Iowa alone has a stack of over $83,000 in \noutstanding lab cleanup bills, and this amount continues to grow. Last \nyear, Iowa received over $1.3 million in reimbursement, and at the \ncurrent pace this total is expected to be higher this year.\n  Four weeks ago, Mr. President, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Kyl, and I wrote \nthe appropriations committee to alert them to this problem. Our offices \nwere aware of this impending problem, and wanted to insure that no one \nwas taken by surprise so there could be a quick resolution. Two weeks \nago, we were joined by Mr. Craig and Mr. Ashcroft in a letter to the \nAttorney General, encouraging her to work with the Appropriators in \nreprogramming funds to cover this shortfall.\n  I am pleased to say that within days we had been informed that a \nreprogramming request had been sent to the White House Budget Office \nfor their approval. The request would allow for the use of returned \nCOPS funds--money that was not going to be spent otherwise--to be used \nto clean up these environmental hazzards. I want to emphasize that this \nsource was identified by the Justice Department, not by Congress. And I \nwant to applaud their swift action to solve the problem, and not play \npolitics.\n  But then, OMB happened. It did nothing. The problem mounts, and OMB \nsits. That is why Senator Hutchinson and I are offering this Sense of \nthe Senate. We hope to encourage timely action--not more sitting on \nbureaucratic thumbs. I urge my colleagues to join us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2776-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 292--RECOGNIZING THE 20TH CENTURY AS THE ``CENTURY OF \n                      WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES''\n\n  Mr. CLELAND (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Bond, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nBryan, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. \nLincoln, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Robb, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. \nDurbin) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 292\n\n       Whereas women made unparalleled strides during the 20th \n     century in education, professions, legal rights, politics, \n     military service, religion, sports, and self-reliance;\n       Whereas at the dawn of the 20th century, most women in the \n     United States were denied the right to vote;\n       Whereas the Women's Suffrage movement, the largest \n     grassroots political movement in the Nation's history, \n     involved about 2,000,000 women and took more than 70 years of \n     petitions, referenda, speeches, national and State campaigns, \n     demonstrations, arrests, and hunger strikes;\n       Whereas women won the right to vote throughout the United \n     States with the ratification of the 19th amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States in 1920, and by the end of \n     the century, women were voting in larger numbers than men in \n     some national elections;\n       Whereas women represent an increasing share of people being \n     awarded college and postgraduate degrees;\n       Whereas women are increasingly owning their own businesses \n     and working to narrow the gap in earnings between women and \n     men, and in 1999 women earned 73 cents for every dollar \n     earned by men in contrast to the 57 cents they received in \n     1973;\n       Whereas during the 20th century, women served their country \n     proudly and capably in the armed services, including duty in \n     both World Wars, Korea, Vietnam, Panama, Libya, the Persian \n     Gulf, Bosnia, Kosovo, and all major contingencies including \n     in warfighting roles;\n       Whereas in World War I, women were only allowed to serve in \n     the Army as nurses, and with over 30,000 women serving in \n     World War I, approximately 10,000 women served as volunteers \n     overseas, with no rank and no benefits;\n       Whereas women now serve in all ranks, in all branches of \n     the armed services, as pilots, intelligence specialists, \n     drill instructors, specialists, and technicians, soldiers, \n     airmen, and marines on the battlefields, and as sailors \n     aboard Navy and Coast Guard ships at sea;\n       Whereas women were once denied the right to enter the \n     national academies for military service or to compete to \n     become astronauts or combat pilots, in 1976 Congress passed, \n     and President Ford signed into law, legislation authorizing \n     the admission of women into the military service academies;\n       Whereas women are now excelling in military academies and \n     emerging as part of the military leadership of the future, \n     and have served with distinction as members of combat \n     squadrons and as commanders and members of the space shuttle \n     crew;\n       Whereas the 20th century saw women in new roles as justices \n     on the United States Supreme Court, members of the \n     President's Executive Cabinet, United States Senators and \n     Representatives, and women's services have become invaluable \n     in appointed and volunteer positions and as Federal \n     legislators, State and local legislators, Governors, judges, \n     Cabinet officers, county commissioners, mayors, city council \n     members, directors of Federal, State and local agencies;\n       Whereas women have become prominent figures in amateur and \n     professional sports highlighted in 1999 with the United \n     States Women's Soccer Team winning the World Cup in a \n     stunning victory; and\n       Whereas women can look back at the opportunities created \n     during the 20th century and look ahead toward even greater \n     accomplishments in the 21st century: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the accomplishments and unfailing spirit of \n     women in the 20th century; and\n       (2) recognizes the 20th century as the ``Century of Women \n     in the United States''.\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a \nresolution recognizing the 20th century as the ``Century of Women in \nthe United States.'' I would like to thank Georgia State Representative \nHinson Mosley for introducing a similar resolution in the Georgia \nGeneral Assembly recognizing the tremendous accomplishments of women in \nGeorgia and in the United States during the 20th century and for \nsharing his resolution with me. Representative Mosley's exceptional \nresolution passed the Georgia House of Representatives by a vote of \n120-0 and the Georgia Senate on a vote of 51 to 0.\n  Like Representative Mosley's resolution, my proposal recognizes that \nas we enter the 21st century, it is essential that we note the vast \nopportunities available to today's women that were not available to \nwomen entering the 20th century. Women made unprecedented strides in \ncivil rights, careers, religion, education and military service. \nAlthough we must keep in mind the challenges that women in our society \ncontinue to face and the work that women and men must yet accomplish, \nlet us celebrate the victories won by women in the past 100 years.\n  I, along with Senators Boxer, Bond, Baucus, Bryan, Durbin, Landrieu, \nMikulski, Murray, Lincoln, Kerry, Jeffords, Feinstein, Robb and Cochran \nurge my colleagues to support this resolution and recognize the 20th \ncentury as the ``Century of Women in the United States.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2776-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2776-S2777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 293--ENCOURAGING ALL RESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES \nTO COMPLETE THEIR CENSUS FORMS TO ENSURE THE MOST ACCURATE ENUMERATION \n                       OF THE POPULATION POSSIBLE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Bryan, Mr. \nTorricelli, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \nGraham, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Reid, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Schumer, \nMr. Akaka, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Kohl, \nMrs. Feinstein, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Robb, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. Reed, and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs:\n\n[[Page S2777]]\n\n                              S. Res. 293\n\n       Whereas the Constitution requires an actual enumeration of \n     the population every 10 years;\n       Whereas Federal, State, and local governments, as well as \n     charities and other groups serving Americans, use information \n     gathered by the census to distribute hundreds of billions of \n     dollars for programs from education to employment, housing to \n     transportation, and rural development to urban empowerment;\n       Whereas inaccurate or incomplete census data would make it \n     impossible for this aid to be distributed appropriately or \n     fairly and would prevent critically needed funding from \n     finding its way to the appropriate recipients;\n       Whereas inaccurate or incomplete census data would also \n     throw into doubt the ability to correctly apportion \n     representation in Congress or equitably redraw voting \n     district lines within the States, raising questions about \n     whether the one-person-one-vote rights of Americans are being \n     appropriately guarded;\n       Whereas the privacy of all data collected by the Bureau of \n     the Census is guaranteed absolute confidentiality for 72 \n     years from the public and all other government agencies; and\n       Whereas the Bureau of the Census cannot conduct its \n     constitutional or legal duties and Americans cannot be \n     assured of the integrity of the census results, and therefore \n     the equity of all of the manifold decisions that rely upon \n     census numbers, without the fullest possible participation \n     from the public: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) it is the civic duty of Americans to assist in ensuring \n     the most accurate census possible; and\n       (2) all residents of the United States should complete \n     their census forms.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today Senator Lieberman and I, along with \na group of our colleagues, are introducing a resolution emphasizing to \nall Americans the importance of accurately and completely filling out \ntheir census forms. It is my hope that all members of the Senate will \ncosponsor this important resolution to support the Census Bureau as it \ncarries out the role that the Constitution and Congress have directed \nit to take.\n  I continue to be concerned with the statements of some elected \nofficials urging Americans not to respond to some of the questions on \ntheir census forms. These statements are reckless and irresponsible.\n  First, every question on the census form is required by the \nConstitution or by law. All of these questions were reviewed by \nCongress before the census began, and received virtually no comment at \nthat time. Second, an accurate census is absolutely critical to meet \nthe needs of the public. Local, state and federal aid programs all \ndepend upon an accurate census count to properly distribute funding for \nroads, schools and health care. Disaster response agencies like the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency use census data to prepare for and \nrespond to hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters. Finally, \naccurate information about population is absolutely essential to fairly \ndistribute congressional seats to ensure that all Americans have equal \nrepresentation in Congress.\n  Any effort to encourage Americans not to complete their census \nquestionnaire will only hinder our ability to allow every community to \nlive up to its potential, and provide its citizens with the roads, \nhospitals and schools they need.\n  As you know, last week the Senate approved an amendment stating that \nno American should be prosecuted for failing to fill out his or her \ncensus form. This resolution was distracting and unnecessary. No \nAmerican is--or for years has been--prosecuted for failing to complete \na census form.\n  The Census Bureau needs to know that it has the full support of the \nCongress as it carries out its vital task. This resolution makes clear \njust how important the bureau's task is, and the need for every \nAmerican to comply with the law and complete the census form. I urge \nall my colleagues to give it their support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2777-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2777-S2785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      CRIME VICTIMS ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 LEAHY (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3097\n\n  (Referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.)\n  Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \nHarkin, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Robb) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill (S. 934) to enhance rights \nand protections for victims of crime; as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

Mr. President, this week marks the 20th anniversary of our \nobservance of National Crime Victims' Rights Week. This is a week that \nwe set aside each year to honor and commemorate the victims of crime \nand those who serve them. It is appropriate to take this time to \ndiscuss the unmet needs of victims in our Nation's criminal justice \nsystem.\n  Tremendous strides have been made in these past 20 years toward \nensuring better and more comprehensive rights and services for victims \nof crime. Today, there are over 30,000 laws nationwide that define and \nprotect victims' rights, as well as over 10,000 national, State, and \nlocal organizations that provide assistance to people who have been \nhurt by crime. This is substantial progress, but there is still more to \nbe done.\n  My involvement with crime victims' rights began more than three \ndecades ago when I served as State's Attorney for Chittenden County, \nVermont, and witnessed first-hand the devastation of crime. I have \nworked ever since to ensure that the criminal justice system is one \nthat respects the rights and dignity of victims of crime and domestic \nviolence, rather than one that presents additional ordeals for those \nalready victimized.\n  I am proud that Congress has been a significant part of the solution \nto provide victims with greater rights and assistance. During the last \ntwo decades, Congress has passed several bills to this end. These bills \nhave included:\n  The Victims and Witness Protection Act of 1982;\n  The Victims of Crime Act of 1984;\n  The Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990;\n  The Violence Against Women Act of 1994;\n  The Mandatory Victims' Restitution Act of 1996;\n  The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 1996;\n  The Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997;\n  The Crime Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act of 1998; and\n  The Torture Victims Relief Act of 1998.\n  It is because of my continuing commitment to protecting the rights of \nvictims that I joined with Senator Kennedy to introduce the Crime \nVictims Assistance Act, S. 934, and its predecessor in the 105th \nCongress. This legislation offers full-scale reform of Federal rules \nand Federal law to establish stronger rights and protections for \nvictims of Federal crime. This legislation further proposes to assist \nvictims of State crime through the infusion of additional resources to \nmake the criminal justice system more supporting of crime victims. In \naddition, this legislation would improve the capacity of the Office for \nVictims of Crime to provide more immediate and effective assistance to \nAmericans who are victims of terrorism abroad.\n  The Crime Victims Assistance Act would improve the lot of victims \nthroughout the country. Unfortunately, it appears that in this \nCongress, as in the last, we will not take the simple and important \nstep of enacting this legislation. Instead, the Judiciary Committee has \nfocused on proposals to amend the United States Constitution. Such \naction is ill-advised and a constitutional amendment is unnecessary. I \nregret that for the last several years the pace of crime victim \nlegislation has slowed dramatically. I have grave reservations about \nproceeding first to amend the Constitution and only then to design and \nenact the legislation that could help crime victims. To help victims we \nmust act on legislation like the Crime Victims Assistance Act and we \nshould be doing so without further delay.\n  While the Crime Victims Assistance Act is central to a package of \nvictim assistance legislation, it does not stand alone. There is so \nmuch that we could be doing to help victims, none of which requires an \namendment to the Constitution. If we truly want to help victims we \nshould, for example, re-authorize the Violence Against Women Act. A \nbill to reauthorize those programs has been pending without action for \ntoo long. It contains over $3.7 billion dollars in funding over five \nyears, funding that primarily goes to State and local programs that \ndesperately need assistance.\n  Just yesterday, the Office of Justice Programs announced that Women \nHelping Battered Women in Burlington, Vermont, will be receiving \n$249,043 under the Rural Domestic Violence and Child Victimization \nEnforcement Program--a VAWA program that I initiated. Earlier this \nmonth, the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services received an award \nof $799,534 under the same program. This program, and other VAWA \nprograms, meet the true and immediate needs of victims in every State. \nBy contrast, the proposed constitutional amendment is a political \ngimmick, which promises much but fails to define real rights or provide \nreal remedies or assistance.\n  We must also do more for victims of hate crimes by passing the Hate \nCrimes Prevention Act. This legislation amends the Federal hate crimes \nstatute to make it easier for federal law enforcement officials to \ninvestigate and prosecute cases of racial and religious violence. It \nalso focuses the attention and resources of the Federal Government on \nthe problem of hate crimes committed against people because of their \nsexual orientation, gender, or disability. The Senate approved this \nlegislation last summer as part of the Commerce-Justice-State \nappropriations bill, but it was dropped before final passage. We should \npass it now, without further delay.\n  With a simple majority of both Houses of Congress we can pass the \nCrime Victims Assistance Act, which should have been enacted three \nyears ago; we can re-authorize the Violence Against Women Act; we can \npass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. These laws can make a difference \ntoday in\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\nthe lives of crime victims throughout the country. There would be no \nneed to achieve super-majorities in both Houses of Congress, no need to \nawait ratification efforts among the States and no need to go through \nthe ensuing process of enacting implementing legislation.\n  I regret that we did not do more for victims last year or the year \nbefore. Over the course of that time, I have noted my concern that we \nnot dissipate the progress we could be making by focusing exclusively \non efforts to amend the Constitution. Regretfully, I must note that the \npace of victims legislation has slowed noticeably and many \nopportunities for progress have been squandered.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with the Administration, victims \ngroups, prosecutors, judges and other interested parties on how we can \nmost effectively enhance the rights of victims of crime. Congress and \nState legislatures have become more sensitive to crime victims rights \nover the past 20 years and we have a golden opportunity to make \nadditional, significant progress this year to provide the greater voice \nand rights that crime victims deserve.\n  I want to take this opportunity to commend all those who work so hard \nevery day to assist victims of crime and to prevent others from \nbecoming victims of crime. That is something I try to do every year \nand, in particular, during Crime Victims Rights Week. In preparing to \ndo so again this year I was disappointed to see that no other Senator \nhas yet recognized Crime Victims Rights week.\n  On behalf of Senators Kennedy, Sarbanes, Kerry, Harkin, Murray, \nFeingold, and Robb, I am today filing a substitute amendment to our \nbill. In spite of the Judiciary Committee's lack of attention to these \nmatters, we have continued to work on them, think about them and to \nimprove the bill. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the substitute \namendment and a section-by-section summary be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support greater recognition of the \nrights of victims of crime. Clearly, they deserve enforceable rights \nthat are guaranteed by law. But, just as clearly, these rights can be \nachieved without amending the Constitution. The Constitution is the \nfoundation of our democracy, and it reflects the enduring principles of \nour country. The framers deliberately made it difficult to amend \nbecause it was never intended to be used for normal legislative \npurposes.\n  We have a responsibility to assure victims of crime that their rights \nin the criminal justice system will not be ignored. That is why my \ncolleagues and I are re-introducing the Crime Victims Assistance Act.\n  Our bill clearly defines the rights of victims, and it establishes an \neffective means to implement and enforce these rights. It does so \nwithout taking the drastic and unnecessary step of amending the \nConstitution. Acting through legislation allows us to act quickly to \ngive victims the rights to which they are entitled. It also allows us \nto react quickly to changing circumstances. By contrast, the proponents \nof a constitutional amendment are asking victims to wait, possibly for \nyears, before any of the provisions in the amendment are adopted, much \nless implemented.\n  Our bill provides enhanced protections to victims of federal crimes. \nIt assures victims a greater voice in the prosecution of the criminals \nwho injured them and their families. It gives victims the right to be \nnotified and heard on detention and plea agreements, the right to be \nnotified and heard at probation revocation hearings, the right to be \nnotified of the escape or release of a criminal from prison, and the \nright to a speedy trial and prompt disposition, free from unreasonable \ndelay. In addition, our bill enhances victims' rights to obtain \nrestitution, to be notified and heard at sentencing, and to be present \nat trial.\n  The rights established by our bill will fill the existing gaps in \nfederal criminal law and will be a major step toward ensuring that \nvictims of crime receive appropriate and sensitive treatment. Our bill \nwill achieve these goals in a way that does not interfere with the \nefforts of the States to protect victims in ways appropriate to each \nState's unique needs.\n  Our bill also contains measures to ensure that victims receive the \ncounseling, information, and assistance they need in order to \nparticipate in the criminal justice process to the maximum extent \npossible. It creates and funds additional federal victim assistance \npersonnel. It authorizes the use of funds to establish effective pilot \nprograms. It provides funds for increased training of state and local \nlaw enforcement agencies and court personnel, to enable them to respond \neffectively to the needs of victims and to notify them of important \ndates and developments. Our bill also establishes ombudsman programs to \nensure that victims are given unbiased information about navigating the \ncriminal justice process. To make all of these improvements possible, \nthe proposed statute also improves federal financial support for victim \nassistance and compensation.\n  There is no need to amend the constitution to achieve these important \ngoals. In my view, when it is not necessary to amend the constitution \nto achieve a particular goal, it is necessary not to amend it. That is \nwhy I ask my colleagues to establish effective and enforceable rights \nfor victims of crime by supporting the Crime Victims Assistance Act.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I was pleased to join Senators Leahy and \nKennedy as a sponsor of the Crime Victims Assistance Act, and I endorse \nthis modified version of the bill. This is an important bill designed \nto give substantial, enforceable rights to the victims of federal \ncrimes to participate fully in the various criminal justice proceedings \narising out of their cases.\n  I understand that the sponsors of the constitutional amendment \nconcerning the rights of victims of crime, often referred to as the \nVictims' Rights Amendment or VRA, will bring the amendment to the \nSenate floor in the near future. I have the utmost concern for the \nvictims of crime, and I want to see them supported as much as possible \nin the law as they deal with the consequences of the crime committed \nagainst them. But I oppose the amendment.\n  The main reason for my opposition is that I do not think it is \nnecessary to amend our great governing document, the Constitution of \nthe United States, to provide the protection that victims of crime seek \nand deserve. We have a responsibility to deal with these issues through \nlegislation before turning to the constitutional amendment process. \nThat process is long and uncertain and its results are much less easier \nto fix than a statute if we have left something undone that should have \nbeen done.\n  The statutory alternative developed by Senators Leahy and Kennedy, \nwhich I expect will be offered as an amendment to the VRA when it comes \nto the floor, will truly serve the interests of victims in a much more \ndirect and effective way than would a constitutional amendment. And we \ncan enact it this year, getting relief and protections to victims of \ncrime immediately that will not be available to them until some \nuncertain date under the constitutional amendment.\n  So I am pleased to join in this effort, and I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to try to convince the Senate that this is the best \nway to support the interests of victims of violent crime.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           JOHN H.

Mr. President, I make note tonight of a very \nsignificant event which occurred today in the Capitol. We were able to \npass legislation\n\n[[Page S2786]]\n\nfrom the Foreign Relations Committee, under the leadership of the \nchairman of that committee, Chairman Jesse Helms, The Hague Convention \non International Adoption.\n  The reason I mention it particularly tonight is that we will be \ntaking up this implementation legislation when we return--hopefully, \nsoon after we return. Then we will be considering a very important \ntreaty under the same title.\n  There are many hundreds of leaders in Washington today from the Joint \nCouncil on International Children's Services and with the National \nCouncil for Adoption who have worked literally for years to bring us to \nthis point.\n  I also commend our partners in the House, Congressman Delahunt from \nMassachusetts, Congressman Burr, and Congressman Gejdenson from \nConnecticut who worked very hard on this who were terrific leaders.\n  Sixty-six countries participated in this ground-breaking document. \nThere were 37 signatories, and to date 29 countries have ratified. I \nparticularly mention Mexico and Romania as two of the earliest \ncountries.\n  Since the United States receives more children in this country \nthrough adoption than all other countries combined, and since we pride \nourselves on being a leader in this particular area, I think it is very \nsignificant that we step forward, pass this legislation, and ratify \nthis treaty.\n  In closing, let me say it is so significant because many Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle have worked for so many years to promote \nadoption in a very positive way to say basically that every child \ndeserves a home. If their biological family is split apart or broken up \nby death, or disease, or tragedy, neglect, or abuse, it is our \nresponsibility as a society to make sure those children are cared for \npermanently by someone who is capable of nurturing and loving.\n\n  The significance of this treaty is that now we express, in an \ninternational way, that that child should then go to their family and \nthen to the community at large, but if no place can be found, surely \nthere is a home somewhere on this planet for these children. There are \nmany orphans and there are many children in limbo caught within systems \nin the United States and elsewhere.\n  I thank my colleagues and I thank Senator Helms for his great \nleadership. I look forward to taking up this issue when we return \nbecause there was great committee work done and a lot of work for many \nyears was put into this. I am convinced that millions of children now \nall over the world will be able to find a home and families will be \nable to find children once this legislation is implemented and carried \nout.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much. I thank my colleague from West \nVirginia for allowing me to speak for a few minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2786-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MAJORITY LEADER, TRENT LOTT\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I have a very brief colloquy with the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont from the Committee on Labor, Health, \nEducation and Pensions. It had been anticipated there would be a \nunanimous consent request to move forward on legislation on organ \ntransplants which came out of the Labor Committee yesterday on a \nunanimous vote. I had been deeply involved in that matter when the \nissue came before the conference on the appropriations bill for Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education. We had crafted, after a great \ndeal of controversy, a resolution where the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services came especially to an evening session and we worked out \nwhat I thought were the final details on the settlement.\n  But as I think George Shultz said, nothing is ever settled in \nWashington and the matter has seen a new birth. The issue came before \nthe Labor Committee and they have crafted a new proposal. I had \nintended to object. It now appears that others will object and the \nmatter will not come forward.\n  I thought it useful to have a colloquy with Senator Jeffords where I \nwould not raise an objection on his assurance that out of the \nconference the bill of the Labor Committee would not be watered down \nany more. That is a minimal consideration for fairness in organ \ntransplants. In my judgment, no bill would be better than any bill \nwhich is less than the one which is out of committee.\n  My own personal view is that the compromise crafted in my \nsubcommittee on appropriations on that bill is a superior approach, but \nI did see the wave moving toward what happened in the Labor Committee \nyesterday. Therefore, I will not raise an objection on the assurance \nfrom the chairman that that bill will not be reduced, modified, or \nweakened in any way in conference.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator for his statement. We had an \nincredibly good breakthrough in negotiations, which is why I can \nreassure the Senator of my belief that we don't have to worry about it \nbeing changed, with the administration about 3 o'clock the morning \nbefore last, after long negotiations, and we came to a resolution which \nat least I know my critics in Vermont and everyone I know has agreed is \na wonderful resolution of the problem. I am hopeful we will also be \nable to get the holds from the other side of the aisle removed \nexpeditiously so this can be passed.\n\n  I thank the Senator because he was a leader in this field, and the \nbill he brought out of the appropriations process was certainly one \nwhich was taken into consideration and utilized in the final \nresolution.\n  With Senator Kennedy and Senator Frist agreeing to it, with the \nadministration, I think we have, for the first time, a real hope this \nvery difficult area of organ transplants and how they will be utilized \nmay have a permanent solution--at least a solution for a foreseeable \nlength of time. A lot of it is due to the efforts of the Senator, and I \nappreciate it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Vermont for that statement. I \nwant to be sure I have his commitment he will not bring back a \nconference report to this floor which would water down in any way the \nbill which came out of his committee yesterday.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I give the Senator those assurances.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my friend from Vermont, and I thank my colleague \nfrom West Virginia, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2786-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2786-S2787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE LAST BUDGET RESOLUTION MANAGED BY SENATOR LAUTENBERG\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the conference report on the budget \nresolution for fiscal year 2001 has been adopted. I note that this will \nbe the last budget resolution to be managed by my good friend from New \nJersey, Senator Lautenberg. Senator Lautenberg joined the Budget \nCommittee in 1985, 2 years after he was first elected to the Senate. \nSince that time, he has become an expert on the Federal budget process. \nHe has worked hard. He has been diligent in his business.\n  The Bible says:\n\n       Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand \n     before kings.\n\n  Frank Lautenberg has been diligent in his business. His mastery of \nFederal budget matters was aided, to a great degree, by his earlier \nmastery of business matters in the private sector. Frank Lautenberg was \none of the founding partners of a company called Automatic Data \nProcessing. That company now employs 37,000 employees and has a market \ncapitalization in excess of $31 billion. Just prior to being elected to \nthe Senate, Frank Lautenberg served as both chairman and chief \nexecutive officer of that company. As a\n\n[[Page S2787]]\n\nbusinessman, he developed an uncanny ability to perform mathematical \ncalculations in his mind. As such, his staff on the Budget Committee is \nusually playing catchup, as Senator Lautenberg restates budgetary \nissues in percentage terms.\n  The people of New Jersey, and, indeed, the people of the United \nStates, have benefited greatly from the business expertise that Frank \nLautenberg has brought to the U.S. Senate and especially to his \nassignment as the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee. Frank \nLautenberg rose to the position of ranking member in 1997, following \nthe retirement of Senator James Exon of Nebraska. Throughout Senator \nLautenberg's service on the Budget Committee, he has been an \nextraordinarily able and outspoken advocate of funding for our Nation's \nchildren, for the environment, and for transportation.\n\n  In addition to serving on the Senate Budget Committee, Senator \nLautenberg also serves on the Appropriations Committee, where he is \nranking member of the very important Subcommittee on Transportation on \nwhich I serve. In that regard, Senator Lautenberg is eminently well \nversed in both the budget and appropriations processes.\n  So I commend Senator Lautenberg for his very able service to the \nSenate and to the Nation in his capacity as ranking member of the \nSenate Budget Committee. We will miss not only his contributions but \nalso his good humor in future budget debates.\n  Mr. President:\n\n       It isn't enough to say in our hearts\n       That we like a man for his ways;\n       It isn't enough that we fill our minds\n       With psalms of silent praise;\n       Nor is it enough that we honor a man\n       As our confidence upward mounts;\n       It's going right up to the man himself\n       And telling him so that counts.\n\n       If a man does a work that you really admire,\n       Don't leave a kind word unsaid.\n       In fear to do so might make him vain\n       And cause him to lose his head.\n       But reach out your hand and tell him, ``Well done.''\n       And see how his gratitude swells.\n       It isn't the flowers we strew on the grave,\n       It's the word to the living that tells.\n\n  So I say to Frank Lautenberg: Well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2787-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2787-S2788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EASTER--A TIME OF REBIRTH\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, when many people contemplate Easter, \nthoughts of chocolate bunnies, Easter egg hunts, and family gatherings \ncome to mind. Little girls dream of a new frilly lace-bedecked frock, \nshiny new patent leather shoes, and a festive bonnet adorned with \nribbons and flowers to top it all off. It is hard not to feel an \nexcitement in the air as the daylight hours increase, the winter coats \nare put away, and the sweet smell of the season's first roses fill the \nair. The landscape is freshly decorated with a pallet of azaleas, \ntulips, jonquils, and pink and white flowers of the dogwood. Overnight, \nit seems, the silhouettes of the tree branches disappear, replaced by \nthe first green buds of spring. Neighbors, who seemed almost strangers \nduring the long dark winter, suddenly greet you from their front \nporches, and passersby out for an afternoon stroll stop to offer that \nmuch-needed gardening advice, or they admire your latest planting. The \nfirst aroma of charcoal fills the air as grills are fired up after a \nlong rest. Children play outside after dinner, trying to squeeze in \nevery bit of the daylight into their playtime. Everything seems new, \neverything seems exciting, everything seems reborn. But during this \nseason of rebirth, how many stop to ponder the true meaning of this \nmost holiest of seasons of the Christian calendar?\n  Easter, Jesus' resurrection from the dead, was the key belief of the \nearliest Christians. In fact, that truly miraculous event has made an \nimprint on other religions and inspired to thought and deed individuals \nwho do not practice the Christian faith. Mohandas K. Gandhi said simply \nand eloquently:\n\n       Jesus, a man who was completely innocent, offered himself \n     as a sacrifice for the good of others, including his enemies, \n     and became the ransom of the world. It was a perfect act.\n\n  The Bible says a great deal about Easter, that central mystery of the \nChristian faith. That Jesus was crucified and miraculously raised from \nthe dead is hard for many to accept. It was hard for the early \nChristians to comprehend also, but the faith in the risen Christ spread \nlike a wildfire on a dry and windy summer day!\n  Easter arrives late this year, on April 23, almost as late as it can \npossibly be. It is celebrated on a Sunday on varying dates between \nMarch 22 and April 25, and is, therefore, called a movable feast. \nEaster embodies many pre-Christian traditions. The origin of its name \nis unknown; however, many scholars have accepted the derivation \nproposed by the 8th-century English scholar St. Bede--that it probably \ncomes from Eastre, the Anglo-Saxon name of a Teutonic goddess of spring \nand fertility, whose festival was celebrated on the day of the vernal \nequinox. The Easter rabbit, a symbol of fertility, and colored Easter \neggs, originally painted with bright colors to represent the sunlight \nof spring, and used in egg-rolling contests, are traditions that have \nsurvived. According to the New Testament, Christ was crucified on the \neve of Passover and soon rose from the dead. The Easter festival \ncommemorated Christ's resurrection. Over time, there were serious \ndifferences between the early Christians over the date of the Easter \nfestival. Those of Jewish origin celebrated Easter immediately after \nPassover, which fell on the evening of the full moon. Therefore, \nEaster, from year to year, fell on different days of the week. \nChristians of Gentile origin, on the other hand, wished to commemorate \nthe resurrection on Sunday, the first day of the week. It was on the \nsame day of the week each year, but fell on different dates from year \nto year. In 325 A.D. Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, who, early in \nhis reign, issued a document allowing Christians to practice their \nreligion within the empire, convoked the Council of Nicaea. The council \nunanimously ruled that the Easter festival should be celebrated \nthroughout the Christian world on the first Sunday after the full moon \nfollowing the vernal equinox.\n  At Easter, we receive again God's greatest gift of love: Jesus. \nSpring is a time to remember that gift. Death and resurrection are \nentwined not only in the death and resurrection of our Lord, but also \nin spring's final struggle with winter's strong grasp. There is a \nstruggle in both dying and in birth and it is logical to think that \nsomething must be born in order to die. However, from Jesus' words in \nJohn's Gospel, Chapter 12, verses 23 and 24, as Jesus foresees his own \ndeath, the Bible tells us something different--it tells us that \nsomething must die in order to be born. Jesus says:\n\n       The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. \n     Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall \n     into the ground and die, it abideth alone, but if it die, it \n     bringeth forth much fruit.\n\n  Easter is the time of year that finds many churches overflowing. \nParking attendants direct traffic caused by the overflow of cars on \nthis special day. Pews are packed tight. Extra chairs line the aisles, \nand much of this crowd only sees the inside of a church once a year, \nand Easter is the day. It is nice to see new faces. Those who attend \nchurch every Sunday look around at all the new faces, hoping they will \nbecome familiar, and struggle to find their regular seats. The struggle \nis worth it, however, because some of these same people will come back \nand join with the community that has worshiped together all year. They \nwill become members of a church family like those who have risen in the \ndarkness to watch the youth group tell the Easter story at sunrise--\nthere is nothing like it, telling it at sunrise--or who are praising \nGod with their voices in the choir, or who cooked the pancake breakfast \nfor Palm Sunday, or who decorated the Sanctuary with Easter Lilies. \nPerhaps they will be like those who teach the children the meaning of \nGod's love and grace in Sunday school classes. They will find a church \nhome. They will find God. They will be awakened. They will be reborn!\n  During our lives, we all experience the loss of a loved one. Have you \never thought about the resurrection story in a way that brought you \ncomfort in your time of grief? A little boy recently lost his \ngrandfather, and one day, when he was remembering his grandfather, he \nsaid to his mother, ``Mom, Easter will be extra special this year. We \nwill have two reasons to celebrate! Granddad and Jesus have both\n\n[[Page S2788]]\n\nrisen!'' If a 6-year-old can understand the beauty of the Easter story \non this level, think of the hope that this celebration can bring to \nothers who are grieving. I talked with one of my constituents on \nyesterday who lost his wife. I said: Come Eastertime, your wife knows \nyour grief. She knows about your sorrow. And the beauty of the story \nis, you can see her again. Every year at this time I remember my \nbeloved grandson, Michael, who died in a tragic accident in 1982. I \nknow that he is in a better place, and my faith in the Lord carries me \nthrough my sorrow. I can visualize Michael stepping out of the tomb \nwith Christ, and I know that he, too, is ``alive.'' Hear these words of \nTrappist monk Henri Nouwen:\n\n       Easter does not make death less painful or our own grief \n     less heavy. It does not make the loss less real, but Easter \n     makes us see and feel that death is part of a much greater \n     and much deeper event, the fullness of which we cannot \n     comprehend, but which we know is a life-bringing event.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The best way I can express to you the meaning death \n     receives in the light of the resurrection of Jesus is to say \n     that the love that causes us so much grief and makes us feel \n     so fully the absurdity of death is stronger than death \n     itself. Love is stronger than death. The same love that makes \n     us mourn and protest against death will now free us to live \n     in hope.\n\n  So, Mr. President, let Easter be the time to remember that the tomb \nis empty, that those who have passed before us have been reborn and \nwill live eternal life. Let us rejoice at this miracle and the miracle \nof God's love. As we hide Easter eggs for our children, our \ngrandchildren, or even our great grandchildren, and help them search \nthrough the green and purple Easter grass for the last sticky \nmarshmallow chick and a handful of jelly beans, let us not forget the \ngift that God gave us. As Jesus said in the third chapter of the Gospel \nof John, verse 16:\n\n       For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten \n     Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but \n     have everlasting life.\n\n  These are powerful words, and they are often used as words of \npersuasion, to bring others to Christ. God gave His only begotten Son . \n. . for us! What a powerful love that is!\n  While the Senate is in recess and the schools are closed for ``spring \nbreak,'' I hope that those who are listening will take this time to \nrecall this miracle of Easter. I continue to believe that the warp and \nwoof of this great Nation are the deeply rooted religious beliefs of \nits people. Our religious beliefs, though diverse, our common faith in \nthe Creator, remind all of us to look for the greater good, the higher, \nbetter part of ourselves and of others. The lessons differ, but the \nmessage is the same. Let us love one another. The resurrection of Jesus \nis the basis for the Christian belief that not only Jesus, but all \nChristians, will triumph over death. In closing, I recall the words of \nWilliam Jennings Bryan and his thoughts concerning Proof of \nImmortality:\n\n       If the Father deigns to touch with divine power the cold \n     and pulseless heart of the buried acorn and to make it burst \n     forth from its prison walls, will He leave neglected in the \n     earth the soul of man, made in the image of his Creator? If \n     He stoops to give to the rosebush, whose withered blossoms \n     float upon the autumn breeze, the sweet assurance of another \n     springtime, will He refuse the words of hope to the sons of \n     men when the frosts of winter come? If matter, mute and \n     inanimate, though changed by the forces of nature into a \n     multitude of forms, can never be destroyed, will the imperial \n     spirit of man suffer annihilation when it has paid a brief \n     visit like a royal guest to this tenement of clay? No, I am \n     sure that He who, notwithstanding His apparent prodigality, \n     created nothing without a purpose, and wasted not a single \n     atom in all His creation, has made provision for a future \n     life in which man's universal longing for immortality will \n     find its realization. I am as sure that we live again as I am \n     sure that we live today.\n\n  Mr. President, let us celebrate these words of hope this Easter \nseason. The tomb is empty and the soul of man will never, never die.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2788-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2788-S2789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INDEPENDENT COUNSEL ROBERT RAY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak in support of the \nremarks that were made earlier today by the distinguished Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Reid. Senator Reid spoke eloquently about the need for \nRobert Ray, the independent counsel who assumed duties when Kenneth \nStarr resigned, to bring that investigation of the President to a \nclose.\n  The report earlier this week in the Washington Post that Mr. Ray is \nincreasing his budget and his staff in contemplation of a possible \nindictment of the President after the President leaves office is \nchilling. Senator Reid is right to remind Mr. Ray that this is the \nUnited States and not a country such as the old Soviet Union where the \nabuse of the administration of law was used as a political weapon.\n  Mr. Ray apparently justifies the continuation of his office and his \nconsideration of an indictment of the President because of his \ncommitment to the principle that no one is above the law.\n  Certainly in this country that principle is fundamental. That was the \ntheory behind establishing the independent counsel law in the first \nplace. But that principle has two other equally important applications. \nOne is that it means Mr. Ray himself is not above the law; and, two, \nwhile it is imperative that top Government officials be treated no \nbetter than private citizens, it is equally important that they should \nalso be treated no worse.\n  The independent counsel law requires that the independent counsel \noperate as a normal U.S. attorney and that the independent counsel \ncomply with the policies and practices of the Department of Justice.\n  We require this in the law because we do not want our top Government \nofficials to be treated worse than a private citizen. Yes, we want to \nmake sure our top Government officials do not get preferential \ntreatment, but equally important, we do not want them to be treated \nunfairly either.\n  Mr. Ray projects he is going to spend an additional $3.5 million in \nthe next 6 months sifting through the evidence to determine whether or \nnot he should indict the President for perjury in a civil case.\n  Do any of us think that a U.S. attorney would spend 2 years and tens \nof millions of dollars investigating a possible perjury charge in a \ncivil suit to begin with? Does anyone think a U.S. attorney would then \nask for or receive six new attorneys, additional investigators and \ncontractors, and an additional $3.5 million of taxpayers' money on top \nof the 40 staff people and above the $52 million that the office had \nalready spent to investigate?\n  The facts in the Lewinsky case have been sliced and diced and parsed \nand sifted through over and over again. They have been brutally \nrevealed and thoroughly reviewed detail by detail.\n  If Mr. Ray is not to be above the law himself, and if he is to abide \nby the principle he claims to hold dear, then he should do what a U.S. \nattorney would do in a case like this involving a private citizen--\nbring it to a close.\n  The purpose of the independent counsel law is to fairly investigate \ntop Government officials so they are treated no better and no worse \nthan a private citizen. It is, instead, being used to pillory.\n  Nineteen months ago, Mr. Ray's predecessor, Kenneth Starr--surely a \ndogged independent counsel--represented to Congress that he was going \nto end the investigation ``soon.'' That was Mr. Starr's word, ``soon.''\n  Mr. Starr represented the following to the House of Representatives \non September 11, 1998:\n\n       All phases of the investigation are now nearing completion. \n     This Office will soon make final decisions about what steps \n     to take, if any, with respect to the other information it has \n     gathered.\n\n  Those were Mr. Starr's words 19 months ago when he made the \nrepresentation to the Congress of the United States and the people of \nthe United States that his office would soon make final decisions about \nwhat steps to take, if any.\n  Mr. Ray's statement, as reported in the Washington Post, that this is \nstill an open investigation and that he wants six new attorneys and \n$3.5 million more belies Mr. Starr's formal representation to the \nCongress and to the\n\n[[Page S2789]]\n\npeople. In commenting on Mr. Ray's latest statements, Pulitzer Prize \nwinning columnist Maureen Dowd noted that even Javert, the driven \npoliceman in the book ``Les Miserables,'' who was singularly focused on \ncapturing Jean Valjean ``jumped into the Seine at some point.''\n  I am not urging Mr. Ray to jump into the Potomac. I am saying--and I \nam confident that this is the opinion of the majority of the people in \nour country--that Mr. Ray needs to bring this investigation to a close \nand to do it now.\n  The Lewinsky matter is over. The Paula Jones case is over. They were \ntraumatic times for the country. The public has suffered. The President \nhas been punished. It is time to move on. To extend this investigation \nwith new attorneys and more money and more time is to punish the \ncountry. The country doesn't deserve it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that today's editorial from \nthe New York Times entitled ``Reining in Robert Ray'' and today's op-ed \npiece from the Washington Post by Richard Cohen entitled ``Independent \nCounsel Overkill'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 13, 2000]\n\n                         Reining In Robert Ray\n\n       There are worrying signs that Robert Ray, the career \n     prosecutor who succeeded Kenneth Starr as independent counsel \n     investigating President Clinton, shares his clumsy \n     predecessor's problem in winding up an investigation. Mr. Ray \n     at this point should have a concise two-point agenda--to \n     deliver a report summing up the findings of his office, and \n     then go home. Instead he is beefing up his staff. Moreover, \n     he makes it no secret that he is actively considering \n     indicting Mr. Clinton after he leaves office in connection \n     with the same issues that were argued at the impeachment \n     trial last year.\n       In other words, Mr. Ray intends to drag out his mandate \n     nine more months. ``It is an open investigation,'' he told \n     The Washington Post this week. ``There is a principle to be \n     vindicated, and that principle is that no person is above the \n     law, even the president of the United States.''\n       Mr. Ray is right about that principle, and we have \n     consistently favored vigorous inquires into the president's \n     personal and campaign finances and his truthfulness under \n     oath.\n       But respect for the rule of law does not require a \n     suspension of reasonable prosecutorial discretion.\n       It would be a disservice to the Constitution to set a new \n     precedent of indicting former presidents over offenses \n     adjudicated in the context of impeachment that received an \n     adequate and punishing airing in the Senate trial. Responding \n     to the new stirrings in the independent counsel's office, \n     Vice President Gore said yesterday that Mr. Clinton had no \n     intention of pardoning himself should he be indicted while \n     president, or accepting a pardon from his successor. That is \n     laudable, if true. Yet the possibility of criminal charges \n     against the president should not be on the table at this late \n     date. The nation has moved on, and once he has completed his \n     overdue reports, so should Mr. Ray.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 13, 2000]\n\n                      Independent Counsel Overkill\n\n                           (By Richard Cohen)\n\n       Something happens to an ordinary man when he becomes an \n     independent counsel. His chest must swell, his biceps must \n     bulge and he probably cannot pass a phone booth without \n     feeling the urge to change his clothes. Such a man is Robert \n     W. Ray, the successor to Ken Starr, who earlier this week \n     told The Post he just might indict Bill Clinton after the \n     president leaves office. Stay in that phone booth, Bob.\n       Ray's warning is backed by a reconstitution of the office. \n     Six new lawyers have been hired. A new investigator has been \n     brought on board. An FBI agent has been detailed to the \n     staff, and Ray plans to spend even more money in the next six \n     months than he has in the last--for a total of $6.6 million. \n     From what he says and the way he has been acting, it seems \n     Ray might put the cuffs on Clinton just as the new president \n     says, ``So help me God.''\n       Why? ``There is a principle to be vindicated,'' he told The \n     Post's David Vise, ``and that principle is that no person is \n     above the law, even the president of the United States.'' \n     This, of course, is the sort of thing you find chiseled over \n     courthouse doors, contradicted only by what transpires in the \n     courthouse itself. Some people are above the law. The \n     envelope, please.\n       The first is Richard Nixon. Guilty of obstruction of \n     justice, of using our very government to cover up his crimes \n     and lying so often about so much that I don't think he spoke \n     the truth for his entire last year in office, he nonetheless \n     was given a deal: resign the presidency and you will not be \n     indicted. Just to make the deal sweeter, Gerald Ford, his \n     successor, pardoned him.\n       Next comes Spiro T. Agnew, Nixon's first vice president. A \n     more mendacious fellow never occupied that office. He \n     extorted. He accepted bribes. He lied. Yet he too was allowed \n     to resign his office, pay a wee fine--and go his merry way. \n     An ordinary man would have gone to jail. Agnew too was above \n     the law.\n       These are not happy facts, but they are true nevertheless. \n     They reflect a coming to terms with reality that, in the end, \n     persuaded prosecutors to abandon their plans to seek \n     indictments. The stakes were greater than the fate of a \n     single man and, besides, some felt Nixon and Agnew had been \n     punished enough. They were ruined men.\n       The reality is that Clinton, too, has already paid a \n     penalty. He is only the second president to be impeached and \n     he has undergone the most mortifying and virtually molecular \n     examination of his private life. To most Americans, the \n     matter must seem closed. It sure seemed that way to Richard \n     Posner, the federal judge whose wisdom was recently enlisted \n     in a vain attempt to settle the government's case against \n     Microsoft.\n       Posner is the author of a book about the Clinton \n     investigation, ``An Affair of State,'' for which he was \n     criticized by Ronald Dworkin, a New York University law \n     professor who is as eminent on the left as Posner is on the \n     right. Dworkin wrote recently in the New York Review of Books \n     that as a sitting judge, Posner should never have written \n     about an ``impending'' case.\n       Nonsense, replied Posner in the current issue. ``A \n     prosecution of President Clinton, while conceivable as a \n     theoretical possibility, is not imminent and in fact will \n     almost certainly never happen.'' He even restated it by \n     saying, ``Almost no issue of policy has a smaller probability \n     of someday becoming a legal case.'' Clearly, Robert Ray has \n     not read Posner.\n       But he should. We all know Clinton lied. We all believe he \n     perjured himself, and I, for one, do not excuse him for any \n     of it. A president, of all people, should not lie under oath. \n     Still, it has all been played out, talked to death in the \n     House and Senate, yakked to smithereens on television and \n     bound for posterity by Ken Starr.\n       Ray can indict Clinton anywhere he has a grand jury. But \n     Washington's the town where the president works, where he \n     lives and where he was deposed. If there was a crime, \n     Washington's the crime scene. A trial there would mean a jury \n     pool drawn from a majority black city where, in most \n     neighborhoods, no one has seen a Republican since the \n     Garfield administration. But no matter where he was tried, it \n     likely would be by people who feel that a person who lies \n     about sex, while technically wrong, is guilty only of \n     committing common sense. A conviction is out of the question.\n       Give it up Bob. Your best way of serving the country is to \n     close down your office, lock the door and put Clinton behind \n     you.\n       Much of the country already has.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2789-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2789-S2790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ONE YEAR OF COLUMBINE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, one week from today, we will memorialize \nthe worst school shooting tragedy in our nation's history. The very \nmention of Columbine High School strikes a nerve with the American \npublic. It reminds us of a horrendous scene of children, screaming and \nrunning from their assailants, while SWAT-teams descended on to their \notherwise calm neighborhood. On April 20, this year the nation will \nremember, but for the students of Columbine, those few hours of April \n20, 1999 are replayed over and over again every day in their minds.\n  The survivors of Columbine revisit the massacre daily. They are \nreminded of that day by the fragments of ammunition in their bodies, or \nthe scars cut deep in to their skin. When they see trenchcoats, they \nshudder, when they hear or smell fireworks, they get flashbacks. At \nsuch young ages, they have endured unimaginable physical and emotional \npain. They have been poked and prodded by nurses, physicians, surgeons, \nphysical, occupational and recreational therapists, and clinical \npsychologists. Some of them have found peace, others are still angry \nand frightened. A few can not tell their stories but many can tell them \nover and over again.\n  For Columbine-survivor Valeen Schnurr, ``The nights are always the \nworst.'' Valeen is in college now, but Columbine is still very much \nwith her. She writes, ``Inevitably, I find my thoughts drifting into \nnightmares, terrifying images of the library at Columbine High School \non April 20, 1999. The sound of students screaming as explosives and \ngunshots echo through the school; the burning pain of the bullets \npenetrating my body; the sound of my own voice professing my faith in \nGod; seeing my hands fill with my own blood; and my friend Lauren \nTownsend lying lifeless beside me as I try to wake her.''\n  ``In the mornings when I look in the mirror, the scars I see on my \narms and upper body always remind me that it's\n\n[[Page S2790]]\n\nnot just a nightmare, but the memory of a real event that will stay \nwith me for the rest of my life. The scars are a part of me now, but \nthey help me to remember that I've been blessed with a second chance at \nlife.''\n  Another survivor, Kelsey Bane, talks about how she felt on her first \nday back at Columbine. ``On August 16, 1999, a new school year began. \nOnly this year, I wasn't full of excitement. Instead, I was full of \nemotions I can't describe, because I was headed back to my school--\nColumbine High--for the first time since April 20. I was scared out of \nmy mind, but I knew that whatever I did that day would determine the \nway I would live the rest of my life. So I went to school; I faced my \nfears and my nightmares from the past four months and got ready to \nbegin a new school year.''\n  Over the last year, ``[it] has gotten harder, as I expected it would. \nSometimes I can't remember what used to occupy my thoughts, because now \nmy mind is overwhelmed by these horrific experiences. Our lives will \nnever be the same--and I don't think I will ever fully accept that.''\n  Nicole Nowlen, who was a relatively new student when the tragedy \noccurred, wrote ``nine pieces of buckshot hit me; four exited and five \nare still inside. When school started at Chatfield High [in May], I \nwasn't physically ready, so I finished my sophomore year with a tutor \nand went back to Columbine in August.''\n\n  ``It's been like this roller-coaster ride ever since. October and \nNovember got too crazy. First they arrested a kid [from Columbine] for \nmaking threats to finish the job. Then there was the six-month \nanniversary, and Mrs. Hochhalter [the mother of Anne Marie Hochhalter \nwho was badly injured] killed herself. In all my classes, the kids \nnever stopped talking about the shooting. It was depressing, so I \ndecided to be home schooled.\n  ``I started seeing a counselor in November . . . Things are better \nnow, so I'm not going anymore. I may go again, but for now I'm at a \ngood point.''\n  ``What helped me the most was Gerda Weissman Klein. She's a 75-year-\nold Holocaust survivor who came to speak at our school in January. \nShe's really the only one who understands what happened to all of us.''\n  For the students of Columbine, every day is a struggle, every day \ntakes another act of courage. There is nothing we can do in Congress to \nchange that, but there is something we can do to protect other students \nfrom the nightmares, the anger, and the pain, as told by these \nstudents. Congress owes it to Columbine to try to end school shootings \nand reduce access to guns among young people. As of this one-year \nanniversary, Congress has failed to do so.\n  Columbine victim Valeen Schnurr wrote, ``People on the outside don't \nrealize how horrible it can actually be. We're the ones who can get \neveryone motivated and involved in making changes.'' I only hope Valeen \nis right. Her story should motivate Congress to strengthen our laws and \nsave the lives of America's children.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was disappointed to hear one of our \nfine Senators, an able attorney, take the floor just a few minutes ago \nto commence a new round of attacks, it appears, on the new independent \ncounsel, Mr. Ray.\n  We went through a period of time in which a person in this country \nwas trying to enforce the law, trying to complete his duty as a sworn \nofficer of the court, an individual asked to serve by the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, Mr. Starr, who conducted himself with \nrestraint, propriety and fidelity to duty--a thankless task. He then \ngave up that office. Now it appears that Mr. Ray will be subjected to \nthe same type of remarks. It is really disturbing and frustrating for \nme to hear that. I hope we don't hear that beginning. He simply made \nthe obvious statement to the paper that the President can be indicted \nafter he leaves office. He said that the investigation is not complete. \nHe is charged with completing the investigation. He has an obligation \nto complete it, and he should complete it. I don't think anyone would \nsuggest that he ought to stop before the evidence is gathered, that he \nought not to fulfill his duty and responsibility that has been given to \nhim. So I am really concerned about that.\n  During the impeachment trial--and I hate to even recall that, but I \ndidn't start this discussion tonight--I remember that those on the \nother side of the aisle said even if a crime were committed, that would \nbe something a prosecutor would deal with but it did not require us to \nimpeach. Obviously, that is true. People could have believed that crime \nwas committed and that an impeachment vote was not required. But that \ndoes not suggest a prosecution should not go forward. We have a \nprinciple in this country that is chiseled into the walls of the \nSupreme Court building: Equal Justice Under Law.\n  The Supreme Court made clear during the Nixon case, and at other \ntimes, that no American is above the law. They say, well, you would \nnever prosecute another citizen in America for committing perjury in a \ncivil case. That is silly. Well, I suggest that is not accurate. People \nare prosecuted for perjury in civil cases. I served as a U.S. attorney \nfor 12 years in Mobile, AL. I remember very distinctly a young police \nofficer who accused the chief of police of corruption. He was his \ndriver. He made allegations in a deposition, and lawsuits were filed \nagainst the chief of police in Mobile, AL, who was an African American. \nThey were coming after him. He repeated that under oath, and it turned \nout to be totally bogus. He eventually admitted it was bogus. He came \nto me as a U.S. attorney, a Federal prosecutor--it was a Federal \nlawsuit--and I believed it ought to be prosecuted. We charged that \nyoung man for that stupid, perjurious, felonious act. He pleaded guilty \nto it, as well he should have.\n  I don't know why the President is above that. If he did a crime, he \nought to answer for it. I remember when this matter was at one of its \nintense points, I shared a private conversation with a distinguished \nSenator on the other side of the aisle. I shared with him that maybe \nthe President ought to just admit he did something wrong, say he did it \nto the world, say he didn't tell the truth, ask the Congress to \nnot impeach him, ask the American people for forgiveness, and say when \nhe serves his term and walks out of there, he is willing to plead \nguilty to any crime he committed and ask for the mercy of the court. \nNow that would have ended the whole thing. That would have taken a \nmanly act on his part, which I didn't really see occur during that \ntime.\n\n  So I don't know how it ought to be handled. But I don't believe a \nduly appointed special prosecutor needs to be subjected to abuse on the \nfloor of the Senate for doing what he is instructed to do and charged \nwith doing by the courts of America. And to say it is like Russia, I \ndon't appreciate that one bit. What is like Russia is when leaders lie, \ncheat, steal, and maintain their office. That is what happens in a \ncountry such as Russia, not in a free democracy where all Americans are \nequal and have a right to know that every other public official is \nequal and subject to the law just as they are.\n  I am not suggesting I know what the facts are or that Mr. Ray does or \ndoes not have a good case. I have been a prosecutor, and I know what \nyou have to do. A prosecutor has to gather the facts. Then if he has a \ncase, he has to put it out before the whole world. If it is not there, \nhe will be remembered for a bogus and unfair prosecution, if he ever \ngot an indictment from a grand jury, which I doubt he would if he \ndidn't have a good case. I am not afraid of the system. The President \nis subject to the system as is anyone else.\n  I wish we could bring this investigation to a close, but I happen to \nbe on the committee involved in an investigation of various matters \ninvolving campaign finance and spying and that sort of thing. Senator \nSpecter from\n\n[[Page S2791]]\n\nPennsylvania chairs it, and Senator Torricelli is a member. We have an \nincredibly difficult time getting information and documents from this \nGovernment. No wonder it takes Mr. Starr and Mr. Ray so long and they \nare frustrated at every turn in obtaining evidence they need to make a \nlegitimate decision and present a legitimate case to a grand jury.\n  I wish this were over. I wish we never had to talk about it. I don't \nintend to raise the subject myself. But as a Federal attorney, I have \nbeen in court trying to do my duty. I have made up my mind that I am \nnot going to allow somebody who is doing his duty to gather the \nevidence and make a decision on whether a case ought to go forward to \nbe abused and compared to somebody in Russia. I am not going to allow \nthat. We need to speak out against that, and I intend to do so at every \nopportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2791-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Materials Corridor \n     and United States-Mexico Border Technology Partnership Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the 2,000 mile long United States-Mexico border region, \n     extending 100 kilometers north and south of the international \n     boundary, has undergone rapid economic growth that has \n     provided economic opportunity to millions of people;\n       (2) the border region's rapid economic growth has \n     unfortunately created serious problems including pollution, \n     hazardous wastes, and the inefficient use of resources that \n     threaten people's health and the prospects for long-term \n     economic growth in the region;\n       (3) there are a significant number of major institutions in \n     the border States of both countries currently conducting \n     research, development and testing activities in technologies \n     that might help alleviate these problems;\n       (4)(A) these new technologies may provide major \n     opportunities for significantly--\n       (i) minimizing industrial wastes and pollution that may \n     pose a threat to public health;\n       (ii) reducing emissions of atmospheric pollutants;\n       (iii) using recycled natural resources as primary materials \n     for industrial production; and\n       (iv) improving energy efficiency; and\n       (B) such advances will directly benefit both sides of the \n     United States-Mexico border by encouraging energy efficient, \n     environmentally sound economic development that improves the \n     health and protects the natural resources of the border \n     region;\n       (5) in August 1998, the binational United States-Mexico \n     Border Region Hazardous Wastes Forum, organized by the \n     Department of Energy's Carlsbad Area Office, resulted in a \n     consensus of experts from the United States and Mexico that \n     the Department of Energy's science and technology could be \n     leveraged to address key environmental issues in the border \n     region while fostering further economic development of the \n     border region;\n       (6) the Carlsbad Area Office, which manages the Waste \n     Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, New Mexico, is well suited \n     to lead a multiagency program focused on the problems of the \n     border region given its significant expertise in hazardous \n     materials and location near the border;\n       (7)(A) promoting clean materials industries in the border \n     region that are energy efficient has been identified as a \n     high priority issue by the United States-Mexico Foundation \n     for Science Cooperation; and\n       (B) at the 1998 discussions of the United States-Mexico \n     Binational Commission, Mexico formally proposed joint funding \n     of a ``Materials Corridor Partnership Initiative'', proposing \n     $1,000,000 to implement the Initiative if matched by the \n     United States;\n       (8) recognizing the importance of materials processing, \n     research institutions in the border States of both the United \n     States and Mexico, in conjunction with private sector \n     partners of both nations, and with strong endorsement from \n     the Government of Mexico, in 1998 organized the Materials \n     Corridor Council to implement a cooperative program of \n     materials research and development, education and \n     training, and sustainable industrial development as part \n     of the Materials Corridor Partnership Initiative; and\n       (9) successful implementation of this Act would advance \n     important United States energy, environmental, and economic \n     goals not only in the United States-Mexico border region but \n     also serve as a model for similar collaborative, \n     transnational initiatives in other regions of the world.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to establish a multiagency \n     program to--\n       (1) alleviate the problems caused by rapid economic \n     development along the United States-Mexico border;\n       (2) support the Materials Corridor Partnership Initiative \n     referred to in section 2(7); and\n       (3) promote energy efficient, environmentally sound \n     economic development along that border through the \n     development and use of new technologies, particularly \n     hazardous waste and materials technologies.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Program.--The term ``program'' means the program \n     established under section 5(a).\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Energy.\n\n     SEC. 5.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) certain parcels of private land located in northeast \n     Oregon are intermingled with land owned by the United States \n     and administered--\n       (A) by the Secretary of the Interior as part of the Central \n     Oregon Resource Area in the Prineville Bureau of Land \n     Management District and the Baker Resource Area in the Vale \n     Bureau of Land Management District; and\n       (B) by the Secretary of Agriculture as part of the Malheur \n     National Forest, the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, and the \n     Umatilla National Forest;\n       (2) the surface estate of the private land described in \n     paragraph (1) is intermingled with parcels of land that are \n     owned by the United States or contain valuable fisheries and \n     wildlife habitat desired by the United States;\n       (3) the consolidation of land ownerships will facilitate \n     sound and efficient management for both public and private \n     lands;\n       (4) the improvement of management efficiency through the \n     land tenure adjustment program of the Department of the \n     Interior, which disposes of small isolated tracts having low \n     public resource values within larger blocks of contiguous \n     parcels of land, would serve important public objectives, \n     including--\n       (A) the enhancement of public access, aesthetics, and \n     recreation opportunities within or adjacent to designated \n     wild and scenic river corridors;\n       (B) the protection and enhancement of habitat for \n     threatened, endangered, and sensitive species within unified \n     landscapes under Federal management; and\n       (C) the consolidation of holdings of the Bureau of Land \n     Management and the Forest Service--\n       (i) to facilitate more efficient administration, including \n     a reduction in administrative costs to the United States; and\n       (ii) to reduce right-of-way, special use, and other permit \n     processing and issuance for roads and other facilities on \n     Federal land;\n       (5) time is of the essence in completing a land exchange \n     because further delays may force the identified landowners to \n     construct roads in, log, develop, or sell the private land \n     and thereby diminish the public values for which the private \n     land is to be acquired; and\n       (6) it is in the public interest to complete the land \n     exchanges at the earliest practicable date so that the land \n     acquired by the United States can be preserved for--\n       (A) protection of threatened and endangered species \n     habitat; and\n       (B) permanent public use and enjoyment.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Baca ranch comprises most of the Valles Caldera in \n     central New Mexico, and constitutes a unique land mass, with \n     significant scientific, cultural, historic, recreational, \n     ecological, wildlife, fisheries, and productive values;\n       (2) the Valles Caldera is a large resurgent lava dome with \n     potential geothermal activity;\n       (3) the land comprising the Baca ranch was originally \n     granted to the heirs of Don Luis Maria Cabeza de Vaca in \n     1860;\n       (4) historical evidence, in the form of old logging camps \n     and other artifacts, and the\n\n[[Page S2800]]\n\n     history of territorial New Mexico indicate the importance of \n     this land over many generations for domesticated livestock \n     production and timber supply;\n       (5) the careful husbandry of the Baca ranch by the current \n     owners, including selective timbering, limited grazing and \n     hunting, and the use of prescribed fire, have preserved a mix \n     of healthy range and timber land with significant species \n     diversity, thereby serving as a model for sustainable land \n     development and use;\n       (6) the Baca ranch's natural beauty and abundant resources, \n     and its proximity to large municipal populations, could \n     provide numerous recreational opportunities for hiking, \n     fishing, camping, cross-country skiing, and hunting;\n       (7) the Forest Service documented the scenic and natural \n     values of the Baca ranch in its 1993 study entitled ``Report \n     on the Study of the Baca Location No. 1, Santa Fe National \n     Forest, New Mexico'', as directed by Public Law 101-556;\n       (8) the Baca ranch can be protected for current and future \n     generations by continued operation as a working ranch under a \n     unique management regime which would protect the land and \n     resource values of the property and surrounding ecosystem \n     while allowing and providing for the ranch to eventually \n     become financially self-sustaining;\n       (9) the current owners have indicated that they wish to \n     sell the Baca ranch, creating an opportunity for Federal \n     acquisition and public access and enjoyment of these lands;\n       (10) certain features on the Baca ranch have historical and \n     religious significance to Native Americans which can be \n     preserved and protected through Federal acquisition of the \n     property;\n       (11) the unique nature of the Valles Caldera and the \n     potential uses of its resources with different resulting \n     impacts warrants a management regime uniquely capable of \n     developing an operational program for appropriate \n     preservation and development of the land and resources of the \n     Baca ranch in the interest of the public;\n       (12) an experimental management regime should be provided \n     by the establishment of a Trust capable of using new methods \n     of public land management that may prove to be cost-effective \n     and environmentally sensitive; and\n       (13) the Secretary may promote more efficient management of \n     the Valles Caldera and the watershed of the Santa Clara Creek \n     through the assignment of purchase rights of such watershed \n     to the Pueblo of Santa Clara.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to authorize Federal acquisition of the Baca ranch;\n       (2) to protect and preserve for future generations the \n     scientific, scenic, historic, and natural values of the Baca \n     ranch, including rivers and ecosystems and archaeological, \n     geological, and cultural resources;\n       (3) to provide opportunities for public recreation;\n       (4) to establish a demonstration area for an experimental \n     management regime adapted to this unique property which \n     incorporates elements of public and private administration in \n     order to promote long term financial sustainability \n     consistent with the other purposes enumerated in this \n     subsection; and\n       (5) to provide for sustained yield management of Baca ranch \n     for timber production and domesticated livestock grazing \n     insofar as is consistent with the other purposes stated \n     herein.\n\n     SEC. 103.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Federal Land Transaction \n     Facilitation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Bureau of Land Management has authority under the \n     Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. \n     1701 et seq.) to sell land identified for disposal under its \n     land use planning;\n       (2) the Bureau of Land Management has authority under that \n     Act to exchange Federal land for non-Federal land if the \n     exchange would be in the public interest;\n       (3) through land use planning under that Act, the Bureau of \n     Land Management has identified certain tracts of public land \n     for disposal;\n       (4) the Federal land management agencies of the Departments \n     of the Interior and Agriculture have authority under existing \n     law to acquire land consistent with the mission of each \n     agency;\n       (5) the sale or exchange of land identified for disposal \n     and the acquisition of certain non-Federal land from willing \n     landowners would--\n       (A) allow for the reconfiguration of land ownership \n     patterns to better facilitate resource management;\n       (B) contribute to administrative efficiency within Federal \n     land management units; and\n       (C) allow for increased effectiveness of the allocation of \n     fiscal and human resources within the Federal land management \n     agencies;\n       (6) a more expeditious process for disposal and acquisition \n     of land, established to facilitate a more effective \n     configuration of land ownership patterns, would benefit the \n     public interest;\n       (7) many private individuals own land within the boundaries \n     of Federal land management units and desire to sell the land \n     to the Federal Government;\n       (8) such land lies within national parks, national \n     monuments, national wildlife refuges, national forests, and \n     other areas designated for special management;\n       (9) Federal land management agencies are facing increased \n     workloads from rapidly growing public demand for the use of \n     public land, making it difficult for Federal managers to \n     address problems created by the existence of inholdings in \n     many areas;\n       (10) in many cases, inholders and the Federal Government \n     would mutually benefit from Federal acquisition of the land \n     on a priority basis;\n       (11) proceeds generated from the disposal of public land \n     may be properly dedicated to the acquisition of inholdings \n     and other land that will improve the resource management \n     ability of the Federal land management agencies and adjoining \n     landowners;\n       (12) using proceeds generated from the disposal of public \n     land to purchase inholdings and other such land from willing \n     sellers would enhance the ability of the Federal land \n     management agencies to--\n       (A) work cooperatively with private landowners and State \n     and local governments; and\n       (B) promote consolidation of the ownership of public and \n     private land in a manner that would allow for better overall \n     resource management;\n       (13) in certain locations, the sale of public land that has \n     been identified for disposal is the best way for the public \n     to receive fair market value for the land; and\n       (14) to allow for the least disruption of existing land and \n     resource management programs, the Bureau of Land Management \n     may use non-Federal entities to prepare appraisal documents \n     for agency review and approval consistent with applicable \n     provisions of the Uniform Standards for Federal Land \n     Acquisition.\n\n     SEC. 203.

Mr. President, we have a number of bills from my \nCommittee on the Calendar that are ready for consideration, but I want \nto take a moment to say a few words about a bill I think has real \npotential for addressing the long-term energy needs of our nation. H.R. \n1753, the Methane hydrate Research and Development Act of 2000, would \nestablish a small research program with the potential for a major \npayoff--energy security for the foreseeable future. Methane Hydrates \nare rigid, ice-like solids of water surrounding a gas molecule, found \nat low temperatures and high pressures. When melted or depressurized, \nthey release methane, pure natural gas, the same fuel we use to heat \nour homes and power our economy.\n  Significant quantities of methane hydrates have been detected all \nover the world. In the U.S., marine geologists have detected deposits \nof methane hydrates in deep sea sediments that lie off the coasts of \nthe Carolinas, Louisiana, Texas, California, Oregon, and my home state \nof Alaska. We've also detected methane hydrates under the permafrost \nduring conventional oil drilling operations in my home state of Alaska. \nThe U.S. Geological Survey estimates that nearly 320,000 trillion cubic \nfeet of natural gas can be extracted from the methane hydrates found in \nthe U.S. alone. Compare that to our existing reserves of cheap, clean \nnatural gas--1,300 trillion cubic feet--and our annual use of natural \ngas--just 20 trillion cubic feet per year. Even if we can learn to \nrecover just 1 percent of our methane hydrate reserves, we will more \nthan triple our available natural gas reserves and guarantee a source \nof cheap, secure and clean energy for the next century and well beyond.\n  The problem is: we need fundamental research on these hydrates to \nunderstand how they form, and how the gas molecule can be released in a \nway that we can use. Even now, methane hydrates pose hazards to \nconventional oil and gas recovery. Hydrates determine the stability and \nstrength of the sea floor--when the hydrates are destabilized, the \nresulting gas release can undermine oil platforms and sink drilling \nships. Methane hydrates release 160 volumes of gas for every volume of \nhydrate--and many existing hydrate formations are very unstable. Even a \nsmall disturbance--an unintentional landslide--could release massive \nquantities of gas. Oil platforms in the Caspian Sea have been destroyed \nas a result of this kind of accidental release.\n  Methane hydrates also play a significant role in global climate \nchange. Recent scientific research suggests that abrupt climate changes \nhave occurred in the past as a result of release of methane gas from \nhydrates. They are an important part of the global carbon cycle, which \nwe must ultimately understand in detail if we want to act responsibly \nto address the risk of climate change. Since natural gas releases fewer \ncarbon atoms per unit of energy, replacing coal and oil usage with \nnatural gas from methane hydrates also reduces our risk of climate \nchange--some experts estimate we can reduce our carbon dioxide \nemissions by 20 percent just by fuel substitution alone. We can also \nlearn about carbon sequestration through studying how methane hydrates \nform--perhaps even replacing methane hydrates used for energy with \nhydrates using carbon dioxide sequestered from the atmosphere.\n\n  All of these things point to the need for a fundamental methane \nhydrate research program of the kind proposed in this bill. I want to \nthank my good friends and colleagues on the Energy Committee, Senators \nAkaka and Craig, for their leadership and recognition of the potential \nfor methane hydrates to satisfy our future energy needs, enable our \nlong-term energy security, and help us responsibly address the risk of \nclimate change. Working with our colleagues in the House, we have been \nable to develop legislation that would authorize $45 million in new \nfunding for research in this important area. Anticipating passage of a \nbill like this one, the Department of Energy has prepared an excellent \nmulti-year research and development program plan that addresses all of \nthe issues involved--with the goal of safe commercial production of \nenergy from hydrates by 2010.\n  It is clear that we are not doing enough to explore the possibility \nof this exciting new energy source. Other nations of the world--Japan, \nCanada, India, Korea and Norway--are starting ambitious research \nprograms. The Japanese began a drilling project of their own in \nNovember 1999, and expect that production can begin within 10 years, \nmaybe sooner. The technology exists--Syntroleum, an Oklahoma company--\nhas recently acquired a patent for a gas hydrate recovery system. All \nwe need now is the sustained research to make it commercially viable.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I am glad that my colleagues here \nin the\n\n[[Page S2807]]\n\nSenate will agree to pass the bill in the form passed by the House two \nweeks ago, so we can send it to the President for signature and get \ngoing on this important research program. Thanks to the leadership of \nSenators Akaka and Craig, we may look back years from now on this day \nas the day we broke free of our dependence on foreign oil and \nguaranteed ourselves a clean energy source for many years to come.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Palace of the \nGovernors Annex Act has passed the Senate.\n  In conjunction with Hispanic Heritage Month, I introduced the Palace \nof the Governors Expansion Act last October. The palace is a symbol of \nHispanic influence in the United States and truly shows the coming \ntogether of many cultures in the New World--the various native \nAmerican, Hispanic, and Anglo peoples who have lived in the region for \nover four centuries.\n  Since introducing this bill last October, the situation has become an \nemergency. Walls are crumbling, water pipes are leaking, plumbing is \nbacking up threatening priceless documents.\n  The bill would authorize the construction of the Palace of the \nGovernors' Annex. It would preserve a priceless collection of Spanish \ncolonial, Iberian colonial paintings, artifacts, maps, books, guns, \ncostumes, photographs. The collection includes such historically unique \nitems as the helmets and armor worn by the Don Juan Onate expedition \nconquistadors who established the first capital in the United States, \nSan Juan de los Caballeros, in July 1598. It includes the Vara Stick, a \ntype of yardstick used to measure land grants and other real property \nboundaries in Dona Ana County, NM.\n  We have all heard of Geronimo. The collection includes a rifle \ndropped by one of his men during a raid in the Black Range area of \nwestern New Mexico.\n  We have all heard of Pancho Villa. His activities in the Southwest \ncome alive when viewing some of the artifacts included in the Palace of \nthe Governors Collection. The Columbus, NM, railway station clock was \nshot in the pendulum, freezing for all history the moment that Pancho \nVilla's raid and invasion began. It is part of the collection, but you \nwouldn't know it because there is no room to display it.\n  Brig. Gen. Stephen Watts Kearny was posted to New Mexico during the \nMexican War. He commanded the Army of the West as they traveled from \nthe Santa Fe Trail to occupy the territories of New Mexico and \nCalifornia. As Kearny traveled, he carried a field desk which he used \nto write letters, diaries, orders, and other historical documents. It \nis part of the collection, but you can't see it because there is no \ndisplay space for it in the Palace of the Governors.\n  Many of us have read books by D.H. Lawrence, but none of us has seen \nthe note from his mother that is part of the collection.\n  There are more than 800,000 other historic photographs, guns, \ncostumes, maps, books, and handicrafts.\n  Where are these treasures that Teddy Roosevelt wanted to make part of \nthe Smithsonian housed now?\n  Where is this collection designated as a National Treasure by the \nNational Trust for Historic Preservation kept?\n  In the basement of a 400-year-old building.\n  It is a national travesty.\n  This legislation would right this wrong by authorizing funds for a \nPalace of the Governors Expansion Annex. The entire project will cost \n$32 million. The legislation authorizes a $15 million federal grant if \nthe museum can match the grant on a 50-50 basis.\n  The Palace of the Governors has acquired a half block behind the \ncurrent palace. Obtaining this valuable real estate is evidence of the \ningenuity and\n\n[[Page S2810]]\n\ncommitment of those involved in preserving the collection. Real estate \nnear Santa Fe's plaza is seldom for sale at any price, much less an \naffordable price.\n  The Palace of the Governors has been the center of administrative and \ncultural activity over a vast region in the Southwest since its \nconstruction as New Mexico's second capitol by Governor Pedro de \nPeralta in 1610. The building is the oldest continuously occupied \npublic building in the United States. Since its creation, the Museum of \nNew Mexico has worked to protect and promote Hispanic, Southwest, and \nnative American arts and crafts.\n  I hope the House will act expeditiously on this legislation to save \nthis important collection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/13/senate-section/article/S2810-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEADLINE EXTENSION FOR COMMENCEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION OF A HYDROELECTRIC \n                                PROJECT\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill (S. 1836) to extend the \ndeadline for commencement of construction of a hydroelectric project in \nthe State of Alabama, was considered, ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, read the third time, and passed; as follows:\n\n                                S. 1836\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is today \nconsidering for final passage S. 1769, as amended by the House. I \nintroduced S. 1769 with Chairman Hatch on October 22, 1999 and it \npassed the Senate on November 5, 1999. This bill will continue and \nenhance the current reporting requirements for the Administrative \nOffice of the Courts and the Attorney General on the eavesdropping and \nsurveillance activities of our federal and state law enforcement \nagencies. The House amendment is the text of H.R. 3111, a bill to \nexempt from automatic elimination and sunset certain reports submitted \nto Congress that are useful and helpful in informing the Congress and \nthe public about the activities of federal agencies in the enforcement \nof federal law. I am also glad to support this amendment.\n  For many years, the Administrative Office (AO) of the Courts has \ncomplied with the statutory requirement, in 18 U.S.C. 2519(3), to \nreport to Congress annually the number and nature of federal and state \napplications for orders authorizing or approving the interception of \nwire, oral or electronic communications. By letter dated September 3,\n\n[[Page S2814]]\n\n1999, the AO advised that it would no longer submit this report because \n``as of December 21, 1999, the report will no longer be required \npursuant to the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995.'' I \ncommend the AO for alerting Congress that their responsibility for the \nwiretap reports would lapse at the end of this year, and for doing so \nin time for Congress to take action. The date upon which this reporting \nrequirement was due to lapse was extended in the FY 2000 Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, H.R. 3194, until May 15, 2000--only a few short \nweeks away.\n  AO has done an excellent job of preparing the wiretap reports. We \nneed to continue the AO's objective work in a consistent manner. If \nanother agency took over this important task at this juncture and the \nnumbers came out in a different format, it would immediately generate \nquestions and concerns over the legitimacy and accuracy of the contents \nof that report.\n  In addition, it would create difficulties in comparing statistics \nfrom prior years going back to 1969 and complicate the job of \ncongressional oversight. Furthermore, transferring this reporting duty \nto another agency might create delays in issuance of the report since \nno other agency has the methodology in place. Finally, federal, state \nand local agencies are well accustomed to the reporting methodology \ndeveloped by the AO. Notifying all these agencies that the reporting \nstandards and agency have changed would inevitably create more \nconfusion and more expense as law enforcement agencies across the \ncountry are forced to learn with a new system and develop a liaison \nwith a new agency.\n  The system in place now has worked well and we should avoid any \ndisruptions. We know how quickly law enforcement may be subjected to \ncriticism over their use of these surreptitious surveillance tools and \nwe should avoid aggravating these sensitivities by changing the \nreporting agency and methodology on little to no notice. I appreciate, \nhowever, the AO's interest in transferring the wiretap reporting \nrequirement to another entity. Any such transfer must be accomplished \nwith a minimum of disruption to the collection and reporting of \ninformation and with complete assurances that any new entity is able to \nfulfill this important job as capably as the AO has done.\n\n  S. 1769 would update the reporting requirements currently in place \nwith one additional reporting requirement. Specifically, the bill would \nrequire the wiretap reports prepared beginning in calendar year 2000 to \ninclude information on the number of orders in which encryption was \nencountered and whether such encryption prevented law enforcement from \nobtaining the plain text of communications intercepted pursuant to such \norder.\n  Encryption technology is critical to protect sensitive computer and \nonline information. Yet, the same technology poses challenges to law \nenforcement when it is exploited by criminals to hide evidence or the \nfruits of criminal activities. A report by the U.S. Working Group on \nOrganized Crime titled, ``Encryption and Evolving Technologies: Tools \nof Organized Crime and Terrorism,'' released in 1997, collected \nanecdotal case studies on the use of encryption in furtherance of \ncriminal activities in order to estimate the future impact of \nencryption on law enforcement. The report noted the need for ``an \nongoing study of the effect of encryption and other information \ntechnologies on investigations, prosecutions, and intelligence \noperations''. As part of this study, ``a database of case information \nfrom federal and local law enforcement and intelligence agencies should \nbe established and maintained.'' Adding a requirement that reports be \nfurnished on the number of occasions when encryption is encountered by \nlaw enforcement is a far more reliable basis than anecdotal evidence on \nwhich to assess law enforcement needs and make sensible policy in this \narea.\n  The final section of S. 1769 would codify the information that the \nAttorney General already provides on pen register and trap and trace \ndevice orders, and would require further information on where such \norders are issued and the types of facilities--telephone, computer, \npager or other device--to which the order relates. Under the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act (``ECPA'') of 1986, P.O. 99-508, codified at \n18 U.S.C. 3126, the Attorney General of the United States is required \nto report annually to the Congress on the number of pen register orders \nand orders for trap and trace devices applied for by law enforcement \nagencies of the Department of Justice. As the original sponsor of ECPA, \nI believed that adequate oversight of the surveillance activities of \nfederal law enforcement could only be accomplished with reporting \nrequirements such as the one included in this law.\n  The reports furnished by the Attorney General on an annual basis \ncompile information from five components of the Department of Justice: \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the United \nStates Marshals Service and the Office of the Inspector General. The \nreport contains information on the number of original and extension \norders made to the courts for authorization to use both pen register \nand trap and trace devices, information concerning the number of \ninvestigations involved, the offenses on which the applications were \npredicted and the number of people whose telephone facilities were \naffected.\n  These specific categories of information are useful, and S. 1769 \nwould direct the Attorney General to continue providing these specific \ncategories of information. In addition, the bill would direct the \nAttorney General to include information on the identity, including the \ndistrict, of the agency making the application and the person \nauthorizing the order. In this way, the Congress and the public will be \ninformed of those jurisdictions and using this surveillance technique--\ninformation which is currently not included in the Attorney General's \nannual reports.\n  The requirement for preparation of the wiretap reports will soon \nlapse so I am delighted to see the Congress take prompt action on this \nlegislation to continue the requirement for submission of the wiretap \nreports and to update the reporting requirements for both the wiretap \nreports submitted by the AO and the pen register and trap and trace \nreports submitted by the Attorney General.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.
