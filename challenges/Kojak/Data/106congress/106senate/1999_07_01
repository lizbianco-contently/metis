Mr. President, I wish to make a comment about \nReverend Lyons, who just opened our Senate session with a prayer, \nbecause he is a very special person to me and to the State of Texas and \nreally to all Americans.\n  A little over a year ago, a heinous crime was committed in the small \ntown of Jasper, TX, when James Byrd, Jr., was brutally murdered simply \nbecause of his race, dragged to death by three men in a pickup truck. \nThe senseless killing riveted the Nation and many feared the outbreak \nof civil disorder. But Rev. Kenneth Lyons helped still the troubled \nwaters. He is pastor of Greater New Bethel Baptist Church where James \nByrd's family worshipped every Sunday.\n  Pastor Lyons spoke fearlessly to people of all races. He said, ``This \nmust have been a divine wake-up call to the consciences of men. You \ncan't fight fire with fire.'' He urged not vengeance but harmony and \npeace.\n  Reverend Lyons' wise leadership personified Abraham Lincoln's call to \nthe ``better angels of our nature.'' He helped unite the people of \nJasper, TX, in their commitment to equality and justice, to rise above \nhatred and despair.\n  Millions of Americans watched that small town of Jasper, TX, as it \ncame together because of Reverend Lyons' plea for redemption and \nhealing. Because of his faith and eloquence, we are better people.\n\n\n                       Response In Jasper, Texas\n\n  There are other heroes in Jasper, TX, and it was one of the great \nmoments of my life to be able to go to Pastor Lyons' church and attend \nthe burial ceremony for James Byrd, Jr., and to meet the kind of people \nwho make this country what it is. I met James Byrd, Sr., and Mrs. Byrd, \nRenee Mullins, James Byrd, Jr.'s daughter, and his son. I met people \nwho had just endured something that none of us ever want to have any of \nour family or friends ever endure. James Byrd, Sr., was saying: There \nis no hate here; there is love in this family.\n  That was the beginning of the healing process not only in Jasper, TX, \nbut a model for America--when something we cannot possibly understand \nhappens, someone steps forward and says we can't let this tear all of \nus down. James Byrd, Sr., started that process.\n  I want to talk about Billy Rowles, the Jasper County sheriff, who did \nnot let one minute pass when he got that call on that fateful Sunday \nmorning and he heard the beginning of what was\n\n[[Page S7974]]\n\ngoing to be a nightmare for his town. Billy Rowles started making \ncalls, and he said: This is not going to stand. We are going to have \njustice in Jasper County. We are going to have justice from what I am \nhearing over the phone on Sunday morning. And because of Billy Rowles' \nleadership, justice is on its way.\n  The mayor of Jasper is R.C. Horn. He was right there on the phone \ntalking to Pastor Lyons, making calls to all of the clergy in Jasper, \nTX, that Sunday morning, setting the tone for what would be the \nmessage: That this community is not a bad community and I want every \none of you in your pulpits on Sunday morning to say this is a community \nof love. Mayor Horn was one of those people who started the healing \nprocess.\n  Guy James Gray, the district attorney of Jasper County, was not going \nto let anything slip by. He was going to make sure the people who \nperpetrated this heinous crime would come to justice.  Of the three \npeople who have been accused, thanks to the good work of Guy James \nGray, one has been convicted.\n\n  And there is Walter Diggles, the executive director of the Deep East \nTexas Council of Governments, always there behind the scenes, trying to \nhelp in this first week when all of the attention was focused on \nJasper, TX. Jasper, TX, had never had the attention of the world \nfocused on it.\n  But because of Walter Diggles, Billy Rowles, and Guy James Gray and \nMayor Horn and the James Byrd, Jr. family, these people were able to \nwithstand all the television cameras and all the people who came from \noutside to give them advice they did not really need because they knew \nwhat was the right thing to do. They knew that to keep their community \ntogether they were going to have to talk about love, not hate. They did \nnot need anybody coming in from outside to tell them that because they \nwere speaking from the heart. They didn't have focus groups and they \ndidn't have advisers and psychiatrists. They did not need organizers \nand spinmeisters because they were doing it from the heart. And they \nhave created a model that every community will follow if it wants to \nkeep a community together after a terrible tragedy.\n  I want to add one more to this list because I have never seen \nanything like what happened in the trial of the first of those accused \nof this murder. There you saw the father of the accused, named Ronald \nKing, sitting in the courtroom every day, absolutely devastated by what \nhis son was accused of doing. This father, who adopted this boy to give \nhim a chance in life, sat in that courtroom in support of his son, but \ndevastated at what he was hearing in the courtroom. Mr. King came out \nof that courthouse every day, and he said: I don't blame the Byrd \nfamily for any bad feelings that they would have, and I apologize to \nthe Byrd family. I support my son and I love my son and I always will, \nMr. King said, but he said I understand how James Byrd, Sr. and his \nfamily feel and my heart goes out to them.\n  James Byrd, Sr. reached back to Ronald King and he said: I understand \nyour pain. This is not your fault, and we will be strong together.\n  Ronald King is a hero, too, because what Pastor Lyons and the city of \nJasper and all of those I have mentioned have done for our country is \nto show us that the spiritual community can make a difference by \npreaching love when there is a lot of opportunity for hate, and how \nthat divine love can keep a community together, can make us remember \nour strengths in this country, and not dwell on the weaknesses.\n  I applaud Jasper, TX, and these leaders and Pastor Lyons, whom we \nhave heard today; James Byrd, Sr. and his family; and Ronald King, for \nshowing us that this is a great country and we are going to take a \nterrible tragedy and we are going to make this country stronger, as I \nbelieve it is today, because of a very small group of people who didn't \nneed national advisers to tell them what was right. In fact, they have \nshown us what is right about our country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S7974-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 1 hour for debate prior to \ncloture vote on the motion to proceed. The time will be equally divided \nbetween the two leaders.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need to \nmake an initial statement. Then we will have speakers on our side and \nwork with the Democratic side to work out the remainder of the time.\n  Today is the 73rd day since we began the process of trying to move \nforward with a Social Security lockbox. I think, from every indication, \nwe finally will begin to make some progress this morning. I hope this \nwill be a rapid process from this point forward, that things will not \nbe delayed much longer, and we can quickly come to some type of \nagreement for orderly consideration of this proposal.\n  It is vitally important we not delay any longer. Since we introduced \nthis amendment on April 20, the following has taken place: $22.2 \nbillion more of the Social Security surplus or almost 20 percent of \nthis year's surplus has been put in danger of being raided. The House \nvoted 416 to 12 to pass their own version of a lockbox, a version that \nwe could not consider in this body. The President himself has endorsed \nthe idea of a lockbox and stated that Social Security taxes should be \nsaved for Social Security. Yesterday, the Democratic leader indicated \nthe Democrats would not block this motion to proceed. So I see this as \na positive.\n  What I have to say is very simple. It is clear that Americans, \nregardless of where they might live, believe their Social Security \ndollars ought to be used for Social Security. I cannot imagine there is \na Member of the Senate who does not hear that message when talking to \nseniors in their States or, for that matter, when talking to anyone who \nis paying payroll taxes. The American people are frustrated when they \nhear that money they send here for Social Security is being spent on \nother programs. To some extent, this was justified during the period in \nwhich we were running budget deficits. But today we are not. Today we \nare running surpluses. The latest news is good news. It seems to me it \neven further justifies creating a lockbox to make sure none of these \nSocial Security dollars are any longer spent on anything except Social \nSecurity. The only way to do it, in my view, is to pass legislation \nsuch as S. 557, such as the proposal that will be before us today.\n  So I ask my colleagues to not only give us the chance to move forward \non this legislation but to work together to craft a proposal as soon as \nwe possibly can so we can be sure these Social Security dollars do not \nget spent on other programs. It is a very attractive thing, to talk of \nnew programs, of expanding existing programs, and so on, because today \nwe are in a period of economic prosperity and we are running surpluses. \nBut we should take this opportunity, in my view, to at least fence off \nthe Social Security surplus so it cannot be used for other programs. I \nam hopeful today we can take an important step toward that end so I can \ngo back to Michigan and tell the people in my State their Social \nSecurity payroll tax dollars are going to be protected. That is what I \nwant to do. I suspect that is what a lot of other Members of the \nChamber want to do.\n  I am hopeful that after today, once we get through the recess period, \nwe will move expeditiously to finish the job. Social Security dollars \nought to be spent on Social Security. We should move as quickly as \npossible to make that the case. So I am very optimistic, if we are \nsuccessful with the cloture vote today, we can move in that direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may need to the \nSenator from Missouri.\n\n[[Page S7975]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nhis outstanding leadership on this issue.\n  Today the Senate will vote for the fifth time to stop filibusters on \nlegislation to protect Social Security trust funds. It is time for us \nto stop, to end the delay. It is time for us to align ourselves with \nthe American people who overwhelmingly want us to protect the money \nthey put into the Social Security trust fund and to reserve it for \nSocial Security payments. We should pass this bill so protecting Social \nSecurity will be the law of the land. It is time to build a tough law, \na firewall if you will, between politicians' desires to spend and the \nSocial Security trust fund.\n  There is no addiction more pervasive in this city than the spending \nof money. It is a tough habit to break, but we are in a position to do \nso. We are in a position to say we can manage our affairs without this \nmoney; let us make a commitment forever to break this habit of spending \nthe Social Security trust funds.\n  President Clinton's proposed budget in January would have spent $158 \nbillion in Social Security surplus over the next 5 years out of the \ntrust fund, but, thank goodness, this last week President Clinton \nannounced that he does not want to do that. That concept is no longer \nhis plan. Instead of spending that $158 billion over 5 years in other \nprojects, he said he wants to reserve it for Social Security--every \npenny for Social Security. ``Social Security taxes should be saved for \nSocial Security, period.''\n  What a tremendous concept. It is one which we have been working on \nand we have been working to pass. The President has announced his \nsupport for it. It is a general concept which the House of \nRepresentatives has supported. In its recent vote a couple weeks ago, \nthe House voted 416-12.\n  We look for bipartisan things to do in this city, things that unite \nus instead of divide us, things that mobilize the American people, \nthings that find common objectives and common ground. Here is an item \nthe American people overwhelmingly endorse. Here is an item on which \nthe House of Representatives really reflects the American people, 416-\n12. That is an overwhelming vote. And the President of the United \nStates endorses the lockbox.\n  What is interesting is that the President's endorsement is of the \nlockbox. He just did not say we should not spend Social Security as a \ngeneral concept or a general idea or a principle by which we operate \nGovernment. When we talk about a lockbox, we are talking about \ninstitutionalizing the prohibition, not just saying this is something \nwe hope to do in future years. By saying we want to build a lockbox, we \nhave to build a structure for protecting Social Security, and that is \nsomething the President has said he wants--a structure, a lockbox, \nsomething that keeps us from making these expenditures.\n  For the past 6 months, this Congress has been devoted to protecting \nall the Social Security surplus. In January, congressional Republicans \nbegan working to ensure that Congress would protect every penny of the \nsurplus. In March, Senator Domenici and I introduced S. 502, called the \nProtect Social Security Benefits Act, which would have instituted a \npoint of order preventing Congress from spending any Social Security \ndollars for non-Social Security purposes.\n  What does a point of order mean? A point of order means that if there \nis a point of order and someone tries to do it, the Chair, the \nPresiding Officer, can say it is out of order. Most Americans have been \npart of some kind of meeting somewhere when someone brought something \nup that was out of order. The gavel goes down, and the person presiding \nover the meeting says: We are not going to discuss that; that is not a \npart of what we do. There is a point of order against it. It is out of \norder, and you move on to something else.\n  That is the way we propose to treat proposals that will spend the \nSocial Security surplus. We will simply say: We don't do that; it is \nagainst our rules; it is out of order, we will move on to something \nelse. That was S. 502.\n  Then in April, together with Senator Domenici, the Senate  passed a \nbudget resolution that did not spend any of the Social Security \nsurpluses for the next decade. Included in the resolution was language \nendorsing the idea of locking away the Social Security surpluses, sort \nof a rules of the Senate lockbox but not a statutory lockbox. A \nstatutory lockbox, of course, would bind the House, the Senate, and the \nPresident. This language passed the Senate with unanimous approval.\n\n  Also in April, Senators Abraham, Domenici, and I offered the Social \nSecurity lockbox amendment which would have added executive \nresponsibilities to the congressional requirement to protect the Social \nSecurity surpluses. By ``executive responsibilities,'' we were really \nsaying the President had to submit a budget that did not invade the \nSocial Security surplus as part of the President's plan.\n  The Senate has voted on the Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft plan three \ntimes so far, and I believe we will agree to the motion to proceed \ntoday. But until today, the Senate has filibustered, has said we will \nnot go there. Frankly, the President of the United States wants to go \nthere, the American people want to go there. The President had the \ncourage to reverse his position, first saying, ``I want to spend some \nof that money,'' then saying, ``No, we should reserve every cent for \nSocial Security, period.''\n  On May 26, the House of Representatives, reflecting, I believe, the \npeople of America--and that is really what we are supposed to do in \nmany respects; that is why we are sent here--overwhelmingly passed H.R. \n1259, Congressman Herger's measure to protect the surpluses. The vote \nin that case, as I have already mentioned, was 416-12. That means for \nevery 100 votes in favor of the measure, there were only 3 votes \nagainst the measure. Mr. President, 100 to 3 is a pretty strong margin. \nThat is a bipartisan consensus. This reflects the will of the people.\n  On June 10, Democrats in the Senate blocked the Herger measure. They \nvoted against moving even to consider it.\n  It is time we stop this kind of parliamentary maneuver. We all know \nwhat the will of the American people is. We know what the clear \nstatement of the President of the United States is. We know what we \nhave done on five previous occasions, refusing to discuss it. Today we \nshould vote to move forward on this issue.\n  The lockbox will accomplish an important goal: Protect Social \nSecurity taxes. It will reserve those taxes for Social Security, and \nSocial Security alone, so that when someday those who need Social \nSecurity want to call on this Government for the payment of their \nbenefit, the Government will be stronger, having less debt, having more \ndiscipline, having a greater capacity to meet its obligations and to \nhonor the commitments made under Social Security.\n  Those who say they want to protect Social Security should join us in \nour efforts to save every dime--no, let me correct that--every penny, \nevery cent of this money for Social Security's future beneficiaries. \nThis lockbox is a way to make this happen.\n  Congress has been moving to create a Social Security lockbox this \nentire year. President Clinton has now stated he agrees with us, and I \nwelcome the support of the President and Senate Democrats in finishing \nthe Nation's business in supporting the toughest possible lockbox \nmeasure, one that protects not 20 percent, not 40 percent, not 60 \npercent, not 80 percent, not 99 percent, but 100 percent of the Social \nSecurity surpluses, protects them so they are available to meet the \nresponsibilities of the Social Security system.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the \ntime of those in support of the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I do not oppose the motion to proceed. I \nexpect the Senate will perhaps vote unanimously to proceed on this \nissue, but I do want to give some historic perspective to this issue of \na lockbox.\n  I proposed a lockbox amendment in 1983. I offered an amendment the \nday\n\n[[Page S7976]]\n\nwhen the Ways and Means Committee passed the Social Security reform \npackage in 1983. I said: If we do not put this extra Social Security \nmoney away, it will be used as part of the operating budget and it will \nnot be saved. My amendment lost in the Ways and Means Committee in \n1983. So this is not a new idea.\n  One of the interesting things about this debate is, it was not too \nmany years ago that we debated a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget in the Senate. I voted against that, and the constitutional \namendment lost by one vote. I went through some very interesting times \npolitically back home and across the country because I cast a vote that \ndefeated the constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  One of the points I continued to make in the Senate as we debated \nthat--and I was accused of talking about gimmicks and using gimmicks at \nthat point--was the constitutional amendment to balance the budget was \nwritten in a way that said all revenue that comes into the Federal \nGovernment shall be considered revenue for the purposes of the budget. \nThere was no distinction between Social Security moneys and other \nmoneys; it is all operating budget revenue. To the extent we require a \nbalanced budget, it means we can use the Social Security money as \nordinary revenue and then we can claim we balanced the budget. I said \nthat is writing in the Constitution the invitation to continue doing \nwhat we have been doing, which is looting Social Security.\n  What I heard in response was no. There were three stages of denial:\n  First, we deny we are looting Social Security. That was the first \nstage of denial.\n  The second was: Well, even though we deny it, if, in fact, we are \ndoing it, we promise to quit.\n  And the third stage of denial was: We insist we are not doing it, but \nif we are doing it, we promise to quit. And if we can't quit it, we \nwill at least taper off.\n  Those were the three stages of denial in the Senate.\n  Because those of us who said, we will not write into the Constitution \nan amendment that permits forever the use of Social Security trust \nfunds as part of the operating budget, we were told: Well, would it be \nall right if we said we will keep using the Social Security trust funds \nfor the next 12 years? I said: No, that would not be all right. So that \nwas the debate back a few years ago.\n  Now we come to a debate today, and the folks who then called our \nposition on Social Security revenues a gimmick are now proposing a \nlockbox. I say, I think we should have a lockbox. But I do not think \nyou ought to do a lockbox in isolation. I think you should have a \nlockbox with respect to the Social Security revenues so they cannot be \nused for ordinary operating revenue. That money is taken from workers' \npaychecks. It is called Social Security dedicated taxes. It goes into a \ndedicated fund and ought not be available under any circumstances for \nany other purposes. That is the point we made on the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget.\n  I have some charts here, that I will not use, that describe what was \ntold to us during that debate: Gee, you're standing up talking about \ngimmicks. Of course you have to use the Social Security money as part \nof the regular budget in order to balance the budget. You can't balance \nthe budget without using Social Security money.\n  History, of course, shows that was nonsense. But here we are, and the \nquestion is the lockbox. We ought to have a lockbox. We ought to do \nseveral things at the same time, however. Because I worry. I see this \nweek Reuters has a press story: ``How Republicans Propose $1 trillion \nin tax cuts.'' If you do a lockbox on Social Security revenues only and \nthen say, all right, now we have locked away Social Security revenues \nonly, and we propose $1 trillion in tax cuts, the question in two areas \nis: What have you done to extend the life of Social Security? And what \nhave you done in this fiscal policy to extend the life of Medicare?\n  Unfortunately, the answer in both cases could be, you have done \nnothing to save for Medicare; and while you might have given $1 \ntrillion in tax cuts, you may have done nothing to extend, even by 1 \nyear, the Social Security program.\n  So let us do a couple of things. Let us do--together--a lockbox. I \nsupport that. I was ridiculed for it back in the constitutional \namendment debate, but I have always supported it. I supported it going \nback to 1983 when I offered the amendment to do it in the House Ways \nand Means Committee. But let us not just do the lockbox. Let's do the \nlockbox the right way. Secondly, let us make sure that some of the \nadditional revenue that is available extends the life of Medicare and \nextends the life of Social Security. I ask unanimous consent for 2 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This would provide a guarantee that the revenue stream \nfor Social Security is available only for Social Security; that is, the \ntax money that is available for it goes only into the Social Security \ntrust fund and can be used only for that purpose.\n  But it would do two other things as well. It would say, let us use \nsome additional resources not just for a $1 trillion tax cut but also \nto extend the life of Social Security and the life of Medicare. Doing \nboth of these things, I think, will give the American people the \nreassurance that both of these programs, which have been so important \nin the lives of so many Americans in this country, will be available \nfor many years to come.\n\n  I do not think, as I said when I started, there will be a debate here \non whether we should proceed. Let's proceed. I expect the motion to \nproceed will carry, perhaps unanimously. We will have a debate on the \nlockbox issue.\n  But my point is, let us not debate that in isolation. Let us debate \nit with the eye on this ball: That we need to extend the life of Social \nSecurity and extend the life of Medicare, even as we do what we should \nhave done long ago; and that is, make certain that no Social Security \nrevenues are used for any purpose other than the solvency of the Social \nSecurity system itself. That is what workers expect. That is the basis \non which money is taken from their paychecks and put into a dedicated \ntax fund. That is what senior citizens expect from this program, which \nwas a solemn promise made to them many decades ago.\n  I thank the Senator from New Jersey for the time. I look forward to \nthe debate following the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield myself such time as is necessary to make some \nremarks.\n  Mr. President, I say thank you to the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota because he kind of hit the nail on the head. Let's get on \nwith this debate. That is the question. And whether or not we disguise \nit in terms of votes to the public at large--and cloture votes and \nthings of that nature may seem rather arcane to the public--the main \nthing is to get on with the discussion.\n  I am supporting the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 557, \nwhich is the legislation to reform the budget rules governing emergency \nspending. I am going to support cloture on the motion to move ahead \nwith this--we call it a motion to proceed--to get on with the debate, \nnot only because I support the underlying legislation, which amends the \nrules governing emergency spending but, more importantly, because like \nmost, if not all, Democrats, I strongly support the establishment of a \nSocial Security and Medicare lockbox. It is time for a real debate to \noccur on a lockbox. And I look forward to that debate.\n  Democrats have long argued that protecting Social Security and \nMedicare should be Congress' top priority. We believe that strongly. We \nsimply must prepare our country for the impending retirement of the \nbaby boomers. We ought to do it now, particularly since we are going \nthrough this incredible prosperity, a prosperity never before seen in \nthis country.\n  To help achieve that goal, Senator Conrad and I proposed our own \nversion of a Social Security and Medicare lockbox. It is a lockbox that \nreserves the surpluses for both Social Security and Medicare--reserves \nthem; you cannot touch them--without creating the threat of what is now \nproposed, which could be a Government-wide default.\n\n[[Page S7977]]\n\n Our lockbox has much stricter enforcement than the weak one that was \napproved by the House of Representatives.\n\n  Early this week, President Clinton also proposed to establish a \nSocial Security and Medicare lockbox. His proposal not only would \nprevent Congress from spending Social Security surpluses in any year, \nbut it would extend the solvency of the trust fund to the year 2053.\n  Although all of the details of the President's plan have not been \nworked out yet, I strongly support his general approach. I am hopeful \nit can win with bipartisan support. We would like to see it that way.\n  The distinguished Senator from Michigan, Senator Abraham, and Senator \nDomenici have proposed a different version of a lockbox which has been \noffered as an amendment to the previous bill S. 557. Unfortunately, \ntheir lockbox is seriously openable. In fact, as Treasury Secretary \nRubin has written, instead of protecting Social Security benefits, \ntheir lockbox actually would threaten benefits. That is because it \ncould trigger a Government-wide default based on factors beyond \nCongress' control.\n  Such a default would make it impossible to pay Social Security \nbenefits. They can call it what they will--lockbox, cash drawer, \nwhatever--but it will still impair the possibility, at some point, to \npay the Social Security benefits. The issue before the Senate today \nisn't whether we are for or against the Abraham-Domenici lockbox. It is \nnot whether we are for or against the Democratic lockbox. The issue is \nwhether we should proceed to a debate about lockbox legislation at all. \nI believe we should. It should be an open debate. Senators should have \nthe right to offer amendments, but we should go ahead and get that \ndebate underway.\n  In the past, the majority has tried to stifle that debate and to push \nthrough their own version of a lockbox without giving the Democrats and \nthe American people an opportunity to present and to consider \namendments. We Democrats have rightly resisted that. We cannot be \ngagged, and we will not be locked out of the legislative process, \nespecially on an issue as important as protecting Social Security.\n  Having said that, nobody should doubt the commitment of Senate \nDemocrats to support a Social Security and Medicare lockbox. I take a \nmoment here to identify what a lockbox is to represent: a place you \ncan't invade for any other reason except to make sure that Social \nSecurity is there for the longest period of time available for those \nwho are paying into this system, the money to pay those benefits is \ngoing to be there.\n  Another major concern of the American public, the elderly public \nparticularly, is Medicare. Will it run out of funds before the 50-year-\nold is there to have his or her health care protected? That is what we \nare debating. We ought not to be talking about process. We ought to be \ntalking about what are the promises that we are trying to fulfill.\n  One is that Social Security will be there when you get there and you \nwant it and you need it. Two is that Medicare is there to help protect \nthe health of an aging population.\n  I expect there is going to be a very strong vote on this side of the \naisle in support of moving to proceed to that debate. Unfortunately, \nwhat we have heard is that the majority will then file cloture on the \nbill itself. Another explanation. Cloture means to shut down the \ndebate, not permit the Democrats to add amendments, not to permit the \nAmerican public to hear the full discussion. That is the issue--\ncontinuing to block our ability to offer any open, new ideas to their \noriginal proposal.\n  Well, if that is true, it is outrageous. It is the kind of political \ngame that has been played on this floor on this issue from day 1. \nApparently the majority isn't as anxious to get a Social Security \nlockbox as they pretend to be. They just want to force the Democrats to \ncast votes against cloture, against continuing the debate, against \npermitting the debate.\n  Well, Democrats have to oppose cloture, if we are being blocked from \noffering amendments. That doesn't mean we are being obstructive. It \ndoesn't mean we are filibustering the bill. We just have to protect our \nrights and the citizens' rights as we see them.\n  What the Republicans want to do is force us to cast these cloture \nvotes and then claim that we are filibustering the lockbox. It is \nwrong, and they are aware of it. They want to shut us out of the \ndebate. We represent a significant part of the American public. Whether \nthey voted for us or they didn't, we represent them.\n  This isn't just playing politics. It is unfair, and it is especially \nunbecoming of a party that is in the majority and purportedly running \nGovernment. They should be spending their time getting legislation \npassed, not just forcing Democrats to walk the line, to cast votes that \nthey can later misrepresent for political gain.\n  President Clinton has reached out his hand with a proposal that \nobviously lays the groundwork for a bipartisan deal. He is known to \ninclude Republicans in discussions about things. I serve on the Budget \nCommittee. I am the senior Democrat. This is the third President with \nwhom I have served. I have never seen a President more anxious to \ndiscuss his ideas on legislation with the other side than President \nClinton.\n  He said he is willing to compromise on tax cuts. He said he wants to \nwork with the Congress. What is the response from the majority? \nPartisan politics. You have to ask why. Do they really think it makes \nany difference whether there are five cloture votes instead of four? It \nis a mischaracterization. Who is trying to kid whom? This goes beyond \npetty. It really is unfair and pathetic.\n  I hope we are going to stop these political games. Then let us sit \ndown on a bipartisan basis and do the work of the people. Let us \ndevelop a real lockbox that makes sense to both of us, a consensus \nview, and one that really protects Social Security and Medicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Michigan for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nPennsylvania would like.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from \nPennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have to comment on the statement of \nthe Senator from New Jersey.\n  One of the more vexing problems we have in political debate in \nAmerica is who is telling the truth. What I am going to tell you is 180 \ndegrees from what the Senator from New Jersey just said. What he \nrepeatedly said is true is, in fact, not true.\n  What the Senator from New Jersey said is that the Democrats would not \nbe able to offer amendments on the Social Security lockbox as a result \nof the cloture votes that were taken on April 22, April 30, and June \n15. That is not true.\n  Let me state that again, emphatically, to the Senator from New Jersey \nand to the American public: What the Senator from New Jersey just said, \nwhich is that Democrats were blocked from offering amendments on the \nissue of a Social Security lockbox, is not true. So the entire speech \nwe just heard was, in fact, a statement which had no basis in fact. \nThat is true.\n  The Senator from New Jersey could have opposed cloture and offered \nall the amendments he wanted on the Social Security lockbox. We could \nhave had hours, days of debate on a Social Security lockbox. We wanted \nto have those kinds of debates. They refused.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Isn't it so that the tree--I don't want to use arcane \nlanguage; I always try to get away from that so the public understands \nwhat we are talking about. Weren't we blocked from amendments by virtue \nof the fact that the amendment tree was filled by the Republicans?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The April 22 vote was a vote on cloture on the first-\ndegree amendment. The tree was not filled. It was a first-degree \namendment vote on cloture, No. 1. We wanted a vote on that particular \namendment, yes.\n  After that amendment would have passed or failed, you were then \navailable to offer all the amendments you\n\n[[Page S7978]]\n\nwanted on Social Security. You could have offered your own Social \nSecurity lockbox. You could have taken the Abraham bill and changed the \nwording in it, and we could have had a vote on that, but you did not \nwant to do that. You did not want to have that debate. You refused us \neven getting into a vote. All we wanted to do with these cloture \nmotions was to say: Give us a clean vote on this particular proposal. \nAfter that, you are free to amend it. You are free to offer your own; \nyou can do whatever you want. You can offer a Medicare lockbox. You can \ndo whatever you want. Just give us a vote on our proposal and then you \nare welcome to do whatever else you want. You said emphatically, \nunanimously, three times: No.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask the Senator, if he will indulge another \nquestion, was the tree filled with second-degree amendments?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That was not the statement of the Senator from New \nJersey. He made the statement that he could not offer amendments. The \nanswer is, he could have offered amendments.\n  What we wanted was a vote on the Abraham-Domenici bill. After that \nvote, he was free to amend that proposal. He was free to offer his own \nproposal. There could have been a full and open debate on Social \nSecurity lockbox, after he gave us a vote on our amendment.\n  I don't think that is an unreasonable thing to ask.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Well, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for the \ncourtesy. But the fact of the matter is that there was an obstruction \nto us offering amendments until the Republicans were certain that they \nhad their amendment considered in its raw form. Frankly, to me, that \nwas blocking Democrats from having it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. All I say to the Senator from New Jersey is that all we \nasked for is to give us a clean up-or-down vote on our amendment. After \nthat amendment, you could have amended that thing, you could have \noffered your own, done anything you wanted. All we wanted to make sure \nof was that we had a clean vote on our amendment to start this debate, \nand after that, you could have done anything you wanted.\n  By the way, if you look at the statement you just read into the \nRecord, you said exactly the opposite of what I just said. You said you \ncould not have offered amendments when, in fact, you could have. You \nstill had the right to, and you chose not to because you didn't want to \nenter into this debate.\n  We see a wonderful willingness on the part of the Democrats now, \nafter the President joined our side in saying we want a lockbox, to \nopen up and debate this and offer amendments, when you had the very \nsame opportunity four times to do the same thing.\n  I welcome that. I welcome that we are going to have an opportunity to \nfocus in on what I think is one of the most important things--not just \nfor Social Security but important things for the long-term fiscal \nfuture of this country, this government; that is, putting in place a \nprovision that says if you are going to spend more money on new \ngovernment programs, or even if they are going to spend money on tax \ncuts, you are not going to spend it on Social Security unless you stand \nup before this Senate and before the American public and say: We are \ngoing to take Social Security dollars. We believe it is more important \nto do tax cuts. We believe it is more important to do funding for \neducation or funding for defense than it is to provide money for Social \nSecurity.\n  That is the vote we are looking for. That is the vote of \naccountability that we want every Member of the Senate to have to cast. \nThat is the fiscal discipline, when people have to make that choice, \nand it is clear to everybody what the choice is. We have lots of points \nof order and procedural things, but then everybody sort of walks out of \nthe room and spins it their way. In this case, with the lockbox vote, \nwhere it says you have to vote on a motion that says we will spend \nSocial Security money for X or Y or Z, you have to tell the American \npeople that you believe that is a higher priority than Social Security.\n  We have no such vote today. But if we pass a lockbox, then the \nAmerican public will know what your choices are. There may be a \nsituation where we need to spend Social Security money. Frankly, I \ncan't think of one, but there may be one--an emergency, a true \nemergency, where our national security is at risk. There may be a \nsituation where we want to spend Social Security dollars, but it has to \nbe voted on. That is the most important thing. That is what the other \nside never wanted to have happen.\n  I thank the President for breaking the logjam over there. The House \nDemocrats did a pretty good job; they passed a Social Security lockbox \nbill. But it was the folks on the other side who stood as the dam to \nthis current that was flowing through the Congress. I thank the \nPresident for getting the beavers to work, getting them out of the way \nand making sure we can have a full, fair, and open debate--as we could \nhave three or four times previous to this. We could have had a full, \nfair, open debate in the Senate about a very important issue, yes, for \nSocial Security but just as important to the fiscal discipline of the \nU.S. Government in the future.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from New Mexico, \nMr. Abraham and Mr. Domenici, for their excellent work on this issue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do the Republicans have \nleft?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes 18 seconds are remaining on the \nRepublican side; 12 minutes 12 seconds are remaining on the Democrat \nside.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield me 4 minutes?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield the Senator as much time as he needs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, please tell me when I have used 4 \nminutes.\n  I say to the President of the United States: Thank you very much, Mr. \nPresident. You have agreed with us on one of the most important issues \nconfronting the senior citizens of this Nation. In your budget and your \nrecommendations in the past, during this fiscal year, you suggested \nthat only 62 percent of the Social Security trust fund be saved and put \nin a trust fund and stay there for senior citizens for their Social \nSecurity. We suggested in our budget resolution that anything short of \n100 percent was not right. After weeks of debate in this body, without \nan opportunity to get a vote on an amendment that would have said that \nand would have locked it tightly in place, the President of the United \nStates announced that there are more resources available because the \nsurpluses are bigger and decided that he agreed with the Republicans \nthat 100 percent of the Social Security trust fund should be set aside \nfor Social Security purposes.\n  Now the time has come for the Senate to do that. This is not an issue \nof Medicare. This is an issue of the Social Security trust fund being \navailable for no purpose other than Social Security. In the meantime, \nit is used to reduce the national debt. That is the program, that is \nthe plan, that is the safest and fairest thing for seniors across this \nland.\n\n  Pretty soon, we are going to find out whether that is really the \nissue or whether there is another issue, and that other issue is, even \nif you have done that and set it aside and locked it away, should there \nbe a tax cut? It would appear that for some reason, the President of \nthe United States and maybe a majority of the Democrats in the Senate \ndon't want to let the American people have a refund of the taxes they \nhave overpaid. And now we learn from both auditing or accounting \nentities, the President's and ours, that that surplus is even bigger \nthan we thought. That is aside from the Social Security trust fund--in \naddition to it, without touching it.\n  The issue, then, is what kind of gimmick are we going to use to eat \nup that surplus so there is no money available to give back to the \nAmerican people? That is the issue. The issue will be couched as if we \nshould put $350 billion of this non-Social Security surplus in a \nMedicare trust fund. But the President's own proposals belie the \nnecessity for that and just give it a birth--you open it up and you can \nsee it for what it is, an effort to deny the American people a tax cut \nbecause, lo and behold, the President said we can reform Medicare. We \ncan actually put in place prescription drugs. And what is\n\n[[Page S7979]]\n\nthe price tag? Let's just agree that the President has a good number--\nhow about that, I say to Senator Abraham--$46 billion, not $396 \nbillion; $46 billion is what he says we need during the next decade to \nprovide prescription drugs, which he deems to be good for the senior \ncitizens of America. He is crossing this land and saying: I am for \nprescription drugs.\n  We are for prescription drugs. In fact, we are so pleased that the \nPresident has acknowledged exactly that situation that we are almost \nprepared to say--as soon as we run some numbers --that we can do better \nthan you have done in terms of prescription drugs for senior citizens \nwho need prescription drug assistance.\n  But let's remember, he says we need $46 billion. We are going to hear \nsome arguments about the lockbox, saying let's have another lockbox for \nMedicare and let's take a bunch of the money that the taxpayers ought \nto get and put it over there in a trust fund under the rubric that it \nwill help get rid of the deficit, that it will bring down the deficit \nof the United States, the overall debt--even though the three major \naccounting entities that have testified said it will be the same thing \nwhether you put it in there or not. It has no impact because at some \npoint you have to pay off those IOUs, and that means a tax increase.\n  Now, this is rather complicated, but the truth of the matter is--\nlisten up, seniors--we are going to provide a prescription drug benefit \nas good as the President's or better. Let's focus on that. That is what \nwe are going to do. Indeed, we are going to put every nickel--I remind \neverybody it takes $120 billion more for the trust fund to get all it \nis entitled to, according to CBO. We are going to put more than $1.8 \ntrillion in. We are going to put $1.9 trillion in that trust fund.\n\n  In summary, we are making some headway. It is slow and tedious.\n  I assume that today all Members on the other side of the aisle are \ngoing to vote for cloture on the motion to proceed. I believe that is \nthe case. It will be 100 to nothing, as if they have agreed to a \nlockbox. Actually, that is a wasted vote, if there are going to be 100. \nThey are just deciding they all want to go home and say: We are for the \nlockbox also.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we vitiate the yeas and \nnays on the lockbox motion to proceed----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We object.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May I finish? I wasn't finished.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am sorry. Please continue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May I finish my consent request? I would like to make \nsure it makes some sense.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we dispense with that vote and that we \nproceed to substitute for that a motion as if cloture was before us on \nthe actual lockbox amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  If the Senator has a little time later, I would be glad to use \nanother minute.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Republicans control 2 minutes 54 seconds. The Democrats have 12 \nminutes 12 seconds.\n  The question from the Chair is, Who yields time?\n  If neither side yields time, the time will be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time not be counted to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  Mr. President, we are going through an exercise about what is being \ncharacterized by the Democrats and what is being characterized by the \nRepublicans as an imperfect lockbox situation--a lockbox \nrecommendation.\n  I want to try to get this debate on this subject itself instead of \nthe process. The fact of the matter is that if we try to define what \nconstitutes a lockbox--we heard the Senator from North Dakota earlier \ntalking about his effort to identify a lockbox going back to 1982 or \n1983, in that period. Lockbox terminology was used way before it was \ndiscussed on this floor. It is a common expression in terms of banking \nand financial programs.\n  What we are talking about, very simply, is whether or not we put \nenough money away to say to the American public, when it is your time \nto retire--talking to those who now are, let's say, in their twenties, \nmaybe in their teens--Social Security will be there for you when it is \nyour time to use that benefit.\n\n  That is the discussion that goes on.\n  The other program--Medicare, which is directly linked to the Social \nSecurity program--health care for the elderly, for seniors, is the \nbiggest worry among our population. People identify it as their concern \nabout being locked out of health care--not knowing what conditions \nmight arise that will absorb all of their savings, all of their \nresources. With the good science that has been developed over the \nyears, we have had far better health than we thought we might have, \nlooking back some years.\n  I know that when I was in the Army during World War II, I never \ndreamed that at this stage of my life I would be hard at work trying to \ndo the things that I do, and feeling pretty good about it. I am glad to \nknow there is a program out there for those who aren't physically able \nto deal with life's daily pressures, and when they run into medical \nproblems, health care is going to be there. That is the way it ought to \nbe.\n  With all of that, and all of the criticism of President Clinton, the \nfact is that he is the leader in the country who saw us stop the \nhemorrhaging of incredibly increasing debt that was falling upon not \njust the present generation but future generations.\n  I used to hear the cries: We are saddling our children and our \ngrandchildren with debt. Now we want to pay it off. They say: Well, \npaying off debt, what does it mean? It means an awful lot. The fact of \nthe matter is that it provides the kind of things that families try to \nprovide; and that is security for the future--reserves--so that when \nyou have something you either need or want, you have some means to do \nit.\n  That is what we are talking about here. We want to preserve, and we \nwant to increase, the solvency of Medicare to make sure it is there for \na longer period of time. We want to extend Medicare to 2025 and have \nSocial Security retirement benefits available until 2053, with a pledge \nfrom the White House and from this President to try to reform the \nprocess to extend it even further. That is what we are discussing.\n  Despite the cries and the pleas--``to tell the truth,'' is what I \nheard. I don't usually use that kind of terminology, because not \ntelling the truth suggests some kind of a character flaw. The truth in \nmany times is as observed by the person speaking. But the real judgment \ncomes from the others who hear it. The truth of the matter is that we \nare trying our darndest--each side of the aisle--in this particular \nconstruction of how they see us, we being able to provide the kind of \nsecurity that our people want. We on this side of the aisle think it \nought to be done by not only preserving all of the Social Security \nsurpluses but by paying down the debt and increasing reserves available \nto put into that Social Security trust fund to extend it slightly even \nfurther. That is what we want to do.\n  All of the gimmicks that are used, all of the ploys that the majority \nhas used characteristically to try to stop the Democrats from offering \namendments, from making this debate available to the public--that is \nthe way it goes. We have never seen the kind of a period where so many \ncloture votes are ordered at the same time that a bill is sent up to \nthe desk to be considered. Almost immediately, in so many cases, it is \nfollowed by a cloture vote before there is any debate. The cries of a \nfilibuster are hollow cries, because no filibuster has had a chance to \nget underway. There hasn't been any chance to talk at all. Shut it \ndown. Use the cloture vote technique.\n  The public shouldn't perhaps be deceived by what they hear about how \nanxious the Republicans are to get on\n\n[[Page S7980]]\n\nwith the work of the people when they refuse to allow reasonable debate \non the subject. There are ways to do it: Fill up the amendment tree, \nthat stops it; invoke cloture, that stops it; or put in quorum calls, \nor have majority votes on things that stop the process.\n\n  The question is simply, Do we want to extend Social Security \nsolvency? I think that answer has to be yes. Do we want to extend the \nMedicare solvency? I think that answer has to be yes.\n  Let the American people decide. When do they decide? They decide in \nNovember 2000 whether or not they prefer one method or the other. We \nought to be plain spoken about what it is we are trying to do and not \nshut off the debate and not say that the Democrats could have offered \namendments. They couldn't have, not at that time. They could have in \ndue time--after everything was signed, sealed, and delivered. It is a \nbackhanded way of operating.\n  I hope we will move on to the debate of the lockbox legislation. Let \nthe public hear it. Take the time necessary to have a full airing. Let \neither side amend it and get on with serving the people's needs.\n  How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has control of 3 minutes 20 \nseconds; the Republicans have 2 minutes 54 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute 30 seconds.\n  We are here today to try to put in motion a process that will save \nthe Social Security trust fund surpluses for Social Security. The \nRepublicans have been trying to simply get a vote on our proposal for \nover 70 days.\n  The entire parliamentary effort that has been described has been \naimed at simply getting us a chance to have a vote on what was our \noriginal amendment to a different bill. The notion that getting cloture \non that amendment would somehow stifle opportunities for others to \nbring amendments is not the way this system works. I think everybody \nshould understand that. Our goal is to get a vote on the amendment we \nwanted. That is perfectly consistent with what people on all sides \nalways try to do. It was a simple effort.\n  Let's not get caught up in the parliamentary discussions. The bottom \nline is we are still trying to create a lockbox for the American people \nwho send payroll taxes to Washington so they can be assured those \ndollars go to Social Security. That is what we are fighting for. This \ndebate is no more complicated than that.\n  We have heard claims people want a weaker lockbox, a harder lockbox. \nLet's go forward with it. Let's pass this motion. Let's vote for \ncloture today. Give Members a chance to have a vote on our plan. If \nothers want to offer their plans, there will be opportunities for that.\n  I don't think there should be any absence of clarity as to what we \nhave been trying to achieve for 73 days, and that is simply to get a \nvote on a lockbox, which was brought as an amendment by the \nRepublicans. We will still get that vote; we will keep fighting until \nwe do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield back the remaining time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans have 1 minute 16 seconds.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield that time to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is not an issue of what kind of \neconomic game plan we have had for the last 5 or 6 years. We all \nunderstand that hard-working Americans are making this economy hum. \nInvestors who have become more enlightened and entrepreneurs who are \ntaking more risks have caused a great American recovery, sustained in a \nmanner we have never expected.\n  The issue is, when we collect more taxes, and we exceed \nexpectations--in fact, not just by a few hundred million, but actually \napproaching $1 trillion--should we wait for the Government to spend it \nor should we give some of it back to the American taxpayer?\n  Actually, the Social Security trust fund can be saved. Medicare with \nprescription drugs can be reformed and fixed so we have prescription \ndrugs, and there is still a large amount of money left over. What \nshould we do with it? Invent some way to set it aside? If we do that, \nit will be spent. Let's give some of it back to the American people. \nThat is why the lockbox is important. It says what is left over does \nnot belong to Social Security; it belongs to the American people. Use \nit prudently, Congress, and give back some of it.\n  It appears there is a war with that side of the aisle against giving \nanything back to the American people from these kinds of surpluses. I \nbelieve we will win that war. We relish it. We are ready to go. That \nwill be the issue the next couple of months.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.

Mr. President, I had asked for a reservation of some 30 \nminutes to speak on the pending nomination of Mr. Larry Summers for the \nposition of Secretary of the Treasury.\n  In considering the nomination of Mr. Summers for the position of \nSecretary of the Treasury, I have reviewed the many facets of the work \nof that particular office and have focused with particularity, at this \ntime, on the administration's policy on nonenforcement of the \nantidumping laws. I had met with Mr. Summers on Friday, June 18th, and \ntold him at that time that I was giving consideration to a protest vote \nagainst his nomination because of the administration's failure to \nenforce the antidumping laws after having discussed with him his own \nviews.\n  Since that time I have decided to direct my efforts, instead, to try \nto put together a coalition of Members of Congress, both in the House \nand the Senate, to find a remedy where a private right of action could \nbe used to enforce the antidumping laws.\n  This is a subject that has been of great concern to me during my \nentire tenure in the Senate, having introduced a variety of bills--\nwhich I shall discuss in due course--going back as early as 1982.\n  In the course of a number of legislative proposals, I have had \ncosponsorship from a wide variety of my Senate colleagues, including \nthen-Senator Gore, Senators Thurmond, Byrd, Helms, Cochran, Hatch, \nInouye, Murkowski, Kennedy, Levin, Santorum, Mikulski, and Sessions.\n  The problem of dumping is an extraordinarily acute problem in America \ntoday. It has come into very sharp focus with what has been happening \nin the steel industry, which has been decimated over the past two \ndecades.\n  Steel, two decades ago--in 1979--had employees numbering \napproximately 500,000. Today, we have about a third of that number. In \nthe course of the past several months, some 10,000 steelworkers have \nlost their jobs because of dumping from many foreign importers. But in \nreviewing the issue of dumping, I have found that it is extraordinarily \nwidespread.\n  Here is a partial list of the products which are dumped in the United \nStates, in addition to steel: wheat, hogs, lamb, cotton, sugar, orange \njuice, raspberries, flowers, salmon, mushrooms, paper clips, pencils, \ngarlic, brake rotors, telephone systems, brass, pasta, picture tubes, \nrubber, industrial belts. And the series goes on and on.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks, the \nantidumping duty orders in effect as of March 1, 1999, be printed in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. This list contains, I am advised, some 280 products \nwhich are dumped in the United States where our dumping laws, simply \nstated, are not enforced.\n  There is a groundswell in America today protesting the failure to \nenforce the antidumping laws. Dumping is a situation where, for \nexample, steel coming from Russia will be sold cheaper in the United \nStates than it is being sold in Russia. That is flatly against the laws \nof the United States. It is flatly against international trade laws. \nThe United States has laws against that kind of dumping. But they are, \nsimply stated, ignored.\n  The groundswell of opposition to dumping is reflected in the very \nstrong vote in the House of Representatives on the so-called steel \nquota bill; 289 Members of the House voting in favor of it, 141 in \nopposition, more than enough votes to override a veto.\n  When the issue came to the Senate last week, there was considerable \nspeculation as to whether there would be 67 votes to override a veto \nand whether there would be an excess of 60 votes for cloture. Then, as \na result of some very intense, last-minute lobbying by the \nadministration, a great many Senators changed their votes, reversed \ntheir announced intentions, and we had 42 votes in favor of the steel \nquota bill. Even so, it was a large vote in the Senate--considering all \nthe circumstances--because of the very strong public policy against \nquotas, remembering the problems in the Smoot-Hawley era. I think the \neffort at the quota bill was really to attract the attention of the \nadministration, to show how serious the problem was.\n\n  In my capacity as chairman of the steel caucus, I have convened a \nnumber of meetings of our caucus. I have met with Treasury Secretary \nRubin and Commerce Secretary Daley and Trade Representative Barshefsky. \nWe have made the case of the need for enforcement of our trade laws. \nWhile not exactly a deaf ear, there was certainly little by way of any \npositive response.\n  I had an opportunity to talk personally with the President during a \nlong plane ride from Andrews to Tel Aviv last December. The plane ride \nwas more than 10 hours, an opportunity to talk about a great many \nsubjects. I discussed with the President the very serious problems with \nthe steel industry. He was sympathetic but nothing really has come from \nthe administration to deal effectively with the problem of dumping.\n  The fact of life is, where it comes to considerations of foreign \npolicy or defense policy, American industry is traditionally sacrificed \nand the antidumping laws are not enforced.\n  This is an issue which has concerned me, as a Pennsylvania Senator, \nsince 1981 when I took my oath of office. In 1984, there was a \nfavorable ruling by\n\n[[Page S7982]]\n\nthe International Trade Commission supporting the steel industry. It \nwas then up to the President, President Ronald Reagan, to determine \nwhether or not that International Trade Commission ruling would stand. \nMy then colleague, Senator John Heinz--the late Senator Heinz, who we \nall miss so very much--and I made the rounds of key administration \nofficials. Then-Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige was in favor of \nupholding the International Trade Commission order. Then-Trade \nRepresentative Bill Brock was in favor of upholding the International \nTrade Commission order. Then-Senator Heinz and I met with Secretary of \nState George Shultz, separately with Secretary of Defense Caspar \nWeinberger, and were told in no uncertain terms by the Secretary of \nState that our foreign policy was such that the ITC decision had to be \nreversed by the President. That was Secretary Shultz' recommendation. \nSecretary of Defense Weinberger said about the same thing, that defense \npolicy required the ITC ruling be overturned, which the President had \nthe right to do. So, in fact, in September of 1984, President Reagan \ndid overturn the International Trade Commission ruling. That was just \nsymptomatic and characteristic of what had happened with respect to \ndumping and the harm of lost jobs to the industry.\n  Since the early 1980s, the steel industry has poured $50 billion of \ncapital into modernization efforts and has pared the payrolls, as I \nnoted earlier, from about 500,000 to about a third of that. There is no \nway that the American steel industry can compete with dumped steel; \nwhere Russians or Brazilians or others are prepared to steal--dumping \nis a form of stealing, spelled different from steel--the product. There \nis no way the American steel industry can compete with dumping.\n  On June 18 of this year, the Washington Post contained a notation \nthat Secretary of Commerce Daley had declared the steel crisis was \nover. Outraged by that conclusion, 12 chief executive officers of \nAmerican steel companies wrote to Secretary William Daley, in part as \nfollows:\n\n       The steel crisis is still very much with us. Cold rolled \n     imports are up dramatically, 24 percent above the level for \n     the first 4 months of last year. Imports of cut-to-length \n     plate are up dramatically, 25 percent year-to-year in for \n     this period. The prices remain extremely depressed. Operating \n     rates have plunged from 93 percent to 80 percent on an \n     annualized basis.\n\n  A 10 percent change in operating rates equals about $5 billion in \nrevenue, so that decrease would be in the $7 to $8 billion range in \ndecreased revenue.\n  Within the next week, after the letter of June 18 to Secretary Daley \nfrom the steel executives, the statistics released by the Department of \nCommerce showed a tremendous additional surge. From April to May, \nimports went up by almost 700,000 metric tons, more than 30 percent. \nImports of cold-rolled steel products from Russia were 7,296 metric \ntons in April 1999, and almost 41,000 metric tons the following month \nof May, an increase of more than 450 percent.\n  So we have seen the problem aggravated. The steel companies have \nbrought seven antidumping cases with the Department of Commerce. Six of \nthose have been subjected to suspension agreements by the Department of \nCommerce. When a complaint is brought, the Department of Commerce has \nthe authority to end the complaint with a suspension agreement.\n  I had an opportunity to talk at some length just yesterday to \nSecretary of Commerce Daley to try to get an update on enforcement of \nthe antidumping laws, and more particularly, the enforcement of the \nantidumping laws with regard to steel. Secretary Daley, at least to my \nway of thinking, was not at all on target with what the Department of \nCommerce is doing.\n  I confronted him with the specifics on the suspension agreement that \nthe Department of Commerce entered into with Russia on February 22 of \nthis year. That agreement permits unfair traders to avoid liability for \nmillions of dollars in penalties due on steel dumped since November of \n1998. The terms of the suspension agreement result in imports rising to \na level of 750,000 metric tons per year and further displace very \nsubstantial domestic production. With respect to the proposed Brazilian \nantidumping suspension agreement, the fixed exchange rate locks in \nunrealistic low prices without allowing for future changes in the \nexchange rate. On another proposed Brazilian countervailing suspension \nagreement, it is 37 percent above the prelevel crisis.\n  So here we have efforts made under section 201, where the President \nhas the right to rescind the remedy. That is consistently done. Here we \nhave these countervailing duty cases brought, where the Department of \nCommerce has the authority to enter into a suspension agreement to the \ndetriment of the American steel industry. That is consistently done.\n  The remedy which I suggest on pending legislation is to provide for a \nprivate right of action so the injured parties--whether they are the \nsteelworkers who have been demonstrating and protesting in Washington, \nD.C. in major rallies or whether it would be the steel companies who \nhave written to administration officials--the injured parties would \nhave an opportunity to go into Federal court to get justice.\n  You have the trade laws of the United States which prohibit dumping;  \nyou have the international trade laws, which prohibit dumping. The laws \nprohibiting dumping are entirely consistent with GATT, our \ninternational trade agreements. But those antidumping laws are, simply \nstated, not enforced.\n\n  In my discussions with Secretary Daley yesterday, he raised the \nquestion about the very substantial trade, the lower prices to \nconsumers, and noted that in an era where there is overcapacity around \nthe world and there is a world depression, the United States is an \nobvious target for this dumping, to the benefit of our consumers. But \nthat is not an adequate answer. That is not an adequate answer when \nthousands of steelworkers are laid off, or when the farmers are having \na disastrous economic time, when the Congress has to appropriate \nbillions of dollars in farm relief because of the dumping of wheat, the \ndumping of hogs, and dumping of lamb.\n  I recall as a teenager working in the wheat fields in Kansas before \nmoving to Pennsylvania. I grew up in a small community, Russell, KS, in \nthe heart of America's breadbasket, the heart of America's wheat \nbasket. The wheat that has been dumped on the American markets has had \na tremendously devastating effect on the American farm community, as so \nmuch of the other dumping of the commodities I have noted.\n  There is a remedy that would provide a private right of action to go \nto court, where the courts would be concerned with what the law is \nagainst dumping and would be concerned with what the evidence is--\nstrong evidence to prove that dumping exists. Then the court, under the \nlegislation I have introduced, would enter what is called an \n``equitable order,'' to assess a duty or a tariff that is consistent \nwith GATT, based upon the difference between what the goods ought to \nsell for and the price at which they are dumped.\n  There is, obviously, concern by the administration about the use of \nthe court system when the administration wants to have the power to \nmake decisions as the administration chooses. But when the \nadministration acts in the interest of foreign policy, or in the \ninterest of defense policy, to the prejudice of so many workers in \nAmerica who are not getting justice, that simply is not right.\n  The equity action would not submit the case to a jury. Rather, it is \ndecided on traditional principles of the law of equity by a judge \nalone. It is possible to have a temporary restraining order issued on \nthe basis of affidavits submitted. It is not a complicated matter to \nprove dumping. A judge then has the authority, under the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure, to issue what is called an ex parte order just on \nthe application of one party--without even the other party being \npresent--where the affidavits are sufficient. The duty then arises for \nthe court to have a hearing within 5 days on a preliminary injunction. \nThen these equity matters can be tried in a matter of a few days, or a \ncouple of weeks at the outside.\n  When some administration officials have complained that court cases \ntake a very long time, it simply is not true. Where a court of equity \nissues an order, that order stays in effect even when an appeal is \ntaken, unless there\n\n[[Page S7983]]\n\nis an issuance of a supersedeas. To get a supersedeas, there has to be \na bond posted in twice the amount of the damages. The fact is that once \nthese enforcement actions would be taken, the dumpers would find it \nmore expensive to violate the law than to comply with the law. This \nwould be a remedy that would have a very profound effect.\n  This is not an idea I have proposed for the first time in the \nlegislation filed this year. During the 97th Congress, I introduced \nSenate bill 2167. In the 98th Congress, I introduced similar \nlegislation under the number of Senate bill 418. In the 99th Congress, \nit was S. 236. In the 100th Congress, it was S. 361. In the 102d \nCongress, it was S. 2508. In the 103d Congress, it was S. 332. On March \n3 of this year, I introduced the pending legislation as Senate bill \n528.\n  Votes have been held, with one vote as close as 51-47, losing on an \neffort to attach that as an amendment. One of the bills was reported \nunanimously out of the Judiciary Committee and, as noted before, a \nconsiderable group of colleagues have sponsored one or more of these \nbills: then-Senator Gore, Senators Thurmond, Byrd, Cochran, Helms, \nInouye, Murkowski, Hatch, Kennedy, Levin, Santorum, Mikulski, and \nSessions have all been supportive of this legislation.\n  I must say that the hearings in the Finance Committee have not \nproduced a consideration of this legislation in a markup. So it is my \nintention to find a vehicle on which to offer this legislation, some \nother bill that comes to the floor. In discussions with many \ncolleagues, there is very considerable interest in many quarters \nbecause when the matter is discussed, so many of my fellow Senators \nsay, well, that is a wheat issue that prejudices the farmers of my \nState; or that is a hog issue or a lamb issue that prejudices the \nfarmers of my State; or with the enormous list of products involved, so \nmany jobs are being taken.\n  So the essence of the issue is: What will happen on enforcement of \nantidumping laws in America? The bitter fact of life is that \nadministrations that are both Republican and Democrat have not been \ninterested or diligent in enforcing our antidumping laws. Instead, they \nhave preferred to bend to the interests of the foreign policy \nconsiderations, or defense policy. When Russia dumps in the United \nStates--and Russia's economy is in a precarious shape--the \nadministration enters into a suspension agreement badly prejudicing the \nAmerican steel industry, causing the loss of thousands of jobs on the \nadministration's conclusion that it is more important to have a solid \neconomy in Russia and not to have instability with Boris Yeltsin than \nit is to lose thousands of jobs of the steelworkers. When wheat, or \nlambs, or hogs, or orange juice, is dumped, there again, the avalanche \nof those cases is beyond the capacity of the administration to handle.\n  There is a solid precedent in our legal procedures for private rights \nof action. We have the antitrust laws that are enforced by private \nparties, who are authorized under Federal statutes to get not only \ndamages, but treble damages, three times the damages. You have the \nsecurities laws of the United States that are enforced by private \nrights of action.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission simply can't handle all of the \nenforcement of our securities laws, just as the Department of Justice \nand the Federal Trade Commission cannot handle all of the antitrust \nlaws. This has been a subject of deep concern to me, since my days as a \nlaw student when I wrote an extensive article in the Yale Law Journal, \nappearing in 1955, on private rights of action. It was directed at the \ncriminal process, but the analogies are the same. If we enact \nlegislation that enables the steelworkers, or the steel companies, or \nthe farmers, or the wheat companies, or the electronics industry, or \nthe telephone industry, or the long list of industries that have been \nvictimized by dumping to go into court, the judge will not look at what \nis our foreign policy or what is our defense policy, but will see the \nU.S. law that prohibits dumping, and will analyze the GATT provisions \nwhich authorize the enforcement of antidumping laws.\n\n  The legislation calls for these actions to be brought in the U.S. \nInternational Court of Trade in New York City.\n  So this is not a matter of the steelworkers going to a friendly judge \nin Pittsburgh, or the wheat farmers going to a friendly judge in \nWichita, but it will be handled by the International Court of Trade \nwhich sits in New York City and has the expertise and the detachment to \nlook at the law--to look at the facts--and to do justice. But justice \nis not being done in America today where you have the failure of the \nadministration to enforce these laws.\n  During the almost two decades that I have served in the Senate, it \nhas been the same whether the administration was of one party or the \nother, and that it is easy to slough off the loss of jobs and the loss \nof American industry. But that, simply stated, is not fair.\n  It may be that if we mobilized a group of Senators to vote against \nthe nomination of Mr. Summers, or if I voted against the nomination of \nMr. Summers, it would attract more attention than a 22-minute floor \nstatement. But after having considered the matter for the intervening \nalmost 2 weeks since I met with Mr. Summers, I thought that it would be \nnot fair to him. He has an excellent record, a good academic record, \nand a strong record in the Department of the Treasury. But when I \ndiscussed with him the enforcement of the antidumping laws, I did not \nfind the concerns that I thought the Secretary of the Treasury-\nDesignate ought to have. But we have agreed to talk further.\n  Yesterday, when I talked to Secretary of Commerce Daley, again I did \nnot find the kind of sensitivity or concerns that I thought the \nSecretary of Commerce ought to have.\n  When I reviewed the suspension agreements that Secretary Daley's \nDepartment entered into, I thought that they were prejudicial to the \ninterests of the American steel industry. But in America, we have had \nso many illustrations where the legislative bodies don't act, or where \nthe executive branches don't act but where the courts do. It is nothing \nlike life tenure for a Federal judge and the dispassionate application \nof the rule of law but, rather, the facts to the case. But were that to \nbe done, it is not a matter of protectionism. It is a matter of \nenforcing the basic rule of free trade.\n  Anytime someone takes up the cudgel to complain about what is \nhappening for failure to enforce antidumping laws, the financial \npublications are always saying that is a cry for protectionism. But the \nfact is that it is not protectionism. It is enforcing the basic tenet \nof free trade, which means no dumping. If you have dumping you do not \nhave free trade.\n  We are going to continue to work with the coalition of Senators. We \nwill not use this occasion to protest the administration's failure to \nenforce the antidumping laws by a protest vote against Mr. Summers but \nto try to bring a coalition together, and perhaps even to persuade the \nnew Secretary of Treasury, the existing Secretary of Commerce, and \nperhaps even the President, that justice and fairness and equity \nrequires enforcement through the judicial process, which is the only \nway to get appropriate relief.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                           EXHIBIT NO. 1\n\n                               ANTIDUMPING DUTY ORDERS IN EFFECT ON MARCH 1, 1999\n                   [Duty orders revoked by Sunset Review remain in effect until Jan. 1, 2000]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              Case No. and country                                         Product                           D I\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA-357-007  Argentina...........................

Mr. President, I want to say to my colleague from \nPennsylvania, who just addressed the issue of Treasury and the issue of \nsteel, that I supported the proposal last week of Senator Rockefeller \nand felt as though that was a strong message that we needed to be \nsending. We didn't prevail in that particular issue. It is an important \nissue for the Senator from Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania's economy depends \non many sectors. But steel is a very important one. And the trade issue \nis extremely important.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nConnecticut for those comments. I dare say that if we polled all of our \ncolleagues, the other 98, there would not be a Senator who would not \nhave problems in his own State on dumping. Some may object saying that \nthey do not want to have anything to impede the flow of commerce, but \nthere are some limits.\n  When it comes to the law, I know my colleague from Connecticut is as \nconcerned about the rule of law as I am. If we want to eliminate the \nantidumping provisions, I will keep quiet. But when the law prohibits \ndumping and there is so much of it to the prejudice of so many people--\ntalk about victims' rights--this is an injustice that is being \nperpetrated day in and day out. If it goes to court, justice will be \ndone.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. Everyone faces these dumping issues. \nWe are a very open society. That is one of our strengths. But there are \nlimits. The only thing I would say--again, I don't want to tie us up \nbecause we have other matters to attend to--is that I happen to be a \nstrong supporter of Larry Summers as a candidate for the Secretary of \nthe Treasury position.\n  He is a very fine individual who I think will do a tremendous job. \nFirst of all, he will be listening to people such as our distinguished \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, and I hope the colleague of the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, the Senator from Connecticut, on these matters. I am \nsure he will do that. I know that he will do that.\n  But, obviously more importantly, we need not just good listening but \nalso a willingness to make the fight as only can be done at the \nexecutive branch level. We in Congress can pass amendments and bills to \ntry to do it. But in the area of trade --I know that my colleague from \nPennsylvania will agree--the executive branch is really where the \ninfluence is most felt through the Office of the President, the \nSecretary of Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of \nState, where they raise these issues at that level. That is where we \nhave the most success, I think, at least historically, in dealing with \nthe kind of issues that he has addressed this morning.\n  I am confident that Larry Summers is going to be a very strong \nadvocate\n\n[[Page S7987]]\n\non behalf of our country and its needs and its sectors that the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has talked about.\n  I just didn't want the moment to pass without expressing my support \nfor this very fine individual, whom I have come to know and respect \nimmensely over the last number of years. He has worked with Rubin in \nTreasury.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, just one further comment. Some of our \nmost worthwhile floor discussions is when there is an exchange of \nideas. So often comments go from protection of speech out into a \nvacuum. Like the old saying about college lectures in classes, it goes \nfrom the notes of the professor to the notes of the student without \npassing through the head of either. But when you have a discussion, it \nmay be a little more informative. The executive branch is where it \nought to start. But if there is not relief from the executive branch, \nthen I look to the judicial branch.\n\n  The one conclusive item that I will note, because I don't want to \ntake more than another 45 seconds, is in the enforcement of the civil \nrights laws. We could never have gotten desegregation in America if it \nwas left up to the Congress or to the State legislatures or to the \nPresidents and the Governors nibbling at the edges a little bit. But \nwhen the case went to court, justice was done.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from Pennsylvania is absolutely correct. We \nneed to have that judicial branch if we are going to really make the \nlaws work ultimately. I appreciate that point. It is one well taken.\n  I agree with his point as well that if you are going to have \nantidumping laws on the books, enforcing them is the only way to live \nup to our obligations.\n  I appreciate his comments.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dodd pertaining to the introduction of \nlegislation are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S7987-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7987-S8010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--RESUMED--\n                               Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 98, insert between lines 4 and 5 the following:\n       Sec. 636. (a) Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (in \n     this section referred to as the ``VFW''), which was formed by \n     veterans of the Spanish-American War and the Philippine \n     Insurrection to help secure rights and benefits for their \n     service, will be celebrating its 100th anniversary in 1999;\n       (2) members of the VFW have fought, bled, and died in every \n     war, conflict, police action, and military intervention in \n     which the United States has engaged during this century;\n       (3) over its history, the VFW has ably represented the \n     interests of veterans in Congress and State Legislatures \n     across the Nation and established a network of trained \n     service officers who, at no charge, have helped millions of \n     veterans and their dependents to secure the education, \n     disability compensation, pension, and health care benefits \n     they are rightfully entitled to receive as a result of the \n     military service performed by those veterans:\n       (4) the VFW has also been deeply involved in national \n     education projects, awarding nearly $2,700,000 in \n     scholarships annually, as well as countless community \n     projects initiated by its 10,000 posts; and\n       (5) the United States Postal Service has issued \n     commemorative postage stamps honoring the VFW's 50th and 75th \n     anniversaries, respectively.\n       (b) Therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States Postal Service is encouraged to issue a \n     commemorative postage stamp in honor of the 100th anniversary \n     of the founding of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United \n     States.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, as a member of the VFW Ladies Auxiliary \npost in Caribou, ME, and as the daughter of a World War II veteran who \nwas wounded twice in combat, I am honored to lead the charge for this \nworthwhile legislation.\n  The Veterans of Foreign Wars traces its roots back to 1899, when \nveterans of the Spanish-American War and the Philippine Insurrection \nreturned home and banded together to establish a handful of local \norganizations intended to help secure medical care and pensions for \ntheir military service. These original foreign service organizations \ngradually grew in number and influence and in 1914 came to be known \ncollectively as the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States.\n  Mr. President, it was several years later, on June 24, 1921, when the \nVFW's chapter in my home State of Maine was chartered. Today, there are \n84 VFW posts in Maine to which over 16,000 veterans belong.\n  Those small groups of veterans who organized in 1899 have today grown \nto over 2 million strong. During that time, VFW members have fought in \nevery war, conflict, and military intervention in which the United \nStates has been engaged during this century.\n  As we near the start of a new millennium, the VFW's members continue \nto live by the organization's creed of ``Honor the dead by helping the \nliving.'' They do so by representing the interests of veterans across \nthe nation through an established network of trained service officers \nwho, at no charge, help millions of veterans and their dependents \nsecure the educational benefits, disability compensation, pension, and \nhealth care services to which they are rightfully entitled as a result \nof their distinguished service to our country.\n  This service also extends beyond veterans. The VFW's Community \nService Program, through members in its 10,000 posts, serves \ncommunities, states, and the nation. During the past program year, for \nexample, the VFW, working side by side with its Ladies Auxiliary, \ncontributed nearly 13 million hours of volunteer service and donated \nnearly $55 million to a variety of community projects. In addition, the \nVFW helps young men and women attend college by providing more than \n$2.6 million in scholarships annually.\n  Mr. President, this Sunday, on the Fourth of July, we will celebrate \nthe 223rd anniversary of the founding of the United States of America. \nI can think of no more appropriate time to honor the brave men and \nwomen who, while far from home, sacrificed so much that the dreams of \nour founding fathers might become, and remain, a reality. By urging the \nU.S. Postal Service to issue a commemorative stamp honoring the VFW's \n100th anniversary, as was done for its 50th and 75th anniversaries, the \nSenate can take a small step toward remembering their service and \nshowing our deep appreciation for their unwavering commitment to our \ncountry, both in peacetime and in times of conflict.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Colorado and the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota for working with me on this amendment. It is \nmy understanding the amendment has been cleared and that it is \nacceptable to the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. As a life member of the VFW myself, and a sponsor of \nthis amendment, I think it is an important statement to make, as my \nfriend said, as we move to the Fourth of July weekend. I am happy to \naccept this amendment.\n  I yield to Senator Dorgan.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think it is a good amendment. I have asked consent to \nbe added as a cosponsor. I am happy to support the efforts of the \nSenator from Maine, and we have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1202) was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank my colleagues for their support and cooperation.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, seeing no other Senators on the floor, I \nannounce we would like to have them come down and offer their \namendments. We will be happily expecting them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will ask that a letter from Barry \nMcCaffrey, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, be \nprinted in the Record. General McCaffrey has written to me and, I am \nsure, the chairman of the subcommittee because he is concerned about \nthe funding level for the National Youth Antidrug Media Campaign.\n  As we indicated yesterday, that campaign will be funded in the \nsubcommittee mark at $145.5 million. That is about $49 million below \nthe administration's request.\n  General McCaffrey has a number of observations about that and makes \nthe point in his letter that he hopes, in this process between the \nSenate and the House, somehow those funds might be restored to full \nfunding at the President's request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of National \n           Drug Control Policy,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 1999.\n     Hon. Byron L. Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan The purpose of this letter is to bring \n     to your attention a precarious funding recommendation for the \n     FY 2000 appropriation for the National Youth Anti-Drug Media \n     Campaign. This drug-prevention initiative is the centerpiece \n     of the national effort to educate America's sixty-eight \n     million children and adolescents about the risks associated \n     with illegal drugs. Thanks to the Congress' full support of \n     the campaign over the past two years, we have succeeded in \n     harnessing the full power of modern media--from television to \n     the Internet to sports marketing--to provide accurate and \n     effective anti-drug information to children, adolescents, \n     parents, and other adult influences.\n       We are pleased with the results obtained since the campaign \n     was launched eighteen months ago.\n       The campaign's messages are being heard. 95 percent of our \n     youth target audience is receiving an average of 6.8 messages \n     a week. Among African American youth, we are doing even \n     better--reaching 95 percent of the young people 7.8 times per \n     week, 94 percent\n\n[[Page S7989]]\n\n     of Hispanic youth are receiving messages in Spanish 4.8 times \n     per week.\n       Our children are becoming more aware of the risks and \n     dangers of drugs. Teens are indicating in response to surveys \n     that campaign ads are providing them new information, \n     increasing their awareness of the dangers associated with \n     drugs, and making them less likely to try or use drugs. \n     Parents state that the ads are providing new information and \n     making them aware of the effects of drugs on their children.\n       The private sector is matching the federal government's \n     investment. Over the past year, corporate America has \n     provided $217 million in pro-bono advertising and in-kind \n     contributions. In the past twelve months, the campaign has \n     generated 47,000 public service announcements and resulted in \n     thirty-two network television shows including anti-drug \n     messages.\n       The Senate Appropriations Committee has recommended that \n     the media campaign be funded at 25 percent below our request \n     in FY 2000--$145.5 million, $49.5 million below the \n     administration's request. This funding level would not allow \n     the campaign to reach adolescents and parents with the \n     message frequency required to fundamentally change attitudes \n     towards illegal drugs and, eventually, reduce drug use by \n     vulnerable adolescents and teens. The Committee's additional \n     recommendation that $49 million of proposed FY 2000 funds not \n     be available to the Campaign until the final day of the \n     fiscal year would result in a de facto 48 percent cut in \n     campaign funds.\n       Now is not the time to make cuts in the Media Campaign. We \n     are at a critical juncture in time. Drug use by our teens \n     skyrocketed between 1992 and 1996 as risk perception \n     declined. In the past two years, the Monitoring the Future \n     survey and the National Household Survey of Drug Abuse \n     suggest that our children are becoming more aware of the \n     risks posed by illegal drugs and that adolescent drug use \n     rates are declining. This campaign can be a catalyst for \n     lower drug use rates by our children.\n       We need your leadership to ensure that the full Senate \n     restores funding to the requested amount of $195 million in \n     FY 2000 for the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. This \n     is a sound investment in the well being of our sixty-eight \n     million young people.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, also, to add to the comments made by \nSenator Campbell, I believe we had something in the neighborhood of 20 \namendments that were filed. The unanimous consent agreement required \nthat amendments be filed by noon today. This subcommittee on \nappropriations has now, I believe, close to 20 amendments, perhaps 21 \namendments, that have been filed. It is, I know, the intention and the \ninterest of the leadership--the majority leader and Senator Daschle as \nwell--to move ahead and finish this bill and finish some other business \ntoday.\n  My hope is that Members who have offered amendments--in fact, all the \namendments have been filed on behalf of other Senators by Senator \nCampbell and myself. I hope very much that those who asked us to file \nan amendment on their behalf will come now to the floor and offer those \namendments so we can proceed to get through this piece of legislation.\n  Of the 20 amendments, some likely will be worked out, some will \nperhaps need votes. Senator Campbell is absolutely correct, this is the \nright time for people on whose behalf we have offered these amendments \nto come to the floor and begin debating them.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1201\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize the conveyance to the Columbia Hospital for \n     Women of a certain parcel of land in the District of Columbia)\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I call up the Lott-Daschle amendment No. \n1201, the conveyance of land to the Columbia Hospital for Women, and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell] for Mr. Lott, for \n     himself and Mr. Daschle, proposes an amendment numbered 1201.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, I ask that my amendment to the bill be \ncalled up at this time. It has already been laid down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself and \n     Mr. Chafee, proposes an amendment numbered 1193.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 98, insert between lines 4 and 5 the following:\n       Sec. 636. Section 5304 of title 5, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(j) For purposes of this section, the 5 counties of the \n     State of Rhode Island (including Providence, Bristol, \n     Newport, Kent, and Washington counties) shall be considered \n     as 1 county, adjacent to the Boston-Worcester-Lawrence; \n     Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, and Connecticut locality \n     pay area and the Hartford, Connecticut locality pay area.''.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment I am offering, on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Chafee, deals with a problem that is particular to \nRhode Island. The problem involves what is known as locality pay. That \nis the differential pay that Federal employees are given because of \nhigher costs in the area in which they live and work. Essentially it is \na comparison between the labor cost in the private sector and the \nFederal sector. If there are higher private labor costs, there is a \ndifferential added to the paycheck of the Federal employee in the \nparticular area.\n  The problem with Rhode Island is, because of the complicated rules of \nallocation, my entire State is excluded from locality pay. So Federal \nworkers who work in Rhode Island do not receive locality pay, even \nthough their fellow workers, in some cases just a few miles away, in \nMassachusetts or Connecticut, receive this differential locality pay.\n  Now, the reason the rules disadvantage Rhode Island is, essentially, \nto qualify for locality pay, you have to have at least 2,000 workers in \na county and that county has to be contiguous to another locality area. \nThis is a map of New England and parts of New York. Because of the high \ncost of labor in Boston and in these major areas, such as New York City \nand Hartford, CT, because of the concentration of workers, these areas \nin blue represent locality pay areas. However, Rhode Island has been, \nin a sense, discriminated against because, for one thing, the managers \nof this program have stopped the locality line about 4\\1/2\\ miles from \nthe border, in some cases. In a county in which we have 3,500 workers--\nwe have enough workers in Newport County, but we are not contiguous to \na locality pay area. In northern Rhode Island, we don't have 2,000 \npeople in a certain county, but we are contiguous to another area. So \nthe combination of these rules of numbers of Federal employees and \nbeing contiguous to a high locality pay area works to the detriment of \nRhode Island.\n  Let me suggest something else that also I think is unique in the \nsituation of Rhode Island. We, I think unlike every other State in the \nU.S., do not have county governments. We don't operate anything on a \ncounty basis. Rhode Island is the smallest State in the Union, roughly \n70 miles long and 35 miles wide. The concept of county is something \nthat really is not apropos. When you look at some of the larger States \nin the country where counties are of sufficient size, where they easily \naccommodate several thousand workers, then it makes a difference but \nnot in Rhode Island.\n  The proposal that Senator Chafee and I have developed is quite \nsimple; that is, to consider the entire State of Rhode Island as a \ncounty. Frankly, in the context of the United States, it is about the \nsize of many counties. If we had that change in the law, we would have \na situation where our workers in Rhode Island--we have approximately \n6,000 Federal employees --would, in fact, be in an area contiguous to \nlocality pay zones and would qualify for the extra pay. What does this \nmean in the paychecks of our workers? Essentially, what they are seeing \nis 3.45 percent less in their 1999 paychecks than people doing the same \njobs in New London, CT, and in Boston, MA. In fact, Boston is about 40 \nmiles from Providence. So we have this awkward situation. In fact, we \nhave people who live in Rhode Island and work in Boston for the Federal \nGovernment and get paid higher than their neighbors who live in Rhode \nIsland and work in Providence, RI. So this situation is both unfair \nand, I think, unfortunate.\n\n  Our amendment would correct that situation and it would do so in a \nway which, I think, would not do great damage to the overall structure \nof locality pay throughout the United States. After all, we are talking \nreally about a unique situation--the smallest State in the country, \nwhich has no effective counties in it as a measure of\n\n[[Page S7991]]\n\nany governmental type of activity. So I suggest very strongly that we \napproach this with a legislative solution.\n  I must thank both the subcommittee chairman, Senator Campbell of \nColorado, and also the chairman of the authorizing committee, Senator \nThompson. We have been talking with both individuals and they have been \nmost helpful, as have their staffs. They have suggested that we can \nprobably, with their assistance, make more progress by simply today \ndiscussing and describing the issue and then relying upon our mutual \nefforts to try to derive some type of administrative solution to this \nissue.\n  Let me say one other thing that makes this a very compelling problem \nto us. This is not simply going out and saying I want to have my \nworkers treated the same way their brethren and sisters are treated \njust 30 miles away; there is something else here. We find it, in \ncertain cases, difficult to recruit Federal workers to come into the \nRhode Island area because if they have a choice between going to Boston \nor to parts of Connecticut, or parts of Long Island, NY, in the same \nregion, they will choose these other regions because they will \nautomatically get a 3, 4, 5 percent pay increase, simply by choosing to \nwork in Boston rather than working in Providence.\n  We have, in the past, tried to recruit individuals to come into our \nFBI and our Secret Service office, and many, many qualified people have \nsaid: I would love to work there. The challenges are there, the career \npotential is there, but the problem is, how can I turn to my family and \nsay I am going to take a 3, 4, 5 percent pay cut?\n  This really affects our ability to recruit those individuals that we \nneed--as anyplace needs--to effectively run our Federal agencies. So \nboth Senator Chafee and I are concerned about and committed to this \nissue. First, we recognize that this is something that, with the \ncooperation and the help of the Appropriations Committee and Senator \nCampbell, and the authorizing committee with Senator Thompson, and \ntheir ranking members, we hope we can make progress on the \nadministrative front.\n  At this time, unless the Senator from Colorado has comments, I ask \nunanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for up to 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dan Alpert, \na fellow in my office, be permitted floor privileges during the \npendency of this bill and during the morning business time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bingaman pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1315 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the time provided by the \nmanagers.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, while we are waiting for Senators to \ncome to the floor with amendments, I would like to speak to two \nsections of the Treasury and general government appropriations bill \nthat are, I believe, of great importance.\n  The first is called the GREAT Program--the Gang Resistance Education \nand Training, or GREAT Program. This is a program that is administered \nby the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, in partnership with \nState and local law enforcement.\n  Unfortunately, gang activity has increased in our country in recent \nyears, as the Chair well knows.\n  ATF has developed a program to give our children the tools they need \nto be able to resist the temptation to belong to a gang.\n  The GREAT program is only seven years old, but has already grown from \na pilot program in Arizona to classrooms all over the United States--\nand in Puerto Rico, Canada, and overseas military bases. ATF estimates \nthat about 1.7 million students have received GREAT training.\n  GREAT was designed to provide gang prevention and anti-violence \ninstruction to children in a classroom setting. ATF trains local law \nenforcement officers to teach these classes, and provides grants to \ntheir offices to help pay for their time.\n  Needless to say, working policemen in classrooms do a lot to dispel \nthe sometimes erroneous myths that children have about working \npolicemen.\n  This program is having a positive effect on student activities and \nbehaviors, and is deterring them from involvement in gangs. A side \nbenefit is that the graduates seem to be doing a better job of \ncommunicating with their parents and teachers, and getting better \ngrades.\n  Last year the Subcommittee on Treasury and General Government held a \nhearing on the GREAT Program. The highlight of the morning was \nlistening to the students from Colorado, Wisconsin, Arizona and a \nnumber of other States as they told about what they learned when they \ntook the classes. It was very encouraging to hear how some of these \nkids actually turned their lives around because of this training.\n  For the second year in a row, the administration is requesting only \n$10 million for grants for the GREAT program. Last year, Congress felt \nthat wasn't enough to fund the many requests for help from State and \nlocal law enforcement and provided $13 million for GREAT grants. $10 \nmillion still isn't enough.\n  We are asking again in this bill to provide $13 million. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the effort of the committee to again provide $13 \nmillion for grants to State and local law enforcement for this \nworthwhile and effective program.\n  The other section of the bill I would like to mention for the \nknowledge of my colleagues is what is called the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children.\n  This center was created in 1984, and is dedicated to finding every \nmissing child and helping to prevent the abduction and sexual \nexploitation of all children.\n  Sadly, we are not 100 percent successful. Every year thousands of \nchildren are put at risk. In fact, every day in the United States 2,300 \nchildren are reported missing to different law enforcement agencies.\n  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children works closely \nwith three entities under the jurisdiction of this bill--the Customs \nService, the Postal Inspection Service, and the Secret Service. I think \nit is important for my colleagues to be aware of the contributions of \nthese different agencies.\n  In 1987, the Customs Service was the first Federal law enforcement \nagency to agree to be the contact point for tips and leads from the \ntoll-free Child Pornography Tipline. Under direction provided by the \ncommittee, support for the Tipline will continue in the fiscal year \n2000. This funding will be used for promotional brochures, public \nservice announcements, and a campaign to educate teenage girls about \nthe risks they may encounter and the ways to stay safer from crime.\n  In March of last year, the Customs Service and the National Center \nfor Missing and Exploited Children launched the new CyberTipline to \nallow parents to report incidents of suspicious or illegal internet \nactivity. For the benefit of my computer literate friends, that \ninternet address is ``www.missingkids.com/cybertip.''\n  The U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children have a long-standing relationship in \ncombating child pornography and sexual exploitation of children. For \nover ten years, information developed from the Child Pornography \nTipline has been provided to the Postal Inspection Service for \ninvestigative purposes. In addition, the\n\n[[Page S7992]]\n\nCenter has provided technical assistance when needed for specific \ninvestigations. The Postal Inspection Service has provided continuing \nassistance to the Center through training, development of publications, \nand outreach programs.\n  In late 1996, a cooperative agreement with the Secret Service \nForensic Services Division resulted in the creation of the Exploited \nChild Unit. This unit focuses on combating child molestation, \npornography, and prostitution. They raise public awareness about the \nproblem of pedophilia and focus educational efforts on child safety on \nthe internet.\n  This bill today gives ample opportunity to provide funding for both \nof these programs. This particular program will provide $2 million for \nforensic support of investigations and $1.996 million for the exploited \nchild unit. This money will be well spent.\n  I know my colleagues will be willing to support this.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask of you, or the distinguished chairman \nof the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, \nwhat the process is to call up one of the amendments that has been laid \ndown, specifically No. 1195? Do I need to ask unanimous consent to set \naside the pending business? What is appropriate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to call up his \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1195\n\n(Purpose: To increase by $50,000,000 funding for United States Customs \n Service for salaries and expenses to hire 500 new inspectors to stop \n    the flow of illegal drugs into the United States and facilitate \n              legitimate cross-border trade and commerce)\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1195, dealing with \nthe appropriation of additional funding for 617 Customs inspectors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. KYL], for himself, Mrs. \n     Hutchison, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Graham, and Mr. \n     Gramm, proposes an amendment numbered 1195.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 13, line 24, strike ``$1,670,747,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,720,747,000''.\n  On page 15, line 6, before the period, insert the following: ``: \nProvided further, That $50,000,000 shall be available until expended to \nhire, train, provide equipment for, and deploy 500 new Customs \ninspectors.''\n       On page 49, line 13, strike ``$38,175,000'' and insert \n     ``$36,500,000''.\n       On page 50, line 1, strike ``$23,681,000'' and insert \n     ``$22,586,000''.\n       On page 53, line 3, strike ``$624,896,000'' and insert \n     ``$590,100,000''.\n       On page 58, line 8, strike ``$120,198,000'' and insert \n     ``$109,344,000''.\n       On page 62, line 26, strike ``$27,422,000'' and insert \n     ``$25,805,000''.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this is one of the amendments which was \noffered during the subcommittee markup but which we did not pursue \nbecause we had not identified offsets for the additional $50 million \nbeing requested, and we wanted an opportunity to try to work it out \nbefore the bill came before the Senate.\n  We have not really worked out all of the details of this. Therefore, \nI am informed by the chairman of the subcommittee he may not be able to \nsupport this amendment at this time.\n  It is my intention to at least begin the process on behalf of myself \nand Senator Hutchison, who hopefully will be present shortly, so we can \nbegin the discussion as to how to find a way to fund some additional \nCustoms inspectors, particularly to be deployed on the southwest \nborder.\n  Before I describe the problem and the reason for this, I commend the \nchairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee for a really heroic \neffort to save existing Customs inspectors.\n  What had happened is, the way the administration's budget had been \nprepared, it was going to fund existing agents out of a fee structure \nthat never had any chance of being passed by the Congress or \nimplemented into law. Had not the chairman and ranking member acted \nquickly to find other sources of funding, we would have lost 617 \nexisting Customs inspectors, but they were able to find that money \nelsewhere.\n  As a result, those positions have been saved at least for now. Where \nthat leaves us is exactly even, with no increase in Customs officers, \ndespite the huge increases in the number of people and the amount of \ncommercial traffic crossing our border, particularly in the Southwest.\n  What that means is we are just literally dead in the water despite \nthe efforts of the subcommittee chairman, Senator Campbell.\n  That is why we wanted to find an additional $50 million to hire 500 \nagents--only 500 agents--for next year to help with this problem.\n  Let me describe a little bit the problem on the Southwest border. As \nyou know, we passed NAFTA. NAFTA has enabled us to dramatically \nincrease commercial traffic between Mexico and the border, our four \nborder States of the United States. But even without NAFTA, we would \nstill have an increase in commercial traffic as well as the daily \ntraffic between the communities south of the border and the American \ncities on our side.\n  I was somewhat amused that my colleague from Michigan, Senator \nAbraham, was very concerned about the situation on the Canadian border \nnear Detroit. He was lamenting the fact we could end up with a \nsituation where there was a 2-minute delay for every car going through \nthe border checkpoint--a 2-minute delay. Just think what that would \nmean with the large number of people who wanted to cross into the \nUnited States from Canada each day.\n  The reason I had to chuckle a little bit is, if we are successful, if \nwe do get some additional agents, and the chairman of the subcommittee \nis successful in protecting what we have, our goal, stated by the \nFinance Committee, is to get to the point where we will only have a 20-\nminute delay per car at the Arizona border or at the Mexican-United \nStates border.\n  A 20-minute delay every time you want to cross the border becomes \nonerous, particularly to people who live in the border communities and \nwho every day cross the border for business or for family or pleasure \nreasons. There are literally hundreds and thousands of people who do \nthat every day. This does not speak of the commercial traffic, which I \nwill talk about in just a moment.\n  The point is, we are trying to get to a point where it only takes you \n20 minutes to come into the United States or to go into Mexico. But we \nare talking specifically about coming into the United States. That is a \nvery onerous situation when you are trying to promote commerce as well \nas more tourists coming to the United States, as well as families. So \nthis is not something that is a luxury but something I think everyone \nwould recognize is very important.\n  I will talk about some of the numbers because I think it is very \ninstructive.\n  The traffic congestion at any of our border crossing points into \nMexico--you just have to be there to see it. The number of commercial \ntrucks, for example, that cross the border annually in my State of \nArizona increased from 287,000 in 1994 to 347,000 in 1998. We do not \nhave the personnel to keep up with that congestion.\n  For example, in San Luis, AZ, which depends very heavily on cross-\nborder trade, you can easily wait 3 hours to cross. That is not unheard \nof at all, to sit there for 3 hours waiting to cross into the United \nStates. This is during times when it is very critical, particularly for \nproduce. Much of the commercial traffic that comes from Mexico to the \nUnited States is produce. It does not do any good for that produce to \nbe sitting out there for 3 hours in the very warm sun south of Yuma, \nAZ, waiting to come in through the border crossing.\n  I ask my colleagues, if they had to wait 3 hours every time they \nwanted to get someplace on Capitol Hill, how long they would stand for \nit. Obviously, not very long.\n  We just don't have enough Customs inspectors, however, to staff that \nSan Luis port even to stay open during some key hours. I point out, the \ncommercial point is closed on Saturdays. So we are only talking about \ngeneral business hours.\n\n[[Page S7993]]\n\n  In effect, what ends up happening is, you get cancellations or \nreroutes hundreds of miles away to other ports when you have these \nkinds of long delays. The number of inspectors at this particular port \nof San Luis has increased. Do you want to know by how much it has \nincreased? One inspector over the last 5 years. That is all. It went \nfrom 51 to 52. Obviously, we are not keeping up with the traffic.\n  The same is true of the port of Nogales, which is the largest port in \nArizona. There the fresh produce industry is very big, both import and \nexport. It is over $1.5 billion a year. It is now the fifth busiest \nport on our Southwest border. But the Nogales port does not have enough \ninspectors. The number of inspectors there actually decreased last year \nby seven.\n  According to the Fresh Produce Association of America, there have \nbeen occasions, even during the low-produce season, where 6-mile truck \nbackups have occurred down in Mexico. Just think about that for a \nmoment--6 miles of trucks waiting to clear Customs. It is not at all \nuncommon for the truckers to come to the border and literally have to \nwait overnight before they can find a slot the next day to cross into \nthe United States. And we are trying to encourage trade?\n  We understand that trade benefits people on both sides of the border. \nObviously, we are not doing our part when the produce from Mexico \ncannot come into the United States because we do not have enough \ninspectors.\n  The lack of personnel on our borders is also a very serious problem \nwith respect to the interdiction of illegal drugs and other contraband. \nAs we all know, the Customs inspectors are really our first line of \ndefense there. I have been on the border where you have these huge, \nlong lines of traffic. Everybody is anxious to get through, and you \njust have a few ports with a few inspectors there struggling mightily \nto determine whether or not there may be some illegal drugs or \ncontraband. We have given them some good high-tech equipment they can \nuse, but it still requires manpower. Every week, they are able to stop \nsome kind of traffic in which smuggling is going on, but they do not \nbegin to catch even a fairly significant percentage of it.\n  Just to give you an idea what they have been able to accomplish, \nbetween 1994 and 1998 heroin seizures have gone up by 2,078 percent, \nmarijuana seizures up 80 percent. It is clear that more Customs \ninspectors are needed to keep up with these increasing percentages of \nattempts to smuggle drugs and other contraband into our country.\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, the Finance Committee marked up its \nversion of the Customs reauthorization bill not too long ago. In it, \nthey approved legislation that Senators Domenici, Gramm, Hutchison, and \nMcCain, and I and other border Senators introduced, to increase the \nCustoms personnel in order to reduce the wait times there to better \nfight the war on drugs and to enhance commerce to 20 minutes per \nvehicle.\n  When we can't even provide the funding to get the wait times down to \n20 minutes per vehicle, we are derelict in our duty; we are failing in \nour responsibility; and the responsibility is on the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  That is why Senator Hutchison and I have introduced this amendment to \nadd $50 million for 500 inspectors. We may take one item out to make it \n$49 million so that the offsets we have provided would be more easily \nsupportable by our colleagues, but this is an increase of merely 500 \nagents with this $50 million. That is what it costs to get the \nequipment and the training and get this number of Customs inspectors \nactually on line at one of our ports of entry.\n  The amendment, as I said, will actually permit the deployment of \nthese agents during the next year to one of these points of entry where \nthey are needed for the Southwest border.\n  Just to focus a little bit more on the specific need with respect to \ncommerce there, should my colleagues be interested, the number of \ntrucks crossing the U.S. border annually has increased from 7.5 million \nin 1994 to over 10 million in 1998. That is a 40-percent increase. More \nthan 372 million people crossed either the United States-Mexico or \nUnited States-Canadian border in the last fiscal year.\n  But even with this huge increase in the crossings, of both \nindividuals and commercial traffic, the number of Customs inspectors \nand the canine enforcement officers--that is an important part of this, \ntoo--has only increased by 540 people between 1994 and 1998. That is \nsimply not enough to keep up with the commercial traffic, let alone the \nmissing of opportunities to seize illegal drugs.\n  Of the 3,400-plus pounds of illegal heroin seized last year, Customs \nseized 2,700 pounds. Of the 1.76 million pounds of marijuana seized, \nCustoms seized just under 1 million pounds. And of the roughly 265,000 \npounds of cocaine seized last year, Customs seized 148,000 pounds.\n  Clearly, this is where the first line of defense is in our war on \ndrugs. I know my colleagues and I love to stand here and talk about how \nwe need to get tougher in the war on drugs. This is our chance. The \nfirst line of defense in the war on drugs in the United States is at \nthe point of entry where people attempt to bring this illegal \ncontraband into our country and, because we are unwilling to fund the \nnumber of customs inspectors required, we don't have enough people on \nthe border to check every vehicle and, therefore, to find and to stop \nthese kinds of illegal drugs coming into our country.\n\n  I know the chairman of the subcommittee has talked a lot about the \nneed to meet this need. I don't think there are any of us who don't \nappreciate what we have to try to do. It is very difficult in a tough \nbudget environment to find the money to do it.\n  What I have tried to point out is that we have to set priorities. If \nyou look at all of the other parts of the budget, I can't find hardly \nany area in this particular budget that, in my view, has a higher \npriority than protecting our kids from drugs, than protecting our \nborder from people who are literally invading our country with illegal \nsubstances to do detriment to our citizens. What is more important in \nthis budget than that?\n  I, literally, challenge my colleagues who will oppose our amendment, \ndefending appropriations that are in this mark for their particular \narea of interest, because we have had to provide $50 million in offsets \nin order to fund this $50 million for increased Customs agents, I \nchallenge my colleagues to come to the floor and be willing to explain \nwhy what they are trying to protect in this budget is of a higher \npriority than stopping drugs at our border. I will be very curious to \nsee how many of our colleagues are willing to come and vote against our \namendment because it is taking funding out of something that is \nimportant to them, to explain to us why that is more important than \nthis.\n  I am sorry to present that challenge as directly as I am. I think if \nwe are going to be serious about this problem, rather than just talk \nabout it, we have to address this in a very serious way that makes \ntough choices, that prioritizes. We can't just say, well, it is hard to \ndo, and, therefore, we will try to do it next year. That is why we are \nso insistent on trying to accomplish this now.\n  There is much more I could say about this particular problem at this \ntime. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison is going to speak to this amendment \nas well. Perhaps the chairman of the subcommittee would like to address \nthe issue now; I am not certain. Perhaps I could make that opportunity \navailable, should the subcommittee chairman wish to avail himself of \nit.\n  If not, I am happy to speak to the issue more.\n  Let me stop at this point and see if Members might have any other \nconversation on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona for \nbringing this to the attention of the Senate. I certainly understand \nand sympathize with him. My State borders his, and I spend a good deal \nof time in Arizona. I am fully aware of the problem we have with our \nborders. They are like a sieve, very frankly.\n  I wish we could have found the additional $50 million he asked for, \nbut, as he has already mentioned, we did have some budget constraints. \nWe simply could not find it.\n  Let me tell my colleagues from where the Senator from Arizona would \ntake the money to offset the $50 million additional money he would like \nto\n\n[[Page S7994]]\n\nput in this account. He would take $1,675,000 from the Federal Election \nCommission. He would take $1,095,000 from the Federal Labor Relations \nAuthority. He would take $34,786,000 from the GSA. These are repairs \nand alterations that are badly needed for Federal buildings across the \ncountry. He would take $10,854,000 from the GSA policy and operations \naccount, and $1,617,000 from the Merit Systems Protection Board.\n  I will talk for a few minutes about what we have done. First of all, \nin this bill the committee has provided $1.67 billion in funding for \nfiscal year 2000 for the Customs Service. This level is $263 million \nmore than was requested by the administration and provides for \nmaintaining current levels of funding and other related costs as well \nas nonrelated labor issues associated with the increase of inflation, \nwith the exception of the fiscal year 1999 pay raise component.\n  The committee has provided new funding for the Customs integrity \nawareness effort, totaling $4.3 million. In addition, the committee \nprovided an additional $2.5 million for the establishment of an \nassistant commissioner for training, which will provide in-service \ntraining and professional development of Customs personnel. There have \nbeen news reports about the breaches of integrity within the Customs \nService. These programs are in response to those issues. This funding \nwill assist the Customs Service in improving their hiring \nmethodologies, ensuring that applicants are of the highest quality. In \naddition, the funding will improve the recruitment and redesign of the \nhiring process as well as support existing personnel.\n  The committee has continued level funding for the Customs Service \nchild pornography efforts. The committee has been very pleased by the \nCustoms Service's efforts, given the limited resources dedicated to \nthat program. The committee has also provided $19 million in funding \nfor items associated with technology and staffing along the Southwest \nborder, to which the Senator alluded.\n  Last year, as part of the fiscal year 1999 emergency drug \nsupplemental funding, this committee provided an additional $80 million \nfor nonintrusive inspection equipment on top of the $40.6 million for a \nvariety of technologies for the Southwest border. This funding provided \nfor the purchase of a mobile truck X-ray system, railcar inspection \nsystems, gamma ray inspection systems, and higher energy, heavy pallet \nX-ray systems. Of the $276 million of funds provided in that emergency \nsupplemental, the Customs Service has not yet obligated all those \nfunds. In fact, as of today, there is $143 million that has not been \nspent in the account.\n  In addition, there is sufficient funding to cover the costs of the \nannualization of Operation Hardline and GATEWAY, as well as equipment \nannualization for fiscal year 1999. This will allow Treasury to \nannualize the cost of these border-related positions.\n\n  In addition, there is $1.29 million included to cover the cost for \nthe mandatory workload increases during peak processing hours for the \nnew crossings, including staffing and the dedicated commuter lane in El \nPaso, TX.\n  The committee has also included new funding for the Customs Integrity \nAwareness Program at $4.3 million, so the total cost of the effort is \nnow $18 million. That is $6 million in the base and $4.3 million for \nthis year for polygraphs and $8 million for agent inspector \nrelocations.\n  I wish we could have done more. Very simply, as everybody in this \nbody knows, we were up against budget constraints. We simply did not \nhave the money to fund all the things that we would like to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Senator REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Texas is here to \ndebate the Kyl-Hutchison amendment. I think that is appropriate. I want \nto respond briefly to Senator Kyl's statement.\n  We are working under some very difficult budget constraints. There is \na budget that is affecting the work we do on the floor that I didn't \nsupport. It was a budget that was given to us and passed by the \nmajority. There are all kinds of problems we have with domestic \ndiscretionary spending, including more Customs agents. I would love to \nhave more Customs agents. We need them very badly in Las Vegas, the \nmost rapidly growing area in the whole country.\n  Remember, we, on this side of the aisle, did not vote for that \nbudget. The budget we are working under is the budget that was given to \nus by the majority. With all of our domestic discretionary programs, we \nhave a lot of problems, not the least of which is Customs agents.\n  I hope the American public is aware of the fact that veterans' \nbenefits, as a result of the budget we have, are being stripped \nsignificantly. I hope there will be an effort made to have more money \nplaced in the allocations to allow more appropriate and fair spending \nfor domestic discretionary programs in all of our appropriations bills.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I hope we will be able to allocate the \n$50 million in the Kyl-Hutchison amendment for the hiring of new \nCustoms agents.\n  We have a terrible situation. I understand the position of Senator \nCampbell and Senator Reid in having to allocate this money. I think \nthey have done a yeoman's job working within the budget constraints.\n  The fact of the matter is, in any budget, any family has to set \npriorities. This administration has refused to set a priority of \nprotecting our borders from illegal immigration and illegal drugs \ncoming in. The fact is, they asked for no new Border Patrol agents this \nyear, even though Congress has allocated 1,000 new Border Patrol agents \nevery year for 5 years starting 2 years ago.\n  They didn't even hire the allocation in this year's budget. We \nauthorized and paid for 1,000 Border Patrol agents in this year's \nbudget, and this administration has only been able to hire 200 to 400 \nagents. Since we lose so many, we are worse off than we were when we \nstarted this fiscal year.\n  Now we come to Customs agents who are, once again, on the front line, \nparticularly for illegal drugs because they are the ones responsible \nfor searching trucks and cars that come in through the border. Once \nagain, we have a request from the President for zero new Customs \nagents. The Customs Office itself asked for 617 new Customs agents. \nLook at what these Customs agents are doing. More than $10 billion in \ndrugs flow across the U.S.-Mexico border each year. Last year, the \nCustoms Service seized 995,000 pounds of marijuana, 148,000 pounds of \ncocaine, and 3,500 pounds of heroin.\n  We are talking about not fully funding new agents, to not give these \npeople on the front line the help they need in stopping the flow of \nillegal drugs into our country. In Loredo, TX, the biggest commercial \nport of entry on our southern border, there were over 1 million truck \ncrossings last year. There are routine waits of 4 to 6 hours. At El \nPaso's Bridge of the Americas, the hours of operation are from 6 a.m. \nto 5 p.m., but because the Customs Service can't afford to pay \novertime, they have to close at 4 so that they will be able to actually \nfinish the people in the pipeline by 5. Trucks entering an import lot \nafter 4 have to wait until 6 the next morning just to have their \ndocumentation cleared. This is hurting not only our ability to curb \nillegal traffic, but it is also hurting trade and free trade and \nratcheting up the cost of goods coming in from the border. So it is \nvery important that we look at Customs agents as the front line for \ngetting illegal drugs stopped at our country's borders.\n  DEA Administrator, Tom Constantine, was before the Commerce, State, \nJustice Subcommittee this past March, and he said:\n\n       The vast majority of drugs available in the United States \n     originate overseas. The international drug trade is \n     controlled by a small number of high echelon drug lords, who \n     reside in Colombia and Mexico. Most Americans are unaware of \n     the vast damage that has been caused to their communities by \n     international drug trafficking syndicates, most recently by \n     organized crime groups headquartered in Mexico. At the \n     current time, these traffickers pose the greatest threat to \n     communities around the United States. Their impact is no \n     longer limited to cities and towns along the Southwest \n     border; traffickers from Mexico are now routinely\n\n[[Page S7995]]\n\n     operating in the Midwest, the Southeast, the Northwest, and, \n     increasingly, in the northeastern portion of the United \n     States.\n\n  We need to have as a priority stopping illegal drugs coming through \nour borders. And if the administration continues to ask for zero new \nborder patrol agents and zero new Customs agents, we are not going to \nbe able to win the war on drugs. We cannot do it.\n  Senator Kyl and I didn't choose to go in and take from other parts of \nthe budget; that was our only option. When the President comes in with \na budget that asks for no new Customs agents, we could do nothing but \ntry to find offsets in order to maintain the integrity of the budget. \nSo we went for administrative costs that were increases in spending \nover last year. It wasn't our choice to do this, but the \ndifference between having increases in the GSA budget or increases in \nCustoms agents who are going to be on the front line stopping illegal \ndrugs from coming into our country, and to ease the flow of trade into \nour country, it seems to me, is pretty clear.\n\n  So I hope that we can make this a priority. I look forward to working \nwith Senator Campbell and Senator Reid in the conference committee to \ntry to mitigate the impact of any cuts that would be made in other \nbudgets. I understand their position and having to defend this bill. \nThey had hard choices to make. But we can't choose to walk away from \nlaw enforcement on our borders. This is a Federal responsibility. We \ncan't fill in with local law enforcement officers. They don't have the \ncapability to stem the flow of illegal drugs into our country.\n  So I hope our colleagues will support the Kyl-Hutchison amendment. We \nwill do everything we can to mitigate the cuts that we are making in \nother areas, but it has to be our priority to get control of our \nsovereign borders, to keep illegal drugs from going into Cleveland, OH, \nor from going into Tacoma, WA, or Wilmington, DE, because that is where \nthese drugs end up; they don't stay on the border. They infiltrate our \ncountry, and we must stop it. This is one of the ways we are going to \ntry to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I have to tell you, I have no quarrel \nwith my colleagues from Texas and Arizona in my efforts and interests \nin reducing the use of drugs in America, since I helped write this bill \nand I have been on the forefront of trying to reduce drugs and putting \nmoney where it is most needed. But I remind my friend from Texas that, \nin fact, in this bill we put in $263 million over the administration's \nrequest. In addition, as I have already said, of the $276 million of \nfunds provided in the emergency supplement, which was signed into law \non May 31 of this year, Customs has still not spent $143 million of \nthat money. I know some of it is for equipment, but certainly some of \nthat could be transferred within the Department to areas that need it. \nWe have done the best we can.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the Senator will yield, I was thinking as we were \ntalking about this, and as the Senator was making his point, perhaps we \ncould look for offsets within Customs' budget, as well as some of these \nother areas. We would like to pass the amendment, but we also would \nlike to maybe look for other ways that Senator Kyl and I could set \npriorities within the Customs Department budget and maybe work \nsomething out that would not hurt another agency as much but we \nreprioritize within the budget.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. We will be happy to work with the Senator from Texas \nand Senator Kyl. If we can find the offsets within Customs' budget, we \nwould be delighted to work with the Senator.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I just wanted to address a comment to the \nchairman of the subcommittee, Senator Campbell. I made the point when I \nfirst began to speak that without his efforts, we would not have been \nable to save existing Customs inspectors. I misspoke and understated \nthe nature of the problem and, therefore, the significance of what \nSenator Campbell was able to accomplish. I think in the way I stated \nit, I said there were 617 additional inspectors that were at risk. \nActually, I think the number is closer to 5,000.\n  Had Senator Campbell and the other leadership of the subcommittee not \ngotten to the problem to find an additional $312 million, as he pointed \nout, all 5,000 of those existing inspectors would have been at risk \nbecause they were being funded by a source which was not ever going to \nmaterialize and, in fact, which has not materialized. So in announcing \nthe chairman's successes, I actually understated the nature of what he \nwas able to accomplish. Senator Hutchison and I, therefore, take \nnothing away from the chairman of the committee, who has had to \nscramble very hard to try to help find a solution to this problem of \nCustoms agents at our borders.\n  We have expressed, I think, in the strongest terms that we can, our \nappreciation for that. The chairman doesn't have to remind us of the \nhard work that he has put into that. We simply are of the view that we \nhave to find a way to do more than tread water to stay even because, as \nboth of us have pointed out, the traffic at the border is not staying \neven. The drug smugglers' efforts to bring more contraband into the \ncountry is not staying even. We have to try to keep up. The modest \nincrease we are talking about is an effort to try to keep up with the \nnature of the problem that we have.\n  Point No. 1, the chairman is absolutely correct. They fought very \nhard to get additional money just to save the status quo.\n  But I think the second point we are making is also valid; that is, \npreserving the status quo isn't good enough. We need to try to find a \nsource to at least find another $50 million for these additional \nCustoms inspectors to at least try to keep pace with what is going on \nat our borders.\n  I ask the chairman, if there is no further discussion, we could \nsimply defer a vote on this until afterwards. It is my understanding \nthere will be a vote on the Lautenberg amendment in roughly 90 minutes \nor so. Perhaps we can simply conclude this conversation now and \nschedule any vote immediately after that.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I move to table the Kyl amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays. I further ask that the vote on the Kyl \namendment take place immediately after the vote on the Lautenberg \namendment, No. 1214, which we expect to take place later this \nafternoon.\n  However, I will be happy to work with my colleague, and if we can \nfind a solution or a way to offset the money in the Customs' budget, at \nthat time I will ask to vitiate this motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request. I \nask unanimous consent that the time prior to the motion to table \namendment No. 1214, the Lautenberg amendment, be limited to 90 minutes \nto be equally divided in the usual form, and that no other amendments \nbe in order to the amendment prior to the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill for \nallowing me to do this.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for about 6 minutes to introduce a \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Akaka pertaining to the introduction of S. 1317 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, we have an agreement worked out on two \namendments dealing with child care centers and Federal activities.\n\n[[Page S7996]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 1197\n\n (Purpose: To ensure the safety and availability of child care centers \n                         in Federal facilities)\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I ask the Jeffords amendment No. 1197 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell], for Mr. Jeffords \n     and Ms. Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered 1197.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'm pleased to join Senators Jeffords and \nLandrieu as a cosponsor of this amendment that helps address an issue \naffecting many lower pay-grade federal employees with young children: \naffordable child care. Often there are facilities available to fill \nthis need, but the costs puts this option beyond the reach of these \nfamilies. This amendment addresses this concern by allowing the use of \nappropriated funds to help these families. Though I am concerned that \nthe House may be uncomfortable with the overall scope of this \namendment, I look forward to working with Senators Jeffords and \nLandrieu to make sure this measure or a reasonable compromise is \nacceptable to both the House and the Senate.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to reiterate the importance of an \namendment that we agreed to earlier today by unanimous consent. This \namendment offered by Senator Jeffords and myself will increase the \navailability, safety, and quality of Federal child care.\n  I firmly believe that the Federal Government should serve as a model \nfor other employers to implement child care services in this country. \nThese services must be affordable, safe, and be provided in an \natmosphere that supports healthy development and growth of children. We \nhave already made much progress within the Department of Defense with \nthe enactment of legislation that ensures quality, safe and affordable \nchild care to defense employees. The DoD program is now considered one \nof the finest in the world. It is now time to take this exemplary model \nand expand it to all Federal agencies.\n  The executive branch of Government has responsibility for over 1,000 \nchild care centers--788 through the military, 109 through the General \nServices Administration, and 127 through other Federal departments. \nOver 215,000 children are being provided child care through these \nvarious Federal programs.\n  Unfortunately, almost 1/3 of Federal employees with young children \nmay not have access to any Federal child care services. We need to \nensure all children of Federal employees, not just those under the \nDepartment of Defense, have access to high quality and affordable child \ncare.\n  Every parent should know that when they drop their children off at a \nFederal day care facility that their child is safe--because we have \nenacted uniform safety standards for these child care facilities.\n  We also must make efforts to ensure that child care is made available \nto every Federal employee regardless of their income. Now, more than \never, Federal employees are struggling to balance work and family \nobligations. They are also struggling to pay for the cost of child \ncare. Currently, the cost of quality child care services ranges from \n$3,000 to more than $10,000, depending on where a person lives. In my \nState, this care ranges from $3,000 to $6,000. Unfortunately, many \nfamilies in Louisiana cannot afford this cost. In fact, there are over \n500,000 children throughout Louisiana whose families earn under \n$27,000.\n  One of the first steps that the Federal Government can and should \ntake is to provide a model for other employers to follow, so more \nindividuals will have greater access to affordable and quality child \ncare. Moreover, if the Federal Government is to remain a credible \nprovider of child care services, Congress must enact this important \namendment. I look forward to working my colleagues in the House and \nSenate to ensure adoption of this legislation in the conference report.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this amendment will go a long way toward \nensuring the safety and healthy development of children of federal \nemployees who are cared for in federally sponsored or operated child \ncare centers. The Senate passed this amendment last year on the \nTreasury-Postal appropriations bill by unanimous consent. \nUnfortunately, it was dropped during the last few hours of the \nconference. So I am back again this year.\n  In 1987, Congress passed the Trible amendment which permitted \nexecutive, legislative, and judicial branch agencies to utilize a \nportion of federally owned or leased space for the provision of child \ncare services for federal employees. The General Services \nAdministration (GSA) was given the authority to provide guidance, \nassistance, and oversight to federal agencies for the development of \nchild care centers. In the decade since the Trible amendment was \npassed, hundreds of federal facilities throughout the nation have \nestablished onsite child care centers which are a tremendous help to \nour employees.\n  As you know, Federal property is exempt from state and local laws, \nregulations, and oversight. What this means for child care centers on \nthat property are not subject to even the most minimal health and \nsafety standards. Even the most basic state and local health and safety \nrequirements do not apply to child care centers Federal facilities.\n  I find this very troubling, and I think we sell our federal employees \na bill of goods when federally owned leased child care cannot guarantee \nthat their children are in safe facilities. The Federal Government \nshould set the example when it comes to providing safe child care. It \nshould not be turn an apathetic shoulder from meeting such standards \nsimply because state and local regulations do not apply to them.\n  As Congress and the administration turn their spotlight on our \nnation's child care system, we must first get our own house in order. \nWe must safeguard and protect the children receiving services in child \ncare centers housed in federal facilities. Our employees should not be \ndenied some assurance that the centers in which they place their \nchildren are accountable for meeting basic health and safety standards.\n  This amendment will require all child care services located in \nfederal facilities to meet, at the very least, the same level of health \nand safety standards required of other child care centers in the same \ngeographical area. That sounds like common sense, but as we all know \ntoo well, common sense is not always reflected in the law.\n  It should also be made clear that state and local standards should be \na floor for basic health and safety, and not a ceiling. The role of the \nFederal Government--and, I believe, of the United States Congress in \nparticular--is to constantly strive to do better and to lead by \nexample. Federal facilities should always try to provide the highest \nquality of care. The GSA has required national accreditation in GSA-\nowned and leased facilities for years, and the majority of child care \ncenters in GSA facilities are either in compliance with those \naccreditation standards or are strenuously working to get there. This \nis high quality of care towards which we should strive for in all of \nour Federal child care facilities.\n  Federal child care should mean something more than simply location on \na Federal facility. The Federal Government has an obligation to provide \nsafe care for its employees, and it has a responsibility for making \nsure that those standards are monitored and enforced. Some Federal \nemployees receive this guarantee. Many do not. We can and must do \nbetter.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I ask the amendment be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1197) was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1211 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I call up amendment No. 1211 by Ms. Landrieu, and I ask \nthat it be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 1211) was withdrawn.\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent immediately following the\n\n[[Page S7997]]\n\nvote in relation to the Kyl-Hutchison amendment on the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill, the Senate immediately proceed to a vote on the \nconfirmation of the nomination of Lawrence Summers to be Secretary of \nthe Treasury, Executive Calendar No. 95.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I now ask unanimous consent it be in order to ask for \nthe yeas and nays on the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1214\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the inclusion of alcohol abuse by minors in \n            the national anti-drug media campaign for youth)\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1214, which \nhas been sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself, \n     and Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Harkin, and \n     Mr. Johnson, proposes an amendment numbered 1214.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. INCLUSION OF ALCOHOL ABUSE BY MINORS IN NATIONAL \n                   ANTI-DRUG MEDIA CAMPAIGN.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999 (Public Law 105-277) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in section 101(h) of division A (the Treasury \n     Department Appropriations Act, 1999), in title III under the \n     heading ``federal drug control programs--special forfeiture \n     fund (including transfer of funds)'', by inserting \n     ``(including the use of alcohol by individuals who have not \n     attained 21 years of age)'' after ``drug use among young \n     Americans'';\n       (b) Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization \n     Act of 1998.--Section 704(b) of the Office of National Drug \n     Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 (title VII of \n     division C of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999 (Public Law 105-277)) \n     is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (14), by striking ``and'' after the \n     semicolon;\n       (2) in paragraph (15), by striking the period and inserting \n     ``; and'', and by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(16) shall conduct a national media campaign in \n     accordance with the Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998 \n     (including with respect to the use of alcohol by individuals \n     who have not attained 21 years of age).''.\n       (c) Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998.--The Drug-Free \n     Media Campaign Act of 1998 (subtitle A of title I of division \n     D of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act, 1999 (Public Law 105-277)) is amended--\n       (1) in section 102(a), by inserting before the period the \n     following: ``, and use of alcohol by individuals in the \n     United States who have not attained 21 years of age''; and\n       (2) in section 103(a)(1)(H), by inserting after ``antidrug \n     messages'' the following: ``and messages discouraging \n     underage alcohol consumption,''.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. This amendment is being offered on behalf of myself, \nSenator Byrd, Senator Hutchison, Senator Hollings, Senator Johnson, and \nSenator Harkin. This amendment would require the drug czar's office to \ninclude messages in his current media campaign to discourage children \nfrom engaging in underage alcohol consumption.\n  Running ads on national TV espousing the evil of drug use without \neven mentioning alcohol sends the wrong message to America's children. \nIt is the equivalent of telling kids, ``Say `no' to drugs, but this \nBud's for you.''\n  The fact is, consuming alcohol is illegal in all 50 States if you are \nunder the age of 21. Among America's youth, underage alcohol \nconsumption is just as big of a problem as drug use.\n  The facts are revealing. For those who are not aware of the danger, \nalcohol kills six times more children ages 12-20 than all other illegal \ndrugs combined. It was a surprise to me, and I suspect it is a surprise \nto millions of other Americans.\n  Underage alcohol consumption and its devastating effects on children \npaint a daunting picture. According to the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, the average age at which children start drinking is 13. \nEven worse, the research shows that children who drink at the age of 13 \nhave a 47-percent chance of becoming alcohol-dependent; if they wait \nuntil they are 21 to begin drinking, they have only a 10-percent chance \nof becoming dependent.\n  In all, there are nearly 4 million young people in this country who \nsuffer from alcohol dependence. They account for one-fifth of all \nalcohol-dependent Americans.\n  The bottom line is that we dare not turn a blind eye when an \nopportunity comes along to address this problem. The drug czar's media \ncampaign is that opportunity.\n  Drug czar Gen. Barry McCaffrey has said:\n\n       [T]he most dangerous drug in America today is still \n     alcohol.\n\n  Gen. McCaffrey has also said:\n\n       [Alcohol is] the biggest drug abuse problem for \n     adolescents, and it's linked to the use of other, illegal \n     drugs.\n\n  Statistics support what General McCaffrey has been saying. According \nto the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, \nyoung people who drink alcohol are 7.5 times more likely to use any \nillegal drug and 50 times more likely to use cocaine than young people \nwho never drink alcohol. In other words, alcohol is a gateway drug. Too \noften it leads to the use of marijuana, cocaine, and heroin by \nchildren. Since that is true, including ads addressing underage alcohol \nconsumption in the media campaign would benefit the campaign and \nincrease its overall effectiveness.\n  In advocating for this amendment, our voices are not alone. Surgeon \nGeneral David Satcher recently wrote a letter to General McCaffrey:\n\n       I want to recommend that you include advertisements \n     addressing underage drinking in the paid portion of ONDCP's \n     media campaign.\n\n  Surgeon General Satcher also stated:\n\n       It is time to more effectively address the drug that \n     children and teens tell us is their greatest concern and the \n     drug we know is most likely to result in their injury or \n     death.\n\n  In addition to support from the Surgeon General, we have bipartisan \nsupport in the House. This same amendment was already added to the \nHouse version of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill by \nCongresswoman Roybal-Allard from California and Congressman Wolf from \nVirginia.\n  Editorials have also been written across this country supporting our \nposition. Editorials have appeared in the Washington Post, the New York \nTimes, Christian Science Monitor, and the Los Angeles Times, among \nother newspapers.\n  This effort on behalf of our children is further supported by more \nthan 80 organizations, including Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the \nAmerican Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the \nAmerican Public Health Association, the Center for Science in the \nPublic Interest, and the Crime Prevention Council.\n  The Senate has not been silent on the issue of underage drinking in \nthe past, and we should not stand mute now. We have made clear on at \nleast three occasions that it is the law of the land to prohibit the \nuse of alcohol by those under the age of 21.\n  I am proud to have been the author of the 1984 law that made 21 the \ndrinking age in all 50 States. As a matter of fact, I had an argument \nwith a couple of my children who were less than 21 at the time. We had \na long discussion. They said it might cut into their fun, their proms.\n  But I looked at the statistics and saw how many lives we could save. \nIn the almost 16 years that law has been on the books, we have saved \n15,000 kids from dying on the highways.\n  Later, in 1995, Senator Byrd led the charge on ``zero tolerance'' for \nunderage alcohol consumption by writing the law that says if you are \nunder 21, a .02 blood-alcohol level is legally drunk.\n  Our amendment is not prescriptive. It would not tell the drug czar \nwhich types of alcohol ads or precisely how many alcohol ads would be \nrun. But it would require the drug czar to include the underage alcohol \nconsumption message in its media campaign. And it would give General \nMcCaffrey the authority to do so, authority he has claimed he currently \nlacks.\n  We want to send a strong message to America's youth that neither \nunderage alcohol consumption nor drug use is acceptable. We do not want \nto say there is a preference of one over the\n\n[[Page S7998]]\n\nother. We do not want to do that by being silent on alcohol.\n  Mr. President, the only successful path to winning the war on drugs \nis the one paved by preventing underage drinking. If we cannot muster \nthe political will to tell our children that underage drinking is \nwrong, we will never win the war on drugs.\n  We must not accept underage drinking as a so-called rite of passage \nbecause it is a passage directly to illegal drugs such as marijuana, \ncocaine, and heroin; and it is a passage to a life of alcohol \ndependency.\n  What we have heard from colleagues who are not supporting us is that \ndrugs are illegal. But so is drinking under the age of 21.\n  Tobacco is a legal product, but we have worked hard to try to stop \nyoung people from starting to smoke because we know eventually it often \nleads to respiratory failure, lung cancer, and other diseases, as well \nas premature death.\n  So I hope our colleagues will support this amendment. It is time to \nmake young people aware of the facts. Underage drinking is not \nacceptable. It leads to addiction, and nothing is more painful to a \nparent than to see an addicted child.\n  We ought not to be deterred by any arguments that suggest that adding \nalcohol to the media campaign might detract from the message about \ndrugs. What is the difference? Addiction is addiction is addiction. We \ndo not want to lose our kids. We do not want them to lose control, and \nwe do not want them to lose their lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, before I speak to the Lautenberg \namendment, I ask unanimous consent to correct the Record. On several \noccasions in earlier debate I referred to the Kyl amendment No. 1195 as \nthe Kyl amendment. I ask unanimous consent to correct that title to the \nKyl-Hutchison amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friend \nfrom New Jersey. I came from an alcoholic family. Believe me, I know \nfirsthand the devastating effects of what it does in a family. I have \nhad over a dozen relatives, uncles, cousins and so on, including a \nsister, who have died from some form of alcohol-related abuse. I know \nthe devastating effects on a whole community; on society as a whole. I \nknow the cost and I do not think anybody detests it more than I do.\n  As my colleague, Senator Dorgan, knows, coming from a State in which \nthere are many Indian reservations, fetal alcohol syndrome, which is an \neffect on children from mothers drinking too much, is literally \nhundreds of times worse on those reservations. On one reservation in \nAmerica, 1 out of 4 children is born with some degree of fetal alcohol \nsyndrome as opposed to the national average of 1 out of 500.\n  I am concerned, but the question for this body is not whether we want \nto reduce the use of alcohol by youngsters. Of course all of us want to \ndo that. The question here is whether the ONDCP is the right vehicle or \nnot. My view is it is the wrong vehicle.\n  I have been the chairman of this committee since the inception of \nthis media campaign, when Senator Kohl was the ranking minority, and \nthis project is something the committee originally had a great deal of \ndifficulty in doing, because we wanted to make sure we got the best use \nof taxpayers' money when we set this up. I believe this amendment would \nsimply dilute that mission. The committee did not provide as much as we \nwould want this year. In fact, we are putting in $50 million less this \nyear than we did for the ONDCP last year. I believe the inclusion of an \nanti-alcohol campaign would simply decrease the funds available for the \nantidrug campaign more than we want to. The House, in my opinion, made \na mistake when they pursued this action.\n\n  I also tell you we are, in my view, increasing the jurisdiction of \nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy without legislative \nauthority to do so. This is the wrong vehicle, as I mentioned, and I am \nseriously concerned that the precedent it would set would cause us a \ngreat deal of controversy, maybe open a Pandora's box of other \namendments to broaden the ONDCP into areas it should not be.\n  This amendment expands ONDCP's jurisdiction into alcohol prevention. \nAs I mentioned, they do not have a statutory mandate to do that. There \nare other agencies, such as the Center of Substance Abuse Prevention, \nthat are better equipped to handle this kind of campaign. When we \noriginally put the money into this campaign a few years ago, we wanted \nto make sure we could measure the effects. So there was a GAO study \nauthorized, a 5-year study to review the media campaign and give the \nresults to our committee about the ongoing effects, to see if we, in \nfact, were reducing the use of alcohol consumption by youngsters as a \nresult of the campaign.\n  That study is only halfway through. It still has several years to go. \nI think if we dilute this message, if we start expanding the role, we \nare simply going to completely throw out the validity of that study the \nGAO is doing.\n  So, although I do appreciate the efforts of the Senator from New \nJersey, and I look forward to working with him on other ways we can \nreduce alcohol use by youngsters, I, at this time, oppose the \namendment. I will move to table after my colleague speaks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I require \nto respond to my friend from Colorado.\n  He talks, as he said, with experience, having seen alcohol addiction \nand the devastation it inflicts. But I want to respond specifically to \nthe question the Senator from Colorado raises about dilution of \nmessage. We think that when a campaign is directed toward young people \nand it says ``Say no to drugs,'' the omission of alcohol sends the \nwrong message. That's like saying, ``Drugs are bad for you, but alcohol \nis not so bad.''\n  So when we look at the statistics, and we see alcohol kills six times \nas many young people ages 12 to 20 than all of the illegal drugs \ncombined, that tells us that the media campaign cannot deliver a \nthorough message unless it includes alcohol. Without including alcohol, \nthe media campaign is a mere wink at underage drinking.\n  The drug czar is going to have $1 billion, we hope, over the next 5 \nyears to deliver a message. Mr. President, $1 billion is a lot of \nmoney. So if the media campaign says ``Say no to drugs,'' and it also \nsays ``Say no to alcohol,'' I see nothing wrong with that. And if there \nare ads portraying the horrific things that illegal drugs can do to \nkids, there should be ads portraying the same horrific things that \nalcohol can do to kids.\n  With the budget surpluses we have, we will keep on looking for \nadditional funding for this campaign. One of the things that touches \neverybody in this Chamber, regardless of party, is interest in \nchildren, interest in protecting them from violence, interest in \nprotecting them from disease, and interest in protecting them from \naddiction. So I think it is quite appropriate we combine the message on \naddiction to include all of the products that would be addictive, \nincluding alcohol.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished Senator from \nNew Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg. I compliment him on the battle he has been \nwaging, and successfully, might I add. I am sorry he has elected not to \nreturn to this body. I wish he would change his mind on that score.\n  Let me just say at this point, I am pleased to join Senator \nLautenberg in offering this amendment to the fiscal year 2000 Treasury \nand general government appropriations bill. The amendment would require \nthat the Office of National Drug Control Policy's Antidrug Youth Media \nCampaign include ads regarding illegal underage drinking. It is absurd \nto me that our federally funded media campaign fails to include the No. \n1 drug choice amongst children; namely, alcohol. I do not know how that \ncould escape anyone's attention. I cannot understand why that is not \nincluded.\n  Large numbers of young people are drinking. According to the 1997 \nMonitoring the Future Study conducted by\n\n[[Page S7999]]\n\nthe University of Michigan, approximately 34 percent of high school \nseniors, 22 percent of tenth graders, and 8 percent of eighth graders, \nreport being drunk at least once in a given month.\n  Yes, Mr. President, drunk. I know that is a shocking statistic. It is \nalso one that we should not tolerate. Alcohol is a gateway drug. Young \npeople who consume alcohol are more likely to use other drugs.\n  Statistics compiled by the National Center on Addiction and Substance \nAbuse at Columbia University show that 37.5 percent of young people who \nhave consumed alcohol have used some illicit drug versus only 5 percent \nof young people who have never consumed alcohol.\n  Early alcohol use results in alcohol problems in life. A report by \nthe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism indicates that \nwhen young people begin drinking before the age of 15, they are four \ntimes more likely to develop alcohol dependence than when drinking \nbegins at age 21.\n  I noted in I believe it was either Roll Call or the Hill earlier this \nweek there was a story about interns who are visiting the ``watering \nholes''--visiting the watering holes. We all know what that means. \nThese are not watering holes. These are places where these young \ninterns are going to drink some form of alcohol, and many of them will \nend up getting drunk.\n  Most tragically, alcohol kills. It is deadly. Deadly! It takes the \nlives of more children than all other drugs put together. Yet, for some \nreason, this particularly lethal drug is left out of the media \ncampaign. This administration has been leading a great campaign, a \ngreat crusade against tobacco, against smoking, and that is all right. \nThat is well and good. But why doesn't the administration put its stamp \non a crusade, on a great campaign against alcohol for youngsters? Why \ndoesn't the administration lead in that crusade?\n  Let me repeat a story I have told many times. Russell Conwell, one of \nthe great chautauqua speakers, told the story ``Acres of Diamonds'' \n5,000 times. I have not told this story 5,000 times, but I have told it \na number of times.\n  In 1951, when I was a member of the West Virginia Senate, I asked the \nwarden of the State penitentiary in Moundsville to let me be a witness \nto the scheduled execution of a young man by the name of James Hewlett.\n  Under the laws of West Virginia at that time, a certain number of \nwitnesses were required to be at an execution. The warden acceded to my \nrequest.\n  Why did I want to witness an execution? I often have the opportunity \nto speak to young people. I often speak to these pages who are sitting \nright now on both sides of the aisle looking at me. I speak with them \nout in the halls. I try to tell them wholesome stories from Tolstoy or \nfrom other great authors. I try to give them good stories. I try to \nteach them good lessons so they will leave here having heard someone--\nand I am sure there are other Senators who do the same thing--talk with \nthem about values.\n  It was for that reason that I wanted to see this execution. I often \nspeak to young people in 4-H groups, Boy Scout groups, Girl Scout \ngroups, and other groups, and I wanted to be able to tell them \nsomething that would help them in later life.\n  I went down and talked with the man who was to be executed. He had \nhired a cab driver to take him from Huntington, WV, over to Logan. On \nthe way, he pulled a revolver and shot the cab driver in the back, \nrobbed him, dumped him by the side of the road, and left him there to \ndie.\n  Later, Jim Hewlett was apprehended in a theater in Montgomery. He was \nbrought to trial, convicted, and sentenced to die in the electric \nchair.\n  He was asked if he would like a chaplain in his cell. He scoffed at \nthe idea of having a chaplain in his cell. He did not want any part of \nit. But when the Governor declined to commute his sentence, then the \nyoung man became serious about a chaplain. He wanted a chaplain in his \ncell.\n  On this occasion, the warden permitted me to go down to the cell of \nthe young man, and I talked with him. I told him I had the opportunity \nto talk with young people on many occasions, and I asked if he had \nsomething that he could tell me that would help these young people, \nsome advice that I could pass on to them that might assist them in \navoiding trouble in later life.\n\n  Jim Hewlett said yes. He said: ``Tell them to go to Sunday school and \nchurch.'' He said: ``If I had gone to Sunday school and church, I \nwouldn't be here tonight.''\n  Our conversation was very short. The hour of 9 was rapidly \napproaching, and he was to step into the electric chair at 9 o'clock. \nAs I started to go, after thanking him, he said, ``Wait a minute. Tell \nthem one more thing. Tell them not to drink the stuff that I drank.'' \nThose are his exact words. I have spoken them hundreds of times: ``Tell \nthem not to drink the stuff that I drank.''\n  I said: ``What do you mean by that?''\n  The chaplain spoke up and said: ``Senator''--I was a State senator at \nthat time--``Senator, you see that little crack on the wall up there? \nIf he were to have a couple of drinks, he would try to go through that \ncrack in the wall. That is what it does to him. He was drinking when he \nshot the cab driver.''\n  I went back to the warden's office.\n  The rest of the story, of course, is obvious. The young man was \nexecuted, and I have been passing these words of Jim Hewlett from \nFayette County, WV, on to young people during these almost 50 years \nsince: ``Tell them not to drink the stuff that I drank.''\n  Why do we have to tippy-toe around it? Why does the administration \nhave to tippy-toe around it? Why do the people in the administration \nwho have responsibilities along this line have to tippy-toe around it? \nAlcohol kills! Not only does it sometimes kill the person who imbibes \nbut it also kills others--wives, children, old people who are trying to \ngo to the grocery store or to a child-care center. These are people who \nare innocent. They are not doing the drinking. But the person who drank \nand then got behind the wheel, that person has killed others.\n  Every year at commencement time, when high schools are holding their \ncommencements all over the country, we read stories in the newspapers. \nThey are the same year after year: a group of youngsters, having just \ngraduated, have a big party, and they get drunk and they crash their \nautomobile that is going at a speed of 100 miles per hour into a tree. \nThe automobile wraps itself around the tree and there are the mangled, \nbleeding, dead bodies in the twisted wreckage. And in the car is also \nfound some alcohol.\n  It is time this country awakens. It is time the churches of this \ncountry awaken and tell our young people: Don't do it.\n  When I give a Christmas message, I do not say: Don't drink and drive. \nI simply say: Don't drink. I am not expecting everybody to feel as I do \nor to do as I do, but at least we ought to do what we can to educate \nthe young people of this country as to the evils, the dangers, and the \nsorrows that will come from the use of alcohol--alcohol.\n  There are some young people right now listening to me on the \ntelevision somewhere who have heard me pass along the advice of the \ncondemned man, Jim Hewlett: ``Tell them not to drink the stuff that I \ndrank.'' I hope those young people will listen. I hope they will take \nit to heart and not drink alcohol.\n  This amendment is a commonsense amendment--a commonsense amendment--\nto address the staggering statistics regarding youth alcohol use. We \nneed to send a strong message to the nation's youth that drinking has \nserious consequences, and all too often they are deadly consequences.\n  I thank Mr. Lautenberg for his statesmanship, for his courage, and \nfor his common sense. I appreciate very much his allowing me to \ncosponsor this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on our time, I thank the Senator from \nWest Virginia. He shows an interest in this subject that calls up our \nknowledge of experience with alcohol that none of us should ever have--\nthe loss of a family member.\n  When you see the devastation of alcohol, you do not understand why it \nis a different class addiction than that which is drugs. It is easier \nto get into. It is less stigmatic. People do not say: Oh, look, he's an \nalcoholic.\n\n[[Page S8000]]\n\n  A friend of mine has a granddaughter, 14 years old--14 years old--who \nstarted sniffing glue, drank alcohol. Now it is drugs. She is in an \ninstitution. It is the most heartbreaking thing one can imagine.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes 34 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will use time allocated by Senator Campbell.\n  Mr. President, it is a rare occasion when I rise to oppose an \namendment on alcohol offered by my colleague from New Jersey. I just \nheard the moving comments by the Senator from West Virginia. On almost \nevery other occasion on the Senate floor, I have supported their \ninitiatives. The .08 national standard on drunk driving, I have \nsupported it. You name it, I have supported it.\n  My mother was killed by a drunk driver. I have been in an accident \ncaused by a drunk driver in which the car I was driving was totaled.\n  Senator Byrd described graduation parties. My cousin's son Jesse was \nat a graduation party one night--the night before he was to graduate \nfrom high school--a wonderful young boy, great golfer, slight of build, \na handsome young man--and at midnight got in the wrong car, a car \ndriven by a young man who had had too much to drink. They drove across \na railroad track and were hit by a train, and that young boy lost his \nlife.\n  I know about the scourges of alcohol. I know about drunk driving. I \nknow about the disease of alcoholism. I also know about the issue of \nillegal drugs in this country and want to tell a story about that, if I \nmight.\n  I visited Oak Hill Detention Center recently, within the last matter \nof weeks. Oak Hill Detention Center is not too far from this building. \nIt is a half-hour drive. It houses some of the toughest young criminals \nwho have committed crimes on the streets of the District of Columbia. \nThese are kids, in many cases tough, hardened criminals but still kids.\n\n  I met a young man who at age 12 was dealing drugs and was addicted to \nhard drugs on the streets of the District of Columbia. He was shot a \nnumber of times, picked up, and convicted of armed robbery. At age 12, \nhe was selling and addicted to hard drugs.\n  Across the table from him sat another young man who, at age 12, was \nalso dealing drugs and convicted of armed robbery. Across the table was \na young girl who, at age 13, was on hard drugs and selling drugs and \nhad a baby--all in the first year of her teenage life.\n  The security fellow in one of the areas of the Oak Hill Detention \nCenter said to me--and I could tell he liked these kids; he cared about \nthese kids; he knew them, knew them well--said: You know, these are \ntough kids. These are kids who have done wrong, in most cases have had \na tough life, but they are still kids. He said: What I regret most \nabout this job is going to their funerals. There are too many funerals. \nAfter they serve their time at the Oak Hill Detention Center and they \nare back on the streets--too often relapsing back on hard drugs--I go \nto their funerals.\n  The common element to the discussions I had at that Oak Hill Youth \nDetention Center was hard drugs--addicted to drugs at a very young age \nand then followed a life of crime, and in most cases violent crime as \nwell.\n  This country has a problem with drugs. One approach to addressing \nthis problem was recommended by the administration and some in Congress \nto say: We know that television has an influence on people's lives. \nTelevision advertising, hundreds of billions of dollars of television \nadvertising has an influence on what people buy, what they wear, how \nthey look, and what they sing. If it has that kind of influence, can we \nuse television in a way that can influence people with respect to drugs \nand how they view drugs?\n  So the proposal was to put together a $1 billion program over 5 years \nto do intensive drug education television advertising. I support that.\n  This year, this subcommittee cut the funding for that by $50 million. \nIn other words, there will be $50 million less than was requested for \nit and $50 million less than was spent last year on this program.\n  This program ought to be allowed to work so we can determine with \nwhat effectiveness we can change people's vision and view about drugs, \nespecially young people. We are in the third year. We need to allow \nthis to work.\n  Cutting this program by $50 million was the last thing we wanted to \ndo, but the budget allocations would not allow us to fully fund it.\n  Now we are told by our colleagues, we want to add other things to it. \nI will support in an instant a proposal brought to the floor of the \nSenate that says let us do something of exactly the same scale on \nalcohol. I will support that in an instant. A $1 billion program over 5 \nyears to educate young people about alcohol, we ought to do that. But I \ndon't think, having cut this program by $50 million this year--\nunderstanding that when you talk to young people anyplace in this \ncountry who have been involved in violent crime, you will find out that \nthe origin of that and the genesis of much of that behavior comes from \naddiction to drugs--now is the time to both cut this program by $50 \nmillion, which is what has happened in this subcommittee, and then also \nadd other responsibilities to that program.\n  I indicated that my family was visited by the horror of the phone \ncall late at night saying that my mother had been killed. Others in my \nfamily have been victims of drunk driving accidents. I understand all \nthat. But the subject here is about drugs.\n  I have spoken on the floor about six times of a person I am going to \nspeak about just briefly again, Leo Gonzales Wright. A young attorney \nwith, I am sure, great hope and stars in her eyes moves to Washington, \nDC, to practice environmental law. In her early twenties, her name was \nBettina Pruckmayr. Bettina Pruckmayr ended her life in this town with \nthe kind of horror that is not visited upon many. She stopped at an ATM \nmachine, was abducted by a man named Leo Gonzales Wright, and stabbed \nover 30 times by this violent felon.\n  Who was Leo Gonzales Wright? A man addicted to drugs, a man high on \ndrugs, a man who had been convicted of murder before, let out of prison \non patrol, tested positive for drugs but not put back in prison.\n  What do drugs mean? What do drugs do? It means that people on our \nstreets, who are addicted to drugs and are willing to commit violent \nacts, murder innocent people like young Bettina Pruckmayr.\n  The origin of this is the problem of drugs. It is a very significant \nproblem. The attempt was to decide whether we could alter behavior, \neducate young children with $1 billion in a 5-year program of \nadvertising dealing with drugs. I happen to think that makes sense. We \nhave tried a lot of different things. It makes sense to try this.\n  Does it make sense to do a lot more on alcohol? Absolutely. I am \nwilling to support that and do that. I don't think, however, it ought \nto be used to dilute this effort. This effort is an effort that is in \nits third year. We have already had to dilute it by reducing funding \n$50 million.\n  I say to my colleague, with whom I voted on every occasion on this \nissue, let us find another way to fund this program and I will be with \nyou. I understand the scourge of alcohol and alcohol addiction, the \ncarnage it causes on American roads, and the devastation it causes to \nAmerican families. I also think those who spoke about that with such \ngripping emotion today probably could tell us stories that they \nunderstand the carnage caused by drug addiction in this country to hard \ndrugs and the number of families whose hearts ache tonight because \ntheir loved one was killed by someone high on drugs, addicted to drugs \nfor a number of years in a circumstance where perhaps, had we done \nthings differently, had we done things better, had we had more \ninfluence on those lives, we might have avoided having that person \naddicted to drugs and, therefore, committed to a life of crime.\n\n  That is what this effort is about. It is what General McCaffrey and \nthe Office of Drug Control Policy, it is what we are trying to do in a \n5-year period. I think we ought to continue to do that.\n  One final point: One of my regrets, standing as I am today, is a \nwoman\n\n[[Page S8001]]\n\nnamed Karolyn Nunnallee, whom I consider a good friend. She is the \nnational president of the Mothers Against Drunk Driving. She and her \norganization very strongly support the Lautenberg amendment. I almost \nnever have disagreed with Mothers Against Drug Driving. I think they \nhave done more in this country than most any other organization I know \nto influence and alter behavior dealing with the issue of drunk \ndriving. I regret very much not supporting them on this issue.\n  For reasons I have already stated, I think we ought to stay the \ncourse on this question of drug addiction and education dealing with \ndrug addiction among America's youth. At the same time, I want to join \nin and support in any way possible the efforts of Senator Lautenberg \nand Senator Byrd and others to add money to transportation bills on \ndrunk driving issues, to add money to health bills on drunk driving. I \nwill support a billion-dollar program in 5 years. Sign me up. But don't \ndilute this program. Let us let this program work to see, at the end of \n5 years, whether we have altered the behavior and substantially changed \nthe determination by some young people in this country to understand \nmore about drugs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has 30 minutes, 25 \nseconds; the Senator from New Jersey has 15 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Kentucky and 10 \nminutes to Senator McConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Lautenburg \namendment.\n  We all want to do what we can to fight underage drinking. At first \nglance this amendment might look like a good idea. Putting the office \nof national drug control policy and the drug czar on the case sounds \nlike we are really taking action in the fight against underage \ndrinking.\n  I believe that this amendment would actually hurt both the fight \nagainst underage drinking as well as our Nation's struggle with illegal \ndrugs.\n  First of all, we're not even sure if the drug czar, General \nMcCaffrey, really wants this amendment. We are hearing rumblings that \nthe administration is against it, but no one seems to know for sure. \nUntil we know, it doesn't make sense to pass the amendment.\n  If General McCaffrey, the man the President has asked to lead the \ncharge in our anti-drug efforts, isn't sure about it, I think we need \nto be very careful.\n  In addition, we know that the bipartisan coalition for a drug-free \nAmerica--headed up by Bill Bennett and Mario Cuomo--the group that \ncoordinates efforts with the drug czar and produces most of the \nGovernment's antidrug ads, does not support this amendment.\n  Bill Bennett and Mario Cuomo don't agree on much, and when they do we \nshould take notice and listen.\n  Second, passing the amendment and adding underage drinking to the \nproblems the drug czar has to tackle will just distract him from his \nprincipal focus--as Senator Dorgan said--the war on illegal drugs.\n  As Senator Dorgan, the ranking member on the subcommittee, pointed \nout last night, the drug czar's resources are already stretched to the \nlimit.\n  Adding underage drinking to the drug czar's portfolio would only \nstretch his resources even further, and force him to take on another \ntough fight. I don't think that's what we want.\n  In fact, we know the Federal Government is already spending hundreds \nof millions of dollars through the various agencies to fight underage \ndrinking, and the evidence shows we are making progress.\n  Over the past 10 years, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nAdministration reports that excessive drinking by underage kids has \ndropped significantly.\n  The Centers for Disease Control agrees. They report that underage \ndrinking has dropped by more than 50 percent over the past two decades. \nA study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse on drinking among high \nschool students reports similar progress.\n  Unfortunately, the evidence from the war on drugs is not as good. \nOver the past 5 years, the Department of Health and Human Services \nreports that illegal drug use has increased for high school kids.\n  We are turning the tide against underage drinking. What now is the \ncompelling reason to involve the drug czar's office? He already has his \nhands full with the war on illegal drugs.\n  As I said earlier, it's an idea that sounds good at first, but I \ndon't think anyone has laid out a compelling justification for it.\n  Mr. President, I applaud Senator Lautenberg for his fight against \nunderage drinking. It is a fight, as is the war on illegal drugs, that \nwe have to win. But I think he has taken the wrong approach on this \namendment. It sounds like a solution in search of a problem. Let's keep \nfighting underage drinking with the tools we now have in place. They \nare working. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Lautenberg \namendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, others have said it probably better \nthan I can, but what is really at stake is whether we are going to \ndramatically diminish, if not gut, the war on drugs.\n  The junior Senator from Kentucky has outlined the progress made on \nthe teenage drinking front in the last 20 years, and it is, indeed, \nsignificant. No one argues with any of the observations that have been \nmade by Senator Byrd and Senator Lautenberg, and others, about the \ndevastating nature of the problem of teenage drinking, although it is \nencouraging that progress is being made.\n  The industry itself advertises against underage drinking extensively. \nThe alcohol industry has spent $100 million over the last 8 years, and \nthe beer industry has spent $250 million over the last 10 years, for a \ntotal of $350 million, in their own financed effort to get at the \nproblem of teenage drinking, which is a horrendous problem. But as \nSenator Bunning has pointed out, it is a problem upon which we have \nmade significant progress.\n  What is before us today with the Lautenberg amendment is whether we \nare going to gut the war on drugs. Regretfully, since President Clinton \ncame to office, teenage drug use in this country has gone up 46 \npercent. We are going backwards in the war on drugs. While it may be an \nunintended consequence of what Senator Lautenberg is seeking to achieve \ntoday, the practical effect of this amendment is to gut the advertising \ncampaign designed to go after teenage drug use, as Senator Dorgan has \npointed out.\n  Let's have no misunderstandings; nobody is in favor of teenage \ndrinking. Nobody thinks that we should not do more about this problem. \nHowever, the issue before us is: Are we going to gut the advertising \neffort in the war on drugs?\n  The National Youth Antidrug Media campaign is underway. This \namendment, according to drug czar Barry McCaffrey, would undermine \nthat. The Partnership for a Drug Free America, which is the nonprofit \ngroup that works with General McCaffrey to run this antidrug campaign, \nopposes this amendment.\n  General McCaffrey said just 3 weeks ago that proposals such as this \namendment ``could dilute the focus of the successful media campaign \nadvertising effort to change attitudes of youth and parents toward \nillegal drug use.'' He also said, ``An anti-underage drinking message \nto youth is largely a separate and distinct message from the anti-drug \nmessage, requiring a significantly different strategic approach based \non scientific and behavioral knowledge.''\n  So what we are doing is mixing up apples and oranges. A campaign, \ndesigned, properly researched, and underway, to deal with youth drug \nabuse would be diverted in an entirely different direction by the \nLautenberg amendment.\n  Others have referred to the letters from Mario Cuomo, Bill Bennett, \nand Jim Burke, the cochairs of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. \nThey\n\n[[Page S8002]]\n\noppose the Lautenberg amendment. Obviously, it is not because they are \nin favor of teenage drinking, but they don't want to gut the effort to \nhave an effective antidrug campaign among America's young people.\n  Chairman Burke, of the Partnership for a Drug-free America, said: \n``We don't believe . . . an effective campaign targeting underage \ndrinking can be carved out of the current appropriation for the \nNational Youth Antidrug Media Campaign.\n  He went on:\n\n       I can tell you that forcing the campaign to address \n     underage drinking (something it was not originally designed \n     to do) will seriously jeopardize the success of this effort.\n\n  He is referring to their effort to deal with teenage drug use, which, \nremember, is going up while teenage drinking is going down.\n  Cochairman Mario Cuomo, former Governor of New York, said this \namendment ``threatens the success of one media campaign by creating \nanother that simply cannot and will not work given the current \nlimitations.''\n  Governor Cuomo also said that ``this type of program will require \nhundreds of millions more dollars--if not billions--to be effective.''\n  Governor Cuomo's cochairman, Bill Bennett, said:\n\n       Advocates are wrong to suggest that this enormous problem \n     of teenage drinking can be addressed effectively within the \n     current appropriation for the antidrug campaign. We read this \n     amendment as the beginning of the end of the antidrug \n     campaign.\n\n  Mr. President, we don't need to end the antidrug campaign. Drug use \nis going up; drug use among high school seniors has gone up 46 percent \nsince 1992. It needs to be addressed. That is what this appropriation \nis for. Certainly, a program to address underage drinking, which all \nthree of the men I have just quoted would tell us, would have to be of \na tremendous size. That is an activity Congress would need to analyze \ncarefully before embarking on.\n  I know that there are probably many Senators who are thinking that if \nthey oppose the Lautenberg amendment, it is going to be very difficult \nto explain in a campaign contest. Let me say this. What would be even \nmore difficult to explain, it seems to me, is a vote that would gut the \neffort to combat drug use in this country--teenage drug use in \nparticular--which is on the increase. That is what this appropriation \nis designed to try to impact.\n  So if we are going to address teenage drinking, let's not do it at \nthe expense of the war on drugs. The war on drugs has not been very \neffectively fought in the last few years. I am not here to cast any \nparticular aspersions against anybody for that, but it is a cold, hard \nreality that teenage drug use has gone up 46 percent since 1992 in this \ncountry. It was previously tracking down. We need to get back on track \nand address this youth drug use. That is what the original \nappropriation was designed to do.\n  I hope we will resist the temptation to gut the war on drugs so that \nwe can pursue it effectively. As evidence, we have the testimony of Jim \nBurke, Mario Cuomo, and Bill Bennett.\n  I ask that the record include copies of a letter from Bill Bennett of \nthe Partnership for a Drug-Free America, opposing the Lautenberg \namendment; a letter from Mario Cuomo of the Partnership for a Drug-Free \nAmerica, opposing the Lautenberg amendment; and a statement of Richard \nD. Bonnette, President and CEO of the Partnership for a Drug-Free \nAmerica, opposing the amendment, along with a press release from the \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that those be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 Partnership for a\n\n\n                                            Drug-Free America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: An amendment has been introduced in \n     the House of Representatives that threatens the success of \n     the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, currently being \n     coordinated by the Office of National Drug-Control Policy and \n     the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. This amendment, now \n     part of the Treasury & General Government Appropriations \n     Bill, mandates the inclusion of alcohol-related messages in \n     the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. As former \n     Director of ONCDP in the Bush administration and as co-\n     chairman of the Partnership, I write to urge you to oppose \n     any similar provision that may be offered in your \n     Appropriations Committee markup of the Treasury and General \n     Government Appropriations Bill.\n       Representative Royal-Allard and Representative Wolf, who \n     introduced this amendment in the House are correct in their \n     convictions about underage drinking. But advocates are wrong \n     to suggest that this enormous problem can be addressed \n     effectively within the current appropriation for the anti-\n     drug campaign. Advocates of the amendment say it is simply \n     designed to give Gen. McCaffrey statutory jurisdiction to \n     address alcohol within the context of this campaign. We read \n     this amendment as the beginning of the end of the anti-drug \n     campaign.\n       If you wish to combat underage drinking, I urge you to \n     support the development of a mass media campaign specifically \n     targeting this issue through a separate appropriation. The \n     marketing experts who comprise the Partnership believe it \n     will take hundreds of millions of dollars to conduct a \n     campaign designed to dissuade teenagers from drinking. The \n     Partnership offers its assistance in this pursuit. But many \n     things need to fall into place first--research, market-\n     testing, and hundreds of millions in funding to do this \n     correctly.\n       Should a version of the Roybal-Allard/Wolf amendment \n     surface in the Senate, please help us keep the National Youth \n     Anti-Drug Media Campaign on track and focused. Please oppose \n     any effort to require this campaign to do more than it was \n     originally designed to do. As you may know, the Partnership \n     receives no part of the federal money dedicated to the anti-\n     drug campaign. The Partnership donates all its advertising to \n     this federally-backed effort for free.\n           Sincerely,\n     William J. Bennett.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Partnership for a\n\n\n                                            Drug-Free America,\n\n                                      New York, NY, June 23, 1999.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: An amendment has been introduced in \n     the House of Representatives that threatens the success of \n     the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, currently being \n     coordinated by the Office of National Drug-Control Policy and \n     the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. This amendment, now \n     part of the Treasury & General Government Appropriations \n     Bill, mandates the inclusion of alcohol-related messages in \n     the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign.\n       If Congress wishes to support developing a national \n     advertising campaign targeting underage drinking, we stand \n     ready to support you be offering the assistance of our entire \n     organization. We do not believe, however, an effective \n     campaign targeting underage drinking can be carved out of the \n     current appropriation for the National Youth Anti-Drug Media \n     Campaign.\n       As the former chairman and CEO of Johnson & Johnson and \n     someone who has spent his entire career in marketing, I can \n     tell you that forcing the campaign to address underage \n     drinking (something that it was not originally designed to \n     do) will seriously jeopardize the success of this effort. To \n     undertake such an effort, extensive consumer-based research \n     would be needed to determine effective advertising \n     strategies. No such research exists. Additionally, to really \n     change attitudes about alcohol, this type of effort would \n     have to compete head-to-head with the billions spent to \n     market alcohol products and, therefore, require significantly \n     more funding.\n       Shaving money out of the National Youth Anti-Drug Media \n     Campaign will not accomplish this. We do not question the \n     rightness of addressing underage drinking. Our concerns focus \n     on what we can and cannot accomplish with the current \n     appropriation. We question the wisdom of seriously risking--\n     and perhaps killing--the effectiveness of one media campaign \n     to create another that simply cannot and will not work, given \n     current limitations. Should a similar amendment be proposed \n     in the Senate, I respectfully ask you to keep the anti-drug \n     campaign focused on what it was designed to target: illegal, \n     illicit drugs.\n           Sincerely,\n     James E. Burke.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Partnership for a\n\n\n                                            Drug-Free America,\n\n                                      New York, NY, June 23, 1999.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: As you may know, the Partnership \n     for a Drug-Free America--a non-profit coalition of \n     professionals from the communications industry--has for the \n     past 12 years demonstrated a remarkable expertise in the \n     production of anti-drug advertising and the execution of a \n     national anti-drug media campaign. The Partnership is \n     currently donating all of its advertising to the National \n     Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, being coordinated by the \n     Office of National Drug Control Policy. The Partnership also \n     provides ongoing strategic advice to the campaign, and \n     receives no federal funds as part of this program.\n       The House Appropriations Committee will soon mark up its \n     Treasury & General Government Appropriations Bill. An \n     amendment has been added to this bill authorizing the \n     inclusion of alcohol-related messages in the anti-drug \n     campaign. As the Partnership has\n\n[[Page S8003]]\n\n     demonstrated, advertising can be used to address teenage drug \n     use. Backed by the proper research, advertising could also be \n     used to address underage drinking. But please understand \n     this: We cannot target both effectively within the current \n     appropriation.\n       The alcohol industry spends billions each year on marketing \n     and promotion. As it stands, $185 million is authorized to \n     fund the anti-drug campaign. Of this less than $150 million \n     is actually being spent on the purchase of media exposure for \n     the campaign. If the Congress is interested in developing an \n     effective campaign to address underage drinking, the \n     Partnership stands ready to work with any and all concerned \n     organizations and government agencies to see it through. But \n     please understand that this type of program will require \n     hundreds of millions more dollars--if not billions--to be \n     effective.\n       Unless the House plans to increase funding significantly \n     for the anti-drug campaign, the Partnership has urged members \n     to vote to strip the Roybal-Allard/Wolf Amendment from the \n     anti-drug media campaign appropriation. The amendment \n     threatens the success of one media campaign by creating \n     another that simply cannot and will not work, given current \n     limitations. A fact sheet on the Partnership and our position \n     on this amendment are attached for your convenience. If any \n     similar provision is offered in your Appropriations Committee \n     markup of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations \n     Bill, I encourage you keep the anti-drug campaign focused by \n     opposing any such measure, unless significantly more funds \n     are appropriated.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Mario M.

Bonnette, President & CEO, Partnership for a \n         Drug-Free America on the Roybal-Allard/Wolf Amendment\n\n       New York, June 7th--We whole-heartedly support the concept \n     of developing a national advertising campaign targeting \n     underage drinking. Alcohol abuse is a huge problem in \n     America, and plays an undeniable role in substance abuse \n     among children and teenagers. As the Partnership has \n     demonstrated, advertising can be used to address teenage drug \n     use. Backed by the proper research, advertising could also be \n     used to address underage drinking. But it is simply not \n     possible to target both effectively within the current \n     appropriation for the National Youth Anti-Drug Media \n     Campaign.\n       I base this perspective on more than 30 years in the \n     advertising business, and 10 years of experience with the \n     Partnership for a Drug-Free America. The Partnership is a \n     coalition of communications professionals from advertising, \n     marketing, public relations and related disciplines. This \n     judgment does not question the relevance of targeting \n     underage drinking. It questions the wisdom of seriously \n     risking--and perhaps killing--the effectiveness of one media \n     campaign to create another that simply cannot and will not \n     work, given current limitations.\n       Our overriding concern about the Roybal-Allard/Wolf \n     amendment is that it will reduce the overall media exposure \n     for the anti-drug campaign. The alcohol industry spends at \n     least $1 billion each year on marketing and promotion; the \n     National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign is funded at $195 \n     million. Of this, less than $150 million is backing the \n     advertising campaign. Clearly, an alcohol-abuse advertising \n     campaign would require significantly more money to compete \n     with the marketing muscle of the alcohol industry. From a \n     sheer marketing perspective, the chances of such a campaign \n     having an impact within the context of the current \n     appropriation are very, very slim.\n       The Partnership stands ready to support the development of \n     a national advertising campaign on underage drinking. We have \n     more than a decade's worth of experience in running a \n     consumer-focused media campaign designed to change attitudes \n     on drugs. We will help any and all groups interested in this \n     type of campaign in every way we can. This type of campaign, \n     however, must be done correctly.\n       The first step of any solid marketing effort is thorough \n     research. We have 11 years of experience in the marketplace \n     and 12 years of research on consumer attitudes about illegal \n     drugs. While one could assume this model could work for \n     alcohol abuse, extensive consumer-focused research would be \n     needed to guide the development and execution of such a \n     program. Currently, this type of research does not exist. The \n     development and literature review backing the National Youth \n     Anti-Drug Media Campaign took more than 18 months. To insert \n     an amendment requiring alcohol abuse be addressed, without \n     the same thorough approach taken in the development of the \n     anti-drug media campaign, ignores the fundamental need for \n     research.\n       Children and teenagers have different attitudes about \n     different drugs--marijuana, cocaine, inhalants, \n     methamphetamine, heroin and other illegal drugs. Kids of \n     different ages, races and genders view these drugs \n     differently. Attitudes about certain drugs also vary by \n     region in the country. We have no similar consumer insights \n     into what kids think about alcohol--beer, liquor, malt \n     liquor, etc.--and how these attitudes may differ by alcohol \n     brand, by age of kids, race, etc.\n       Marketing to reduce alcohol abuse would be more difficult \n     than marketing against illegal drugs. Alcohol, unlike illicit \n     drugs, is legal. While not impossible to accomplish, changing \n     attitudes about alcohol would be very challenging, given its \n     widespread cultural acceptance and use (responsible and \n     otherwise) of alcohol products. Alcohol use is widely \n     glamorized in movies, television and music. Alcohol use is \n     deeply ingrained in our culture--ritualized and commonplace.\n       We respect the opinions and passion of our colleagues \n     working to reduce alcohol abuse. We do not have any ties with \n     the beer and/or alcohol trade organizations opposing this \n     amendment; we do not accept funding from the alcohol and/or \n     tobacco industries. We are concerned about this amendment \n     solely because it could significantly diminish the impact of \n     the anti-drug campaign.\n       The National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign is being \n     coordinated by the Office of National Drug Control Policy in \n     cooperation with the Partnership for a Drug-Free America \n     (PDFA). PDFA provides advertising to the campaign pro bono \n     and receives no federal funding for its role in this effort. \n     The amendment seeks inclusion of anti-alcohol ads in this \n     campaign, which is using federal funds to purchase media \n     exposure for anti-drug advertising.\n\n\n                               fact sheet\n\n       The Partnership for a Drug-Free America is a non-profit \n     coalition of professionals from the communications industry, \n     whose mission is to reduce demand for illegal drugs in \n     America. Through its national anti-drug advertising campaign \n     and other forms of media communication, the Partnership works \n     to decrease demand for drugs by changing societal attitudes \n     which support, tolerate, or condone drug use.\n       The Partnership is comprised of a small staff and hundreds \n     of volunteers from the communications industry, who create \n     and disseminate the Partnership's work. Advertising agencies \n     create Partnership messages pro bono; research firms donate \n     information services; talent unions permit their members to \n     work for free; production professionals bring Partnership \n     messages to life; a network of advertising professionals \n     distribute the group's work to national and local media; \n     public relations firms lend services to various Partnership \n     projects; and media companies donate valuable broadcast time \n     and print space to deliver Partnership messages to millions \n     of Americans.\n       To date, more than 500 anti-drug ads have been created by \n     our volunteers. From March 1987 through the end of 1998, the \n     total value of broadcast time and print space donated to \n     Partnership messages topped $3 billion, making this the \n     largest public service media campaign in history. The \n     Partnership receives major funding from The Robert Wood \n     Johnson Foundation and support from more than 200 \n     corporations and companies. PDFA accepts no funding from \n     manufacturers of alcohol and/or tobacco products. The \n     organization began in 1986 with seed money provided by the \n     American Association of Advertising Agencies.\n       Research demonstrates that the Partnership's national \n     advertising campaign has played a contributing role in \n     reducing overall drug use in America. Independent studies and \n     expert interpretation of drug trends support its \n     effectiveness. The New York Times has described the \n     Partnership as ``one of the most effective drug education \n     groups in the U.S.''\n       Drastic changes in the media industry over the past decade \n     have led to an overall decline in media exposure of public \n     service advertising. This is one factor contributing to the \n     Partnership's decision to participate in the National Youth \n     Anti-Drug Media Campaign, coordinated by the Office of \n     National Drug Control Policy in cooperation with PDFA. \n     Through the leadership of Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of \n     the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, and \n     the commitment of numerous, outstanding members of Congress, \n     a total of $380 million has been appropriated by Congress for \n     this effort to date ($195 million in FY '98, $185 million in \n     FY '99). The bulk of this money is being used to pay for the \n     one thing that has eluded our campaign in recent years--\n     consistent, optimal, national media exposure. PDFA receives \n     no funding for its role in this campaign. The organization \n     donates all advertising to the effort pro bono and serves as \n     a primary strategic consultant (unpaid.)\n       In addition to its work on a national level, the \n     Partnership has helped create 54 state- and city-based \n     versions of its national advertising campaign through its \n     State/City Alliance Program. Working with state/city \n     governments and locally-based drug prevention organizations, \n     the Partnership provides at no cost--the guidance, on-site \n     technical assistance and creative materials necessary to \n     shape a multimedia campaign tailored to the\n\n[[Page S8004]]\n\n     needs and activities within the state or city. Several \n     additional alliances are targeted for launch, which will \n     expand the program's reach to 98 percent of the U.S.\n                                  ____\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of National \n           Drug Control Policy,\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\n    Assessment of the Potential Inclusion of Anti-Underage-Drinking \n                   Advertising in the ONDCP Campaign\n\n       An anti-underage drinking message to youth is largely a \n     separate and distinct message from the anti-drug message, \n     requiring a significantly different strategic approach based \n     on scientific and behavioral knowledge. If we were to be \n     asked to communicate an additional anti-underage-drinking \n     message platform with the current media budget, we would fall \n     below effective reach and frequency levels for all message \n     platforms, thus risking the success of the entire campaign.\n       An anti-underage drinking message to youth would also \n     require separate production, and this would incur a \n     considerable investment ($3-$4 million).\n       An anti-underage drinking message to adults might more \n     easily be incorporated in a strategic message focusing on \n     encouraging good parenting, and the important role of youth \n     influencers, in shapping positive behavior among youth. \n     Ideally, of course, a separate effort targeting adults would \n     be more effective.\n       While incremental advertising funds would absolutely be \n     required to successfully mount an anti-underage drinking \n     campaign, it would not be necessary to double the overall \n     ONDCP advertising budget if the adult efforts are combined. \n     Since the youth campaign represents about half of the \n     campaign, the ideal incremental budget would be approximately \n     $100 million. This would include some funds for such needed \n     expenditures as additional production, new behavior change \n     expertise, and limited copy testing, tracking and evaluation. \n     We would seek every possible efficiency between the anti-drug \n     and anti-underage-drinking campaigns from a creative and \n     media perspective (e.g., limiting the target to older teens).\n       If incremental funds are unavailable at this time, please \n     be aware that the current campaign already includes a \n     substantial percentage of anti-underage-drinking messages \n     (e.g., MADD, DOT, OSAP, etc.). This proportion could be \n     augmented, though this would obviously diminish other PSA \n     efforts. The ``match'' airtime devoted to this advertising is \n     every bit as good as that secured for the paid anti-drug \n     units.\n\n\n                              issue paper\n\n     Inclusion of alcohol in the National Youth Anti-Drug Media \n         Campaign\n       Using appropriated funds to include an alcohol or tobacco \n     component in the paid portion of the ONDCP National Youth \n     Anti-drug Media Campaign, within existing budgets, would \n     significantly dilute the campaign's emphasis on illicit \n     drugs, the primary intent of Congress and the Clinton \n     Administration in establishing this program.\n       The Media Campaign already addresses alcohol in several key \n     areas.\n       When ONDCP purchases time on network or local television \n     and/or radio stations, a condition of the media buy is a \n     dollar-for-dollar contribution to ONDCP from the media outlet \n     in the form of public service. Most comes in the form of \n     donated public service slots in similar time periods, which \n     ONDCP shares with other organizations that have drug-related \n     messages (PSAs). The Media campaign is already using \n     underage-drinking and drunk driving public service \n     announcements in its pro bono component. From July 1998 \n     through January 1999 (the period for which data is \n     available), about 15% of the television public service time \n     given to the Media Campaign has been shared with four \n     organizations involved with underage drinking and drunk \n     driving (They are: National Council on Alcoholism and Drug \n     Dependence, Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), Recording \n     Artists, Athletes and Actors Against Drunk Driving, and the \n     Dept. of Transportation). These 20 PSAs were electronically \n     coded and reports are generated to identify and track when \n     and where each massage is played. Computerized tracking \n     reports indicate these massages have played over 7,000 times \n     on local and network television, which is conservatively \n     valued at $8,000,000 in media time. ONDCP does not count any \n     time donated in the middle of the night (1 a.m. to 5 a.m.) \n     All of these PSAs were aired during appropriate time slots.\n       In addition, the Partnership for a Drug Free America has 53 \n     State and local alliances 15 of which support programs that \n     include alcohol messages as public service announcements. \n     These messages include under-aged drinking, binge drinking, \n     prenatal alcohol use, parental modeling, and other subjects \n     that appear on television, radio, on billboards, on posters, \n     and in print PDFA estimates that the total value of media \n     time donated for these messages is approximately $7,000,000.\n       ONDCP's media match also comes in the form of television \n     programming. At least four national network television \n     programs have focused on youth-alcohol related issues. For \n     example, on May 16, the entire episode of WB's Smart Guy will \n     concentrate on underage drinking. ONDCP's behavioral change \n     experts have worked closely with the writers and producers of \n     this program to ensure key message strategies were \n     incorporated.\n       Much of the campaign's communications strategy to reach \n     parents regarding youth drug are appropriate to reaching \n     parents regarding underage drinking (knowing where your \n     children are, who their friends are, establishing rules and \n     values, etc.).\n       Substantial and costly changes in the communications \n     strategy would be required. The existing campaign strategy \n     was developed over an eight-month period in an expert driven \n     process. The strategy emphasizes specific message platforms, \n     techniques, and activities to address illicit drugs. Adding \n     alcohol to the strategy would mean a substantial departure \n     from current strategy, and would require additional time and \n     research for development. For example, ads would need to be \n     developed to address laws on underage drinking, issues of \n     access to alcohol (point of sale), etc. This would dilute and \n     delay the overall impact of the anti-drug ads by reducing \n     their reach and frequency. Professional advertising and \n     research staff have already alerted ONDCP that we may have \n     too many strategic messages for the level of funds available. \n     The addition of alcohol ads would further complicate efforts \n     and delay the campaign from reaching its planned potential \n     and strength.\n       Development of alcohol messages would place new, \n     unanticipated requirements on our existing partners, require \n     substantial time for production (behavioral briefs, focus \n     groups and testing) and create additional expense. The \n     Campaign was developed based on the Congressional expectation \n     that all the messages used would be produced on a pro bono \n     basis, primarily through the Partnership for a Drug Free \n     America, whose agencies provide their creative work free of \n     charge. PDFA does not produce national messages on alcohol \n     use/abuse; thus, we would required to pay for development \n     costs through an advertising agency (and no funding \n     allocation exists for this). The costs and contractual effort \n     required to undertake this would be substantial. Further it \n     would undermine a principle upon which the campaign was \n     based--the pro bono development of advertising messages.\n                                  ____\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of National \n           Drug Control Policy,\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 1999.\n\n McCaffrey Says Inclusion of Unresearched and Under Funded Alcohol Ads \n         in Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign Would Be Ill-Advised\n\n       Washington, DC.--White House National Policy Director Barry \n     McCaffrey today said that proposals to include alcohol \n     prevention in the paid portion of the ongoing National Youth \n     Anti-Drug Media Campaign ``could dilute the focus of the \n     successful media campaign advertising effort to change \n     attitudes of youth and parents toward illegal drug abuse.''\n       McCaffrey stated, ``We share a concern about the terribly \n     serious problem of underage alcohol use. We do not disagree \n     with the desirability of a media campaign targeted against \n     underage drinking. However, it would be a serious mistake to \n     simply add alcohol messages to the ONDCP paid media campaign \n     without significantly increasing the funding level. \n     Behavioral scientists and youth and advertising experts \n     advise us that our campaign will only be effective if we \n     purchase a sufficient level of media exposure for each of our \n     messages. The addition of paid alcohol ads--without new \n     funds, staff and research--would only hamper the \n     effectiveness of our campaign.\n       A commercial advertiser would not add a new product line to \n     an advertising plan without increasing the advertising \n     budget. We cannot simply add new alcohol messages without \n     seriously endangering the effectiveness of the anti-drug \n     youth campaign. There are several challenges that would make \n     an anti-alcohol campaign an expensive proposition. Although \n     at the initiation of the National Youth Anti-Drug Media \n     Campaign there was a stockpile of illicit drug ads, there are \n     very few ads currently available on underage drinking. We \n     would need to develop and produce expensive new ads. \n     Additionally, since alcohol is legal for adults, an effective \n     anti-alcohol campaign would need an entirely different \n     strategy than our existing media campaign, which has as its \n     focus illegal substances.\n       When ONDCP purchases time on national or local media, we \n     negotiate to achieve a dollar-for-dollar matching \n     contribution. Most of this contribution comes in the form of \n     donated public service announcement slots in similar time \n     periods. ONDCP then passes these PSA opportunities to \n     organizations that have anti-drug messages. From July 1998 \n     through January 1999, roughly 15% of television public \n     service time given to the ONDCP Media Campaign was shared \n     with four organizations confronting underage drinking and \n     drunk driving (National Council on Alcoholism and Drug \n     Dependence, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Recording Artists, \n     Athletes and Actors Against Drunk Driving, and the Department \n     of Transportation). These messages have played over 7000 \n     times on local and network television, which is \n     conservatively valued at $8 million. In this concrete way, we \n     have already generated the largest youth anti-alcohol media \n     campaign in history. ONDCP has also used the match part of \n     the campaign to urge networks to include anti-alcohol \n     messages in entertainment programming. For example, the \n     entire episode of WB's Smart Guy that\n\n[[Page S8005]]\n\n     aired on May 16 concentrated on underage drinking.''\n       We are now entering the second year of an increasingly \n     successful youth anti-drug media campaign. Alcohol and \n     tobacco use are clearly a major threat to the health and \n     safety of our children. However, now is not the time to lose \n     focus on the start of a massive, well designed and successful \n     effort to reverse the disastrous increase in illegal drug use \n     by Amedican adolescents.''\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let us get on about the business of \nfighting teenage drug abuse. I urge my colleagues to support the motion \nto table.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, my colleague from Ohio is going to \nspeak. I will give him 4 minutes to make his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Lautenberg amendment.\n  This is a commonsense amendment.\n  What are the essential facts? The essential facts are that underage \ndrinking is a huge problem in this country. If you are worried about \nyour child dying, this is a good place to start.\n  Statistics are absolutely unbelievable. The life expectancy of those \nbetween the age of 16 and 24 or 25 is not good. One of the main reasons \nit is not good is underage drinking. Most of the fatalities are \nconnected with underage drinking.\n  Let me also state some other essential facts.\n  Advertising works. We all know it works. We know it works on \ncampaigns. Where does the majority of the money that we raise for our \ncampaigns go? It goes to advertising. Advertising is how we communicate \nwith people. We know it works.\n  If we are serious about dealing with this problem, then we need to \nspend the money and we need to do the advertising.\n  One of the statistics that has been cited on this floor is very \ntelling. It goes back to my question. If you are serious about this \nproblem, if you are serious about protecting your kids, what do you do?\n  Here is one statistic. One study indicates that underage abuse of \nalcohol certainly has serious consequences. According to the Pacific \nInstitute for Research and Evaluation, underage drinking killed an \nestimated 6,350 young people between the age of 12 to 20. That was for \nthe year 1994. All other illicit drugs killed 980 youth.\n  If these statistics are true--based on my experience as county \nprosecutor and someone who has been involved in this issue for many \nyears, I think it is true--alcohol kills six times as many children \nthan all other illicit drugs combined.\n  This is a very modest proposal because it does not compel the drug \nczar to spend money. What it simply says is that the drug czar spend \nsome of the money that they have that has been set aside for \nadvertising. They can, in fact, spend it on this horrendous problem.\n  All you have to do to see this problem is to go to the hospital and \ntalk to an emergency room physician. Ask an emergency room physician \nhow often alcohol is related to what they see. They will tell you that \non any Friday night, or any Saturday night, it dominates the \nemergencies; that the vast majority of the emergencies they see, \nparticularly the serious ones, are alcohol related.\n  This is a leading killer of our young people. To say that we are not \ngoing to use this money that is available for advertising, which we \nknow is effective, for this horrendous problem, frankly, makes \nabsolutely no sense.\n  I appeal to my colleagues. While reasonable minds can differ--and I \nthink my colleagues on the other side of this issue have made some very \ninteresting and some good arguments--I believe that the statistics \nclearly indicate that alcohol is the drug of choice among young people.\n  For those who are underage, alcohol is the drug of choice. It is the \nmost serious drug in this country, and it is also a gateway drug, which \nsimply means it is the drug that most young people start with, and then \nthey ``advance'' to other drugs.\n  To be able to mount a successful and a good advertising campaign--to \ntake the words from the amendment, the message of ``discouraging \nunderage alcohol consumption,'' that is what this amendment would \nallow.\n  I urge my colleagues to allow this permissive use of the money. I \nbelieve it will save lives. I believe it is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, what time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 11 minutes 1 \nsecond. The Senator from Colorado has 15 minutes 39 seconds.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I think we have no further speakers on \nthe issue on our side. We are prepared to yield back the time, unless \nsomeone shows up in the next minute or two.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I think that we can move to conclude \nthis debate. I will take just a couple of minutes. Unless there are \nfurther Members who want to speak, I will then yield back the time.\n  This is one of those debates that I really do not enjoy because the \nfriends who are opposing this are not people who are against what we \nwant to do. They are not against eliminating underage drinking--not at \nall. What we are arguing about is somewhat about process.\n  Frankly, though, we are on the same side of the issue. But I see them \nas having an argument that I can't buy, and I don't think the American \npeople will buy. We are saying let's preserve as much of the $1 billion \nthat we have to fight drugs through the media campaign, plus all of the \nother money spent on fighting drugs, even though we are not doing it \nquite successfully.\n  But we ought to be looking more critically at how we deal with the \ndrug problem. We are building more jails. We are penalizing those in \ninstitutions and jails, or in other facilities of incarceration, who \nare not drug addicts. We are spending billions of dollars. And we don't \nput alcoholics in jail. We don't punish them. We don't stigmatize them \nthe same way we do drug users.\n  But I point out that alcohol kills six times more children ages 12 to \n20 than all other illegal drugs combined.\n  What does that say? Does that say that the children who die from \nalcohol are worth less to us as a society than those who die from \nillegal drugs? I don't think that is the message that we want to \nconvey.\n  There is a $1 billion anti-drug media campaign. That $1 billion, in \nlight of this surplus, could grow. But because the drug czar does not \neven have the authority, he cannot issue messages about underage \ndrinking. There is something wrong with that. Why can't an ad that \nshows a picture of a degenerated adult brain from drug use say that \nalso happens from alcohol?\n  In many cases, we see violence from alcohol that does not always \nkill. But it enrages people and causes fights. Alcohol is the product \nlargely responsible for spousal abuse and internal family fights. \nAlcohol does it every time.\n  We have 4 million alcoholics between the ages of 13 and 20--4 \nmillion. That is a lot of young people. Yet, we are not waging the same \nwar against alcohol as we are against drugs.\n  By the way, in the message that we heard from the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Kentucky, he mentioned outstanding citizens, Jim \nBurke and Mario Cuomo, as people who are on the other side. But that \ndoesn't mean that they are right in this fight. I disagree with them \nand have great respect for both of them. I know them personally.\n  The fact of the matter is, when we don't mention that alcohol is a \nscourge, as are illegal drugs, then it is assumed to be by young people \nsomething not so bad. We know it is terrible: Six times more fatal to \nyoung people than all of the illegal drugs combined.\n  What keeps the message from getting out there? I don't know that \nthere is anybody lobbying for illegal drugs. But I know that there are \npeople lobbying to keep this anti-alcohol message away from children. \nWhen I see the Budweiser lizards talking on television, it is a pretty \nattractive picture. But it is not a lot different from Joe Camel \nattracting kids to smoking. Young people laugh. They like those \ncommercials. I know it goes right from the television into young \npeople's minds.\n  Those commercials make people think, ``Beer is cool.'' But it is not \ncool when it is a 13-, 14-, or 15-year-old kid. As they say, a child \nwho starts drinking at age 13 has a 47-percent chance of becoming an \nalcoholic. Those who wait\n\n[[Page S8006]]\n\nuntil age 21 have only a 10-percent chance.\n  Why don't we respond to this epidemic? We can talk about programs \nthat can make a difference, but we are not. But we are spending $1 \nbillion on an anti-drug campaign. Yes, there has been a cutback, but I \nsee that being restored. If those funds grow, the drug czar can't add \nalcohol to the campaign, because he doesn't have the authority. This \namendment gives him the authority. It doesn't tell him how to do it. It \nsays tell young people out there, you hurt your brain, you hurt your \nfamily, you hurt your society, and you hurt yourself if you use \nalcohol.\n  The law is age 21. I wrote that law against terrific opposition in \n1984. It was a Republican President. President Reagan was President, \nand Elizabeth Dole was the then-Secretary of Transportation. We worked \ntogether to get it done because they saw alcohol as a scourge.\n  I hope we are not put off by the argument that you can't do two \nthings at the same time: ``No to drugs'' on one side of the screen; \n``no to alcohol'' on the other side of the screen. I don't think that \nhurts anybody, and it could help somebody. That is the issue.\n  I hate to disagree with some of my friends who have taken the other \nside. I know they feel the problem deeply. I think they have chosen to \ndismiss an opportunity that I think is the only one that exists for us. \nWe will not have an anti-alcohol program. Can you see trying to get \nthat through this place with all of the friends of the alcohol \nindustry? There is not a chance.\n  This is the time to do it. We ought to step up and vote the right \nway. Give the drug czar an opportunity to say no to alcohol, as well as \nto drugs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a series of editorials be printed in the \nRecord, including one from the New York Times, as well as a list of \nover 80 responsible organizations--many of them religious, a lot of \nthem social--who are on our side of the issue, as well as the Surgeon \nGeneral's letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 2, 1999]\n\n                 The Anti-Drug Campaign's Missing Link\n\n       Gen. Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's director of \n     national drug policy, has declared flatly that under-age \n     drinking is the single biggest drug problem among \n     adolescents, and is intimately linked to the use of illegal \n     drugs. But as things stand now, the $195 million national \n     media campaign that General McCaffrey is running this year to \n     dissuade youngsters from using illicit drugs will not spend a \n     penny in Federal funds to warn teen-agers about the dangers \n     of drinking.\n       The White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy \n     offers two reasons for not including alcohol in the anti-drug \n     campaign. the first is that it would dilute the basic \n     message, which is that kids should avoid illegal drugs. That \n     is strange reasoning, given the solid evidence showing that \n     teen-age drinking is often a gateway to illicit drug use. \n     Indeed, the first goal of the White House's national drug \n     strategy is to ``educate and enable America's youth to reject \n     illegal drugs as well as alcohol and tobacco.'' It also notes \n     that adults who started drinking as children are nearly eight \n     times more likely to use cocaine than adults who did not do \n     so.\n       The second reason is that Mr. McCaffrey believes that the \n     statute granting his office authority to combat controlled \n     substances leaves him no room to target alcohol. That rigid \n     interpretation is open to question. In any case, the \n     statutory problem can be quickly remedied by legislations. \n     Representatives Lucille Roybal-Allard, Democrat of \n     California, and Frank Wolf, Republic of Virginia, have \n     introduced a measure that would explicitly give General \n     McCaffrey the authority to include under-age drinking among \n     the campaign's targets.\n       Ms. Allard and Mr. Wolf have lined up powerful support from \n     groups like the American Medical Association. The National \n     Beer Wholesalers' Association opposes the measure, as does \n     the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, a nonprofit \n     coalition of advertising firms that has been working on the \n     campaign. The Partnership argues that an anti-alcohol message \n     would dilute the anti-drug message, but some of the \n     Partnership's members earn lucrative fees for promoting \n     alcohol products.\n       The measure, an amendment to an appropriations bill, \n     deserves support. If warning about the dangers of excessive \n     drinking is not statutorily part of General McCaffrey's job, \n     it ought to be.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From The Washington Post, June 18, 1999]\n\n                           Beer Lobby at Work\n\n       If beer lobbyists have their way in Congress, an expensive \n     taxpayer-funded campaign against youth drug use--$1 billion \n     over five years for a prime-time advertising blitz--will go \n     through Congress without a penny to combat the No. 1 drug \n     choice among young people. In the eyes of the National Beer \n     Wholesalers Association--the group responsible for killing \n     legislation last year to toughen drunk-driving standards--\n     alcohol doesn't count when it comes to warning kids about \n     illegal drug use.\n       Karalyn Nunnallee, national president of Mothers Against \n     Drunk Driving, points out that alcohol kills six times more \n     young people in this country than all illicit drugs combined \n     ``and is the primary gateway drug for other illicit drug \n     use.'' Yet the campaign conducted by Gen. Barry McCaffrey, \n     President Clinton's director of national drug policy, in \n     cooperation with the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, has \n     excluded any references to alcohol. The partnership, a \n     nonprofit, non-federally funded, non-industry-supported \n     coalition of advertising firms, favors a separate campaign \n     against drinking by kids. It argues that anti-alcohol \n     messages would inevitably dilute the focus on ``culturally'' \n     very different drugs.\n       Still, an anti-drug campaign that can't mention alcohol--or \n     binge drinking, a serious problem across America--is flawed. \n     Reps. Lucille Roybal-Allard of California and Frank Wolf of \n     Virginia are sponsoring an amendment before the House \n     Appropriations Committee that would free Gen. McCaffrey of \n     this restriction. Their point is not to detract from anti-\n     drug messages but to add to their effectiveness by reflecting \n     reality. Taxpayer dollars ought not be spent by the hundreds \n     of millions to talk about drugs but to remain mute on the \n     danger of illegal alcohol use by kids.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, June 4, 1999]\n\n                   Say `No' to Underage Drinking, Too\n\n       States uniformly ban the sale of alcoholic beverages to \n     minors because they are not considered mature enough to drink \n     responsibly and safely.\n       That bit of wisdom seems to have been lost on Congress, \n     which by sleight of hand banned the federal government from \n     mentioning alcohol in a $195 million anti-drug media blitz \n     aimed at kids.\n       A two-word phrase deep in the legislation establishing the \n     White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy--the so-\n     called ``drug czar''--limits its activities to ``controlled \n     substances.'' Liquor is not one, and so the federal \n     government can't spend a nickel to warn kids about alcohol's \n     potential dangers.\n       A bill introduced this month by U.S. Rep. Lucille Roybal-\n     Allard (D-Calif.) would correct that and allow the drug czar \n     to include alcohol warnings in anti-drug messages to \n     children. It's a sensible amendment, reflecting national \n     concerns about underage drinking, and it ought to be \n     approved.\n       Leading the crusade against the Roybal-Allard bill is the \n     National Beer Wholesalers' Association, whose tiresome \n     refrain is that liquor is a legal product and the federal \n     government has no business criticizing it in any forum.\n       Nonsense. Alcohol sales to minors are not legal, and the \n     dangers of alcohol abuse by adolescents are universally \n     recognized. ``It's the biggest drug abuse problem for \n     adolescents, and it's linked to the use of other, illegal \n     drugs,'' said drug czar Barry McCaffrey at a Feb. 8 news \n     conference.\n       Among other research, a 1998 University of Michigan study \n     reported that 74 percent of high school seniors had already \n     tried alcohol--about twice as many as had smoked marijuana--\n     and nearly a third admitted getting drunk during the previous \n     month.\n       Still, a spokesman for the drug czar's office argues that \n     adding ``. . . and alcohol'' to the federal ad campaign for \n     kids would muddle its anti-drug message.\n       That's an inane distinction. Alcohol, in the hands of \n     children or teens, is a dangerous drug they should be warned \n     about. It's sufficiently dangerous in fact, that if more \n     money is needed to broaden the federal media blitz, Congress \n     should provide it.\n       Honesty has to be the trademark of a campaign against \n     substance abuse, particularly one aimed at kids. Playing \n     phony games with the definition of ``dangerous substance'' \n     undermines the credibility of the effort and also its \n     effectiveness.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, June 16, 1999]\n\n                         Booze and Its Backers\n\n       Federal drug czar Barry R. McCaffrey has launched a $1-\n     billion media campaign to dissuade youngsters from substance \n     abuse. Not a penny, however, will address the substance that \n     today's teenagers are abusing the most: alcohol.\n       With youth consumption on the rise since the early 1990s, \n     even McCaffrey acknowledges that alcohol leads to more \n     teenage deaths than other drugs combined. Nevertheless, he \n     insists that including alcohol in the campaign would only \n     dilute its basic message, that kids should avoid illegal \n     drugs.\n       That's hard to swallow, given federal studies showing that \n     67% of children who start drinking alcohol before age 15 end \n     up using illicit drugs. And that adults who started drinking \n     as children are nearly eight times more likely to use cocaine \n     than those who did not.\n       That's why the House Appropriations Committee should pass \n     an amendment by Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles), \n     requiring McCaffrey to include underage drinking in his \n     campaign's targets.\n       Ideally, the government would not be spending any money at \n     all to reach the\n\n[[Page S8007]]\n\n     American people on TV and radio: Broadcasters promised in \n     1996 to offer more free public-service spots, just before \n     Congress gave them, without cost, a portion of the supposedly \n     public airwaves that would have fetched $70 billion on the \n     open market. Given that McCaffrey's money has already been \n     allocated, however, Congress' focus should be on how he can \n     spend it wisely.\n       The people scrambling to defeat Roybal-Allard's amendment \n     are unable to offer any sound reason why alcohol should be \n     excluded from McCaffrey's campaign. But they do have a clear \n     stake in opposing the amendment. Leading the charge against \n     it is Rep. Anne M. Northrup (R-Ky.). She received nearly \n     twice as much campaign money from the alcoholic beverage \n     industry in 1997 and 1998 as any of her colleagues on the \n     House Appropriations Committee. At her side is a coalition of \n     advertising firms, called the Partnership for a Drug-Free \n     America, that have benefited handsomely from the $1 billion \n     the alcohol industry spent last year on promotions.\n       On Thursday, the executives of those firms will meet at the \n     annual American Advertising Conference in Washington. In a \n     valid illustration of the capital's incestuous world, the \n     opening speaker will be Gen. Barry McCaffrey.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Christian Science Monitor, June 4, 1999]\n\n              The Monitor's View--Don't Soft-Pedal Alcohol\n\n       The United States government will spend $195 million this \n     year to persuade young Americans to avoid addictive drugs. Is \n     there any good reason why some of that money should not be \n     used to point out the dangers of the substance most abused by \n     the young--alcohol?\n       A couple of members of Congress thought not. That's why \n     they put forward legislation to give the country's chief \n     antidrug official, Barry McCaffrey, the authority to use some \n     of the advertising money available to the White House Office \n     of National Drug Control Policy to steer kids away from beer, \n     wine, and liquor.\n       But these matters are not so clear-cut as they seem--or as \n     they ought to be. No sooner has Reps. Lucille Roybal-Allard \n     (D) of California and Frank Wolf (R) of Virginia offered \n     their amendment than a political-defense mechanism lurched \n     into action. Alcoholic beverages have a powerful lobby on \n     Capitol Hill, and their producers and distributors contribute \n     faithfully to campaign war chests.\n       Opposition to the amendment is coalescing in Congress \n     around the argument that including alcohol would dilute or \n     distort the antidrug message. How so, since alcohol destroys \n     more young lives than any other drug, and people who use \n     ``hard'' drugs typically have tried alcohol first? Binge \n     drinking, threatening order and individual lives, has become \n     an increasing problem on college campuses.\n       No, what's kicking in is ``Big Alcohol's'' political clout \n     and America's ambivalence about its most popular over-the-\n     counter addictive drug, which is relentlessly pitched to the \n     young via TV beer ads. Sadly, McCaffrey's office is \n     ambivalent, hardly leaping to support the amendment Leaving \n     alcohol out of the antidrug campaign creates a gap in common \n     sense and effectiveness. Representatives Roybal-Allard and \n     Wolf get high marks for working to fill it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From the Record, June 7, 1999]\n\n   Overlooked Type of Abuse--Far More Youngsters Drink Than Use Drugs\n\n       Common sense doesn't always win in Congress. How else can \n     you explain some of the reactions to an amendment directing \n     the Federal Government to spend some of its anti-drug \n     advertising dollars to discourage underage drinking? Unless, \n     of course, campaign contributions are a factor.\n       Many people believe that underage drinking is a far more \n     serious problem than drug use by youngsters. And there's \n     evidence to support their view. For example, nearly three-\n     quarters of the high school seniors surveyed by the \n     University of Michigan last year said they had consumed \n     alcohol in the previous year, compared with the 38 percent \n     who reported smoking marijuana. A third admitted to being \n     drunk in the previous month.\n       Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of federal drug policy, has \n     called underage drinking the ``biggest drug abuse problem for \n     adolescents.'' He has said it is ``linked to the use of \n     other, illegal drugs.''\n       Yet while the federal government this year plans to spend \n     $195 million on a national media campaign to fight the use of \n     illicit drugs, no money has been set aside for an advertising \n     campaign to combat underage drinking.\n       Earlier this month, Lucille Roybal-Allard, a California \n     Democrat, introduced legislation to make underage drinking a \n     target of the federal anti-drug media campaign. Her measure \n     is supported by the American Medical Association, the \n     American Public Health Association, the American Society of \n     Addictive Medicine, and Mothers against Drunk Driving.\n       But several members of Congress and the beer wholesalers \n     oppose it. Even the White House's Office of National Drug \n     Control Policy has questioned it.\n       Why? The beer industry says it already spends hundreds of \n     thousands of dollars to combat the problem. It says the drug \n     czar should focus only on illicit drugs. Rep. Anne Northrup, \n     R-KY, agrees and has promised to fight the measure when it \n     comes up for a vote. Ms. Northup says her opposition has \n     nothing to do with the nearly $40,000 in contributions she \n     has gotten from liquor and beer interests in the past two \n     years.\n       The Partnership for a Drug-Free America, the coalition that \n     coordinates the anti-drug media campaign, says it supports \n     the concept of targeting underage drinking. But it says \n     federal efforts would be dwarfed by the $3 billion a year the \n     beer industry spends promoting its products. The Partnership \n     says $195 million is not enough to do two effective \n     campaigns, and that one good campaign is preferable to two \n     weak ones.\n       Maybe, but it's hard to see how targeting underage drinking \n     would dilute the message against drugs. If the two are \n     connected--as Mr. McCaffrey says--discouraging youths from \n     drinking might also prevent some from using drugs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From The Boston Globe, June 22, 1999]\n\n                             Beer Pressure\n\n       The same lobby that killed a proposal last year to \n     standardize blood alcohol levels for drunken driving is now \n     trying to keep underage drinking out of a youth education \n     campaign sponsored by the nation's drug czar, General Barry \n     McCaffrey.\n       The National Beer Wholesalers Association opposes the \n     inclusion of underage drinking in the $195 million media \n     campaign, claiming that alcohol is a legal substance and \n     should not be lumped with marijuana, cocaine, and other \n     illegal drugs. But drinking under age 21 is illegal in every \n     state, and alcohol abuse is far more common than any other \n     drug among young people.\n       General McCaffrey himself has said alcohol is ``the biggest \n     drug abuse problem for adolescents.'' But his office has been \n     strangely circumspect about adding underage drinking to the \n     campaign, saying the drug czar's charter limits his mandate \n     to fighting controlled substances. This is why Congress \n     should favor an amendment sponsored by Representatives Frank \n     Wolf of Virginia, a Republican, and Lucille Roybal-Allard of \n     California, a Democrat, that authorizes McCaffrey to include \n     underage drinking in the education campaign.\n       The alcohol lobby is terrified of being regulated like that \n     other legal killer, cigarettes, with warning labels on beer \n     cans and limits on marketing to teenagers. It points to its \n     voluntary public service ads that urge responsible drinking. \n     But the alcohol industry spends nearly $3 billion a year on \n     marketing and promotion. Against that backdrop, \n     ``responsibility'' needs all the help it can get.\n       The facts about underage drinking are sobering. The \n     National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports 16,100 \n     alcohol-related fatalities in 1997--one person killed every \n     32 minutes. Intoxication rates were highest for the youngest \n     drivers. Although the universal drinking age of 21 has helped \n     reduce fatalities, motor vehicle crashes remain the number \n     one cause of death for teenagers.\n       June--prom season--is the month when most of these tragic \n     deaths occur. It would be a good month for Congress to do \n     something about it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Statement of Organizations Supporting Inclusion of Anti-Underage \n        Drinking Messages in the Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign\n\n       An effective antidrug prevention program directed at \n     America's young people must include a significant effort to \n     discourage underage drinking.

Barry F. McCaffrey,\n     Director Office of National Drug Control Policy, Executive \n         Office of the President, Washington, DC.\n       Dear General McCaffrey: I congratulate you for your \n     excellent work in developing the national anti-drug media \n     campaign and demonstrating such strong leadership in support \n     of our nation's youth. I am confident that the effectiveness \n     of this program as a means of educating and motivating \n     children and their families will be enhanced by a greater \n     commitment to the problem of underage drinking. Thus, I want \n     to recommend that you include advertisements addressing \n     underage drinking in the paid portion of ONDCP's media \n     campaign.\n       Alcohol is the drug most frequently used by American \n     teenagers. It is consumed more frequently than all other \n     illicit drugs combined and is the drug most likely to be \n     associated with injury or death. Alcohol is a drug that can \n     affect judgement, coordination and long-term health. It is \n     involved in teen automobile crashes, homicides, and suicides; \n     the three leading causes of teen deaths. No comprehensive \n     drug control strategy for youth can be complete without the \n     full inclusion of underage alcohol use and abuse.\n       The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reports that \n     there are 11 million drinkers between the ages of 12 and 20. \n     Over fifty percent of high school seniors report having been \n     drunk in the past year. Among 12-17 year olds, less than half \n     perceive great harm in consuming five or more drinks once or \n     twice a week. In light of the prevalence of underage \n     drinking, it is little surprise that alcohol consumption by \n     youth so often results in risky behaviors which lead to \n     unplanned pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, \n     involvement with law enforcement, and worst of all, death and \n     the death of others. These are the immediate impacts on \n     society and do not include the even more costly, long term \n     impact of alcohol abuse or dependence on individual health \n     and the state of families.\n       A recent study from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse \n     and Alcoholism sheds even greater light on the implications \n     of these figures. Youth who begin drinking before the age of \n     15 are four times as likely to become alcoholic as those who \n     wait until age 21 or later to begin drinking. This research \n     also indicates that every year of delayed drinking onset will \n     result in a significant reduction in risk for alcohol abuse \n     or alcoholism. Underage drinking is a shadow that threatens \n     the health, safety and adolescence of our nation's youth.\n       We should utilize a public health media campaign to send \n     youth and their families messages which will educate them \n     about the health and social consequences of underage \n     drinking. Through the ONDCP strategy, we can utilize this \n     effective medium for altering youth attitudes about underage \n     drinking and for supporting community-based prevention \n     activities that will help young people adopt lifestyles that \n     eschew the use of alcohol and other drugs. The evidence of \n     need is overwhelming.\n       I stand ready to work with you to develop a powerful media \n     campaign that will effectively deglamourize underage \n     drinking. I have established a Surgeon General's Staff \n     Working Group to bring together the resources of the \n     Department to create an effective campaign to curtail the \n     incidence of underage and binge drinking. This campaign will \n     be successful only if it can receive the national \n     dissemination available through a paid media campaign. It is \n     time to more effectively address the drug that children and \n     teens tell us is their greatest concern and the drug we know \n     is most likely to result in their injury or death.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                    David Satcher, M.D., Ph.D.\n\n                                    Assistant Secretary for Health\n                                              and Surgeon General.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I want to explain my opposition to the \nLautenberg amendment giving ONDCP's National Youth Anti-Drug Media \nCampaign jurisdiction to include underage alcohol consumption for the \npurposes of the media campaign. Like all my colleagues, I have seen the \nresults of underage drinking, and I deplore them. Young lives should \nnot be wasted, and I challenge the White House and my colleagues to \ncontinue to take action to curb this problem.\n  However, I do not believe this amendment is the correct way to solve \nthe underage drinking crisis. The Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign is not \nthe right vehicle for anti-alcohol messages. The Office of National \nDrug Control Policy fights the war on drugs, not alcohol. I agree with \nDrug Czar Barry McCaffrey that there is an important distinction \nbetween illegal drugs and alcohol, which is a legal substance. \nAdditionally, simply adding anti-alcohol messages to the ONDCP's Youth \nAnti-Drug Media Campaign without appropriating more funds for this \npurpose will dilute the anti-drug efforts. Resources which are badly \nneeded to fight drugs will be rerouted to fight underage drinking. I \ncannot support a bill which chooses to fight alcohol at the expense of \nillegal drugs.\n  I have supported in the past, and will continue to support, programs \nthat discourage underage drinking. In fact, I want to applaud the \nefforts of alcohol distributers, who have initiated many of these \nimportant programs.\n  Let us find a different way to take action against underage alcohol \nconsumption that does not compromise our actions against the use of \nillegal drugs.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield the remaining 2 minutes to the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. I compliment him \non his foresight for bringing this amendment up.\n  We will have a 5-year media campaign, with $1 billion targeted at \nyouth so they don't get into drugs and start taking drugs. The drug \nczar himself, General McCaffrey, said that alcohol is the gateway drug. \nMr. President, 42 percent of Iowa teens seeking substance abuse \ntreatment in 1998 were being treated for alcohol addiction; three out \nof five teens have had an alcoholic drink in the last month.\n\n[[Page S8009]]\n\n  We have a 5-year, $1 billion ad campaign to tell teens don't take \ncocaine, don't take meth, don't smoke marijuana, and we are not going \nto say anything about beer and alcohol? These are the first drugs these \nkids take.\n  That is what the Senator from New Jersey is saying. Let's require in \nthis package of ads over 5 years that they also target drinking by \nkids.\n  I understand that the amendment is supported by Mothers Against Drunk \nDriving, the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse \nCounselors, and the National Association of Alcohol, Drugs, and \nDisability.\n  It is time we took teen drinking seriously. I heard that the National \nBeer Wholesalers Association is opposed to the amendment. If I am \nwrong, someone please correct me. It is this association that has \nalways said they are against teen drinking. If they are against teen \ndrinking, why would they be opposed to this amendment to put ads out \nshowing teens what happens if they drink?\n  Eight young people every day die in alcohol-related car crashes. It \nis time to stop this epidemic.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes 33 seconds.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me reiterate that the practical effect of the \nLautenberg amendment is to gut the effort to reduce teenage drug use.\n  I wouldn't argue with a single thing that any of our colleagues has \nsaid about the importance of combating teenage drinking. Everybody \nthinks it is important to combat teenage drinking. Fortunately, over \nthe past 20 years teenager drinking has gone down. However, according \nto a highly respected University of Michigan study, teenage drug use \nhas gone up 46 percent since 1992.\n  We should let this effort to combat teenage drug use, which is \ndramatically on the increase, go forward. On another day in another \ncontest, let's pursue an effort to deal with teenage drinking.\n  This amendment, regretfully, would gut a very important campaign to \ncombat teenage drug use. That is not me speaking. That is Mario Cuomo \nand Bill Bennett, chairman of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, \nwho oppose this amendment, which is not to say that either one of those \nmen is in favor of teenage drinking.\n  Let's keep this antidrug effort intact and let what we hope will be \nan effective advertising campaign go forward.\n  I thank Senator Campbell for yielding time to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make just a couple of concluding \ncomments, again reiterating I am really quite uncomfortable in the \nposition of opposing Senator Lautenberg. But I do not think this is a \nforced choice of the type he suggests we make; I do not think this is a \nchoice that we ought to be required to make. One might at some point \nput together a program, which I would fully support, to say let us do \n$1 billion advertising in 5 years, targeted to Americans, especially \nAmerica's kids, dealing with alcohol abuse. I would support that. Then \none would say, perhaps, coming to the floor of the Senate: This program \nyou have dealing with alcohol abuse, why doesn't it include drugs? Or, \nWhy doesn't it include addiction to smoking cigarettes? I would support \nthat as well.\n  But we ought to do them as programs we can measure and evaluate. The \nprogram we are talking about now is a program dealing with drugs. It is \n3 years into the program. People say: Why doesn't it include alcohol? \nLet's do a program on alcohol. I will support that.\n  The story I told earlier, about going to the Oak Hill Detention \nCenter and seeing these young children, kids on drugs who were \nconvicted of violent crimes, do you know the other thing about their \nstories? In every case, they were 12 or 13 years old and they were \naddicted to drugs, selling drugs, shooting people, committing armed \nrobbery, being involved in violent crimes; and the other common \ndenominator in every single case was they had parents addicted to \ndrugs. They came from homes, often with only a single parent, in which \nthat parent was addicted to drugs, died at a young age, and was an \nabusive parent because of being addicted to drugs. There is a common \ndenominator.\n  This program is a program designed to say to America's youth, through \ndrug education by television commercials: Don't do drugs. We know \ntelevision advertising works. We all use it. Hundreds of billions of \ndollars a year are spent on television ads to convince people to listen \nto certain kinds of music, wear certain kinds of jeans, to buy certain \nkinds of food. We know it works. I think it will work with respect to \nthis issue of drugs as well.\n  We are 3 years into the program. I will support gladly, and with \ngreat excitement, a program on alcohol. I have supported every \ninitiative dealing with alcohol abuse and drunk driving in this Senate. \nI will support it as well dealing with the addiction to cigarettes. The \ntargeting of alcohol and cigarettes, both legal products, to this \ncountry's youth, is unforgivable.\n  But this is a separate issue. We have a campaign underway. It is 3 \nyears in progress. It is designed very deliberately to change the \nunderstanding and the culture dealing with drugs. I think it has a \nchance of working. So let us do that. We had to cut it $50 million this \nyear alone just on this issue. Let us allow this to work. At another \ntime I will be happy to join my colleague from New Jersey and others in \ndesigning an identical program dealing with alcohol abuse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Senator Dorgan and I find ourselves in a strange debate \nindeed, because I think we as much as anyone in this body want to \nreduce teenage drinking. All of us have had personal tragedies in our \nfamilies. As I say, as a former deputy sheriff and as a volunteer \nprison counselor, I know all the horror stories. We know a lot of them \ntoday. I don't deny any of them. I am sure they have created terrible \nproblems in families and in society, too. But I think we are missing \nthe point I tried to make a while ago. It is not whether we want to \nreduce teenage drinking. We all do. It is whether this is the right \nvehicle; and it is not.\n  I mentioned a while ago that ONDCP does not have statutory authority. \nIf we are going to add statutory authority and just bypass the \nlegislative part of this body, why don't we do away with the \nlegislative part of this body and just do all legislation in \nappropriations bills?\n  I would join my friend from New Jersey if he wanted to introduce a \nbill to add alcohol to the ONDCP's agenda. That would be fine with me, \nto add more money to it, too. I would be a cosponsor. I will be more \nthan willing to fight the battle with him to make sure we reduce \nteenage drinking in any kind of ad campaign that would be effective. I \nhope we will do that, too. But I believe this is the wrong vehicle for \nit. We ought to do it through the authorizing committees.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Colorado will yield, \nlet me make one final observation. He mentions the issue of alcohol. He \ncomes from a particular perspective, being a Native American.\n  I want to tell him just about two people, and I will do it in 30 \nseconds. I toured a hospital one day. He talks about fetal alcohol \nsyndrome. A young Native American woman had just given birth to a baby. \nThe woman was an alcoholic. The baby was born with a .21 blood-alcohol \ncontent, a young baby born dead drunk. This woman, having had a third \nbaby, wanted nothing to do with that child, didn't want to see that \nchild. That child will probably have fetal alcohol syndrome.\n  But I was down at a hospital not far from this building and I saw \nbabies born from crack-addicted mothers, and I saw babies born drug \naddicted, addicted to hard drugs. The doctors told me what those babies \nare like as they try to shed this addiction, being born of mothers who \nhad taken drugs during this pregnancy.\n  We have problems in all of these areas. I do not deny that. But this \nprogram deals with drugs. I think it has a chance of working. I hope we \ncan allow that to happen with this vote.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Senator for those eloquent comments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the first vote, \nthere be 2 minutes equally divided in the usual form between the \nremaining votes.\n\n[[Page S8010]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I see no further speakers. I yield the \nremaining time, and I move to table the Lautenberg amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending business and turn to the conference report to accompany H.R. \n775.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     775), to establish certain procedures for civil actions \n     brought for damages relating to the failure of any device or \n     system to process or otherwise deal with the transition from \n     the year 1999 to the year 2000, and for other purposes, \n     having met, after full and free conference, have agreed to \n     recommend and do recommend to their respective Houses this \n     report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of June 29, 1999.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, debate on the \nconference report is limited in the following manner:\n  The Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, 20 minutes;\n  The Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, 15 minutes;\n  The Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, 15 minutes;\n  The Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, 10 minutes;\n  The Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Hollings, 50 minutes.\n  Immediately following that debate, the Senate will proceed to a vote \non the adoption of the conference report with no other intervening \naction or debate.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I don't intend to use all of my time. I \nintend to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Washington. I have talked \nto other Members who have time under this agreement. For the benefit of \nmy colleagues, I think we will not use all of the time as outlined in \nthe unanimous-consent agreement.\n  I am pleased to urge the final passage of the conference report on \nH.R. 775. This has been a long and arduous process. While there have \nbeen times when the bill appeared to be moving slowly, or even dying, I \nwas always confident we would do the right thing and pass this final \nbill.\n  We are now ready to enact this critical legislation. For the benefit \nof my colleagues, the House has just passed the conference report by a \nvote of 404-24. This is a victory for the Nation and for the continued \nprosperity of our economy as we enter the new millennium.\n  This is a critical piece of legislation. It allows all of our \nbusinesses and industries, large and small, hitech and non-hitech, to \nconcentrate their efforts for the next 6 months on preventing Y2K \nproblems from happening, and planning remediation measures. Rather than \nspending time, resources and money planning litigation defenses, we can \nbe focusing on the means for fixing the problems.\n  This legislation strikes a very fair and practical balance in \nprotecting the economy and protecting the rights of consumers. And very \nimportantly, I want to note, it addresses needs and problems of small \nbusinesses, as well as large.\n  I would like to dispel any misconceptions or misinformation that \nthere was any underhandedness in the final negotiation and drafting of \nrevisions to this bill. Despite attempts to address Administration \nconcerns last week with revisions and compromises that were made \nFriday, over the weekend, and on Monday, final negotiations and \nproposals by the White House were made on Tuesday morning, as we \npressed against the deadline for completion of the conference report. \nFinal revisions and drafting were made with every effort and good faith \nintention to respond to the generalized requests of the White House. \nChallenges to the integrity, professionalism and honor of the conferees \nand staff are unwarranted. This is a fair bill that reflects a \nbipartisan compromise.\n  Perhaps the recent vote just a few minutes ago in the House might \nindicate that is an overwhelming view in the other body. I am sure the \nvote in the Senate will also indicate overwhelming support for this \nlegislation.\n  During the conference, the Senate and the House proponents of the \nlegislation agreed to at least 10 substantive changes to the bill. \nThese significant compromises were in addition to 10 or more major \nconcessions made in the Senate from the time it was passed by the \ncommittee until its passage on the floor. These revisions and \ncompromises have resulted in a more narrowly tailored piece of \nlegislation but one that will still accomplish everything we set out to \naccomplish when the bill was introduced in January.\n  We know the provisions of the bill:\n  The 30-day notice and 60-day remediation period allows prompt \nresolution of problems without time-consuming and expensive litigation\n  It provides that defendants are responsible for the share of harm \nthey cause, with some exceptions to ensure that consumers are made \nwhole.\n  It requires plaintiffs to mitigate damages.\n  It penalizes defendants who intentionally defraud or injure \nplaintiffs; or who are bad actors.\n  It provides liability protection for those not directly involved in a \nY2K failure.\n  It assures that someone will not lose his house if a mortgage payment \ncannot be made or processed because of a Y2K failure.\n  It sunsets in three years.\n  It does not deny the right of anyone to redress legitimate \ngrievances.\n\n[[Page S8018]]\n\n  This legislation will encourage an atmosphere of cooperation in \nsolving problems, rather than rushing to the courthouse. Emphasizing \nthe need to talk out and resolve differences rather than litigating \nthem will be helpful not only in the Y2K situation, but I hope will \nmove us away from the litigious nature of our country today.\n  I am especially pleased at the level of bipartisan and bicameral \ncooperation in bringing this legislation to fruition. This legislation \ndemonstrated the true ability of both parties and both bodies of \nCongress to work together for the good of the country. The efforts on \nboth sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol to achieve \nconsensus have been tireless. This conference has truly been a civics \nclass example of how Congress can rise above special interest demands \nto do the right thing in the public interest\n  Mr. President, there are many who have contributed to this effort, \nparticularly during the conference with the House. I want to especially \nmention the steadfast support and efforts of both Senator Dodd and \nWyden. They worked late into the night this week to negotiate with the \nWhite House and assure the President's support.\n  I thank my two colleagues, Senator Dodd and Senator Wyden. This bill \npassed the Commerce Committee 11-9 on a strict partisan vote. Thanks to \nthe efforts of those two individuals, who have been tireless, we were \nable to not only work with the other side of the Capitol, but the White \nHouse. Senator Wyden and Senator Dodd have better relations with the \nWhite House than I do. That is no secret to anyone around here. The \nfact that they were able to work more closely with the White House than \nI ever could have was a significant and, frankly, critical part of this \nagreement that we made. I again extend my deep appreciation to them.\n  It did not win them the ``Miss Congeniality'' award in their own \ncaucus--something I am familiar with on this side of the aisle.\n  My appreciation, as well as a certain amount of sympathy, goes out to \nthem. In all seriousness, without their efforts we would not be here.\n  I also think they would join me in expressing appreciation to \nCongressman Goodlatte and Congressman Davis on the other side. \nCongressman Goodlatte and Congressman Davis started with a piece of \nlegislation far more ``restrictive''--if that is the right word--in the \nopinion of some, a lot better.\n  The fact is, they were willing to agree to the movement in the \ncompromises that were made. They clearly could have held their ground \nand we couldn't have moved forward.\n  By the way, Congressmen Goodlatte, Davis, and Sensenbrenner were the \noriginators of this legislation.\n  I also thank Senator Gorton, Senator Feinstein, Senator Hatch, and \nSenator Bennett.\n  It reminds me of the old line of Jack Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs: \nVictory has 1,000 fathers and defeat has 1 poor lonely orphan.\n  Along with that philosophy, I thank the staff members on both sides \nof the aisle and both sides of the Capitol: Carol Grunberg of Senator \nWyden's staff; Shawn Maher of Senator Dodd's staff; Jeanne Bumpus of \nSenator Gorton's staff; Larry Block with Senator Hatch; Steven Wall on \nSenator Lott's staff; Laurie Rubenstein with Senator Lieberman; Tania \nCalhoun of the Y2K Committee; Diana Schacht of the House Judiciary \nCommittee; Phil Kiko, of Congressman Sensenbrenner's staff; Amy \nHerrink, of Congressman Davis staff; and Ben Kline of Congressman \nGoodlatte's staff.\n  Finally, I thank the coalition that got behind this legislation. \nTheir help was as broad as any coalition of businesses--large, small, \nand medium sized--I have seen in my experience here in the Senate.\n  I thank the National Association of Manufacturers, the Chambers of \nCommerce, and hi-tech groups, including ITAA, ITI, and BSA.\n  I ask unanimous consent a list of the year 2000 coalition members be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Year 2000 Coalition Members

We could not have succeeded without them.\n  I do not intend to make further remarks except to reserve about 5 \nminutes of my time for the Senator from Washington. I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is a great honor to be on the floor \ntoday to express my special appreciation at being able to work with \nSenator McCain, Senator Dodd, and so many of our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle on this important legislation.\n  This bill is designed with one point and that is to make sure that \nAmerica's prosperity does not screech to a halt when the calendar pages \nflip over to start a new millennium. I am of the view that with this \nbill, millions of consumers and businesses are more likely to be on \nline at the turn of the century than waiting in line for a courtroom \ndate.\n  I am especially pleased at the bipartisan efforts to make sure the \nindividual consumer was protected in this legislation. This legislation \nallows consumers to get punitive damages against the bad actors. It \nmakes sure consumers cannot be ripped off with fraudulent \nmisrepresentations. It greatly expands the opportunity for consumers to \nbring cases in State rather than Federal court. And the conference \nreport ensures that the individual consumer doesn't get the shaft \nbecause they are going to be in a position to be made whole when you \ntake the entire package of remedies that would be available to them.\n  I am going to focus for just a moment on the 20 major changes that \nwere made in this legislation after it left the Senate Commerce \nCommittee; seven of them Chairman McCain and I agreed on and one of \nthem was a bottom-line proposition for me. The Senator from South \nCarolina, who is so eloquent with respect to the rights of plaintiffs \nin our country, was concerned, legitimately, about the long-term \nramifications of this legislation. At my insistence, after the Senate \nCommerce Committee completed its work, Chairman McCain added a 3-year \nsunset provision to this legislation. So this is going to be a bill to \ndeal with a finite, discrete problem, not something that is going to \nlinger for decades and decades.\n\n  We also eliminated the vague Federal defenses that were involved \nearly on. We dropped the preemptive standards for punitive damages. We \nmade sure that bad actors were not going to get a free ride. We \nrestored joint liability for defendants who knowingly committed fraud. \nThere were extra damages for plaintiffs facing insolvent defendants and \nwe restored limited liability for directors and officers. That is what \nwe began with after it left the Senate Commerce Committee and why I was \npleased to join with Chairman McCain.\n  Then Senator Dodd, who is the Democrats' leader on these technology \nissues and who has given me, as a junior Member of this body, so much \ncounsel, came along and made an additional set of important changes so \nas to particularly protect small businesses. We also went further with \nrespect to officers and directors, and we made sure that plaintiffs \nwere not going to face tougher evidentiary standards because of the \ngood work done by the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Then we went to the conference committee and there were 10 major \nchanges made to address concerns of the White House. In the area of \nproportionate liability, we doubled the orphan share for the solvent \ndefendants, we tripled the orphan share for defendants when the \nplaintiffs were bad actors, and we assured that individual consumers \nfacing insolvent defendants were made whole.\n  We made a number of changes in the class action area. We boosted the \nmonetary threshold. In committee, when we began it was at $1 million. \nNow it is at $10 million. We boosted the class size from 50 to 100 \nplaintiffs. We also added provisions to make sure cases could be dealt \nwith under remand provisions to assist the consumer.\n  Finally, there were changes in securities law to exempt private \nsecurities claims under this act, strong provisions with respect to \ncontract enforcement. And to address a number of the important issues \nthat our colleague from North Carolina has raised with respect to \neconomic loss, we stipulated the economic loss rules would apply in a \nnumber of instances so as to give the consumer yet another tier of \nprotection.\n  Our Nation needs a game plan for Y2K. This legislation is not going \nto solve all of the Y2K problems that crop up early in the next \ncentury. But what we will do by passing this legislation is ensure that \nwe do not compound the problems we know are going to occur. We are \ndoing it in a way that is going to ensure consumers are made whole, \nthat bad actors face the stiffest of penalties, and at the same time we \ndo not encourage mindless litigation that does nothing other than drain \nthe vitality out of our economic prosperity.\n  I have believed for a long time that failure to pass legislation in \nthis area would be similar to lobbing a monkey wrench into the Nation's \ntechnology engine which is driving our prosperity. This legislation \ngives us the opportunity to keep that prosperity going. I am very \nhonored to have had the opportunity to be part of this effort.\n  I pay special thanks, in wrapping up my remarks, to my colleague, \nSenator Dodd, the Democratic leader on these technology issues. A \nlittle bit after midnight on Monday--I guess that would be early \nTuesday morning--this relatively young Senator was getting a little \npooped and beginning to wonder how much longer I could keep going. The \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut said: This is not an option. We \nare going to stay at it until this legislation gets done. I say to my \npal from Oregon, I am going to be talking to the President of the \nUnited States tonight.\n\n  I looked at my watch and I thought: Well, it is quarter to 1. This is \ngoing to be interesting, to learn a little bit more about this call. \nBut in fact, as a result of the efforts of Senator Dodd, the work that \nwas done by Chairman McCain and his staff and a variety of colleagues \non both sides of the aisle in those early morning hours, on Tuesday we \nconsummated the 20 major changes that were made in this legislation to \nensure we had a bipartisan bill. So I have to tell you, this \nlegislation, which was on the ropes early Tuesday morning with a lot of \nus thinking that it was going down for the count, now is a bill that \nour body can be proud of. It is a genuine compromise. I am not going to \ncontinue further because I know there are a number of colleagues who \nwish to speak as well. But I do want to pay tribute to a number of our \nstaff who put in these extraordinary hours.\n  I see Marti Allbright and Mark Buse over there, with Chairman McCain; \nSenator Dodd's staff as well. Carol Grunberg, who is here with me, is \nsort of the Senate's Bionic Woman. She just kept going when it was so \nimportant to keep the parties together.\n  I am proud to be part of this effort. I look forward to what I hope \nwill be a resounding vote in the Senate before too long. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is reserved under the \nunanimous consent agreement for the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this conference report on the Y2K liability \nprotection bill is being roundly praised, but not universally. Not \nuniversally. And it should not be. This bill is worse than the bill the \nSenate passed only a few weeks ago. The conference report provides \nexpanded legal protections, especially at the expense of consumers, and \nI believe it raises serious constitutional questions. I do not support \nit because it is an unjustified wish list for special interests that \nare or might become involved in Y2K litigation.\n  The conference report greatly expands the scope of the Senate-passed \nbill by amending this act to apply to a potential Y2K failure. In fact, \nsection 4\n\n[[Page S8020]]\n\nof the bill was amended during the conference to apply to the act's \nlegal restrictions for a potential Y2K failure that could occur or has \nallegedly caused harm or injury before January 1, 2003. Let me ask, \nwhat is a potential Y2K failure? Nobody knows. I tell you this, over \nthe next 4 years almost every lawsuit involving any technology issue \ncould trigger the bill's special legal protections under this sweeping \ndefinition.\n  Once again, the majority is manipulating a key phrase to suit the \nwants of a special interest. The business lobby has inserted its own \nexpanded definition of a Y2K action to broaden the scope of this bill. \nA House conferee observed when this expanded definition was first \nproposed last Thursday that it was an expansive definition that had \nbeen expressly rejected during House Judiciary Committee proceedings. \nIt certainly was not accepted here. Lo and behold, like the ``Lady of \nthe Lake'' rising, we find this comes out of the ether during the \nconference.\n  Not really even during the conference. In fact, that may be one \nreason the conference was never called to meet for a second time to go \nover the proposed conference report or to even vote on these matters, \nbecause it was easier to have matters not considered by the House or \nthe Senate or the conference or voted on, but those that came from \nsomewhere--not from us. But there they are.\n  In fact, after the first truncated meeting was adjourned and a \npossible follow up meeting was postponed Tuesday morning, the \nconference was never called back into public session to debate the \nproposal or even permit amendments to be offered and voted on. I \npredicted at the first and only preliminary meeting of the conference \nthat I would not be allowed an opportunity to improve the bill by \nadding balance and protecting consumers, or at least even get a vote on \nit. I am sorry to report that I was correct. In fact, the conference \nreport was filed without any follow up meeting or votes by the \nconference committee.\n  That is an interesting way of doing things. If we have a lobby that \ndoes not want something, like the juvenile justice bill that passed--\nthey do not want it because they lost on the gun issues--why, it comes \nto a screeching halt: We are studying it, we are reviewing it, we want \nto deliberate this, we need to have time for votes, we have to have a \nconference and go thoroughly into it.\n  We have another lobby that says we want this Y2K bill: We do not like \nthe bill that passed the Senate, and the House did not do enough for \nus. Will you throw a bunch of stuff in, don't vote on it, don't talk \nabout it, don't have any procedure, just toss it in, because this is \nwhat we want, and, oh, by the way, we want it right now, we need it in \na hurry.\n  This vagueness of a potential Y2K failure will also add to more \nfuture litigation instead of curbing it. From a bill that is supposed \nto deter frivolous litigation, this new, vague definition will produce \nmore lawsuits and may give special legal protection to many more \ncompanies than the Senate-passed bill.\n  These special legal protections include: 90-day waiting period to \nfile a lawsuit, heightened pleading requirements, duty to anticipate \nand avoid Y2K damages, overriding implied warranties under State law, \nproportionate liability, and many others. All these special legal \nprotections still apply to small business owners and consumers in this \nso-called compromise. In fact, the bill, as presently drafted, would \npreempt consumer protection laws of each of the 50 States.\n  I have to ask: Why does this bill create new protections for large \ncorporations while taking away existing protections for ordinary \ncitizens? Maybe they do not have as much influence at the conference.\n  Many consumers may not be aware of potential Y2K problems in the \nproducts they buy for personal, family, or household purposes. They \njust go to the store and buy it and expect it to work. They are going \nto find a real surprise if there is something in there that does not \nwork. One thing that will not work is the usual remedies they expect \nout of the consumer protection laws.\n  This bill as presently drafted would preempt the consumer protection \nlaws of each of the 50 states and restrict the legal rights of \nconsumers who are harmed by Y2K computer failures.\n  Why is this bill creating new protections for large corporations \nwhile taking away existing protections for the ordinary citizen? We all \nknow that individual consumers do not have the same knowledge or \nbargaining power in the marketplace as businesses with more resources.\n  Many consumers may not be aware of potential Y2K problems in the \nproducts that they buy for personal, family or household purposes. \nConsumers just go to the local store or neighborhood mall to buy a home \ncomputer or the latest software package. They expect their new purchase \nto work. What if it does not, due to a Y2K problem?\n  Then the average consumer should be able to use his or her home \nstate's consumer protection laws to get a refund, replacement part or \nother justice. But not under this bill.\n  The conference report also greatly expands the jurisdiction of the \nfederal courts to consider Y2K cases under its class action \nprovisions--now throwing Y2K cases into Federal court if a plaintiff \nseeks an award of punitive damages. Again, this expansion of the \nSenate-passed bill is unjustified.\n  It could be legal malpractice for an attorney not to seek punitive \ndamages at the beginning of a case, when the complaint is filed and \nbefore discovery of all the facts has commenced. This provision makes \nno sense and may cause great harm.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist and the Judicial Conference soundly rejected \nthis approach months ago. The Judicial Conference found that shifting \nY2K cases from state courts ``holds the potential for overwhelming the \nfederal courts, resulting in substantial costs and delays.'' I wonder \nwho pays for that. I bet it is us.\n  In addition, the Judicial Conference concluded ``the proposed Y2K \namendments are inconsistent with the objective of preserving the \nfederal courts as tribunals of limited jurisdiction.''\n  These views are shared by the state court judges, as reflected in the \nposition of the Conference of Chief Justices. They note that these Y2K \nbills ``pose a direct challenge to the principles of federalism \nunderlying our system of government.'' They describe these bills as \n``radically'' altering the complementary role of the state and federal \ncourts. The Chief Justices of our state courts remind us: ``The \nfounding fathers created our federal system for a reason that Congress \nshould be extremely reticent to overturn.''\n  I thought the Administration had also rejected this approach.\n  Mr. President, I suspect that the sweeping federal procedural and \nsubstantive changes to state law in this conference report will not \npass constitutional muster when challenged. The conference report does \nnot create a federal cause of action for Y2K lawsuits. Instead, the \nbill forces federal rules and liability protections on state-based \nclaims and procedures. This will result in the dismissal of claims that \nmight otherwise succeed under state law and clearly usurps the ability \nof state legislatures to make and enforce the laws for their citizens.\n  The conference report is an arrogant dismissal of the basic \nconstitutional principle of federalism. Given the Supreme Court's \nrecent rulings on the power of the States in relation to the Congress \nunder our Constitution, I predict the Supreme Court will strike down \nthis new law as unconstitutional.\n  We in Congress should not be tramping on the rights of the States to \nset the legal procedures for their courts and define the legal rights \nfor their citizens.\n  On May 1, 1999, Assistant Attorney General Eleanor Acheson outlined \nthe Department of Justice's views on this legislation. The Department \nof Justice concluded that: ``Because the McCain-Wyden-Dodd proposal \nmodifies tort and contract law so as to reduce the liability of \npotential Y2K defendants, it reduces the incentive for potential \ndefendants to avert Y2K failures. In a similar fashion, we do not \nbelieve that modifying the rules of liability that apply to meritorious \ntort and contract actions will deter frivolous Y2K claims, which by \ndefinition will be filed regardless of the rules of liability. Instead, \nthe modification in the McCain-Wyden-Dodd bill seem more likely to \ncurtail legitimate Y2K lawsuits.''\n  I agreed with the Department of Justice on May 1, 1999, when this \nletter\n\n[[Page S8021]]\n\nwas written, and I agree with this letter today. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the full text of the Department of Justice's \nviews as of May 1, 1999, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. This conference report is telling the business community: \nDon't worry, be happy when it comes to Y2K remediation; don't worry \nabout fixing the problem, don't worry about trying to protect the \nconsumers, because the Senate and the House are going to protect you; \nall you have to worry about is yourself, not those who buy your \nproducts.\n  If they take that attitude using this bill as a shield, it only makes \nY2K computer problems worse next year instead of fixing them this year. \nThe best defense against any Y2K lawsuit is to be Y2K compliant in \n1999, not waiting for a problem to happen and in the year 2000 say: Oh, \nwait a minute, they took care of us in the Congress; too bad, we're \nhome free.\n  That is why I hosted a Y2K conference in Vermont to help small \nbusinesses prepare for 2000. That is why I taped a Y2K public service \nannouncement in my home state. That is why I cosponsored Senator Bond \nand Senator Kerry's new law, the ``Small Business Year 2000 Readiness \nAct,'' to create SBA loans for small businesses to eliminate their Y2K \ncomputer problems now. That is why I introduced, with Senator Dodd as \nthe lead cosponsor, the ``Small Business Y2K Compliance Act,'' S. 962, \nto offer new tax incentives for purchasing Y2K compliant hardware and \nsoftware.\n  These real measures will avoid future Y2K lawsuits by encouraging Y2K \ncompliance now.\n  Last year, I joined with Senator Hatch to pass into law a consensus \nbill known as ``The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure \nAct.'' We worked on a bipartisan basis with Senator Bennett, Senator \nDodd, the Administration, industry representatives and others to reach \nagreement on a bill to facilitate information sharing to encourage Y2K \ncompliance.\n  The new law, enacted less than nine months ago, is working to \nencourage companies to work together and share Y2K solutions and test \nresults. It promotes company-to-company information sharing while not \nlimiting rights of consumers. That is the model we should use to enact \nbalanced and narrow legislation to deter frivolous Y2K litigation while \nencouraging responsible Y2K compliance.\n  Unlike last year's Y2K information sharing law, this conference \nreport is not narrow or balanced. Instead it is an justified wish list \nfor special interests that are or might become involved in Y2K \nlitigation.\n  The coming of the millennium should not be an excuse for cutting off \nthe rights of those who will be harmed. It should not be an excuse for \nturning our States' civil justice system upside down. It should not be \nan excuse for immunizing those who recklessly disregard the coming \nproblem to the detriment of American consumers.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                 Office of Policy Development,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 1999.\n     Hon. Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     President, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to clarify the Justice \n     Department's views on the McCain-Wyden bill, S. 96, as \n     amended by Senator Dodd's April 28 proposal. We appreciate \n     the efforts of Senator Dodd to improve S. 96. Nevertheless, \n     Senator Dodd's amendments do not cure many of the defects \n     that prompted the Department to oppose S. 96, and the \n     Department continues to oppose the bill, even with Senator \n     Dodd's amendments. The Department, however, understands that \n     Senators Kerry and Robb are working on an amendment in the \n     nature of a substitute that addresses our primary concerns \n     and which we can support.\n       The Administration has, all along, advocated Y2K \n     legislation as long is it serves three important goals: (i) \n     giving companies every incentive to become Y2K compliant; \n     (ii) encouraging resolution of Y2K problems without resort to \n     litigation; and (iii) deterring frivolous Y2K lawsuits \n     without deterring legitimate Y2K claims. We are convinced, \n     however, that the McCain-Wyden-Dodd bill does not achieve \n     these goals. In fact, that bill may significantly undermine \n     two of them. Because the McCain-Wyden-Dodd proposal modifies \n     tort and contract law so as to reduce the liability of \n     potential Y2K defendants, it reduces the incentive for \n     potential defendants to avert Y2K failures. In a similar \n     fashion, we do not believe that modifying the rules of \n     liability that apply to meritorious tort and contract actions \n     will deter frivolous Y2K claims, which by definition will be \n     filed regardless of the rules of liability. Instead, the \n     modifications in this McCain-Wyden-Dodd bill seem more likely \n     to curtail legitimate Y2K lawsuits.\n       I will now outline briefly some of the Department's major \n     concerns with the McCain-Wyden-Dodd version of S. 96.\n\n\n                            coverage issues\n\n       The McCain-Wyden-Dodd proposal would apply to Y2K lawsuits \n     brought by consumers and to private securities actions. \n     McCain-Wyden-Dodd contains a number of provisions that make \n     it more difficult for plaintiffs to assert and recover on \n     their Y2K claims--they must provide more extensive notice to \n     all defendants, satisfy higher pleading requirements, and may \n     even then be denied their economic losses and punitive \n     damages. Although these restrictions may be appropriate as \n     applied to businesses with greater financial and other \n     resources, imposing these heavier burdens is likely to erect \n     insuperable obstacles for plaintiffs who are consumers.\n       The McCain-Wyden-Dodd proposal also applies to private \n     securities actions, even though such actions are already \n     governed by the comprehensive provisions of the Private \n     Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities \n     Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998. Considerable time \n     and effort was spent in designing those two laws as a means \n     of barring meritless claims but allowing the filing of \n     legitimate claims. In the absence of any evidence that this \n     legislation was ineffective at achieving these purposes, \n     there would appear to be no need to upset the careful balance \n     it achieved by applying the sweeping reforms of McCain-Wyden-\n     Dodd to litigation already covered by that prior legislation.\n\n\n                        class action provisions\n\n       The McCain-Wyden-Dodd proposal creates federal jurisdiction \n     over any Y2K class action where more than one million dollars \n     is at issue. With this low threshold, this proposal allows \n     most Y2K class actions brought in state court, even those \n     based solely on state law, to be moved to federal court, \n     where they would be analyzed under federal standards. Class \n     action claims that could have been brought under state law \n     would have to be dismissed unless they also satisfy those \n     federal standards. Not only would this result in the \n     dismissal of claims that might have succeeded under state \n     law, but it would also usurp the ability of state \n     legislatures to define the relief available to their \n     citizens.\n\n\n        provisions modifying state tort law affecting y2k claims\n\n       The McCain-Wyden-Dodd proposal substantially rewrites state \n     tort law as applied to Y2K claims. Section 13, for example, \n     freezes in time many aspects of the state law governing \n     resolution of Y2K tort claims as it existed on January 1, \n     1999, thereby preventing the States from enacting any reforms \n     to their tort law, even reforms that apply generally to all \n     tort claims. Other sections of McCain-Wyden-Dodd \n     significantly curtail the damages Y2K plaintiffs may recover \n     for their injuries. Most dramatically, section 12 bars \n     recovery of economic losses in all tort suits not involving \n     personal injury or property damage, including fraud and \n     misrepresentation suits where the only damages are economic \n     losses. This is not simply a codification of existing state \n     law rules; section 12 establishes a new--and much broader--\n     restriction for the recovery of these damages. Finally, \n     section 5 of McCain-Wyden-Dodd usurps state law regarding \n     recovery of damages with a rule of proportionate liability \n     for all Y2K defendants, no matter how much they might have \n     contributed to the plaintiff's injuries.\n       Because of the concerns I have outlined, the Department \n     remains opposed to S. 96, even as modified by Senator Dodd's \n     proposed amendments.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised us that \n     from the perspective of the Administration's program, there \n     is no objection to the submission of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Eleanor D. Acheson,\n\n                                       Assistant Attorney General,\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield sufficient time as may be \nnecessary under the time I am allotted under the agreement.\n  Mr. President, a notable author once stated that ``decades \nsurrounding a new millennium are periods of severe disruptions and \ncultural transformations.'' In the context of American politics, it \nappears that this prophecy is coming to fruition even before the 21st \ncentury officially arrives.\n  From the manner in which this legislation has been considered, and \nunfortunately, from its ultimate passage, it appears that this country \nis embarking upon a serious transformation of America's \nconstitutionalism.\n  For 200 years, we have honored a system of federalism that recognized \nthe appropriate balance between States\n\n[[Page S8022]]\n\nand the Federal Government concerning the administration of civil law. \nCivil disputes unrelated to constitutional claims were considered to be \nreserved to the states and local citizens. But this cherished notion of \nstates' rights no longer seems to be the case. Now, upon the idea of \npromoting industrialism, and more specifically, the so-called growth of \ntechnology, it appears that federalism, as well as the constitutional \nrights of American citizens, are becoming not only dishonored, but for \nsale to the highest bidder.\n  There are some who will support this legislation today upon the \ngrounds that this is a bill limited in scope. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. This legislation includes some of the broadest \nlimitations ever imposed on consumers' civil remedies, including severe \nrestrictions on the recovery of economic losses and the ability to \npursue class action suits.\n  The majority's claims about the recovery of economic losses greatly \nexceed the degree to which economic losses will be recoverable under \nthe bill. In reality, the legislation will forbid the recovery of \neconomic losses in almost every situation.\n  The conference majority contends that the class action provision has \nbeen made more pro-plaintiff because of the change made to the monetary \nrequirement--from $1 million to $10 million--and the change made to the \nclass size requirement, which is now 100 members. However, the \nconference majority failed to highlight the decision by the conference \ncommittee to add a provision that allows any class action suit to be \nremoved to federal court in the event the suit includes a claim for \npunitive damages. The addition of this provision has expanded the \nfederalization of class actions suits well beyond the provision in the \noriginal bill.\n  The conference report states that my provision on consumer credit \nprotection has been revised to reflect the true intent of the \nprovision, which was to prevent consumers from losing their mortgages \nbecause of Y2K failures. However, the purpose of the provision was not \nto singularly protect mortgages, but to protect consumers against \nadverse actions in relation to all debt-related transactions, including \nautomobile loans and credit card obligations.\n  I know that many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle will vote \nfor final passage because of the President's decision to sign this \nbill. I am most disappointed in the President's decision. When the \nPresident announced and carried out his veto of the products liability \nbill three years ago, I applauded. He states then that there was no \njustification for broad restrictions on punitive damages, joint and \nseveral liability, and broad preemption of State law. He reiterated \nthose concerns in several statements on this bill. Yet, he announces \nhis intention to sign the bill. In fact, his staff says he'll sign the \nlegislation, even though it doesn't reflect the actual agreement \nbetween the White House and conference members.\n  I assure my colleagues that if we remain on this course, the \nconstitutional and moral soul of this Nation will soon perish. This \nideology of short term gain, and success at all costs, will surely work \nto our detriment. Consideration of this bill reminds me of a quote by \nHorace Rumpole, when he said:\n\n       We went to all that trouble with King John to get trial by \n     our peers, and now a lot of lawyers with the minds of \n     business consultants want to abolish juries.\n\n  Mr. President, when I hear the expression by my distinguished \nchairman about a victory for the Nation and such nonsense from the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon about the consumers not getting the \nshaft--that is exactly what they are getting. That is exactly what is \nhappening.\n  We tried our best to protect the consumers. You name the consumer \norganization in America--Public Citizen, Consumers Union--they are all \nstill opposed to this conference report.\n  I stand here with a letter which the American Bar Association \nrecently wrote:\n\n       The American Bar Association opposes enactment of H.R. 775 \n     in either the form that passed the Senate on June 15, 1999 or \n     the form that passed the House of Representatives on May 12, \n     1999. . .The American Bar Association believes that the \n     rights of the States should not be trampled in the rush to \n     enact legislation to address concerns about Y2K. \n     Traditionally, legal principles governing both tort and \n     contract action have been the province of the States, not the \n     Federal Government. The legal issues likely to be presented \n     by the Year 2000 problem are not unique.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter from the American Bar Association \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         American Bar Association,\n\n\n                                  Governmental Affairs Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 1999.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Majority Leader of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: We understand that the \n     Administration and key members of Congress are continuing to \n     try to resolve differences with respect to H.R. 775, Y2K \n     liability legislation. Last Friday, the ABA's Board of \n     Governors met in Boston and adopted policy regarding the \n     pending legislation. I am writing to you to express the \n     American Bar Association's views on this legislation.\n       The American Bar Association opposes enactment of H.R. 775 \n     in either the form that passed the Senate on June 15, 1999, \n     or the form that passed the House of Representatives on May \n     12, 1999. The ABA is supportive of efforts to impose a \n     reasonable waiting period before a lawsuit could be brought \n     and encouraging potential litigants to utilize alternative \n     dispute resolution methods during this period. The ABA is \n     also supportive of encouraging the disclosure of known Y2K \n     defects and of encouraging businesses, with appropriate \n     antitrust relief, to cooperate in the development and \n     implementation of remediation of Y2K defects. However, the \n     ABA strongly opposes provisions in the versions of the \n     legislation that passed both in the House and in the Senate \n     that would: (1) provide for federal standards regarding the \n     award of punitive damages; (2) limit the extent of \n     defendants' liability to their proportional share of damages; \n     (3) limit the liability of officers and directors in Y2K \n     proceedings; (4) allow for removal of almost all Y2K class \n     actions to federal court; and (5) preempt the state laws to \n     place a federal cap on punitive damages. The ABA also opposes \n     the fee-shifting provisions of section 508 of H.R. 775, as \n     passed by the House.\n       The ABA believes that the rights of the states should not \n     be trampled in the rush to enact legislation to address \n     concerns about Y2K. Traditionally, legal principles governing \n     both tort and contract actions have been the province of the \n     states, not the federal government. The legal issues likely \n     to be presented by the Year 2000 problem are not unique. \n     Except for some regulatory action undertaken by federal \n     and state agencies, there is little in the nature of \n     special Y2K law. Disputes arising from Year 2000 computer \n     failures likely will involve garden-variety claims of \n     misrepresentation, fraud, breach of contract, insurance \n     coverage and the like. There is no reason to believe that \n     the legal standards and procedures applicable to non-Y2K-\n     related tort, contract and class action claims are not \n     appropriate for resolution of lawsuits involving the Year \n     2000 issue.\n       The ABA believes that it is doubtful that H.R. 775, as \n     passed by either House, would encourage more or better Year \n     2000 remediation, or more or better disclosure about Year \n     2000 readiness. In fact, we believe that the opposite result \n     is the more likely. Many businesses are inspired to undertake \n     their Year 2000 remediation projects with a higher degree of \n     diligence precisely because of potential legal liability. \n     Legislation changing the standards of liability breeds \n     uncertainty, and prudent business people frequently opt not \n     to spend money in the face of uncertain returns. Where the \n     relevant law of the jurisdictions in which businesses now \n     operate is fairly certain, any new federal law will only \n     muddy the waters. In light of the almost certain \n     constitutional challenges and the necessity of litigation to \n     interpret a new law in the various states, the efficacy of \n     any new legislation will also be minimal at best.\n       From the perspective of directors and officers insurance \n     issues, a Y2K safe harbor could put the directors and \n     officers in a Catch-22 situation. Year 2000 compliance is \n     expensive. Compliance obligations must be weighed, like any \n     other business decision, against the costs and the \n     liabilities of non-compliance. If the penalties associated \n     with Year 2000 are removed, it is plausible the directors' \n     and officers' decision-making pendulum would swing the other \n     way--toward maximizing corporate short term profits.\n       Moreover, proposed legislation has the potential to \n     penalize organizations that have been the most diligent in \n     their Year 2000 preparations. Many companies have spent \n     millions of dollars in this endeavor. More significantly, \n     many started early, and have virtually completed their \n     projects, performing innumerable tests and drills. Some are \n     helping their customers and other members of the business \n     community by sharing the knowledge they have learned. These \n     efforts should be encouraged. However, by raising the bar for \n     bringing and sustaining legal action, Congress may be \n     penalizing those companies who through their own foresight \n     spent their resources to adequately\n\n[[Page S8023]]\n\n     deal with Year 2000 issues. Those who choose not to spend \n     sufficient resources could have a competitive advantage. In \n     short, whatever benefits the proposed legislation may have \n     are likely to be too little, too late and to reward the wrong \n     people.\n       The fee-shifting provisions of Section 508 of H.R. 775, as \n     passed the House, would preempt federal, state and local \n     statutes and court rules to apply a modified ``losers pay'' \n     or fee-shifting court rule with respect to any Year 2000 \n     claim for money or property. They would require that if \n     either side rejected a settlement offer prior to trial and \n     did less well at trial than the offer, that party would be \n     responsible for the attorney's fees and costs of the other \n     party from the date on which the last offer was made by the \n     adverse party.\n       Section 508 would force parties either to accept a \n     settlement offer or run the risk of incurring the fees of the \n     other side. This would encourage ``low-ball'' settlement \n     offers by the defendant rather than a realistic appraisal of \n     the value of the case. Only the wealthy claimant would be \n     able to run the risk of incurring such fees; in particular, \n     the middle-class claimant who has some assets to lose would \n     be in the greatest jeopardy. In a clear case of liability, \n     the advantage might be partially alleviated by a counter \n     offer or demand. But in all cases, the risk of litigation \n     would be greater for someone who believes their claim or \n     defense is just.\n       The American Bar Association does not endorse court rules \n     or statutes that provide for fee-shifting based upon \n     rejection of settlement offers. Such proposals would deter \n     those who lack the financial wherewithal to absorb not only \n     their own legal fees but also those of their adversaries from \n     filing meritorious claims or defending meritorious positions. \n     They favor the litigant with financial muscle, provide a \n     disincentive to all claimants with limited financial means \n     and encourage settlement by gamesmanship rather than \n     encouraging realistic appraisals. Ultimately they erode our \n     country's concept of equal justice under the law.\n       Although the ABA does not support court rules or statutes \n     that provide for fee-shifting based on rejection of \n     settlement offers, it adopted policy in February 1996 \n     suggesting that if such a statute or rule is being \n     contemplated, certain safeguards outlined in an ``offer of \n     judgment procedure'' be incorporated in such a statute or \n     rule. We would be happy to provide you with a copy of this \n     offer of judgment procedure should you wish to review it and \n     to answer any questions you may have about the ABA policy on \n     this matter.\n       Please let me know if I can provide you with additional \n     information or otherwise be of assistance to you on this \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert D. Evans.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No Governor, no Attorney General, no State legal group \nsupports this legislation. On the contrary, there is a letter here from \nthe Conference of Chief Justices of the several States in opposition to \nthis measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Conference of Chief Justices, Office of Government \n           Relations, National Center for State Courts,\n                                      Arlington, VA, May 25, 1999.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I am writing on behalf of the \n     Conference of Chief Justices (CCJ), to express our concern \n     with S. 96 and H.R. 775 in their present form. We understand \n     that S. 96 and H.R. 775 are attempts to address the serious \n     problem of potential litigation surrounding the Y2K issue. \n     However, in part, the bills pose a direct challenge to the \n     principles of federalism underlying our system of government. \n     We are particularly concerned that each bill would in effect \n     replace established state class action procedures in favor of \n     removal to the Federal courts on most cases. The members of \n     CCJ seriously question the wisdom of such an action.\n       In this regard, CCJ agrees with the position of the U.S. \n     Judicial Conference as submitted by Judge Walter Stapleton to \n     the House Judiciary Committee on April 13, 1999. His \n     testimony points out that:\n       ``State legislatures and other rule-making bodies provide \n     rules for aggregation of state-law claims into class-wide \n     litigation in order to achieve certain litigation economies \n     of scale. By providing for class treatment, state \n     policymakers express the view that the state's own resources \n     can be best deployed not through repetitive and potentially \n     duplicative individual litigation, but through some form of \n     class treatment. H.R. 775 could deprive the state courts of \n     the power to hear much of this class litigation and might \n     well create incentives for plaintiffs who prefer a state \n     forum to bring a series of individual claims. Such individual \n     litigation might place a greater burden on the state courts \n     and thwart the states' policies of more efficient \n     disposition.\n       Federal jurisdiction over class litigation is an area where \n     change should be approached with caution and careful \n     consideration of the underlying relationship between state \n     and federal courts.''\n       We would emphasize that State courts presently handle 95 \n     percent of the nation's judicial business. State and Federal \n     courts have developed a complementary role in regard to our \n     jurisprudence and these bills would radically alter this \n     relationship. It is not enough to argue these bills affect \n     only a segment of commerce, or that resolution of the problem \n     on a state by state basis is inconvenient. It is a bad \n     precedent that could have future ramifications. The founding \n     fathers created our federal system for a reason that Congress \n     should be extremely reticent to overturn.\n       If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me \n     directly, or contact Tom Henderson or Ed O'Connell who staff \n     our Government Relations Office. They can be reached at (703) \n     841-0200.\n           Respectfully,\n\n                                               David A. Brock,\n\n                                                    Chief Justice,\n                          President, Conference of Chief Justices.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Certainly everybody wants money. I want money. You want \nmoney. Republicans want money. Democrats want money. The White House is \ngoing crazy after money. Heavens above, everybody knows everybody wants \nmoney.\n  If you think this is just a spurious comment, let's go back. Here it \nis: ``GOP Vies for Backing of High-Tech Leaders. Party Aims to Exploit \nY2K Vote. . .''\n  That is from the Washington Post, dated June 13. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n GOP Vies for Backing of High-Tech Leaders--Party Aims to Exploit Y2K \n                            Vote, CEO Summit\n\n                         (By Thomas B. Edsall)\n\n       Republicans will make an all-out bid to wrest the cash and \n     prestige of Silicon Valley from the Democratic Party this \n     week by capitalizing on a crucial Senate vote and a three-day \n     National Summit on High Technology, events that will have \n     high-tech executives lining the halls of Congress in \n     unprecedented numbers.\n       The Senate vote on a measure to protect the high-tech \n     industry from Y2K computer damage suits and the gathering of \n     the industry's corporate elite at the summit sponsored by the \n     Republican-controlled Joint Economic Committee are designed \n     to demonstrate the commitment of the GOP to the unfettered \n     market forces so beloved by the chip makers, venture \n     capitalists and software CEOs of ``the new economy,'' and to \n     reveal pointedly to high-tech leaders the influence in the \n     Democratic Party of one of their most feared adversaries, the \n     trial lawyers.\n       The trial bar has filed numerous securities suits against \n     the industry and its members are expected to unleash lawsuits \n     over the expected breakdown of computers that have not been \n     adjusted to deal with the date change on Jan. 1, 2000, \n     popularly known as the Y2K computer glitch.\n       ``This is one of the few segments of the business community \n     that hasn't reflexively gone Republican,'' said Rob Atkinson, \n     director of the Technology and New Economy Project of the \n     Democratic Progressive Policy Institute. ``Now, the \n     Republicans have started to wake up and say, `We want the \n     high-tech community to be ours.' ''\n       The high-tech industry is a significant source of political \n     money. The Center for Responsive Politics estimated that the \n     computer industry and its executives gave just under $9 \n     million to congressional candidates in 1997-98, and early in \n     the presidential nomination fights, Vice President Gore has \n     raised an estimated $75,000 from the industry, slightly more \n     than the $67,000 raised by Texas Gov. George W. Bush.\n       As, or perhaps more, important than the money, however, is \n     the partisan competition to be on the side of a driving force \n     in the national economy.\n       Rep. Thomas M. Davis III (Va.), chairman of the National \n     Republican Congressional Committee and a leader of the GOP's \n     high-tech drive, contends that high-tech executives realize \n     that such ``vestiges of the old Democratic coalition'' as \n     organized labor and the trial lawyers ``will not allow them \n     [Democrats] to support high tech.''\n       In fact, the legislative record of both parties and of the \n     Clinton administration on high-tech issues is mixed, with \n     each taking stands for and against positions supported by the \n     Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC), a group \n     praised by both sides of the aisle.\n       In Congress, the GOP has a substantial advantage in its \n     ITIC ratings. In the House, computations based on the ITIC's \n     vote analysis showed Republicans receiving an average ranking \n     of 69.7 percent, compared with the Democrats' 49.1 percent. \n     The ratings were closer in the Senate: 83.9 percent for \n     Republicans, 71.1 percent for Democrats.\n       The ratings were based on 1997-98 votes on securities \n     litigation reform, Internet taxes, temporary work visas for \n     skilled foreigners,\n\n[[Page S8024]]\n\n     ``fast-track'' trade proposals, computer export controls and \n     encryption legislation.\n       Only votes on economic and regulatory issues were \n     considered. Votes on social issues such as abortion, school \n     prayer and pornography were excluded, since those have little \n     bearing on the industry's bottom line. The libertarian \n     tradition in the hightech community makes the religious right \n     and the antiabortion movement significant liabilities for the \n     Republican Party.\n       Also, the development of sophisticated encryption and \n     faster computers has put the industry in direct conflict with \n     those seeking to restrict trade with potentially hostile \n     nations, and with law enforcement officials seeking wiretap \n     access to electronically transmitted information.\n       And the demand for technology-sophisticated workers runs \n     head-on into anti-immigration forces in both parties.\n       In terms of partisan competition, Democrats are \n     increasingly worried that the GOP's full-scale assault is \n     likely to weaken the Democratic advantages among libertarian \n     high-tech entrepreneurs.\n       Some Democrats have been stunned by the impressive \n     collection of technology company executives who have joined a \n     72-member high-tech fund-raising committee for Bush. These \n     computer industry leaders include America Online's James L. \n     Barksdale, Cisco Systems' John Chambers, Intel's Gordon \n     Moore, LSI Logic's Wilfred J. Corrigan, Applied Materials' \n     James C. Morgan and Advance Mirco Devices' W.J. Sanders III.\n       Democratic conflicts pitting plaintiffs' lawyers against \n     the technology sector will be thrust into the open when the \n     Senate votes this week on legislation limiting corporate \n     liability in Y2K damage suits, a measure backed strongly by \n     the high-tech industry but opposed by trial lawyers.\n       That vote is expected to take place Tuesday, in the middle \n     of the Joint Economic Committee's three-day summit. The \n     sessions, put together by Republican Sens. Connie Mack (Fla.) \n     and Robert F. Bennett (Utah), will provide a public forum to \n     an extraordinary array of high-tech luminaries.\n       On Monday, those scheduled to testify include IBM's Louis \n     V. Gerstner Jr., Intel's Craig R. Barrett and Federal Reserve \n     Chairman Alan Greenspan. Day two will feature Microsoft's \n     Bill Gates, Adobe Systems' John E. Warnock and Novell's Eric \n     Schmidt. Wednesday will be the turn of Sun Microsystems' \n     Scott McNealy, America Online chief technology officer Marc \n     Andreessen and eBay's Meg Whitman.\n       Democrats are worried about the timing of the hearings and \n     the Y2K vote, said Lisa Quigly, chief of staff of Rep. Calvin \n     M. Dooley (Calif.), co-chairman of the New Democrat \n     Coalition, which has strong ties to the technology sector.\n       ``We are miles ahead of them [Republicans]; they don't have \n     the relationships at all,'' Quigly said, but ``because some \n     [Democrats] are not supporting Y2K [liability legislation], \n     it looks as if Democrats are not for high tech.''\n       Democrats have made what they hope will be a preemptive \n     strike that will take the edge off the Republican challenge.\n       Last week, House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-\n     Mo.), who has not had strong ties with the high-tech \n     community, appointed a high-tech advisory committee headed by \n     two Californians whose districts are centers of high-tech \n     entrepreneurial activity: Reps. Zoe Lofgren and Anna G. \n     Eshoo.\n       The Gephardt announcement coincided with a New Democrat \n     Network-sponsored ``technology outreach'' day, which featured \n     sessions with Microsoft senior vice president Craig Mundie, \n     venture capitalist John Doerr, Dell Computer's Michael Dell \n     and Hewlett Packard's Lewis E. Platt.\n       In what may prove to be a faint hope, Simon Rosenberg, \n     executive director of the New Democrat Network, said that \n     high-tech leaders are going to see the GOP drive this week as \n     ``a very overt and clumsy attempt to catch up on high tech. \n     But this challenge of which party is going to be the one that \n     most adapts to the new realities and the new challenge is \n     going to be with us for a long time.''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Here is the same: ``Congress Chasing Campaign Donors \nEarly and Often'' about Y2K. That is from the New York Times, dated \nJune 14. I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 14, 1999]\n\n            Congress Chasing Campaign Donors Early and Often\n\n                          (By Alison Mitchell)\n\n       Washington, June 13--As campaign finance legislation \n     languishes, Congress has gone on an allout funding-raising \n     binge driven by the battle for control of the House, \n     competition for money with the Presidential campaigns and an \n     early push by incumbents to scare off challengers.\n       In a sign of just how intense the money chase has become, \n     all four Senate and House campaign committees have, for the \n     first time, created their own special programs to court and \n     cater to donors willing to give them $100,000 in each of the \n     two years of the 2000 campaign cycle.\n       Unabashed by the debate over President Clinton's use of the \n     White House to court deep-pocketed donors in 1996, the \n     committees are offering generous contributors an array of \n     incentives, like access to party leaders, special issue \n     briefings and meetings in lush locales.\n       In the case of the Democratic Congressional Campaign \n     Committee, which is led this year by Representative Patrick \n     J. Kennedy of Rhode Island, that even includes a weekend at \n     the Kennedy family compound in Hyannisport, Mass., as close \n     as it gets to a Democratic shrine.\n       ``If we're going to raise more money,'' said Edward M. \n     Kennedy of Massachusetts, ``we're going to have to do it in \n     bigger chunks.''\n       The creation of the groups is a sign of how the 2000 battle \n     for Congress is causing an escalation in the pursuit of so-\n     called soft money, the kind of unrestricted contributions \n     from wealthy individuals, corporations and labor unions that \n     the parties have used to get around the post-Watergate \n     contribution limits.\n       By law, an individual can give only $20,000 a year to the \n     party committees to use for the direct purpose of electing a \n     Federal candidate. So the bulk of these $100,000 donations \n     would be considered of soft money, which can be used for \n     activities like party building or advertisements advocating \n     issues.\n       Once such money was largely the purview of the national \n     political parties, not their Congressional arms. But last \n     year the Congressional committees became more aggressive in \n     pursuit of the money, and these programs show that they are \n     now going even further. Previously the big-donor programs on \n     Capitol Hill were tailored for the $15,000 and $25,000 \n     contributor. (The Republicans had a $100,000 ``Majority '98'' \n     program for the House and Senate elections last year, but \n     divided the proceeds among several party committees.)\n       For those trying to stanch the flow of money into politics, \n     these are bad omens.\n       ``You've ended up with an absolutely `anything goes' \n     attitude,'' said Fred Wertheimer, an advocate of legislation, \n     now stalled, that would ban soft-money contributions. He \n     called the $100,000 groups a ``qualitative expansion of soft \n     money.''\n       Representative Thomas M. Davis 3d of Virginia, the chairman \n     of the National Republican Congressional Committee, says the \n     Democrats are hypocrites for raising such donations because \n     they have rallied around the bill to ban them while \n     Republican leaders have firmly opposed it. ``The difference \n     is they profess to oppose soft money,'' Mr. Davis said.\n       The Democrats say the will not disarm until the law \n     changes.\n       ``All of us are hoping for campaign finance reform, but we \n     are also preparing for the worst'' said Senator Robert G. \n     Torricelli of New Jersey, who as chairman of the Democratic \n     Senatorial Campaign Committee is in charge of fund-raising \n     and recruiting candidates.\n       The fund-raising flurry is driven in large part by an \n     unusual political season in which not just the White House \n     but the House could change hands. A few even argue that \n     control of the Senate could be in play.\n       ``It's impossible to predict which party will control which \n     institution,'' Mr. Torricelli said.\n       The House and Senate committees are also pushing to raise \n     money before they have to go into head-on competition with \n     the Presidential race. And they want to show the kind of \n     high-dollar strength that gives an air of victory and draws \n     more donors. The committees are just as zealous in pursuit of \n     the traditional donations for Federal campaigns as they are \n     in seeking soft money.\n       ``The stakes are high, whatever the outcome,'' said Gary J. \n     Andres, a lobbyist who is working closely with the National \n     Republican Congressional Committee to advise endangered \n     Republicans and help them raise money. ``So I think you're \n     going to see an expanded effort on both sides of the aisle.''\n       The fund-raising is particularly aggressive in the House, \n     where a shift of just six seats in the next election could \n     return the Democrats to the majority. Congressional leaders \n     say the narrowness of the Republican majority is not only \n     attracting more money for each party, it is causing some \n     donors and interests to give to both.\n       It's a funny dynamic,'' Mr. Davis said. ``You have some \n     people scared to death the Democrats will take the House and \n     they will give you more. And there are groups that will hedge \n     their bets. If they didn't think the Democrats had a chance \n     they would probably just give to us.''\n       House Democrats are bluntly telling lobbyists and corporate \n     interests with offices along K Street here that they had best \n     take out some insurance should the Democrats take back the \n     House.\n       Representative Kennedy said that Democrats in this cycle \n     would be ``expecting much more from those who haven't \n     traditionally been supporters of us but have been giving \n     large contributions to our opponents and can't be expected to \n     not at least meet us halfway.'' He said, ``They need to \n     balance out the sheets a little bit.''\n       Through the first quarter of 1999, the House Democrats' \n     campaign committee took in a record $6.8 million. By the end \n     of this month, Democratic officials say they might reach \n     about $14 million--what it took House Democrats the entire \n     year to raise in 1997, the last comparable nonelection year. \n     In three separate events last week, President Clinton, Vice \n     President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton all appeared at \n     fund-raisers for House Democrats.\n       The House Republicans' campaign committee will be posting \n     its first contribution\n\n[[Page S8025]]\n\n     figures at the end of this month. But the Republicans say \n     they beat the Democrats in the first quarter in traditional \n     donations by 2 to 1, raising over $7 million, and also topped \n     the Democrats in soft money. On June 23, Republicans expect \n     to raise more than $7 million at a gala for both the House \n     and Senate.\n       The Republicans traditionally bring in far more money than \n     the Democrats.\n       The fund-raising drive is equally intense for individual \n     candidates. Particularly in the House, any incumbent who \n     could face a competitive race in 2000 is working overtime to \n     raise as much money as possible by June 30, the next filing \n     deadline for the Federal Election Commission. Almost every \n     night there is at least one fund-raiser somewhere in the \n     vicinity of Capitol Hill.\n       The election commission reports are used by political \n     strategists and donors to judge the potential strength of \n     candidates. And in many cases the size of these bank accounts \n     can draw in more donors--or scare them away from a \n     competitor, helping determine whether a strong challenger \n     should jump into a race.\n       House Republicans are pushing incumbents who already face \n     significant challengers or who drew less than 55 percent of \n     the vote in 1998. The goal is to try to have $200,000 in each \n     of their campaign accounts by the end of the month.\n       Mr. Davis of Virginia says he knows the importance of the \n     June 30 filing deadline. When he was trying to decide whether \n     to challenge the incumbent Democrat, Leslie Byrne, in 1994, \n     he looked at her campaign bank account. ``She had only 25 \n     grand in the bank and I said, `Maybe I can do this,' '' he \n     said. ``If she had had $250,000 in the bank, I guarantee I \n     wouldn't have run.''\n       House Democrats are trying to make sure that all their \n     freshmen in seats that may not be safe have about $150,000 in \n     their accounts by the end of the month. ``It's a real focused \n     and intense effort,'' said David Plouffe, the executive \n     director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n       In some cases the House Democrats say they have challengers \n     lined up and are helping them, too.\n       Patrick Casey, who lost by a whisker to Representative \n     Donald L. Sherwood of Pennsylvania in one of the closest \n     House races of 1998, traveled to Washington last Wednesday \n     for a fund-raiser where Representative Richard A. Gephardt or \n     Missouri, the minority leader, helped him raise $50,000.\n       Congressional leaders have also joined the sweepstakes. \n     Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, for example, is now spending \n     Mondays, Fridays and weekends raising money for House \n     members, hopscotching the country.\n       He plans to take a four-day tour of California later this \n     month to try to raise $2 million at 16 events, most of it for \n     House candidates. His aides say he has raised $5 million this \n     year for candidates and the party.\n       Mr. Gephardt, who would supplant Mr. Hastert as Speaker if \n     the Democrats were to win back the House majority, is also on \n     the circuit. Last week he helped raise money for Mr. Casey \n     and for Representative Carolyn McCarthy of Long Island, \n     attended a Rhode Island event with Mr. Gore and flew home to \n     Missouri to appear with Mrs. Clinton. He aides say that by \n     June 30, he will have raised $4 million.\n       Representative Tom Delay of Texas, the majority whip, has \n     mobilized his entire whip organization of House members to \n     help the Republicans' 10 most vulnerable incumbents. In a \n     program he calls Romp, for Retain Our Majority Program, he \n     has asked these members to raise $3,000 each for each of the \n     10 incumbents.\n       And all the House Republican leaders have helped raise \n     money for a new group called the Republican Majority Issues \n     Committee, which is trying to raise $25 million to get out \n     the conservative vote in critical Congressional districts.\n       The Democrats have called for an investigation of the group \n     because it is not registered with the Federal Election \n     Commission as a campaign organization or disclosing its \n     donors.\n       Karl Gallant, an ally of Mr. DeLay, who is forming the \n     group, said it was not required to register because it would \n     not be endorsing candidates. ``We are not giving money to \n     candidates,'' Mr. Gallant said. ``We are going to be an \n     independent committee that will educate voters on where \n     candidates stand on conservative issues.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You think it is not timely on money? Here at 2 o'clock \nthis afternoon an article was printed regarding Governor Bush. I guess \nhave to be more respectful. He is liable to be President. It reads, \nGovernor Bush--``At a breakfast this morning Bush gets big support from \nSilicon Valley.'' He got all the executives out there. He just pledges \nall these things, I am telling you right now, way better than the \ndistinguished chairman. And the distinguished chairman is pretty good.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Bush Gets Big Support From Silicon Valley\n\n               (By Alan Elsner, Political Correspondent)\n\n       Palo Alto, CA (Reuters)--Republican presidential front-\n     runner George W. Bush's money-raising juggernaut roared \n     through Silicon Valley Thursday, drawing support from a \n     stellar list of high-tech industry titans.\n       Bush, the governor of Texas, has smashed all previous \n     records by raising more than $36.3 million in the first half \n     of the year. He began the second half with a fund-raising \n     breakfast that had been expected to bring in an additional \n     $300,000 but seemed likely to far exceed that estimate.\n       ``This is not my first trip to this incredible land called \n     Silicon Valley. This is my first trip as president of the \n     United States,'' an elated Bush said, before quickly \n     correcting himself to say, ``As soon-to-be president of the \n     United States.''\n       Among the executives there to greet him were Cisco Systems \n     chief executive John Chambers, Microsoft executive vice \n     president Robert Herbold, Oracle Corp. (Nasdaq: ORCL--news) \n     president and CEO Ray Alen, Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC--news) \n     chairman Gordon Moore, eBay president and CEO Meg Whitman, \n     Hewlett Packard president Lew Platt and Charles Schwab, \n     chairman and CEO of the stockbroker company that bears his \n     name.\n       It was a highly impressive turnout from a region that Vice \n     President Al Gore, who may be Bush's Democratic presidential \n     opponent in next year's election, has been courting for \n     years. But Bush had already raised more money from Silicon \n     Valley than Gore in the first three months of this year.\n       Executives said they were attracted by Bush's program of \n     supporting innovation, breaking down trade barriers and \n     removing government regulation.\n       ``The governor has strong support from the high-tech \n     industry that is driven by ingenuity, innovation and the free \n     enterprise system. It's great to have a candidate focused on \n     those fundamentals,'' said Herbold.\n       Lane added: ``This industry needs support from government \n     to continue growing and the Republicans and Bush have been \n     more supportive of business aspects of building this \n     industry.''\n       Bush, who leads the field for the Republican presidential \n     nomination by a wide margin and has a 10 to 20 percentage \n     point advantage over Gore in recent polls, said the \n     attendance of so many prominent executives at his fund-raiser \n     sent an important message that would be noted all across the \n     country.\n       In his speech, Bush pledged to ``take the side of \n     innovation over litigation every single time'' and put \n     forward a number of general ideas of what he might do as \n     president.\n       He said he would reduce the threat of massive litigation \n     arising from the Year 2000 computer bug known as Y2K. He gave \n     grudging praise to President Clinton, who this week struck a \n     compromise with Congress to limit liability awards.\n       Bush has promised to fight for meaningful tort reform to \n     limit lawsuits against business, a favorite Republican theme. \n     He also proposed making the Internet a duty and tariff-free \n     zone worldwide and promised to combat theft of U.S. \n     intellectual property.\n       Bush said he would loosen regulations limiting the export \n     of civilian computer technology while still protecting \n     militarily sensitive technology.\n       He also proposed a permanent tax credit for research and \n     development. Currently, the credit, worth about $2.5 billion, \n     needs to be renewed annually by Congress.\n       Bush's unprecedented fund-raising prowess has led some \n     commentators to predict the race for the Republican \n     presidential nomination is virtually over before it has \n     begun. Only publisher Steve Forbes, who can draw on a vast \n     personal fortune, will be able to come close to matching \n     Bush's financial resources.\n       Of the other Republicans, Arizona Sen. John McCain has a \n     war chest of $6.1 million and the rest of the field is under \n     $3.5 million. Bush also outpaced Gore in fund raising by two-\n     to-one.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. So the record is made with respect to money. \nOrdinarily, we have the rule--I want to be within the Senate rules of \nthe dignity of the body. But we have to get to the reality. No one is \nasking for this except those in the money chase. And, yes, it is \nbipartisan. There isn't any question about that.\n  But this is a shabby performance. It is a sad day in the history of \nthe Senate. Now what really occurred when we went into that conference \nis that the House receded to the Senate except for a minor amendment. \nWe voted on it. Then they started negotiating on the fix, so as to \nensure everybody was on board. They knew they were going to get a bill. \nThe Senator from Connecticut then made the call to the President after \nmidnight. I thought the only person who could get the President after \nmidnight was Monica.\n  The White House sent five veto letters. Yet, the President plans to \nsign the bill, notwithstanding.\n  How emblematic of this administration. We fought like tigers to get \nthis economy going with the 1993 budget. We cut spending. We raised \ntaxes. We did away with 300,000 Federal employees. We got the economy \ngoing even though we could not get a single vote on the other side.\n\n[[Page S8026]]\n\n  Then later, of course, the President joined the other side, went down \nand threw all of his friends in Congress overboard saying we taxed them \ntoo much. Then we had GATT. Then we had the NAFTA with Mexico, and he \nthrew his labor friends overboard. Of course, that has been an \nabomination.\n  You cannot get to reality. They said it was going to increase trade. \nWe went from a $5 billion-plus to a $20 billion-minus deficit. That was \ngoing to pay the Mexican worker better. He is taking home 20 percent \nless pay. It was going to solve the immigration problem. It is worse. \nIt was going to solve the drug problem. They have a narcodemocracy down \nthere.\n  But the President threw that crowd overboard. Now he throws overboard \nthe consumers, middle America, after five veto messages on a much worse \nbill.\n  The Senator from Vermont is right on target. There isn't any \nquestion, when they put out this sheet here--even from my side--in the \npolicy committee meeting there at lunch: How the conference report \nimproves on the Senate-passed bill proportionate liability, even though \nthey rejected Senator Kerry's proposal to place the burden on the \ndefendant. They put the burden on the plaintiff. Individual consumers \nsupposedly are carved out of proportionate liability, that is if they \nare not part of a class.\n  If by chance they are part of a class, their suit is automatically \nremovable to federal court, in the event the claim seeks punitive \ndamages. The President said he would never federalize class actions. \nThey claim the bill preserves the authority of states to void \ncontracts. But I can list a number of contracts that would be illegal \nunder State law but would be enforceable under the conference-reported \nbill. So contracts which were entered into on a fraudulent or \nunconstitutional basis would still be enforced.\n  I will never forget the distinguished Senator from North Carolina; he \ntried to instruct the Senator from Oregon on economic damages.\n  I will give you the case. The client comes in. I am an old-time \nlawyer, and I represent clients. You have to tell them the truth. The \npoor client comes in and says: Hollings, I've got a $10,000 computer I \nbought last year, and now it's after January the first, and it has \ncrashed. It is not Y2K compliant. They told me it was going to last for \n10 years. I want you to bring my case.\n  I said: Wait a minute. They have to understand you have 90 days to \nwait around even though there is no duty to fix. The Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, offered an amendment to require a free fix--\nthat was in response to the Senator from Oregon's lament about fix the \nproblem, fix the problem, just fix the problem. Well, that is exactly \nwhat were attempting to do. We said: Let's get rid of the lawyers. We \nwill fix the problem. Yet, they would not accept that in the conference \nreport.\n  So I say to the prospective client: In that 90 days nothing is going \nto happen. Then I have to investigate in great detail because on \nproportionate liability I do not want to find that the parquet from \nHewlett-Packard was made in India and thus discover that I should have \ngone to New Delhi instead of Hartford to bring this case. I have to \nthen file the pleadings. I have to thereupon get in with the \ninterrogatories, attend all the discoveries because that is the \nbillable-hour crowd.\n  You do not have money for billable hours obviously. This is middle \nAmerica. That is how they get their day in court. So I will attend the \ninterrogatories. I will conduct the trial, and I will handle the \nappeal.\n  By that time, you will owe me over $10,000. Now do you really want me \nto bring this case, considering you can't get any economic loss? I know \nyou said you had to let two of your employees go because you could not \npay them during all this time that it has been down. I know you have a \nloss of business. I know you have lost your reputation and everything \nelse of that kind. But there is no economic loss.\n  The distinguished Senator from North Carolina is the best in the \nbusiness. He will elaborate on that particular point. But that, more or \nless, gets rid of the lawyers. There never has been anything really for \nY2K cases for attorneys. But to come in here now and say it does that, \nit is just shocking that we have just done away with middle America. \nThe civil justice system has been permanently damaged. The very system \nthat supports our Democratic society and consumers. That is why I stand \nhere, for the consumers of America, for middle America, for those who \ncannot employ a trial attorney.\n\n  I go right to that White House and why they changed, because the best \nstory that came out was in the New York Times. I think it is dated just \nyesterday, June 30. It has this statement in here, that the Vice \nPresident, as he begins his campaign for the Presidency, was eager to \nrid himself of the ``taint'' of financial support from trial lawyers.\n  No. 1, try to get some money out of that trial lawyer crowd, hard \nmoney. It is limited to $1,000. Soft money, let's go to Silicon Valley. \nThere is Bush. He is there this morning, the Governor. This is the soft \nmoney bill. That crowd, he has $36 million. He has more than Gore, the \nVice President, the President, and Bill Bradley all put together. One \nfellow has it. He can get that money. They know where to get soft \nmoney.\n  I can't get much hard money out of that trial lawyer crowd. I want \nmore from them, I want them to know. I have publicly stated that on the \nfloor. But they don't have soft money.\n  But the ``taint'' is the one I take exception to, because I am proud \nto be associated with trial lawyers. They are in there, down in the \npits, on the front lines protecting middle America. All I hear in this \nCongress is about middle America--taxes, taxes, taxes. How about \nrights, rights, rights? They don't have the money for billable hours.\n  A crowd such as we have up here in this Washington group, all the \nlobbyists, I am glad they put that list--is that the billable hour list \nthe distinguished chairman just handed in for the record?\n  So with the billable hour list, sure, they are lazy. They don't try \ncases. They continue cases. They go to the golf course. The clock runs \nand they send the bills. But you have to produce if you are a trial \nlawyer or you don't get anything. You take on all the expenses.\n  This is a system that has worked for over 200 years at the State \nlevel. All the State authorities now are opposed to this Federal \nadulteration, but they are talking about how they are looking out for \nconsumers and a victory for America and those kind of things.\n  I am particularly shocked at my Republican chairman who has led the \nfight on campaign finance reform. I worked with him. I have a bill in \nfor a constitutional amendment to try to legalize, if you please, the \n1974 act before it was made unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of \nthe United States. In one line: The Congress of the United States is \nhereby empowered to regulate or control spending in Federal elections. \nOnce we do that, we go back to the 1974 act, do away with the soft \nmoney, everything on top of the table, and we are limited on the amount \nof money--we, candidate--we are limited on buying the office. But the \nmoney to buy the office is bad enough when the money goes so far as to \nbuy the principle. That is a shocking thing to me. If there is such a \nthing as campaign finance reform, then in the name of campaign finance \nreform, kill this conference report, because this is an abortion. There \nisn't any question in my mind. It is way worse than we have ever had in \nany particular measure.\n  I want to say one word about the software industry, because I have \nworked in the Congress over the years with that particular industry, \nbut they are learning a bad lesson now. They are learning they can buy \nanything, because they can change around State law, just them.\n  I have been up here, 32, now going on 33, years. We have never done \nthis for any special group. Here they agree something could be fixed in \n90 days. That is the provision in the bill.\n  We are giving them still--you have July, August, September, October, \nNovember, December, almost 6 months to still get it fixed, rather than \n90 days. But they come in and demand this, when they now really are \ntrying to demand everything.\n  Everybody ought to know that the Internet was started by the \nantigovernment crowd, free market, free market. After we developed the \nInternet in 1968, with Dopper, thereupon, there came, later on, in the \nmiddle of the 1980s, none other than the\n\n[[Page S8027]]\n\nbest of the best, President Reagan. He gave a voluntary restraint \nagreement to the semiconductor industry because they were going broke. \nIntel had given up one of their particular display chips, if you \nremember. They were going out of business. They hung on, and we \ninstituted Semi-Tech. When I went into the Intel plant in Dublin, \nIreland, the manager there, Mr. Frank McCabe, said: Senator, we would \nhave never had all of this if you hadn't put the $500 million in Semi-\nTech. That is government.\n  They are all talking about pork, pork, pork. I want to emphasize the \npork about which my distinguished colleague always talks. We gave them \nthat particular pork, and now they have come to town and they want \nestate tax cuts. They want the capital gains tax cut. They want to do \naway with taxing the Internet. If you buy something on Main Street, \nAmerica, you have to pay the sales tax. But if you buy it on the \nInternet, there is no tax. It is a free ride. Don't tax the Internet. \nAnd by the way, don't hold me liable. Let's legalize negligence. Let's \nlegalize fraud, with this particular bill, and then just repeal the \ntort system.\n  This is a sad day for the Senate to come here with this particular \nconference report and talk in terms of a victory for America. It is a \nreal bad setback by the White House, the leadership--not on the House \nside, I can tell you that. We have struggled over this thing. I tried \nto hold it up as much as I could, but the die has been cast.\n  I will retain at this particular point the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I don't think I know where the Senator from \nSouth Carolina stands on this issue, having listened to his eloquence. \nI disagree with him about this bill, but he is a wonderful Member of \nthe Senate and a good friend. I always enjoy being a witness to his \neloquence here on the floor of the Senate, even when I may be the \nobject of some of that eloquence, along with my capital city of \nHartford, CT.\n  Let me begin by saying I support this conference report. I commend \nthe chairman of the committee, Senator McCain, for his fine work. There \nwas a tremendous amount of pressure on him last week. There were some \nwho wanted to get this done about a week ago, with the hope there would \nbe a veto. I guess they may have seen some political mileage if the \nbill had been vetoed. That would have been a victory in the minds of \nsome. He willingly allowed us to have the weekend and the following few \ndays to try to work out differences.\n  None of us knew whether we would succeed. Frankly, we weren't very \noptimistic we could work out the differences, given a lot of the \nrhetoric associated with this bill. The fact that we were able to spend \nsome time at it and see if we couldn't find common ground, I appreciate \nvery much. I know most of the Members of this body and others do, as \nwell.\n  I also want to commend my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, who \ndid a very fine job. We worked very closely on this to try to find some \nlanguage and some provisions which would build broader support for this \nlegislation. Also, I want to recognize the efforts of a number of our \ncolleagues whose support was also instrumental in the successful \ncompletion of this conference report: Senator Gorton, Senator Hatch, \nSenator Feinstein, my colleague, Senator Lieberman, and Senator \nBennett, with whom I serve on the special committee on the Y2K issue, \nwhich was established by the majority leader and the minority leader, \nSenators Lott and Daschle, about a year and a half ago, to look at the \nissue of the Y2K problem.\n  We have had some 22 hearings in that committee, examining all aspects \nof our society--government, the private sector, nonprofits, hospitals, \ntelecommunications, transportation, utilities, financial markets--to \ndetermine to what extent this computer bug may affect people in this \ncountry and elsewhere. I think I can say with some degree of certainty \nthat we think, at this juncture, things should not be too bad. A lot of \nwork has been done at all levels in our society, from local communities \nto the States and the national government, to try to fix this problem \nso it doesn't cause the kind of disruptions that many thought could \noccur. But I can't stand here today and tell you we can say with \nabsolute certainty there won't be disruptions and problems. There will \nbe some. We just hope they aren't going to be as significant as some \nhave predicted.\n  One of the areas we were asked to look at is the potential for \nwidespread litigation, the rush to the courthouse. It is no great \nsecret in this country that we have become tremendously litigious; we \nlike suing each other. It has become a problem that has grown over the \nyears. Anybody who has been around certainly knows the statistics and \nthe numbers that tell of the rush to solve every problem by a lawsuit. \nCertainly, I will be the first to recognize, as a member of the legal \nprofession, that without an active and vibrant legal profession, a lot \nof consumer rights would be lost in this country. You need that. It \ncan't all be done by the Justice Department, the Securities and \nExchange Commission, or other agencies at the federal, State and local \nlevel. You need a vibrant private bar. That is essential.\n  But it also has to be one that is tempered. You have to recognize \ncertain fact situations as they occur and determine whether or not \nthere may be a better way of trying to resolve some of these \ndifficulties.\n  That is what this bill is really all about. I will start out by \nsaying it is a 36-month bill. This bill sunsets; every provision of \nthis bill dies after 36 months. We are not writing something in \nconcrete or marble here that is going to last in perpetuity. For 36 \nshort months, this bill will exist.\n  During that period of time, of course, we will learn whether or not \nwe are going to have as widespread a problem with this Y2K computer \nissue as some have anticipated. If we don't, then this bill really \nisn't that important. I hope that will be the case. Nothing would make \nme, as one of the coauthors of this bill, happier than to find next \nJanuary, February, and March, that all of the fears that have been \nraised by the Y2K issue turn out to be nothing more than that--fears--\nand that there would be no reason to litigate or to take 90 days to try \nto resolve the problems. If that is the case, then the bill will last \nfor 36 months, but it won't have any significance.\n  If, however, there are problems that go beyond what I think will be \nthe case, we could end up with people racing to the courthouse to \nlitigate the issues rather than trying to solve the problem. If \nbusinesses are spending money on legal fees rather than trying to spend \nmoney on technicians and others to solve the problem so that the users \nof their equipment will be made whole, then we could end up having the \nY2K problem be a lot more serious than I think it is apt to be.\n  This agreement, this conference report--even if you had no idea what \nwas in it, I think you would be safe to conclude that it is probably a \ngood one, for one basic reason: no one is fully satisfied. Everyone had \nto make concessions in this proposal.\n  It is not perfect, by any stretch of the imagination. But that should \nnot obscure the fact that it is an outstanding achievement, in my view, \narrived at in a manner that is bipartisan, bicameral, and in \ncooperation with the executive branch.\n  It is narrowly crafted to address the repercussions of an event that \nwill only happen once in history: the changing of the calendar, 183 \ndays from today, to the new millennium. We don't know, as I said, with \nprecision what the repercussions will be. We hope and trust that, for \nour citizens, they will be minimal. But we know there will be \nrepercussions, affecting virtually every facet of our lives, from \nenergy to health care, from food to telecommunications.\n\n  We will encounter problems associated with the Y2K glitch. And in \nAmerica, where there are problems, lawsuits are never far behind. The \nY2K committee, as I mentioned earlier, which I cochair with Senator \nBennett, heard hard evidence that some members of the trial bar have \nbeen gearing up for quite some time to usher in the new millennium not \nwith a celebration, but with a subpoena. By some estimates, they will \nfile claims totalling $1 trillion or more.\n  While some of these suits will have merit, many, I am fearful, will \nnot.\n\n[[Page S8028]]\n\n They will become vehicles for profit by select members of the trial \nbar, not to rectify wrongs done to consumers or to businesses.\n  Ultimately, an avalanche of frivolous lawsuits seeking to reap a \nbonanza from this Y2K problem could have a crippling effect on our \neconomy, especially on the technology-based businesses that are \ncreating the lion's share of new jobs in our Nation today.\n  This bill would slow the knee-jerk rush to the courthouse. It says to \nthose who would seek litigation as a first resort: Look before you \nleap. It focuses businesses and consumers on fixing the problems, not \nfighting over them, and getting on-line, rather than getting in line at \nthe courthouse. It encourages them to resolve differences in a \nconference room, not a courtroom.\n  This conference report is narrowly crafted to address frivolous Y2K-\nrelated litigation, and only frivolous Y2K-related litigation. Its \ncarefully circumscribed scope was acknowledged --albeit reluctantly--\nthe night before last by Mr. Mark Mandell, president of the Association \nof Trial Lawyers of America. He had this to say about the conference \nreport:\n\n       It is positive that this unique response to a unique \n     situation will be law for only three years and that the legal \n     rights of anyone who suffers a physical injury are preserved.\n\n  I commend him for the responsibility of that statement. He is the \nhead of the trial lawyers in this country. I quickly add that he is not \nendorsing this bill; he disagrees with it, but he has framed it right. \nIt is a unique answer to a unique problem that, for 36 months, we want \non the books to avoid the potential problems that can affect our \nsociety.\n  These are two important points that deserve to be restated:\n  First, as I said, this is only a 3-year bill. It works no permanent \nchanges in our legal system. Second, it completely and totally exempts \nconsumers who allege they have suffered physical injury as a result of \na Y2K failure.\n  In addition, the conference report contains several other responsible \nand modest provisions that weed out frivolous lawsuits, do no injury to \ntort law and, most important, allows America's businesses to continue \nto create jobs.\n  This bill establishes a 90-day period before a suit can be filed to \nat least create an opportunity for the parties to remedy the defects \nand avoid expensive, time-consuming litigation.\n  We are not going to guarantee the problem will get fixed in that 90 \ndays, but it will sort of call a timeout for 90 days, 3 months, to try \nto solve the problem. That is not a radical idea. It is not a radical \nidea at all to try to get people to work out their differences. That \nmay be a radical idea if your motivation is to get to the courthouse as \nfast as you can. To that crowd, it is a radical idea. But to the \nbusinesses and consumers who would like to be made whole and have the \nproblem fixed, having a cooling-off period for 90 days as we try to \nsolve this problem is not asking too much in a 3-year bill.\n  The bill also requires plaintiffs to plead with particularity about \nthe nature of the harm allegedly done to them, and the monetary amount \nof damages they are seeking as a result of that harm. That is another \n``radical'' idea--that you have to allege with some specificity what \ncaused the problem. I know that is a bad idea if you would like to sort \nof use boilerplate language and race to the courthouse. If you are a \ndefendant, you ought to know what you are charged with, what the \nplaintiff thinks you have done wrong. That ought not to be a great \nradical deviation from the norm. For 36 months, we are going to require \nthat. That ought to be permanent law, in my view, but in this bill it \nlasts only 36 months.\n  The bill also prevents plaintiffs from recovering damages that they \ncould have reasonably and foreseeably avoided. Another radical idea. To \ndiscourage plaintiffs from suing the so-called ``deep-pocket'' \ndefendants, the bill establishes a rule of proportionate liability.\n  As a general matter, it holds the defendant responsible only for the \nharm it causes, and not for the harm caused by other defendants. Again, \nwhat a radical idea that is. If you are fractionally responsible, they \nwould like you to have to pay the whole tab. Again, I appreciate their \ndesire to do so. So you shop all around, and, if you can find anybody \nwith deep pockets who may have handled the box for 5 minutes, then you \ncan get them in a court, and, boom, you can hit them for the total \namount.\n  That is what has caused as many problems as anything else--the lack \nof proportionality and balance.\n  At the same time, we don't allow that provision of proportionality to \napply across the board without exception. We make several reasonable \nexceptions in the interest of fairness.\n  Plaintiffs who sue as individuals, rather than as members of a larger \nclass, may recover jointly and severally from any defendant, even if \nthey are marginally involved, thus helping to ensure that individual \nconsumers will fully recover damages.\n  The bill contains other provisions to ensure that irresponsible, \nreckless, or intentionally wrongful defendants are in no way shielded \nand are fully responsible for their actions. Defendants that commit \nintentional torts will be held jointly and severally liable, even if \nonly fractionally, including for economic losses.\n  In addition, defendants who knowingly make false statements about the \nY2K readiness of their goods or services may not seek mitigation of \ndamages when plaintiffs rely in good faith on such statements. That is \nyet another consumer protection contained within this conference \nreport.\n  There are still other improvements that have been made here, largely \nat the behest of the Administration--improvements, which, in my view, \nstrengthen the legislation. For instance, the class action provisions. \nMembers of a class of under 100 people, and with claims under $10 \nmillion, can stay in State court.\n  We made change after change to accommodate the concerns that were \nraised--many of them reasonable concerns, I might add--to make this a \nstronger and a better bill.\n  We are trying to avoid frivolous lawsuits for 36 months. We are \ntrying to solve the problem. I again want to thank the committee \nchairman and other colleagues who have played such an important role.\n  Lastly, I thank this President of the United States. When I saw the \nPresident--not at 1:30 in the morning, but he was in my State last \nMonday--I mentioned this bill to him in a conversation that may have \nlasted 1 minute. I said: We will have the Y2K issue up in the next day \nor so. The President said: I would like to sign a bill. I think it is \nimportant to have one. But there have to be changes in this legislation \nbefore I can sign it. If you can get those changes and work with our \nstaff, I will take a look at it.\n  That is not an unreasonable statement for an American President to \nmake on an issue like this that confronts our country in 183 days. We \nwent to work that night and worked on these changes. It was late in the \nevening.\n  When I, along with my colleague from Oregon, submitted the final \nproposal to the President of the United States, he said, to his credit: \nIf you can make one more change in this particular area, then I think I \ncould support this bill.\n  That is how this happened.\n  He is being ridiculed today because he tried to get a bill done to do \nsomething about a problem that affects, or will affect, or could \naffect, millions of people in this country. He ought not be ridiculed. \nHe ought to be commended for it. Yes, he could have caved in and gone \nalong. I know a lot of his staff and others didn't want him to sign \nthis bill. But this President went to work, and he listened to the \nproposal. He made some suggestions, and he said: If you can accommodate \nor meet me part way here on some of these ideas, then I would be \nwilling to sign this bill into law.\n\n  As a result of those efforts, he could have said to me on Monday \nafternoon: I am sorry, there isn't anything you can do with this bill; \nI am just flat out against it. That would have been the end of it, \nfrankly. I wouldn't have stayed up half the night trying to work out \ndifferences. But he said try. We did. And we reached that level of \nsupport, or a level of achievement which he thought he could support, \nand that brought us to the point of getting this legislation done.\n  Again, there is nothing perfect about it. I am fully aware that there \nmay be\n\n[[Page S8029]]\n\nsome problems with it down the road. I think this is a good effort to \ntry to minimize those difficulties, to avoid lawsuits and solve the \nproblems, and make this country stronger when it comes to the interest \nof the 21st century.\n  Let me again thank my colleagues who persisted in their efforts to \nreach this point. I also want to recognize the staff who were so \ninstrumental in bringing us to this point, particularly: Marti Albright \nand Mark Buse of the Commerce Committee; Manus Cooney and Larry Block \nof the Judiciary Committee; Jeanne Bumpus with Senator Gorton; Robert \nCresanti, Tania Calhoun, and Wilke Green of the Year 2000 Committee; \nCarol Grunberg with Senator Wyden; David Hantman with Senator \nFeinstein; Laurie Rubenstein with Senator Lieberman; and Steven Wall \nwith Senator Lott.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding, and I urge adoption of the \nconference report.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield such time as necessary to the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me say, first, that there are two very important reasons that \nthis has been an extraordinarily difficult issue for me. The first of \nthose reasons is that I have extraordinary respect for the Senator from \nArizona, the Senator from Connecticut, and the Senator from Oregon. \nThey are friends of mine. They are good Americans. They are good \npeople. They care about this country. They care about it deeply. I \ndon't question their motives for one moment. I believe they are doing \nwhat they think is right.\n  The second reason is that I began this process myself desperately \nwanting to support some kind of Y2K bill.\n  The problem with the way the debate has been conducted is that the \nfocus of my colleagues from Oregon, from Arizona, and from Connecticut \nhas been on things we all agree on. We all agree--speaking for myself--\nthat we should create incentives for computer companies to solve these \nproblems, that we should create incentives for people who buy computers \nto work with those folks to solve problems, and to mitigate whatever \ndamage or loss they may sustain.\n  We all believe there ought to be a cooling-off period. At least I \nbelieve there should be a cooling-off period. I do not think we want \nfolks rushing to the courthouse the first time a problem rears its ugly \nhead. I think we should have reasonable, thoughtful alternative dispute \nresolution.\n  I think all of those things are good things. They are laudable. They \naccomplish important goals. They are things I support and believe in. \nOn those subjects, and on the subject of preventing frivolous \nlitigation, I am totally in agreement with my colleagues who support \nthis bill.\n  The problem is, we are not focusing on the single, most fundamental \nproblem in this bill, which is that in 99 percent of the cases small \nbusinesses and consumers who suffer losses as a result of an \nirresponsible act by a computer company in respect to Y2K can recover \nnothing but the cost of their computer. They can't recover their lost \nwages. They can't recover their actual lost profit. They can't recover \ntheir overhead. If they are run out of business, they are just stuck.\n  Unfortunately, what we have here is what I am afraid happens too \noften in Washington. The little guy loses, and the big guy wins.\n  There is no question that the computer industry has a powerful voice \nin this body. The people who are going to be damaged and hurt by this \nbill don't even know it yet. They largely are completely unaware of it. \nThe small business men and women of this country and consumers in small \ntowns all over North Carolina and across the United States don't even \nknow that they are going to suffer losses, that they are going to be \nput out of business. They do not know that. My question to my colleague \nis, Who speaks for them?\n  We have heard the voices loudly, clearly, powerfully, and \narticulately for powerful, big business. There are many things I will \nsupport industry on that I believe are in the best interests of \nAmerica. The problem is, the people who are going to be injured by this \nbill, the people who are going to be put out of business, the people \nwho by all accounts--my colleagues from Oregon and Connecticut have \njust conceded--will have real and legitimate losses, who speaks for \nthem? I am afraid the answer is that no one speaks for them. They don't \ngive big money to campaigns. They don't even know what is going to \nhappen to them yet. They are out there and are innocent victims. Who is \nthe voice for the little guy in this debate?\n  These losses we have talked about--I am eliminating frivolous \nlawsuits, I am eliminating causes that ought to be resolved, things \nthat ought to be resolved by discussion between the seller and the \nbuyer, all of those things that we are all in agreement on--I am \ntalking about that little business guy or woman in Murfreesboro, NC, \nwho bought a computer believing that it was Y2K compliant, having been \ntold that it is Y2K compliant, and the computer is not Y2K \ncompliant. They lose their business. They have lost thousands and \nthousands of dollars, and they are literally out of business.\n\n  That loss--no matter what we do in this Senate, no matter what we do \nin this Congress, and, with respect, no matter what the President signs \nin the Oval Office--that loss will not go away. It will be there, and \nit will not disappear.\n  There is a fundamental concept we all have to recognize when we come \nto the well later today to vote. Those who vote for this bill have made \na conscious decision. As long as we are willing to recognize that \ndecision, I will respect the vote. That decision is this: We have made \na conscious decision that losses --which are real and legitimate, out-\nof-pocket losses suffered by small business men and women all over this \ncountry--that losses are going to be shifted. We are going to move them \nfrom the responsible party to the innocent party. In this case, the \ninnocent party is a small business; is a consumer; is somebody who \ncannot pay their employees anymore; is somebody who has no cash-flow \nbecause their manufacturing operation has been shut down because of a \nY2K problem.\n  The bottom line is this: We are making a judgment on the floor of the \nSenate that those real and legitimate losses which everyone concedes \nare going to occur--that is the ``nut'' of this. Everything else we \nagree on. I agree with my colleagues about eliminating frivolous \nlawsuits, about alternative dispute resolution, about cooling off \nperiods, about trying to do everything in our power to solve these \nproblems. The nut of this problem is, what happens to the little guy \nwho suffers a real loss?\n  When this conference report passes on the floor of the Senate later \ntonight, we have made the judgment that we will shift that loss. We are \ngoing to shift it on to the people who have no voice, who don't even \nknow they are victims. They are not sitting in our offices. They are \nnot sitting there because they don't know they have been hurt yet. We \nare going to shift the loss to them. We are going to make sure it stays \nright with them. We are going to make sure that multimillion-dollar and \nmultibillion-dollar businesses bear as little of that loss as possible. \nThat is exactly what this bill does. It is that simple.\n  For all of the rhetoric on the floor, it is not about lawyers. It is \nabout the people who make computers. It is about the people who make \ncomputer chips. It is about the people who buy computers. Those are the \nparties to this transaction.\n  The bill that came back from conference is worse than the bill that \nwent to conference. It is worse for a very simple and fundamental \nreason: It creates multiple additional roadblocks to innocent people \nwho get hurt by the Y2K problem. A job that was already extraordinarily \ndifficult, for them to recover for what happened to them, has become \nalmost impossible at this point.\n  I say with complete respect to my colleagues who have argued \nvehemently on the floor that this is a 3-year bill, that it will sunset \nin 3 years, and for that reason it is not bad, that the argument is a \nsmokescreen. Every Y2K problem that will come into existence will \nhappen during that 3-year period--99 percent. By its very nature this \nproblem will show its ugly head in\n\n[[Page S8030]]\n\nthe year 2000 or the year 2001. Essentially, we are going to cover \nevery single Y2K problem that can come into existence.\n  One bit of language that has been referred to in the bill that \nproponents claim helps improve this report over the Senate-passed \nversion has to do with the issue of recovery of economic losses such as \nlost profits, lost overhead, lost income. A phrase reads: ``A party to \na Y2K action making a tort claim other than a claim of intentional \ntort''--up until then it is fine--``arising independent of a \ncontract.''\n  I have spent the last 20 years of my life as a practicing lawyer. \nThis is what that phrase means. If a computer person walks into a small \nbusiness anywhere in this country and makes a fraudulent \nmisrepresentation, intentionally misrepresents the Y2K compliance of \ntheir product, lies, commits criminal fraud, and induces somebody to \nsign a contract on that basis, and in fact, if the contract itself \ncontains fraudulent misrepresentations, what that person can recover is \nthe cost of their computer.\n\n  They are victims of criminal fraud. I want the American people to \nhear this. They are the victims of criminal fraud. What they can get \nback is the cost of their computer.\n  This bill started with a good purpose. It is supported by Members of \nthe Senate whom I have extraordinary respect for. I absolutely have no \nquestion about their motives. They are doing what they believe is \nright. They have made beautiful cases for it on the floor of the \nSenate. My concern has been and continues to be that there is a voice \nthat is not being heard on the floor of the Senate. It is the voice of \nthe victims; it is the voice of the consumers; it is the voice of the \npeople who don't know yet that they are going to be put out of \nbusiness. It is the voice of people who don't know yet that they have \nbeen lied to or misrepresented to, been induced to sign a contract \nunder the specific language of this bill.\n  As a result of this bill, they can recover absolutely nothing but the \ncost of their computer.\n  It is wrong. It violates every concept of justice that exists in the \nUnited States and has existed for the last 200 years.\n  We can do the things that my colleagues want to do: Get rid of \nfrivolous lawsuits, induce people to solve these problems, get people \nto work together, not go into court. We can do all those things, and we \ncan accomplish those things. But we can do it without gutting the right \nof the little guy who has a real and legitimate claim and has suffered \na tremendous loss, been put out of business, without taking away that \nvery fundamental right.\n  Those people are going to be sitting in our offices. So I have one \nlast question to my colleagues: When those men and women are sitting in \nyour offices in February, March, and April of the year 2000, saying: I \nhave been put out of business, who do I go see? Who do I go see about \nthis? I am out of business. Computer people made fraudulent \nmisrepresentations in my contract. They were reckless in the way they \nmade their product. I never knew it. I am out of business.\n  They are sitting on our couch in our offices, and they look in our \neyes and say: Who do I go see about this problem? Maybe some of my \ncolleagues have an answer to that question. Unfortunately, I do not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have only been in this body for 13 years. I have never \nheard quite such a mischaracterization of legislation as the Senator \nfrom North Carolina just displayed.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the success of legislation in a matter of \nconsiderable controversy in our society is always built upon the \nfoundation of compromise. This relatively short debate on the final \npassage of H.R. 775 is a perfect example of that compromise. The \nSenator from Oregon, who was so responsible for the final form of this \nbill, listed all of the changes that he required in order to approve of \nthis legislation. The Senator from Connecticut spoke eloquently of the \nway in which he worked with the administration to change a ``no'' into \na ``yes,'' and make this legislation a reality. My very good friend, \nthe chairman of the Commerce Committee, the Senator from Arizona, spoke \nof the fact that both the original House bill and the original Senate \nbill were much more sweeping and much more decisive in dealing with \nthis Y2K problem. He deserves an extraordinary degree of our thanks and \nour admiration for working constantly and tirelessly toward a \nsuccessful conclusion, even though that conclusion is not something he \nregards as wholly satisfactory.\n  I fall on his side of that debate. I think we should have done much \nmore. I am, in fact, a radical reformer in this whole litigation field, \nwhether it is this narrow issue or the broader issue of product \nliability or medical malpractice or the questionable utility of \npunitive damages in civil litigation. I would go much further than this \nbill does. But what we have done is to bring people together to solve a \nproblem in a way that we can deem a success, all the way through to the \nsignature of the President of the United States.\n  During the last 20 years, our society and our economy may have \nchanged more dramatically than in any other similar period of history. \nWe have become a computerized information society, due to the very \ntechnological developments that resulted in a Y2K challenge. But the \nSenator from North Carolina claims to speak for the voiceless. They are \nnot voiceless. They played a major role in this debate. The coalition \nthat has wanted far stronger legislation than this does, of course, \nconsist of software and hardware companies. But it also consists of the \ngreat bulk of the representatives of the customers of those companies. \nThe National Federation of Independent Business is the largest single \norganization of small business in this country. It favors this \nlegislation. It favors legislation stronger than this. So whoever the \nSenator from North Carolina was speaking for, it was not the small \nbusinesspeople who do not look forward to a blizzard of litigation on \nthis subject.\n  Of course, in retrospect, this new technology might have thought \nabout the Y2K problem earlier than it did. But at this point, our goal \nshould be a solution to the problem, not a blizzard of second-guessing \nlitigation, especially litigation that will almost certainly slow down \nthe future development of the very technology that has been so \nresponsible for the growth in the American economy and has caused such \nsignificant changes for the good in the lives of people all around the \nworld.\n  This bill is by no means perfect. In the view of this Senator it \nlacks that perfection because it is not all-encompassing enough. It is, \nhowever, at least a modest step in the right direction, one supported \nnot only by the technology companies that are responsible for the \ncomputer revolution but by their customers and consumers as well.\n  So with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I can \nwholeheartedly recommend the passage of this legislation to the Senate \nand look forward with satisfaction to the President's approval of this \nbill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, once again I do not yield from the \nstatement made that this has been one shabby charade. I intended to, \nand did, take the President to task, and I do so. You don't send five \nveto messages and then come with a sorry bill, a worse compromise. It \nis obvious. You can look at it on the face of it. It did not take care \nof the consumers. Senator Leahy tried to. It was what we adopted in the \nCongress last year, in the securities bill, in the other measure; we \nalways take care of the consumers. But here the one group penalized, \nsidelined, damaged, if you please, are the consumers of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nPublic Citizen, opposing the bill, opposing this report.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Public Citizen,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1999.\n\n               Please Oppose the Senate Y2K Immunity Bill\n\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of Public Citizen's 150,000 \n     members, we thank you for\n\n[[Page S8031]]\n\n     your vote against passage of H.R. 775, the Y2K immunity bill. \n     We urge you to continue to stand up for consumers and small \n     businesses by voting against the Senate-passed version of \n     this unfair legislation if it is brought to the House floor. \n     Although this measure is somewhat ``less extreme'' than the \n     version of the bill that you opposed when the full House \n     voted on this measure last month, the Senate bill is also \n     sweeping in scope, and its effect on individual and small \n     business consumers will be virtually the same as the House \n     bill: it will make it next to impossible for those with \n     legitimate Y2K claims to seek full and fair compensation in \n     state courts.\n       Both the Senate and House Y2K bills bestow special legal \n     protections upon companies responsible for manufacturing and \n     selling technology products and computer systems that will \n     not work in the Year 2000--even to those companies that \n     knowingly sold Y2K defective products within the last few \n     years, and even to those that are still selling defective \n     products and systems today. This kind of blanket protection \n     from accountability is unfair and unwise. Not only will these \n     bills preempt important consumer protections under state law, \n     they are likely to undermine Y2K readiness by sending a \n     message that Congress will not allow companies to be held \n     accountable for their acts and omissions. They will lead to \n     more Y2K failures and injuries, not fewer.\n       The Senate bill has not all, but many, of the same kind of \n     extreme provisions that made the House bill unacceptable. For \n     example, the Senate proposal contains:\n       A mandate that, to receive punitive damages at all against \n     any defendant--even a huge corporation--a plaintiff must \n     prove applicable state law standards for punitive damages by \n     clear and convincing evidence--a higher burden of proof than \n     is required under many state laws; this provision would make \n     it harder to hold the most irresponsible defendants fully \n     accountable.\n       In addition, the bill also imposes a cap on punitive \n     damages of $250,000 or three times actual damages, whichever \n     is less, in cases involving defendants with 50 or fewer \n     employees; this cap applies no matter how egregious the \n     defendant's behavior unless the plaintiff can prove by clear \n     and convincing evidence that the small business defendant \n     specifically intended to harm the plaintiff--an extremely \n     difficult standard for a plaintiff in a civil case to meet.\n       The elimination of joint liability of defendants in most \n     instances--even for defendants that are substantially \n     responsible for causing a Y2K failure--with no requirement \n     that defendants take any steps to avoid Y2K failures in the \n     first place to receive this liability limitation; this change \n     in law would leave many injured individuals and small \n     business consumers without full compensation.\n       A provision to allow defendants to remove most state law \n     Y2K class actions into federal court--a proposal opposed by \n     the Judicial Conference of the United States, chaired by U.S. \n     Supreme Court Chief Justice Rehnquist.\n       Additional burdens on class action plaintiffs such as \n     heightened notice and pleading requirements and requirements \n     that courts find that the majority of class members' injuries \n     to be ``material'' at the outset of any litigation; these \n     requirements will make it harder for consumers to bring their \n     cases as a class, even if that represents the most efficient \n     way to adjudicate their cases.\n       So-called ``bystander liability'' provisions, limiting the \n     liability of parties other than the product manufacturer or \n     seller by making it more difficult to prove claims of fraud, \n     negligent misrepresentation, interference with contract and \n     other claims where the defendant knew or should have known \n     about the Y2K failure at issue.\n       A mandatory waiting period of 90 days before plaintiff can \n     bring a suit--with no requirement that defendants actually \n     fix any Y2K problems during that time, even though some \n     plaintiffs could suffer substantial losses during that \n     period, such as a small business that is forced to close.\n       In addition, the Senate added more special protections for \n     defendants and one-sided provisions that make the Senate bill \n     even worse in some respects than the bill that passed the \n     House. These include:\n       A complete one-way preemption of state law, preserving \n     every state law that gives more liability protections to \n     defendants while ensuring that the bill only wipes out all \n     current state law rights that benefit consumer and small \n     business plaintiff.\n       A complete affirmative defense against governmental \n     enforcement actions for defendants that failed to comply with \n     most federally enforceable measurement or reporting \n     requirements because of a Y2K failure that was ``beyond the \n     reasonable control of the defendant;'' this applies to rules \n     of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug \n     Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration and other agencies, unless the violation poses \n     an imminent threat to the environment, health, or safety.\n       The suspension of federal penalties for any violation of \n     any federal regulation caused by a Y2K failure (except a rule \n     related to the banking or monetary system) for businesses \n     with 50 or fewer employees as long as that business did not \n     violate the same rule within the last three years and made \n     some ``good faith effort'' to avoid the Y2K problem.\n       The only pro-consumer amendment added to the bill in the \n     Senate offers temporary protection against adverse actions by \n     financial institutions or credit agencies for individuals or \n     small businesses unable to meet a financial obligation, such \n     as making a mortgage payment or paying a credit card bill, \n     because of a Y2K failure. This is an important provision to \n     ensure that a person's credit is not ruined or a family \n     evicted because of an inability to make a payment through no \n     fault of their own. But this one pro-consumer amendment in no \n     way makes up for the overwhelming unfairness of the \n     underlying Senate bill to most consumers and small businesses \n     who will experience Y2K failures in products and services \n     they have purchased, or who suffer Y2K damages from chemical \n     spills or other Y2K-caused accidents.\n       Please oppose the Senate version of H.R. 775.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joan Claybrook,\n       President, Public Citizen.\n     Frank Clemente,\n       Director, Public Citizen's Congress Watch.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this is the letter we received from the \ndistinguished executive assistant, Mr. John Podesta. I ask unanimous \nconsent this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, June 30, 1999.\n     Re H.R. 775--the Year 2000 Readiness and Responsibility Act.\n\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: The nation faces the possibility that \n     widespread frivolous litigation will distract high technology \n     companies and firms throughout the economy from the important \n     work of preventing--and if necessary--repairing damage caused \n     by the inability of systems to process dates in the new \n     millennium. Special, time-limited legislation to deter \n     unwarranted Y2K lawsuits is important to our economy.\n       Over the last few months, the Administration sought to \n     ensure that, while we deterred frivolous claims, we also \n     preserved important protections for litigants who suffer bona \n     fide harm. We believed that the Senate-passed bill failed \n     this test. The Conference Committee agreed to make a list of \n     changes that were important to provide necessary protections.\n       The agreed-upon changes were translated into legislative \n     language extremely narrowly, threatening the effectiveness of \n     the negotiated protections. Nonetheless, we have concluded \n     that, with these changes, the legislation is significantly \n     improved. Specifically, as modified, the Conference Report: \n     ensures that individual consumers can be made whole for harm \n     suffered, even if a partially responsible party is judgment-\n     proof; excludes actions brought by investors from most \n     provisions of the bill and preserves the ability of the SEC \n     to bring actions to protect investors and the integrity of \n     the national securities markets; ensures that public health, \n     safety and the environment are fully protected, even if some \n     firms are temporarily unable to fully comply with all \n     regulatory requirements due to Y2K failures; encourages \n     companies to act responsibly and remediate because those \n     defendants who act recklessly are liable for a greater share \n     of a plaintiff's uncollectible damages; and ensures that \n     unconscionable contracts cannot be enforced against unwary \n     consumers or small businesses.\n       As a result, I will recommend to the President that he sign \n     the bill when it comes to his desk.\n       In the normal course of business, the Administration would \n     oppose many of the extraordinary steps taken in this \n     legislation to alter liability and procedural rules. The Y2K \n     problem is unique and unprecedented. The Administration's \n     support for this legislation in no way reflects support for \n     its provisions in any other context.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John Podesta.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We go to what we knew. They made the agreement, it was \nall signed up, and after the agreement was sent over to the White \nHouse, it was not what they agreed to even then. I read:\n\n       The agreed-upon changes were translated into legislative \n     language extremely narrowly, threatening the effectiveness of \n     the negotiating protections. Nonetheless, we have concluded \n     that, with these changes . . . [we are going to sign the \n     bill].\n\n  They were going to sign a bill. They were going to get a bill for the \nVice President. We have to get this Silicon money. And they ought to be \ntaken to task for this kind of performance here. We know what this is \nabout. Like I say, no State, no Governor, no Attorney General, no \nlegislature supports this effort. Let say that my distinguished friend \nfrom Connecticut is very effective. He says: What a radical idea when \nwe have a unique problem.\n  No, not at all. I am reading from the American Bar Association, all \nthe lawyers:\n\n       Traditionally, legal principles governing both tort and \n     contract actions have been the province of the States.\n\n\n[[Page S8032]]\n\n\n  Not the Federal Government. We all know that.\n\n       The legal issues likely to be presented by the year 2000 \n     problem are not unique.\n\n  We know that. He said it is not unique, it is not a radical idea, it \nis not a radical idea to say what is wrong, specify in your complaint \nwhat is wrong. When the computer breaks down, I don't know what is \nwrong. Who does? It is like in the Food and Drug Administration, when \nthere is bad food we have good product liability; we have a Food and \nDrug Administration. These products they have within their own purview, \nthe proprietary information on the manufacturer, so if there is a \nproduct that breaks down, they know where it is. We cannot find it \nordinarily. But here, they really sidelined middle America, consumers \nand the poor small businessman.\n  They said that is a radical idea. It is a radical idea. It goes \nagainst the entire thrust of the safety principles we experience here \nin America. We have a safe society. You can depend on the food. You can \ndepend on the products. The European Union is now following strict \nliability and joint and several liability that we have here in America. \nA radical idea to run to the courthouse? We are not running to the \ncourthouse.\n  It is a litigious society, but we will show tort claims are down and \nbusiness suing business is up; domestic cases, rights cases for this \nright, that wrong; environment and otherwise, are up. But tort \nliability cases are down.\n  This here really legalizes torts, it legalizes negligence, it \nlegalizes fraud, all in the name of something that happens 6 months \nfrom now when, by their own measure they say we ought to have 90 days \nto fix it. Unreasonable? The Senator from California, she came and \nsaid: Let's get rid of all the lawyers, just use those 90 days to \nrequire the manufacturer to fix it; that's all we need. We need to get \nback in business. We do not need a rush to the courthouse.\n  Rush to the courthouse? That implies you are going to get a rush \njudgment. Try to get 12 jurors to agree on anything today. You cannot \nget 12 Senators.\n  They surely have gotten something very easily. Surely, it was not \nunreasonable to at least say you have to fix the problem, in return for \nexpansive restrictions on plaintiffs' rights.\n  Instead, they say you have to find out what is wrong and specify it \nbefore they do anything. Come on. They say that is in behalf of the \nconsumers of America? And that is a good measure and it is a victory \nfor America? No, Mr. President; this is a sad day when the moneys in \ncampaigns are not just taken to get elected, are not taken just to buy \nthe office, but when they buy the principles in order to cater to a \ncrowd to pass this kind of legislation.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes 37 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to take a few moment to speak on \nbehalf of the conference report. As you know, the negotiations over the \ndetails of the Y2K Act entered their final phase last Friday, during \nthe weekend, and through Monday and Tuesday of this week. With the \ntremendous help and diligence, particularly of Senators McCain, Dodd, \nand Wyden, we were able to craft a compromise bill which addresses \nevery one of the major concerns of the White House.\n  Let me say that the final bill reflects the spirit of compromise. But \nI must admit that I believe the original Judiciary and Commerce \nCommittee bills--along with the House bill--would have been far more \neffective in dealing with the problem of the expected frivolous and \nmassive Y2K litigation--than the current compromise measure. But \nbecause of the overwhelming importance and need for this bill, both \nsides acted in good faith and reached an equitable agreement. Let me \nexplain the depth and breadth of the changes that were made.\n  First of all, the House, recognizing the urgent need to pass this \nlegislation, acceded to the far more lenient Senate bill. In practice, \nthis meant that twelve major provisions of the House bill were dropped, \nranging from elimination of both caps on director and officer liability \nto caps on attorneys fees. In the conference negotiations, seven \nfurther important concessions were made. Finally, in negotiations with \nthe White House led by Senator Dodd, we agreed to six further \nsignificant modifications to the bill. Mr. President, I have a list of \nthese changes. I also have a letter from John Podesta to Senator Dodd, \ndated June 29, that enumerates the changes requested by the White House \nand--except for minor technicialities--agreed to by the conference. I \nask unanimous consent that these two documents be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              The Y2K Act\n\n\n       1. Concessions Made On Y2K Act Since House & Senate Action\n\n       House receded to the Senate, which means:\n       No caps on Directors and Officers liability;\n       Applies current state standards for establishing punitive \n     damages, instead of new preemptive federal standard;\n       Cap on punitive damages no longer applies when defendant \n     specifically intended to injure the defendant;\n       Removed caps on punitive damages for larger businesses;\n       Restore principle of joint liability for defendants who \n     knowingly commit fraud. (House bill provided for several, but \n     not joint, liability);\n       Definition of Y2K failure narrowed and targeted directly on \n     year-2000 date-related data;\n       Dropped provisions dealing with attorneys fees;\n       Added sunset provision limiting application of Act;\n       Three major exceptions to proportional liability rule \n     added. These exceptions and, indeed, the proportionate \n     liability section itself, were taken from recent securities \n     law sponsored by Senator Dodd;\n       Dropped the reasonable efforts defense or Federal rules for \n     admissibility of reasonable efforts;\n       Dropped Federal rule for heightened state of mind \n     requirement;\n       Confirms substitution of Federal question for minimal \n     diversity standard\n\n\n                         2. Further Concessions\n\n       Revised definition of Y2K action--strike ``harm or injury \n     resulted directly or indirectly'' and replace with the WH \n     formulation of ``harm or injury [that] arises from or is \n     related to'' an actual or potential Y2K failure. Add same \n     formulation to claims or defenses.\n       Securities claims exclusion--Rejected WH formulation that \n     private securities claims should be exempted from the bill. \n     New provision would allow provisions of the securities law to \n     stand only it if conflicts with provisions of the Y2K Act. We \n     also agreed to exempt from the Y2K Act's application of \n     securities law the duty to mitigate section.\n       Revised language on duty to mitigate--Added an exception \n     for intentional fraud (unless there was an unjustifiable \n     reliance on defendant's misrepresentations). Also exempted \n     securities claims from this section.\n       Revised language on Economic Loss Rule--Adopted the \n     approach of the Kerry Amendment, which allow for economic \n     damages where the defendant committed an intentional tart \n     (except where the defendant committed misrepresentation or \n     fraud ``regarding the attributes or capabilities of the \n     project or service that forms the basis for the underlying \n     claims.''\n       Warrany and contract preservation--Addition to existing \n     language, makes clear that contract terms can be voided by \n     state-law doctrines of unconscionability existing as of \n     January 1, 1999, in controlling judicial precedent of \n     applicable sate law.\n       Proportion liability--new section which includes: Added \n     three provisions: (1) made clear that the provision does not \n     apply to contract provisions; (2) remove the 50% cap placed \n     on those whose shares are not collectable; (3) made clear \n     that all state law (common law as well as statutory) with \n     grater protection applies.\n       Revised language on class actions--Two changes: (1) to \n     discourage the filing of all state class actions in federal \n     court, we increase the jurisdictional amount from $1 million \n     to $2 million. We also add a requirement that there must be \n     50 or more plaintiffs to remove state class actions to \n     federal court; and (2) to prevent elimination of state class \n     actions, which have been removed to federal court and the \n     judge remanded the class action as not proper in federal \n     court (does not meet the criteria of FRCP 23), such remands \n     will be without prejudice allowing the class action to be \n     refiled in state court (and, if appropriate, amended and \n     returned to federal court).\n       Punitivies--Punitive damage cap for small business--50 or \n     less employees--which is the lesser of $250,000 or 3 times \n     compensatory damages. The cap does not apply if a defendant \n     acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff.\n\n\n                  concessions proposed by senator dodd\n\n       Proportionate Liability; Double orphan share for all \n     solvent defendants; Triple orphan share for defendants proven \n     by plaintiffs to be had actors; Exempt individual consumers \n     in individual, but not class, actions.\n       Class Actions; Increase monetary threshold to $5 million; \n     Increase class size exemption to 100 plaintiffs; Securities.\n       Exempt all private security claims from Y2K Act, except \n     from bystander provision of that Act (Sec. 13(a) and (b)).\n       Contract Enforcement: State law governing contracts of \n     adhesion and unconscionability remains enforceable.\n\n[[Page S8033]]\n\n       Economic Loss; Doctrine will not apply to claims of fraud \n     related to contract formation; Regulatory Relief (Gregg and \n     Inhofe amendments).\n       Inhofe: Exemption applies so long as defendant could not \n     have known of the underlying violation because of a Y2K \n     failure of a reporting system. Similar approach with respect \n     to Gregg. (Specifics to be worked out with Administration and \n     others.)\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 1999.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: After our discussions regarding H.R. \n     775, the Year 2000 Readiness and Responsibility Act, to limit \n     liability resulting from Y2K failures, I am prepared to \n     recommend to the President that he sign legislation that \n     includes the following changes:\n       Proportionate Liability--double orphan share for all \n     solvent defendants, triple orphan share for defendants proven \n     by plaintiffs to be bad actors, and exempt individual \n     consumers in individual, but not class, actions.\n       Class Actions--Increase monetary threshold to $10 million, \n     and increase class size exemptions to 100 plaintiffs.\n       Securities--exempt all private security claims from Y2K \n     Act.\n       Contract Enforcement--State law governing contracts of \n     adhesion and unconscionability and contracts that contravene \n     public policy remain enforceable.\n       Economic Loss--Doctrine will not apply to claims of fraud \n     related to contract formation.\n       Regulatory Relief (Gregg and Inhofe amendments)--Changes \n     made to ensure that the provision would not endanger the \n     environment, public health or safety.\n       Should the language of the legislation reflect our \n     understanding of the resolution of these issues, I would \n     advise that the President sign this bill. I am hopeful that \n     if these changes are made, legislation can be enacted on a \n     bipartisan basis.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John Podesta.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. There can be no question that the final bill is more than \na fair compromise. It balances the need to protect consumers against \nthe need to safeguard business--particularly our high tech industries--\nfrom the ravages of unrestrained predatory litigation. Indeed, some \nexperts maintain that litigation over the Y2K bug could cost the world \neconomy over one trillion dollars.\n  I must emphasize the importance of this. One reason that our economy \nhas been prospering is the beneficial effect of its increasing \ncomputerization. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan \nGreenspan, has asserted several times that the economy's increased \nproductivity is in part due to computerization and the information \nrevolution. And one of America's biggest exports is high technology \ngoods and services. Without this bill, we would be strangling the \nproverbial goose that lays the golden egg. America must remain the \npacesetter in high technology and the leader of the information \nrevolution. Our security and national defense demands it.\n  Because of the importance of this issue, I have stated that I want a \nbill and not a partisan issue. I believed that compromise was the only \nway to achieve a product that was both fair and that would pass \nCongress. The bill we produced is a good product. But, it could have \nbeen a better product if the administration had been more forthcoming. \nDespite frequent requests by myself, Chairman McCain, and other \nSenators, for the administration to become actively involved, the \nadministration did not seriously enter into negotiations until last \nweek. They now--after hours and hours of talks--reluctantly support the \nbill. Well, better late than never, I guess.\n  I want to reiterate my thanks to Chairman McCain and Senators Dodd \nand Wyden. I also want to thank the other conferees, Senators Bennett, \nThurmond, Gorton, Stevens, Burns, Leahy, Hollings, and Kerry, for all \ntheir hard work and efforts in making this bill fair, as well as, \neffective. Senator Bennett in particular was an early advocate for \nprompt and meaningful action on Y2K. I would also be remiss not to note \nmy appreciation for the hard work and dedication of the cosponsor of my \nSenate Judiciary Y2K bill, Senator Feinstein.\n  I also want to thank the House conferees for their hard work and for \ntheir wisdom and prudence. Finally, I want to thank the Senator and \nHouse staff for their dedication. I know the long hours they labored.\n  I urge all Senators to support this compromise conference report.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to applaud my colleagues in the \nSenate and our friends in the House of Representatives for acting \npromptly to negotiate a conference report on the Y2K Act. As chairman \nof the Committee on Small businesses, I have paid particular interest \nto the small business community's concerns about the Y2K problems. \nWhile the ultimate consequences that will result from the Y2K problem \nare as yet unknown, small family-owned businesses are understandably \nconcerned about their futures after the new year. They are concerned \nthat their companies may be in danger either from the problem itself or \nfrom suits brought by trial lawyers concerned only with the fees they \ncan obtain from settlements.\n  These businesses have reason to worry that they will be bankrupted by \nnever-ending litigation. Small, woman-owned and family-owned businesses \nare the most vulnerable from costly litigation, either as plaintiffs or \ndefendants, because they do not have the time to devote to it and do \nnot have excess revenue to afford it. In addition, small businesses do \nnot want to sue companies with which they have long-standing \nrelationships and whose survival is tied to their own. Yet, these \nvulnerable businesses see the looming specter of endless litigation on \nthe horizon.\n  Experts have estimated that total litigation costs related to the Y2K \nproblem will be astronomical. For example, the Gartner Group, an \ninternational consulting firm has estimated that more than $1 trillion \nwill be spent on Y2K litigation. Therefore, this legislation, by \nencouraging resolution of Y2K disputes outside the courtroom and \ndecreasing the number of frivolous lawsuits that small businesses may \nhave to face, will help to ensure that litigation arising from this \nproblem will not devastate the millions of small businesses that are \nthe engine of our nation's economy.\n  The small businesses that are troubled about the prospects of Y2K \nlitigation are located on Main Streets all across America, not just \nSilicon Valley. They are this country's mom and pop groceries, its dry \ncleaners and its hardware stores. The National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses, the nation's largest small business \nassociation, strongly supports this legislation. The NFIB surveyed its \nmembers and found that an overwhelming 93 percent support capping \ndamage awards for Y2K suits. The small business community is speaking \nwith a unified voice in support of legislation to limit the impact of \nY2K suits for the good of this nation and by voting for the conference \nreport today we are not ignoring this voice.\n  The conference report also contains an important amendment that was \nadopted in the Senate sponsored by Senator Gregg and co-sponsored by \nme. While the underlying bill will ensure that small businesses do not \nface financial ruin from costly litigation, the amendment will make \ncertain that our own government does not bankrupt small businesses over \nthe Y2K problem. This amendment will waive Federal civil money \npenalties for blameless small businesses that have in good faith \nattempted to correct their Y2K problems, but find themselves \ninadvertently in violation of a Federal regulation or rule, despite \nsuch efforts.\n  Most experts that have studied the Y2K problem agree that regardless \nof how diligent a business is at fixing its Y2K problems, unknown \ndifficulties are still likely to arise that may place the operations of \nsuch businesses at risk. The last thing this government should do is \nlevy civil money penalties on small businesses that find themselves \ninadvertently confronted with Y2K problems. Many of these businesses \nwill already have had their operations disrupted and may be in danger \nof going out of business entirely. The Gregg-Bond amendment in the \nconference report ensures that the Federal government does not push \nthem over the edge. I urge all my colleagues to support the conference \nreport for the sake of our country's small woman- and family-owned \nbusinesses and to ensure that the economic health of our nation is not \nimperiled by the Y2K problem in the coming year and beyond.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, as I have stated before, the debate \nsurrounding Y2K Liability is a very important one. The estimated cost \nassociated with Y2K issues vary greatly,\n\n[[Page S8034]]\n\nranging from $600 billion to $1.6 trillion worldwide. The amount of \nlitigation that will result from Y2K-related failures is uncertain, but \nat least one study has guestimated the costs for Y2K related litigation \nand damages to be at $300 billion.\n  With that in mind, Congress has been debating legislation which \nencourages companies to prevent Y2K failures and to remedy problems \nquickly if they occur, and to deter frivolous lawsuits. Although I \nsupport the goals of the bill that passed the Senate last month, I \nvoted against that bill because I did not feel it provided enough \nprotection for consumers.\n  I am pleased to see that changes were made in the Conference Report \nthat address my concerns and provide protection for consumers. Because \nof these important changes, I intend to support the Y2K Liability \nConference Report. Many of my colleagues have pointed out positive \nchanges to this bill. I would like to highlight just two provisions \nthat will put consumers in a better position with respect to Y2K \nlitigation.\n  The first provision concerns proportionate liability. Exceptions to \nthe general rule of proportionate liability were made to ensure \nordinary consumers are protected and ``bad actor'' defendants are not \nrewarded. These bad actor defendants, those who act recklessly, will \nbear a higher proportion of liability for otherwise uncollectible \ndamage claims. This both protects consumer plaintiffs and provides \ncompanies with an incentive to identify and remedy Y2K problems.\n  The second provision deals with the duty to mitigate. Under the bill, \nplaintiffs have a duty to mitigate damages, which means that they have \na duty to fix computer problems that could have been reasonably \navoided. The Conference Report adds an important exception to this \nrule. Consumers who rely on fraudulent misrepresentations made by \ndefendants about Y2K readiness will be exempted from this duty to \nmitigate. In other words, if a computer company tells a consumer in bad \nfaith that his computer is ``Y2K compliant'' and that turns out to be \nfalse, the consumer will be in a better position to recover damages \nfrom that bad faith defendant.\n  The Y2K issue is a very unique, once in a millennium, problem. \nBecause it is so unique, I agree that legislation is needed. I believe \nthis legislation now strikes a proper balance between consumers and the \nhigh tech industry---computer companies have an incentive to identify \nand remedy potential Y2K problems, and consumers have important \nprotections when faced with bad actor defendants. Therefore, I will \ncast a vote in support of the Y2K Liability Conference Report.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the long road to \nenacting this critical legislation is finally coming to an end.\n  The conference report now before the Senate is the product of more \nthan seven months of tough, complex negotiations between the high-tech \nindustry, the White House, trial lawyers, consumer groups, computer \nconsultants, countless Members of the House and Senate and other \ninterested parties.\n  The final, bipartisan bill--now supported by the President--will \ncreate a once in a millennium, three-year law. Without it, I believe we \ncould see the destruction or dismemberment of America's cutting edge \nlead in technology.\n  Mr. President, several well-known consultants and firms, including \nthe Gartner Group, have estimated that Y2K litigation could quickly \nreach as high as one trillion dollars. This potential litigation flood \ncould prevent companies from solving Y2K defects, and as a result could \nput the high-tech engine that has propelled our economy to new heights \nat risk.\n  This bill is especially important to California, where over 20 \npercent of the nation's high-tech jobs are located.\n  And the problem extends beyond high tech companies into the lives of \nemployees, stockholders and customers of a wide range of American \nbusiness.\n  We solved part of the Y2K problem last year when Congress \noverwhelmingly passed legislation to protect companies who make \nstatements about Y2K problems in order to help others predict and solve \nthese problems before they occur.\n  But we must now take an extra step, in order to encourage companies \nto work to prevent and fix Y2K problems with minimum delay.\n  Without this bill, companies may be forced to devote far too many \nresources to preparing for lawsuits rather than mitigating damages and \nsolving Y2K problems.\n  And many consultants have come to us and said that they have refused \nto become involved in helping companies solve Y2K problems, for fear \nthat they will open themselves up to being sued later on. They would \nrather just not get involved.\n  As a result, the very people capable of fixing Y2K defects are \nunavailable to perform those fixes.\n  I believe we face a real problem, and we have tried to craft a real \nsolution.\n  And crafting that solution has not been easy. On almost a daily \nbasis, Senate staffers, industry representatives, opponents of the bill \nand others have met for hours at a time to hammer out differences, \nclarify language, and make significant, substantive changes to the \nearly versions of these bills.\n  In fact, even before the Conference Committee met over the last week, \nthe original sponsors of Y2K litigation reform, including myself and \nSenators Hatch, McCain and Wyden, made dozens--if not hundreds--of \nchanges to these bills. We addressed every concern we could, we \nsignificantly limited the scope of the bills, and we clarified many \nsections to ensure that plaintiffs and defendants alike will find an \neven, uniform playing field once the bill passes.\n  And it is important to remember that nothing in this bill is \npermanent--rather, it is a three-year bill limited to certain specific \ncases. The bill applies only to Y2K failures, and only to those \nfailures that occur before January 1, 2003.\n  This bill contains a number of key provisions meant to deter \nfrivolous suits and encourage remediation, arbitration, and problem-\nsolving.\n  Most of these provisions have been modified or limited during the \nnegotiations that have taken place over the last seven months. Several \nchanges were made as late as this week, during negotiations with the \nWhite House.\n  The bill provides a 90-day ``cooling off period'' during which time \nno suit may be filed, so that businesses can concentrate on solving Y2K \nproblems rather than on fending off lawsuits.\n  Only one 90-day period may be invoked per lawsuit, and the 90-day \nperiod does not delay any injunctive relief--a plaintiff may \nimmediately file for a temporary restraining order or any other type of \ninjunctive relief.\n  The purpose of this section is to give both parties an opportunity to \nfocus on identifying and then correcting any Y2K problems quickly and \nefficiently.\n  The bill also provides for proportionate liability in many cases, so \nthat defendants are punished according to their fault, and not \naccording to their ``deep pockets.''\n  Under our current system of joint and several liability, a defendant \nfound to be only twenty, ten or even one percent at fault can \nnonetheless be forced to pay 100 percent of the damages.\n  This system often encourages plaintiffs to go after ``deep pocket'' \ndefendants first, in order to force a quick settlement.\n  I believe that this system is fundamentally unfair, and I am pleased \nto say that this bill eliminates joint and several liability in many \nY2K cases.\n  Under the new system, defendants will be responsible only for that \nportion of damages that can be attributed to them.\n  However, the bill does have several specific exceptions to the \nelimination of joint and several liability.\n  First, any plaintiff worth less than $200,000 and suffering harm of \nmore than 10 percent of that net worth may recover against all \ndefendants jointly and severally. This exception in the bill protects \nthose plaintiffs with a low net worth, but will not unduly injure \ndefendants because the damages recovered will not be great.\n  Second, any defendant who acts with an intent to injure or defraud a \nplaintiff loses the protections under this bill and is again subject to \njoint and several liability. We do not want to protect those acting \nwith an intent to harm.\n  Finally, the original Senate bill provided a compromise for those \ncases in\n\n[[Page S8035]]\n\nwhich certain defendants are ``judgement-proof.'' In cases where a \nplaintiff cannot recover from certain defendants, the other defendants \nin the case would each liable for an additional portion of the damages. \nHowever, in no case could a defendant be forced to pay more than 150 \npercent of its level of fault. The Conference Committee increased that \ncap to 200 percent, making it even easier for plaintiffs to recover the \nfullest possible extent of their damages.\n  The Conference Committee also inserted provisions in the bill, at the \nrequest of the White House, that will allow any individual consumer to \nrecover jointly and severally against defendants for any share of \ndamages that are uncollectible from other, judgment-proof defendants.\n  And for Y2K class action suits, the bill requires that a majority of \nplaintiffs have suffered some minimal injury, in order to avoid cases \nin which thousands of unknowing plaintiffs are lumped together in an \nattempt to force a quick settlement.\n  The bill moves many Y2K class actions into federal court for purposes \nof uniformity, but at the request of the White House the Conference \nCommittee increased the threshold to get to federal court from the one \nmillion dollar level found in the Senate bill to ten million now. \nFurthermore, the number of required plaintiffs required to move a class \naction to federal court has been doubled from fifty to one hundred.\n  And the punitive damages section, which has been severely curtailed \nsince early versions of the bill, now caps punitive damages for small \nbusinesses only--to $250,000 or three times compensatory damages, \nwhichever is lesser.\n  Another change made to the bill in Conference exempts most \nintentional torts from the limits on recovery for economic loss.\n  Finally, the conference report provides that state laws on \nunconscionability will not apply to cases in which individual terms \nwithin a contract should not be enforced--a move further protecting the \nplaintiff's right to recover.\n  Each of the changes made before and during the Conference Committee \nnegotiations has narrowed the focus and effect of the bill, while still \nmaintaining the bill's clear intent to allow companies to prevent, \nsolve and remediate Y2K problems without undue delay stemming from \nfrivolous lawsuits and meritless claims.\n  The ``one trillion dollar litigation headache'' is rapidly \napproaching, and this Congress can provide some preventative medicine \nand some anticipatory pain relief in the form of the reasoned, fair, \nand thoughtful compromise before us.\n  The bill sets forth clear rules to be followed in all Y2K cases, and \nthe bill levels the playing field for all parties who will be involved \nin Y2K suits--plaintiffs and defendants.\n  Companies and individuals alike will know the rules, and will know \nwhat they have to do. And most importantly, the stability that will \ncome from this bill will allow companies to prevent Y2K problems when \npossible, fix Y2K defects when necessary, and proceed to remediation of \ndamages in an orderly and fair manner.\n  This bill has been through a tortuous legislative drafting process, \nwith criticisms, suggestions and changes made from every side and by \nevery sector of our society.\n  So let us pass this conference report today, let us send it to the \nPresident, and let us show this nation that the Y2K crisis will not \ncripple our courts, will not disrupt our economy, and will not put a \nhalt to the technology engine driving our progress towards the twenty-\nfirst century.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to vote on the \nConference Report on H.R. 775, the Y2K Act, I want to praise the \nbipartisan efforts of so many Senate and House Members who have worked \ndiligently to construct an effective, fair bill that will address the \nimportant issue of liability as it relates to the possible Year 2000--\nor Y2K--computer problems. This has been a group effort, teaming \nmembers on both sides of the aisle with the private sector. The \ncoalition of high technology businesses, large businesses, small \nbusinesses, and others provided the initiative and momentum that pushed \nthis bill across the finish line.\n  This bill is constructive, positive legislation. It allows companies \nin the information technology industry to focus their limited resources \non solving Y2K related problems in computer software by preventing \nfrivolous litigation. Litigation which would divert those limited \nresources away from solving Y2K programming deficiencies.\n  Mr. President, so many Senators and their staffs have worked to \ninsure the success of this legislation, even when faced with difficult \nhurdles and odds. The efforts of Senator McCain, Senator Wyden, Senator \nGorton, Senator Bennett, Senator Dodd, Senator Hatch, Sentor Feinstein \nand others, along with the efforts of the House sponsors and conferees, \nhave brought us to this point.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the House has passed this important \nbill today by a vote of 404-24. With only 183 days left until the globe \nturns the page on the calendar to a new century and a new millennium, I \nurge my colleagues to vote for this important bill. I am confident that \nthis Conference Report will pass the Senate by a wide margin, just as \nin the House, and I urge the President to sign this bill into law when \nhe receives it.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we have some demands on this side of the \naisle and some obligations.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from South \nCarolina for his spirited and impassioned defense of his position. It \nis a great privilege to do combat with him, both in the committee and \non the floor. I appreciate his eloquence as always.

Mr. President, I think it is important now we give Members \nsome indication of what the schedule looks like. Senator Daschle and I \nhave been talking about how we can move forward.\n\n[[Page S8036]]\n\n  I believe we have two amendments that have to be dealt with, with the \npossibility of votes, at least two votes at 7:30, in order to finish \nthe Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill. I think there will \nprobably just be one amendment vote and final passage, although there \nis another amendment that has to be disposed of in that time.\n  At that point, our plan is to go to the District of Columbia \nappropriations bill. Work is being done on that now. Senator Daschle \nand I are ready to announce right now that if we can get that done \ntonight at a reasonable hour, we will not have any votes on Friday. If \nwe have difficulty, if we can't get it done tonight, then we will be in \nwith votes tomorrow. We probably are going to have to be in tomorrow \nanyway. Senator Daschle and I had already planned on being here. We \nwant company. We are still working on nominations tonight, and we might \nhave some we will try to get cleared tomorrow.\n  Basically, I am saying that if we could get this D.C. appropriations \nbill completed, then we would not have recorded votes tomorrow. It \nbehooves us all. We are in a good mode now. We are making progress. I \nurge those who are involved in the D.C. appropriations bill to work \naggressively so we can complete this at a reasonable hour tonight. \nOtherwise, we will see you in the morning at 9:30.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the distinguished majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope you will have a session tomorrow without votes. \nThere are many of us who like to make some speeches from time to time. \nWe don't get the opportunity to do that. I would like to give a speech \nconcerning Independence Day, for example, and there are others.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as I indicated, I thought we might have to \nhave a session tomorrow anyway because of some wrapup business we may \nneed to do. If we have Senators who would like to speak as to the \nFourth of July, that is all the more reason. The key question for all \nother Senators is, will there be votes tomorrow morning or not. That \nwill depend on finishing up the District of Columbia appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President. I believe we have a D.C. \nunanimous consent request that is ready now.\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1283\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we take \nup and consider the District of Columbia appropriations bill with the \nfollowing parameters: 40 minutes equally divided on the Coverdell \nneedle exchange amendment, with a second-degree amendment by Senator \nDurbin; 30 minutes for Senator Durbin's tuition assistance program \namendment, and 10 minutes for the opposition; 15 minutes for Senator \nDurbin's sense-of-the-Senate amendment; the Hutchison managers' \namendment, and a final vote.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I have not seen the needle \nexchange amendment or Senator Durbin's second degree, if he has one. I \ncannot agree to this at this time, until I see the amendment, because \nit affects a lot of people and it could mean the spread of disease. I \nneed to see the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. We will work with the Senator from California and let \nher see the amendment. I will ask Mr. Coverdell to make the amendment \navailable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8036-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8036-S8042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota, Senator Wellstone, is to be recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think I follow Senator DeWine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1200\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to pay for an abortion or to pay \nfor the administrative expenses in connection with certain health plans \n                  that provide coverage for abortions)\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n     Brownback, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Helms, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. McCain, \n     Mr. Nickles, and Mr. Hagel, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1200.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VI, add the following:\n       Sec.   . No funds appropriated by this Act shall be \n     available to pay for an abortion, or the administrative \n     expenses in connection with any health plan under the Federal \n     employees health benefit program which provides any benefits \n     or coverage for abortions.\n       Sec.   . The provision of section      shall not apply \n     where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus \n     were carried to term, or the pregnancy is the result of an \n     act of rape or incest.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment on behalf \nof myself and Senators Abraham, Brownback, Santorum, Helms, Ashcroft, \nMcCain, Nickles, and Hagel.\n  This amendment would maintain in force the current law restricting \nFederal funding for abortions only to cases of rape, incest, or life of \nthe mother. Specifically, my amendment would maintain the status quo \nthat limits Federal employee health plans to cover abortions only in \nthe case of rape, incest, and threat to life of the mother.\n  This is the same amendment that was accepted during the debate for \nfiscal year 1999 Treasury-Postal appropriations, the same amendment \nagreed to by this body during the debate for fiscal years 1996 and \n1997. In fact, this is the same language that has been consistently \nsupported by a bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives from \n1983 to 1999, with the exception of only 2 years.\n  I mention all of this to make it very clear to the Members of the \nSenate that this amendment stakes out no new ground. This amendment \nmaintains the status quo. This amendment has been voted on time and \ntime again by this body, and time and time again this body has accepted \nit.\n  The principle is a very simple one--one that goes beyond the \nconventional pro-choice/pro-life debates that we hear on this Senate \nfloor. I think my colleagues know I am pro-life and, therefore, I wish \nto promote the values protecting innocent human life. However, I point \nout that the vast majority of Americans on both sides of the abortion \nissue strongly agree that they should not pay for someone else's \nabortion. That really is what this debate is about.\n  Fairly stated, this amendment is not about the morality of abortion \nor the right of a woman to choose abortion. Rather, this is a very \nnarrowly focused amendment that answers a key question: Should \ntaxpayers pay for these abortions?\n  This Senate, this Congress, has consistently answered no. Congress \nhas consistently agreed that we should not ask taxpayers to promote a \npolicy, in essence, of paying for abortion on demand by a Federal \nemployee. My amendment would maintain the status quo that limits \nFederal employee health plans to cover abortions only in the case of \nrape, incest, and threat to the life of the mother.\n  The vast majority of Americans oppose subsidizing abortions. \nEmployers, as a general principle, determine the health benefits \nemployees receive. Taxpayers are the employers of Federal employees, \nand a large majority of taxpayers simply do not want their tax dollars \nto go to pay for abortions. Taxpayers provide a majority share of the \nfunds to purchase health insurance for the Federal civilian workforce. \nThis provision addresses the same core issue and simply says that the \nFederal Government, as the employer, is not in the business of funding \nabortions. Abortion is certainly a contentious issue, and we should not \nask the taxpayers to pay for it.\n  In conclusion, this issue has been debated time and time again on the \nSenate floor. Current law limits abortion availability in Federal \nemployee health care plans to cases of rape, incest, and to save the \nlife of the mother. That has been the position of the Senate, that has \nbeen the position of the House, and that was approved last year and the \nyear before as well. We should not involuntarily take the money of \nAmericans--many of whom find abortion abhorrent--to pay for abortions.\n\n[[Page S8037]]\n\nWe should not go against the will of the people of this country. We \nshould uphold current law, and that is very simply what this amendment \ndoes.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to understand the \nparliamentary situation. As I understand it, the Senator from Ohio has \n22 and a half minutes and I have the same amount of time. Is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine, and I want to \ntell you why. I hope colleagues will listen to this, because this is an \namendment that impacts 1.2 million women in America today. It is a law \nthat is aimed directly at them. It will harm them; it will take away \ntheir rights.\n  We do a lot of things around here, and some of them don't really \naffect real people. This affects real people who happen to be women, \n1.2 million of them, who are hard-working women, who pay for their own \nhealth insurance--part of it. Yet, under the Senator's amendment, he \nsays to those 1.2 million women: You are going to be treated \ndifferently from every other working woman in America today just \nbecause you happen to work for the Federal Government and just because \nthe Senate has the power to impact you.\n  I think this is a sad day for us again, a very sad day. Every other \nwoman in America who has a health insurance plan can avail herself of \nall the legal procedures that are known to exist today. They have no \nproblem. Abortion is a legal procedure. Let me repeat that. Abortion is \nlegal in America. That is what this is all about. This isn't a debate \nabout these 1.2 million women, not at all.\n  It is about the underlying question.\n  The Senator from Ohio is a leader in the effort to take away a \nwoman's right to choose. He is open about it. He is honest about it. He \nis forthright about it. He thinks abortion should not be legal under \nany circumstance. And his cosponsors today, if you look at their \nrecord, are all in favor of a constitutional amendment banning the \nright to choose.\n  What we are seeing is another way to get to the same end. If you \ncan't repeal Roe, if you can't take away a woman's right to choose, \ntake away her right to be able to pay for the procedure which is legal.\n  Federal employees work hard. They work in every aspect of our lives. \nSome of them are scientists at the NIH. Some of them work delivering \nthe mail. They work hard.\n  It seems to me unconscionable that we would say, because we have the \npower to do it, we would say because of raw legal power, Federal \nemployees, women, you are second-class citizens, and you do not have \nthe same rights as someone who works for American Telephone, or any of \nthe companies, small or large, in this country.\n  Why is it that the Senator from Ohio doesn't have that in his \namendment? Because he can't get it passed. But he has figured out a way \nbecause, yes, the Federal Government, as part of our benefits package, \npays part of the health insurance premium.\n  So that is the vote. It is true that this has passed a couple of \ntimes. We didn't have a debate on it really the last time. I found it \nvery interesting when we started this because my friends came to me and \nsaid: Do we really need to have a vote? Do we really need to talk about \nthis?\n  I want to say something about this. We have a lot of time to talk \nabout Y2K. We have endless days to talk about Y2K, and then we add \nanother hour and a half to talk about Y2K. When it comes to business, \nwe have a lot of time. But when it comes to taking away the rights of \nwomen, oh, Senator Boxer. Do you really need to talk about it? Can't we \njust forget about it? We don't need a vote. We want to go home. I want \nto go home. But we are about to do again what we have done before, \nwhich is to say to these women, you can't be treated like other women.\n  Everyone who gets up on that side to talk about this--I guarantee \nit--really wants to outlaw abortion, period.\n  That is what this is about--make it tougher, make it harder, any hook \nthat they can find to stop a woman from exercising her legal right \ngiven to her by the Supreme Court decision, and, by the way, ratified \nover and over and over again by that Court--even the current Court. \nYes, it is legal for a woman to have control over her own body. Yes, it \nis legal, they said. It is within her privacy rights. It gives her \ndignity. It gives her options. It gives her the ability to take care of \nher own health.\n  This is an insult to women who work for the Federal Government.\n  The Senator from Ohio has no compunction about it--standing up here \nand looking at the women who work here; his own staff, by the way, who \nwill be treated as second-class citizens, different from all the other \nwomen in this country.\n  I now yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California, \nSenator Boxer, who has risen to speak against this amendment, for her \ncourage, and for her reminding all of us of how important this issue is \nto so many women across this country.\n  I speak today in strong opposition to the DeWine amendment, which \nonce again, attempts to restrict access to safe, legal, affordable \nreproductive health care services for women. This amendment simply \nseeks to obstruct a women's right to choose.\n  I know the proponents of this amendment claim they are only \nprohibiting the use of federal funds to pay for abortion. The truth is \nthis amendment is about the U.S. Senate determining what health \nbenefits federal employees will receive.\n  Health insurance for federal employees is an earned benefit. It is \npart of an overall compensation package. It is no different than a \nsalary. Through this amendment, Senator DeWine and his colleagues \nattempting to give federal taxpayers a say in how federal employees \nspend their salaries. This is unfair. A federal employee's salary \nbelongs to the federal employee and a federal employee' health benefits \nbelong to the federal employee.\n  Yet, we are here today debating an amendment that is based on the \npremise that the taxpayer controls federal employee's benefits. Again, \nhealth insurance is an earned benefit offered in lieu of income. The \nvalue of this benefit is part of the overall compensation for work \nperformed. Why are we attempting to dictate the value or scope of a \nbenefit owned by the federal employee? The answer is because the \nmajority believes it can and therefore that it should. That's \nunfortunate.\n  I have a solution for federal employees who object to receiving \nbenefits that allow a women the right to a full range of reproductive \nhealth care services: refuse to purchase health insurance from a plan \nthat offers these benefits. It's that simple. Since the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefit Plan is, in part, funded by a premium paid by \nthe employee that employee should have the right to refuse to support \nactivities to which he or she objects. Those employees should simply \nnot select these plans.\n  I think all federal employees should be outraged by this kind of \namendment that we are debating. Dedicated, hard working federal \nemployees are basically being asked to limit their constitutional right \nto choose when they enter federal employment. This amendment treats \nfederal employees like second class citizens and gives them no ability \nto decide what kind of health insurance is appropriate to meet all of \ntheir health care needs, including reproductive health.\n  This amendment is not about the federal funding of abortions. This \namendment is an assault on women's health. It is a creative way to deny \naccess to abortion services for federal employees and their families. \nFederal employees should not be captive to the narrow views of a \nminority of the public. Allowing federal employees to purchase and \nreceive insurance policies that allow them to have an abortion is not \ndirect federal funding of abortion. It is a round-about way to limit \nsome American's abilities to exercise the rights\n\n[[Page S8038]]\n\ngranted them by the Constitution. I, and the majority of Americans, \nsupport that right and the Roe versus Wade decision. This Senate should \nnot undermine the fundamental right of women to decide whether to bear \na child.\n  Most of my colleagues know voters would be outraged if they sought to \noverturn Roe versus Wade. But instead of simply coming forward and \nadmitting they oppose the idea that a woman has a constitutional right \nto decide what is in her best interest and the best interests of her \nfamily, they hide behind arguments about federal funding. Most of my \ncolleagues know that a majority of the population supports the basic of \nprivacy inherent in the Roe versus Wade decision. Abortion, up to \nviability, is a personal and private matter. Rather than seeking to \noverturn Roe versus Wade, they have decided to restrict access with a \nmultitude of creative, but similarly offensive, ways.\n  By mandating that insurance companies participating in the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefit Plan deny access to abortion services as part \nof their defined benefit package, the U.S. Senate is attempting to take \na private and difficult decision and add to a woman's hardship by \nturning it also into a financial burden.\n  Many federal employees simply do not have the discretionary income to \npay for an abortion. The cost of this procedure can be high. By \nremoving this health care benefit from all federal insurance plans, we \nhave placed a significant financial burden on employees and their \nfamilies. For federal employees, the protections guaranteed under Roe \nversus Wade are seriously jeopardized. Financial barriers can be just \nas effective for many people as simply overturning Roe versus Wade.\n  I hope this amendment is defeated and that we can recognize the \nvaluable contributions of all federal employees by not forcing them to \nsurrender their rights and protections as a condition of being a civil \nservant. I also hope that we can stop these constant assaults on \nwomen's health care and that of their families.\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me just briefly respond to some of the \ncomments that have been made. This matter has been debated many times \non the Senate floor. I seriously doubt there will be any new points \nthat I or anyone else will raise.\n  Sometimes the obvious must be stated: This amendment does not stop \nabortions. This amendment does not say to any woman what she can or \ncannot do. This simply says taxpayers are not going to pay for it. It \nis that simple. It is that basic.\n  We have to understand, on the average health plan in the Federal \nGovernment, 73 percent of the cost is paid for by the Government, which \nmeans 73 percent of the cost is paid for by the taxpayers.\n  We get back to the issue, should the American people, on an \ninvoluntary basis, through their taxes, have money taken out of their \npay to be used to pay for abortions when many people believe very \nadamantly that this is wrong? I think the answer is absolutely not, we \nshould not have this money involuntarily taken from taxpayers to pay \nfor abortions, which violates the conscience of many taxpayers.\n  This is one Senator who doesn't quote polls too often on the Senate \nfloor, but I think it has some relevance about what the American people \nexpect us to do as far as how their taxes are spent. A Fox poll in 1998 \nasked: Do you think health care plans should pay for any of the cost of \nan abortion? That answer? Sixty percent said no. The question \nspecifically had to do with the Federal Government paying for these \nFederal health care plans. Sixty percent said no; 28 percent said yes.\n  I think it is very clear, with the Federal Government paying almost \nthree-fourths of the cost of these plans and taxpayers paying three-\nfourths of the cost, we understand what is at stake and what the issue \nis. It has nothing to do with whether or not a person has a legal right \nto an abortion. That is a debate for a different day.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from Washington was saying we are \nrestricting someone's right by not paying for an abortion, which posits \nthe interesting question that right now comes with a guarantee that the \nGovernment will pay for that right. We have freedom of speech \nguaranteed in the Constitution. Does the Government pay for someone who \nwants to speak? Do the taxpayers pay to put them on television if they \nwant to speak?\n  Mr. DeWINE. The answer is no.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If a group of people want to assemble, does the \nGovernment pay for a room or the assembly costs? Is that part of the \nright of speech--that the Government must pay for the cost of \nassembling?\n  Mr. DeWINE. The answer is no.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If someone believes in freedom of religion, does that \nmean the Government should pay the church to make sure people have the \nfreedom to worship, and make sure the freedom of religion is \nguaranteed?\n  Mr. DeWINE. The answer is no.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is the obvious question.\n  A right is a right, but it does not include the right of the \nGovernment to pay for the exercise of that right.\n  In fact, there could be complications--there is a separation of \nchurch and state--if the Government were to get involved in enforcing \nthose rights in this kind of way.\n  I think we set a very dangerous precedent when we elevate a right to \nthe point where the Government now has to pay for the access of that \nright or for the enforcement of that right. I think that is a dangerous \nstandard that the Senator from Washington has posited and one I hope \nthe Senate will reject tonight.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague for his comments.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from California.\n  I rise in agreement with the Senator from California against the \namendment of the Senator from Ohio. I make this argument--and I am \nsorry the Senator from Pennsylvania is not here--if I were to offer an \namendment that said you couldn't use your Federal dollars to buy a \nhandgun from your salary, there would be outrage on that side. They \nwould say: We haven't made handguns illegal.\n  You may think they should be. I don't, it so happens, but for the \nsake of argument you think handguns should be illegal. But fight it on \nthe issue of handguns, don't fight it by taking away Federal employees' \nrights.\n  There would be outrage from the very same people who are now saying \nthis.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from New York yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am delighted, on the time of the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We have retained the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Is there any prohibition in the DeWine amendment from \nsomeone using their own money to purchase insurance to cover abortion?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. To prohibit an individual to use their own wages to \npurchase insurance for abortions----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Whether one uses their own wages or is part of a \nFederal health plan, paid for, in fact by those wages----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator let me finish?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Over 70 percent is paid for by taxpayer dollars.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. What I say again, it is a specious difference to argue \nthat when you go out with your own dollars is any different from with a \nhealth plan.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Than with taxpayer dollars. That is a specious \ndifference? I don't think so.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. What the Senator from Ohio is seeking to do----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The answer is obvious.\n  I retain my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. There is no prohibition in the DeWine amendment for \nsomeone taking their own wages and purchasing insurance to cover \nabortion. That is the analogy the Senator made, and it is invalid. I \nwanted to make that clear.\n\n[[Page S8039]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from California for yielding to me \nto allow me to answer the question of the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nwhich is what I was attempting to do. He asked me a question, and he \ndidn't let me answer.\n  The answer is simple: What you are doing on this amendment is \nimposing your will on how a Federal employee can spend their money, \ndespite the fact they have a right to choose. It is no different, I \nargue, from me imposing my will on the right of a Federal employee to \nspend their money--Federal dollars--on the right to, say, buy a \nhandgun. What is good for the goose is good for the gander.\n  I wouldn't support that amendment for both the reasons I mention. I \nthink you argue right head on--not try to deal with Federal dollars. \nSecond, I am not for abolishing all handguns. However, I say to my \ncolleagues, the analogy is exact. I think it shows the fallacy of the \nargument behind the amendment of the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the DeWine amendment.\n  It has been 26 years since the Supreme Court decided the case of Roe \nversus Wade in 1973. That landmark decision recognized a woman's \nfundamental constitutional right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. \nIt removed the barriers that for generations had prevented large \nnumbers of American women from obtaining safe and legal medical care to \nterminate their pregnancies.\n  In recent years, however, the barriers blocking access to abortion \nhave begun to be rebuilt. This amendment to ban abortion coverage under \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan is part of that unacceptable \neffort.\n  Several million women currently serve the federal government in every \nstate of the nation. Many work for modest pay and depend upon federal \nhealth benefits for all aspects of their medical care, including \nreproductive health services. The amendment offered today would deny \nthose women access to a legal, medical procedure--a constitutional \nright--and subject them to discrimination, simply because they have \nchosen to work in public service.\n  The anti-choice Republican majority in Congress has failed to undo \nRoe and make abortion illegal. But, they are doing insidious work to \nmake abortion more difficult and more dangerous for the women of this \ncountry.\n  The most important majority in America--the majority of the American \npeople--believe in a woman's right to choose. They understand what the \nanti-choice leadership in the Republican Party is trying to do, and \nthey oppose it very strongly. We must do everything we can to uphold \nthis basic right of American women against this relentless attack.\n  A ban on abortion coverage under the federal health plan would \nundermine a woman's ability to make a decision on one of the most \npersonal, private, and difficult medical issues that will ever occur in \nher life. I urge my colleagues to vote against this ban, and preserve \nthe constitutional right to choose for all women who are federal \nemployees.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment offered by Senator DeWine.\n  The bill reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee would enable \nfederal employees, whose health insurance is provided under the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Plan, to receive coverage for abortion \nservices.\n  The DeWine amendment would prohibit coverage for abortion, except in \ncases of life endangerment, rape or incest. It would continue a ban \nwhich has prevented federal employees from receiving a health care \nservice which is widely available for private sector employees.\n  I oppose this Amendment for two reasons. First of all, it is an \nassault on the earned benefits of federal employees. Secondly, it is \npart of a continuing assault on women's reproductive rights and would \nendanger women's health.\n  We have seen vote after vote designed to roll back the clock on \nwomen's reproductive rights. Every year, on this Appropriations measure \nand on many others, the assault on a woman's constitutional right to \ndecide for herself whether or not to have a child continues. This \namendment continues that assault.\n  Well, I support the right to choose. And I support federal employees. \nAnd that is why I strenuously oppose this amendment.\n  Let me speak first about our federal employees. Some 280,000 federal \nemployees live in the State of Maryland. I am proud to represent them. \nThey are the people who make sure that the Social Security checks go \nout on time. They make sure that our nation's veterans receive their \ndisability checks. At NIH, they are doing vital research on finding \ncures and better treatments for diseases like cancer, Parkinson's and \nAlzheimers. There is no American whose life is not touched in some way \nby the hard work of a federal employee. They deserve our thanks and our \nsupport.\n  Instead, federal employees have suffered one assault after another in \nrecent years. They have faced tremendous employment insecurity, as \ngovernment has downsized, and eliminated over 200,000 federal jobs. \nTheir COLAs and their retirement benefits have been threatened. They \nhave faced the indignity and economic hardship of three government \nshutdowns. Federal employees have been vilified as what is wrong with \ngovernment, when they should be thanked and valued for the tremendous \nservice they provide to our country and to all Americans.\n  I view this amendment as yet another assault on these faithful public \nservants. It goes directly after the earned benefits of federal \nemployees. Health insurance is part of the compensation package to \nwhich all federal employees are entitled. The costs of insurance \ncoverage are shared by the federal government and the employee.\n  I know that proponents of continuing the ban on abortion coverage for \nfederal employees say that they are only trying to prevent taxpayer \nfunding of abortion. But that is not what this debate is about.\n  If we were to extend the logic of the argument of those who favor the \nban, we would prohibit federal employees from obtaining abortions using \ntheir own paychecks. After all, those funds also come from the \ntaxpayers.\n  But no one is seriously suggesting that federal employees ought not \nto have the right to do whatever they want with their own paychecks. \nAnd we should not be placing unfair restrictions on the type of health \ninsurance federal employees can purchase under the Federal Employee \nHealth Benefit Plan.\n  About 1.2 million women of reproductive age depend on the FEHBP for \ntheir medical care. We know that access to reproductive health services \nis essential to women's health. We know that restrictions that make it \nmore difficult for women to obtain early abortions increase the \nlikelihood that women will put their health at risk by being forced to \ncontinue a high-risk pregnancy.\n  If we continue the ban on abortion services, and provide exemptions \nonly in cases of life endangerment, rape or incest, the 1.2 million \nwomen of reproductive health age who depend on the FEHBP will not have \naccess to abortion even when their health is seriously threatened. We \nwill be replacing the informed judgement of medical care givers with \nthat of politicians.\n  Decisions on abortion should be made by the woman in close \nconsultation with her physician. These decisions should be made on the \nbasis of medical judgement, not on the basis of political judgements. \nOnly a woman and her physician can weigh her unique circumstances and \nmake the decision that is right for that particular woman's life and \nhealth.\n  It is wrong for the Congress to try to issue a blanket prohibition on \ninsuring a legal medical procedure with no allowance for the particular \nset of circumstances that an individual woman may face. I deeply \nbelieve that women's health will suffer if we do so.\n  I believe it is time to quit attacking federal employees and their \nbenefits. I believe we need to quit treating federal employees as \nsecond class citizens. I believe federal employees should be able to \nreceive the same quality and range of health care services as their \nprivate sector counterparts.\n  Because I believe in the right to choose and because I support \nfederal employees, I urge my colleagues to join me in defeating the \nDeWine Amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S8040]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 12 minutes 57 seconds under the \ncontrol of the Senator from Ohio and 8 minutes 2 seconds under the \ncontrol of the Senator from California.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield the Senator from Oklahoma 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. On legislative procedure, I have advised my colleagues \non both sides to go through the Chair. I think it is somewhat demeaning \nto the Senate to not have exchanges through the Chair. There is a \nreason for the rule.\n  I will make a couple of comments concerning this issue. I compliment \nmy friend and colleague from Ohio for raising the issue. This is not \nabout how someone spends their own money, I say to my colleague from \nNew York. Anybody can spend their own money. A Federal employee can \nspend their own money and pay for an abortion.\n  It says ``no funds appropriated under this act.'' In other words, no \ntaxpayer money shall be used to pay for abortion. That has been the law \nof the land. We have passed that many times. This administration wants \nto overturn it. They have not been successful.\n  I heard one of my colleagues, I believe my colleague from Washington, \nsay it is only a minority, a radical minority. I am not sure if the \nword ``radical'' was used, but a small minority that wants to impose \nits will.\n  That is not the case. There was a poll taken some time ago that \nasked, ``Should the Government subsidize health care plans to pay for \nabortion?'' and 72 percent said no.\n  I have heard people say: You are trying to outlaw abortion.\n  That is not the case.\n  The purpose of the amendment is, we do not want to subsidize abortion \nand we don't want it to be a fringe benefit.\n  I heard a colleague saying this is a ``benefit.'' It shouldn't be a \nbenefit. Abortion should not be a fringe benefit that is provided for \nand subsidized, three-fourths of which is paid for by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Remember what we are talking about. Abortion happens to take the life \nof an unborn child.\n  I heard a colleague say we need a full range of reproductive \nservices, we need reproductive health. What about health of the unborn \nchild? Are we going to have the taxpayers pay to destroy the life of an \nunborn child? The majority in Congress and overwhelming majority of the \nAmerican people have said no.\n  That is what our colleague's amendment does. It does not take away a \nwoman's right to choose. It does not outlaw abortion. It just says we \nshould not subsidize it. We should not be using taxpayers' money to \nprovide a fringe benefit in the Federal employees' health care plans to \nhelp subsidize the destruction of innocent, unborn children.\n  So I compliment my colleague for the amendment. I urge my colleagues \nto support this amendment when we vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator from Oklahoma yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield on the time of the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Based on the argument he just made, would the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma then be in favor of repealing all tax benefits--tax \nsubsidies or tax benefits to corporations in America that offer general \nhealth care plans to their employees?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Those that include abortions.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The answer to your question is no.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would argue then that this argument makes no sense \nbecause this Senate and this Congress gives hundreds of millions, \nbillions of dollars in subsidies to corporations all over this world \nthat provide health care benefits. I will also argue that the Senator \nfrom California is correct; this is picking on a small group of \nemployees.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield an additional minute to my friend.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. In my mind, this amendment is not really about abortion \none way or the other. It really is about the rights of employees, our \nemployees who we are supposed to protect and treat fairly, men and \nwomen alike. It is not about direct subsidy. This is their wages that \nthey earn, that they use to pay for their health care benefits. Since \nwe give subsidies to all corporations everywhere, why can't we help our \nown employees for something that is legal? I reserve the remainder of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 6 minutes 32 \nseconds. The Senator from Ohio has 10 minutes 23 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 2 minutes to my friend from Minnesota. Before I \ndo, I want to make a point. If you heard the Senator from Oklahoma, you \nheard it right. He says abortion is not a health fringe benefit. He \nsays it is taking the life of an unborn child. In other words, in his \nopinion it is murder.\n  Unfortunately for my friend----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield on your time. I am happy to yield on your \ntime. I will yield on your time.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield the Senator 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Through the Chair, I want to caution my colleague. I \nhave been close to making a rule XIX order. It is against the rules of \nthe Senate to impugn the motives or the intentions of Senators, and the \nSenator from California has been very close to doing that, both to the \nSenator from Ohio and now to the Senator from Oklahoma. I wanted to \nmake her aware of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Oklahoma has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me strongly disagree with my friend from Oklahoma. I \nam merely quoting him. I would be happy to ask the Chair to have read \nback his exact quote. He said abortion is not a fringe benefit. It is \ntaking the life of an unborn child. Therein lies this debate. That is \nwhat he believes. He has said it in his own words.\n  I say to him that a woman's right to choose is legal. It is a legal \nhealth benefit for her to have that option. And to take it away from \n1.2 million women who happen to be Federal employees and then to stand \nup here and say no, you wouldn't take it away from women who work for \ncorporations, even though they get billions of dollars in subsidies, is \nan inconsistent position, in my view.\n  I yield 2 minutes to my friend from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank my \ncolleagues for speaking on this. I actually will be very brief. I just \nwant to make one point.\n  The Senator from Ohio is a good friend. We have worked together on \nmany issues. I just see it a little differently.\n  I really do believe we are talking about a health benefit that the \nFederal employees have negotiated. This is a part of their package. It \nis the same thing as the salary they make.\n  What the Senate is trying to say to employees, or workers, is we are \ngoing to take away that benefit. We are going to take away your health \nbenefit. From the point of view of a lot of working people and from the \npoint of view of just thinking about it, from the point of view of \nemployers and employees, I do not think that is what we should be \ndoing. I do not think that is what we should be doing. I think it is a \nmistake in terms of what kind of respect we have for labor. I think it \nis a mistake in terms of the kind of respect we should have for \nemployees. I do not think on the floor of the Senate we should try to \ntake action to take away a benefit, a very important benefit--access to \nabortion services--from Federal employees. I think that is a profound \nmistake. I hope my colleagues will vote against this.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, not to take time, but I ask unanimous \nconsent that Rachel Gragg and Ben\n\n[[Page S8041]]\n\nHighton, who are two fellows, be granted the privilege of the floor. I \nreserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who \nyields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 3 minutes 46 \nseconds. The Senator from Ohio has 9 minutes 58 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I ask if the Senator would like to use his time?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I see no speakers on our side. I am not prepared to yield \nback, but we are getting down to the closing at this point.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield a minute and a half to Senator Robb.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I have not been present for all of the \ndebate this time, but this issue has been before us many times in the \npast. I stand to oppose the amendment and to speak on behalf of the 1.2 \nmillion Federal employees who would be directly affected by the \namendment. If this amendment were to pass, it would take away their \nhealth benefit rights which have been negotiated. The bottom line is, \nand I say this as one who represents a disproportionate number of \nFederal employees, this would make Federal employees, women who are \neligible for this health benefit, second-class citizens. It would deny \nto them a benefit that is available to every other woman under every \nother private health plan that chooses to offer such coverage. I think \nit would be wrong.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time, and I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Washington for their extraordinary \nleadership, again, on this very important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator from Ohio yield me 3 minutes?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield the Senator from Utah 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I shall try to stay out of the more \ncontentious part of this debate. But there is a point I think I have to \nmake which has to do with the whole health care issue. That is, the \nhealth care system in this country is based on employer choice, not \nindividual choice. I have spoken out against that. I did it during the \ndebate on the Clintons' health care program. I have not made much \nheadway, but this debate gives me the opportunity to point out, once \nagain, that the benefits in a health care plan are always determined by \nthe employer and not by the employee.\n  During the debate over the Clinton health care plan, people would say \nwe should give everybody the same plan that you Senators have. I \nresponded by saying I wish I had the same plan I had before I came to \nthe Senate because I worked for an employer who gave me a better deal \nthan the health care plan adopted by the Federal Government. I happened \nto be the CEO of that company. I, therefore, had something to say about \nwhat that deal would be.\n  I know of health care plans that deny pregnancy benefits. I would not \nwant to work in such a place, having fathered six children. I took \ngreat advantage of the pregnancy benefits. But an employer could say \nand does often say: We can't afford pregnancy benefits. If you are \ngoing to have a baby, you are going to have to pay for it yourself.\n  Fortunately, during the period of time when I had no health care \ncoverage because my employer could not afford it, we did not have any \nchildren. We had our six children under plans that provided pregnancy \nbenefits. But it is not unusual for benefits to vary from company to \ncompany, from employer to employer, and for the employer to make the \ndecision.\n  The decision will be made on the basis of the conscience of \nindividual Senators. But let us understand that as the employers of \nFederal employees, we are not engaged in any unusual activity to make a \ndecision as to which procedures will be covered and which will not, and \nthere are a whole host of procedures in the Government health care plan \nthat are not covered for which other plans pay.\n  That is the way the system works. I would like to change the system \nand give the individual the right to control those dollars absolutely, \nbut I know of no program under our current tax laws where that is done, \nexcept in the case of the self-employed. Unfortunately, within this \nChamber, we have made the decision not to allow the self-employed to \ndeduct the entire cost of that decision.\n  I add those particular facts to this debate, trying to stay out of \nthe more emotional side of it. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time do we have left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 2 minutes 21 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield myself such time as I might consume.\n  Mr. President, abortion is legal in this country, and I know there \nare many on the other side particularly who do not like that. But it is \nlegal. It is a health procedure that impacts on the rights of women, \nand the Supreme Court has said over and over it is legal.\n  This amendment by the Senator from Ohio, supported by the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania and others, picks on women. It picks on a procedure \nonly a woman would need. And it says to that woman: You cannot use your \nown health insurance to access the health care system for a procedure \nthat you decide you want to have because it is legal in this country.\n  This amendment does not say you cannot use your health care insurance \nfor a vasectomy. It does not target men and say you cannot use your own \nhealth insurance for a vasectomy. Some may not like that procedure. It \ndoes not say you cannot use your health insurance for Viagra. No, it \npicks on women, 1.2 million women.\n  My friend from Louisiana pointed out that corporations all over \nAmerica offer their employees this benefit. We subsidize them every day \nwith tax breaks and sometimes even direct payments, and yet we do not \ntouch them. We are picking on 1.2 million women who work for the \nFederal Government. It is wrong. These are good women. These are hard-\nworking women. They deserve equal rights. They deserve dignity.\n  I hope some are listening to this debate and will come over and vote \nno, or if I move to table, will vote aye to table this amendment.\n  I reserve whatever few seconds I may have left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. How much time \nis available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 6 minutes 40 seconds \nand the Senator from California has 2 seconds.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Two seconds?\n  Mr. President, this matter has been debated out, and I believe \neveryone knows what the issue is. It is really not a question, though, \nof taking anything away from Federal employees. As I pointed out \nearlier, my amendment simply maintains the status quo. It keeps the \ncurrent law. It keeps the law that has been in effect virtually for the \nlast decade, with the exception of a 2-year period of time. It does not \ntake anything away.\n  It simply says taxpayers' dollars will not be used to subsidize the \npayment for abortions. The vast majority of the American people do not \nbelieve their tax dollars should be used to pay for someone else's \nabortion. Poll after poll has disclosed that. That is all this \namendment does.\n  My amendment would maintain the status quo that limits Federal \nemployee health plans to cover abortions only in the case of rape, \nincest and threats to the life of a mother. That is what the amendment \ndoes. It is very simple. We have voted on it time and time again.\n  I simply ask my colleagues to follow the will of the American people. \nThe American people are the employer in this case. As my colleague from \nUtah pointed out so very eloquently a moment ago, that is the way every \nother health plan is determined. The taxpayers of this country have the \nright to determine this plan, and they have the right to say their tax \ndollars will not be used to fund abortions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to table the DeWine amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table is not in order while time \nremains.\n\n[[Page S8042]]\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. If the Senator wants to yield back her 2 seconds, I am \nwilling to yield back the several minutes I have left.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to table the DeWine amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1200. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, there are a number of amendments that \nSenator Campbell and I have discussed, which we are prepared to accept. \nHe has a number of them he will mention.\n  Let me mention the amendments by number that we are prepared to \naccept:\n  No. 1209, by Senator Harkin, and he will be modifying that in a \nmoment; amendment No. 1213, by Senator Torricelli; amendment No. 1212, \nby Senator Wellstone; amendment No. 1198, by Senator Enzi.\n  My understanding is that the remaining amendments that are pending \nwill be withdrawn. My understanding, also, is that there is no request \nat this point for a recorded vote on final passage.\n  I am happy to yield to the chairman, Senator Campbell.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, the amendments Senator Dorgan mentioned \nhave been cleared with the majority, and we are prepared to accept \nthem.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I amend that to say that the Torricelli \namendment, No. 1213, will be accepted as modified, and it is the same \ncase with the Harkin amendment, No. 1209, as modified. That has been \ncleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  My understanding, at the moment, is that Senator Schumer from New \nYork is not able to clear the Torricelli sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nNo. 1213.\n  So we have cleared all of the remaining amendments that Senator \nCampbell and I have just described: No. 1209, a Harkin amendment, as \nmodified; No. 1212 by Senator Wellstone; and No. 1198 by Senator Enzi.\n\n\n             Amendments Nos. 1198, 1209, And 1212, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I am offering this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Daschle, Senator Graham, Senator Bingaman, Senator \nMurray, and Senator Johnson. Our amendment is simple and I believe \nmakes common sense. It would give a needed shot in the arm to our war \nagainst drugs by modestly increasing funding for the High Intensity \nDrug Trafficking Areas--so-called HIDTAs--under the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy.\n  The bill before us freezes funding for this important and successful \nprogram. It provides no increases for the existing 31 HIDTAs across the \nNation and it provides no funding for new HIDTAs. Our amendment would \nincrease HIDTA funding by $17 million. It would provide $7 million to \ncombat the rising scourge of methamphetamine abuse. It would\n\n[[Page S8043]]\n\nprovide $5 million to increase existing HIDTAs. And it would allot $5 \nmillion to allow the establishment and funding of new HIDTAs.\n  I fully recognize the challenges faced by the distinguished chair and \nranking member of this Subcommittee. They were dealt a bad check and \nthey have done a commendable job within the allocation they were given. \nHowever, we believe that we have found a reasonable offset--one that \nwill not undermine the effective functioning of the government.\n  We would take $17 million--less then 2.5 percent from the General \nServices Administration account dedicated to the repair and alterations \nof federal government buildings. There is $624 million in this account \nand over $300 million of its goes for unspecified projects. I have no \ndoubt that much of these funds are needed, but clearly $17 million \ncould be absorbed or a short deferral of a project could be made in \norder to make room for a modest increase in our war on drugs.\n  The need for this increase in the HIDTA program could not be clearer, \nparticularly as it relates to combating methamphetamine abuse.\n  There is a plague sweeping across our Nation, ruining an untold \nnumber of lives, and claiming countless numbers of our children.\n  On our streets as well as well as our classrooms, drugs have become \nmore abundant. But there is a new drug, one that is far more addictive \nand readily available than heroin, cocaine, or any other illegal \nnarcotic. Methamphetamine is fast becoming the leading addictive drug \nin this nation. From quiet suburbs, to city streets, to the corn rows \nof Iowa, meth is destroying thousands of lives every year. A majority \nof those lives, unfortunately, are our children.\n  Methamphetamine is commonly referred to as Iowa's drug of choice. \nThis drug is reaching epidemic proportions as its sweeps from the west \ncoast, ravages through the Midwest, and is now beginning to reach the \neast. The trail of destruction of human life as a result of \nmethamphetamine addiction stretches across America from coast to coast.\n  To illustrate the violence meth elicits in people, methamphetamine is \ncited as a contributing factor in 80 percent of domestic violence cases \nin Iowa and a leading factor in a majority of violent crimes.\n  The $17 million we provide would be used for increased enforcement \nand prosecution of drug dealers, additional undercover agents, and to \nhelp pay for the tremendous cost of confiscation and clean up of \nclandestine meth labs.\n  I believe that we have a window of opportunity as a nation to take a \nstand right now to defeat the meth scourge plaguing our nation. Our \namendment will not solve all of these problems, but it will give law \nenforcement the support that they vitally need in their efforts to \ndefeat this dangerous drug.\n  While we debate this modest proposal, another family is being \ndevastated, another community is fighting an uphill battle, and another \nchild is getting hooked by this deadly drug. The time is now to make a \nstand to protect our communities and schools by passing this important \namendment. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1212\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n   provide bonus grants to high performance States based on certain \n criteria and collect data to evaluate the outcome of welfare reform, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1282, the \nTreasury and General Government Appropriations bill for FY 2000, as \nreported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman and the ranking member for \nbringing the Senate a carefully crafted spending bill within the \nSubcommittee's 302(b) allocation and consistent with the discretionary \nspending caps for FY 2000.\n  The pending bill provides $27.6 billion in budget authority and $24.7 \nbillion in new outlays for FY 2000 to fund the programs of the \nDepartment of the Treasury, including the Internal Revenue Service, \nU.S. Customs Service, and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the \nExecutive Office of the President; the Postal Service; and related \nindependent agencies. With outlays from prior-years and other completed \nactions, the Senate bill totals $27.8 billion in budget authority and \n$28.2 billion in outlays.\n  For discretionary spending, which represents just under half the \nfunding in the bill, the Senate bill is at the Subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation for budget authority, and it is $109 million in outlays \nbelow the 302(b) allocation. The Senate bill is $0.5 billion in both BA \nand outlays below the President's budget request.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  S. 1282 TREASURY-POSTAL APPROPRIATIONS, 2000--SPENDING COMPARISONS--\n                          SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n               [Fiscal year 2000, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General             Man-\n                                     purpose   Crime    datory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-Reported Bill:\n  Budget authority................   13,204      194    14,385   27,783\n  Outlays.........................   13,708      128    14,394   28,230\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority................   13,204      194    14,385   27,783\n  Outlays.........................   13,817      128    14,394   28,339\n1999 level:\n  Budget authority................   13,889      132    13,439   27,460\n  Outlays.........................   12,762      131    13,439   26,332\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority................   13,792      132    14,385   28,309\n  Outlays.........................   14,247      127    14,394   28,768\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority................  ........  .......  .......  ........\n  Outlays.........................  ........  .......  .......  ........\n \nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority................  ........  .......  .......  ........\n  Outlays.........................

Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of this bill \nfor their hard work in putting forth this legislation which provides \nfederal funding for numerous vital programs. However, I am sad to say, \nonce again, I find myself in the unpleasant position of speaking about \nunacceptable levels of parochial projects in another appropriations \nbill.\n  I have asked rhetorically on the floor of the Senate many times when \nwe are going to stop this destructive and irresponsible practice of \nearmarking special-interest pork-barrel projects in appropriations \nbills primarily for parochial reasons. I have yet to receive an answer \nand this practice has neither stopped nor slowed. Last year's Treasury \nPostal Appropriations bill contained well over $826 million in \nspecifically earmarked pork-barrel spending. This year's bill is a \ndrastic improvement over last year's bill in that it only contains a \nlittle over $293.6 million in wasteful, pork-barrel spending. $293.6 \nmillion of waste is much better than $826 million of waste, but waste \nis still waste.\n  Where does all this pork go? Well, as usual, this bill contains \nmillions on top of millions for court house construction and repairs. \nWe have $11,606,000 earmarked for repairs and alterations to the Frank \nM. Johnson, Jr. Federal Building--U.S. Courthouse in Montgomery, \nAlabama, and $21,098,000 for repairs and alterations to the Federal \nBuilding--U.S. Courthouse Annex in Anchorage, Alaska. I know that these \ncourt houses may be in dire need of repair and modernization. But are \nthese particular projects more important than the litany of other court \nhouses competing for funding? The process by which these two earmarks \nwere added makes it impossible to assess the relative merit of these \nprograms against all other priority needs.\n  In addition to earmarks for court houses, this bill contains the \nusual earmarks of money for locality-specific projects such as: \n$500,000 for the State Patrol Digital Distance Learning project to help \nthe Nebraska State Patrol create computer-based training programs, and \n$250,000 to the Fort Buford reconstruction project for planning and \ndesign of the reconstruction of this Fort--a Lewis and Clark ``Corps of \nDiscovery'' site.\n  Then there are the many sections of the report which have language \nstrongly urging various Departments of the Federal Government to \nrecognize or participate in a joint-venture with a particular project \nin a state. While these objectionable provisions have no direct \nmonetary effect on the bill, this not-so-subtle ``urging'' is sure to \nhave some financial benefit for someone or some enterprise in a \nmember's home state. For example: Report language urging the \ncontinuation and expansion of the collaboration between the University \nof North Dakota and the Customs Service for rotorcraft training, and \nreport language urging GSA to strongly consider the U.S. Olympic \nCommittee's need for additional space and to give priority to the \nUSOC's request to gain title or acquire the property located at 1520 \nWillamette Avenue in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n  This bill also selects particular sites across the country for which \nthe report language either provides additional spending for extra staff \nand personnel, or ``urges'' the Agency not to reduce its staff. For \nexample: $750,000 for part-time and temporary positions in the Honolulu \nCustoms District, Report language designating the Hector International \nAirport as an International Port of Entry, to be adequately staffed and \nequipped so that the users of the facility are provided efficient \nservices, and report language directing the Customs Service to ensure \nthat staffing levels are sufficient to staff and operate all New Mexico \nborder facilities.\n  Why are these facilities protected at a time when each agency is \nrequired to abide by the Government Program Reduction Act which \nmandates that they operate more efficiently with less bureaucracy? Even \nif these positions are critical, why are they not prioritized in the \nnormal administrative process?\n  Everyone knows that we are very close to breaking the spending caps. \nWe have not done so as of yet. I hope my colleagues understand that \njust because we can fund these programs of questionable merit within \nthe spending caps, that does not mean we have the right to spend tax \npayers' hard-earned dollars in such an irresponsible fashion.\n  I am constantly amazed by the arbitrary fashion by which the \nAppropriations Committee chooses to allocate the dollars that should be \nspent only\n\n[[Page S8046]]\n\nfor important and necessary federal programs.\n  The examples of wasteful spending that I have highlighted in this \nfloor statement is just the tip of the iceberg. There are many more \nlow-priority, wasteful, and unnecessary projects on the extensive list \nI have compiled, and I ask unanimous consent that the list be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nObjectionable Provisions Contained in S. 1282 the Treasury Department, \n     the United States Postal Service, the Executive Office of the \n    President, and Certain Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill.\n\n\n                             bill language\n\n     Department of the Treasury\n       $9,200,000 for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center \n     for construction of two firearms ranges at the Artesia Center \n     in NM.\n       $900,000 is earmarked for a land grant university in North \n     and/or South Dakota to conduct a research program on the \n     United States/Canadian bilateral trade of agricultural \n     commodities and products.\n       $150,000 for official reception and representation expenses \n     associated with hosting the Inter-American Center of Tax \n     Administration (CIAT) 2000 Conference.\n     Independent agencies\n       An earmark of $35,000,000 in Montgomery County, Maryland, \n     for FDA Consolidation.\n       $8,263,000 is earmarked for new construction of a border \n     station in Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan.\n       $753,000 for new construction of a border station in \n     Roosville, Montana.\n       An $11,480,000 earmark for new construction of a border \n     station in Sweetgrass, Montana.\n       $277,000 for new construction of a border station in Fort \n     Hancock, Texas.\n       $11,206,000 for new construction of a border station in \n     Oroville, Washington.\n       $11,606,000 is earmarked for repairs and alterations to the \n     Frank M.

In closing, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \nCapitol and on both sides of the aisle to develop a better standard \nwhich curbs our habit of funneling hard-earned taxpayer dollars to \nlocality-specific special interests.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to express my \nsupport for Courthouse Construction funding for the U.S. federal \ncourthouse in Erie, Pennsylvania. This courthouse is in dire need of \nrepair, and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has placed the \nErie Federal Courthouse on its priority list, and the General Services \nAdministration is in the final stages of completing the design for the \nrefurbished complex, which will be ready for construction in FY2000. \nSpecifically, this project involves the alteration of the existing Erie \nFederal Building, the acquisition, repair and alteration of the \nadjacent Erie County Library building for the bankruptcy court and \ncourt of appeals; and the construction of a new courthouse annex for \nthe district court. The current courthouse provides inadequate space \nand is not consolidated in a single location, presenting logistical and \nsecurity concerns for jurors, judges, attorneys, and the public. The \nproject, which will be a major step in the revitalization of downtown \nErie, will rely substantially on the rehabilitation of existing \nstructures as opposed to more costly, new construction.\n  I understand that the President's budget did not include funding for \ncourthouse construction for the third consecutive year. This failure to \nprovide funding for the needs of our judicial system is a serious \noversight that should not stand in the way of the safety and security \nof my constituents in Erie.\n  I look forward to working with the Chairman of the Treasury and \nGeneral Government Subcommittee, Senator Campbell, and my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, to ensure that this project \nreceives funding as soon as possible. In the meantime, I urge the \nGeneral Services Administration to take any necessary actions to \nrectify safety concerns or logistical problems that may result from \nthis lapse in funding.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I welcome the comments by the Senator from Pennsylvania \nand look forward to continuing to work with him on this request. I am \nwell aware of the importance he places on the proposed improvements to \nthe Erie Federal Courthouse and recognize the significance of timely \naction on this request.\n\n\n              fy2000 appropriations for the hidta program\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S. \n1282, the Fiscal Year 2000 Treasury, Postal Service, and General \nGovernment Appropriations bill. In particular, I commend the Senate \nAppropriations Committee for its support of the High Intensity Drug \nTrafficking Area program within this legislation.\n  The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program was established in \n1988 to assist state and local governments to investigate, prosecute \nand prevent illegal drug production and trafficking. Since 1990, the \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy has designated twenty-six \nregions of the nation as High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas. Most \nrecently, the States of Ohio, Oregon, and Hawaii were among those areas \ngranted HIDTA status to help improve coordination of drug control \nefforts.\n  Unfortunately, communities in my home state of Minnesota continue to \nbe threatened by drug abuse and illegal drug trafficking, particularly \nmethamphetamine. In recent years, methamphetamine has become the drug \nof choice throughout Minnesota, and is closely associated with \nincreased violent crime. In my recent meeting with Office of National \nDrug Control Policy Director General Barry McCaffrey, he referred to \nmethamphetamine as ``the worst drug that ever hit America.''\n  The alarming rate of meth production and trafficking has been caused \nby small, independent organizations that run clandestine laboratories \nin apartment complexes, farms, motel rooms and residences with \ninexpensive, over-the-counter-materials. The secretive nature of the \nmanufacturing process involves toxic chemicals, and frequently results \nin fires, damaging explosions, and destruction to our environment. A \nconstituent from Benson, Minnesota underscored the devastating effects \nof illegal meth production when he wrote, ``The resultant crime and \naddition problems are destroying small and mid-sized rural \ncommunities.''\n  The high volume of meth trafficking in Minnesota has also placed \nenormous strain on the resources of those federal and state law \nenforcement agencies investigating abuse of this deadly substance. In \n1998, for example, task forces from Freeborn County, Hennepin County, \nand Washington County seized a total of fourteen meth labs, an increase \nfrom five seizures in 1997. In 1998, the Minneapolis-St. Paul Resident \nOffice of the Drug Enforcement Agency seized more than 200 pounds of \nmeth, compared to 67 pounds seized in 1997.\n  Mr. President, Minnesota's local law enforcement community has begun \nto strengthen its strategy for combating illegal drug use. By September \n1, a committee that includes representatives from the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice, the Minnesota Sheriffs Association, the Minnesota Attorney \nGeneral's Office, and the Minnesota Department of Public Safety will \nsubmit its proposed HIDTA initiative to the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy.\n  When this designation is granted, Minnesota will receive federal \nassistance to improve antidrug efforts currently underway by local \nprosecutors, sheriffs, police chiefs and state law enforcement \nofficials. I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, a \ncomplete list of the federal and state agencies developing this \nproposal be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, over the last several months, I have also \nworked to focus attention on the value of the HIDTA program to \ncommunities throughout Minnesota. This past Spring, I presented the \nneed for a ``Minnesota HIDTA'' to Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy Director Barry McCaffrey during the May edition of my monthly \ncable television program. As the administrator of the HIDTA program, \nGeneral McCaffrey clearly understands that although law enforcement is \nprimarily a local responsibility, the federal government can support \nthe ability of local law enforcement to investigate and prosecute \nserious drug offenders.\n  I am pleased to have included a provision within S. 899, ``The 21st \nCentury Justice Act'' that underscores the need for additional federal \nantidrug resources in Minnesota. This provision directs the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy to establish a ``Northern Border High \nIntensity Drug Trafficking Area'' that would include the State of \nMinnesota. It also authorizes $2.7 million in Fiscal Year 2000 to \nimproving coordination of antidrug efforts currently underway by local \nprosecutors, sheriffs, police chiefs, and state law enforcement \nofficials.\n  Again, I commend the Senate for its support for the High Intensity \nDrug Trafficking Area program. I will continue to work with law \nenforcement officials, my colleagues in the Senate, and the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy to ensure that localities have the \nassistance they need to protect our communities from crime and drug \nabuse.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n       United States Attorney's Office-District of Minnesota\n       Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms\n       Drug Enforcement Administration\n       Federal Bureau of Investigation\n       Hennepin County Sheriffs Office\n       Internal Revenue Service/CID\n       Minnesota Department of Criminal Apprehension\n       Minnesota Attorney General's Office\n       Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association\n       Minnesota Department of Public Safety\n       Minnesota Sheriffs Association\n       Minnesota State Patrol\n       St. Paul Police Department\n       United States Customs, Office of Enforcement\n       United States Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am concerned about a $257,000,000 \ndecrease in appropriated funding for the United States Customs Service. \nLast year, Congress aided this agency through the Omnibus and Emergency \nSupplemental\n\n[[Page S8048]]\n\nAppropriations, that devotes a large percentage of its aggregate budget \nto preventing the smuggling of Narcotics into the United States, with \nan additional $265,000,000. The Appropriations committee, this year, \nalso recognizing the need of the Customs Service to react to changing \nsmuggling modes and complex money laundering schemes increased the \nCustoms Service total funding by $315,000,000. This is $315,000,000 \nover the President's budget estimate and Congress needs to maintain \nthis effort. Drug trafficking is a never-ending battle. The demand for \nillegal drugs in the United States remains strong. The U.S. Customs \nService is one of our front line drug enforcement agencies that \nprotects America's borders every day from professional drug traffickers \nand money launders. Congress needs to fully and adequately fund the \nsalaries and expenses and needed modernization for one of our major \nfirst line counter-drug agencies.\n  I am aware of the hard choices the Committee had to make in coming up \nwith the current funding level for Customs. But I strongly feel that we \nmust do more. Not only has legal trade expanded dramatically but so has \nillegal drug trafficking and alien smuggling. We have not supported the \nmodernization or expansion of Customs to keep pace. We cannot maintain \nour commitment to fighting the smuggling of illegal drugs without more \nand better.\n\n\n professional liability insurance coverage for senior federal employees\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have offered an amendment to the \nTreasury, Postal and General Government Appropriations bill to ensure \nthat federal managers and law enforcement officials in all federal \ndepartments and agencies receive the same benefits concerning \nprofessional liability insurance. Today, several federal departments \ncontribute to the costs of professional liability insurance for federal \nmanagers and law enforcement officials. Other large federal departments \ndo not contribute to assisting federal managers obtain this insurance.\n  This professional liability insurance is essential as many federal \nmanagers are personally absorbing the significant costs of obtaining \nlegal representation in cases where complaints have been brought \nagainst. Often, allegations have been made by citizens, against whom \nfederal officials were enforcing the law and by employees who had \nperformance or conduct problems.\n  I have been working with Chairman Cochran of the Government Affairs \nSubcommittee on International Security, Proliferation and Federal \nServices to address this important issue and I welcome his views on \nthis matter.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I agree with Senator Warner that this is an issue that \nmust be addressed. In prior action, the Congress provided the authority \nfor federal departments and agencies to contribute one-half of the \ncosts of obtaining professional liability insurance for federal \nmanagers and law enforcement officials. Unfortunately, this benefit has \nnot been offered by all federal departments. I am committed to working \nwith Senator Warner to address this issue and to ensure that all \nfederal managers and law enforcement officials are treated fairly.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank Chairman Cochran for his attention to this issue. \nThis is an important matter that is critical to ensuring that the \nfederal government can attract and retain qualified professionals in \nfederal service.\n  At this time I will withdraw my amendment and look forward to working \nwith Chairman Cochran, Chairman Thompson and other members of the \nGovernment Affairs Committee.\n\n\n                Federal Law Enforcement Training Center\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I want to clarify with the ranking member \nof the Treasury Appropriations Subcommittee the intent of this bill \nregarding its appropriation of $80.1 million for salaries and expenses \nat the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) located in \nGlynco, GA. This appropriation is $6 million less than the $86 million \nfor salaries initially requested by FLETC. It is my understanding that \nthe lion's share of this reduction is simply the result of a \nreadjustment based on what the Subcommittee and Committee believe will \nbe the actual workload at FLETC and not an indication of the \nCommittee's intent that there be any reduction in FLETC's ability to \nfulfill its mission. Does the Senator care to comment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is correct. The $6 million reduction is the \nresult of the Subcommittee's re-estimation of the likely workload at \nFLETC combined with a small across-the-board cut on all salaries \ncovered by the Treasury Department appropriations bill.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator. Should the actual workload at FLETC \nresult in an appropriations need beyond what is provided for in this \nbill, does the Senator believe that the committee would consider \nalternative funding sources to ensure FLETC could fulfill its mission?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The committee recognizes FLETC's important role in \nproviding quality training to the nation's law enforcement personnel, \nand it is fully supportive of providing the funding necessary for the \ncenter to effectively carry out the mission for which it was created.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senators for their comments and the \nranking member for his commitment to FLETC. It is important that \nCongress preserve FLETC's intent and function and I am glad to know \nthat this bill continues Congressional support for, and commitment to, \nthis important training center. I ask Chairman Campbell if he cares to \ncomment on this matter.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Yes, and I echo the sentiments of the ranking member. \nThe amount appropriated by the Committee for salaries and expenses does \nnot indicate a lower level of support for FLETC. The Senators are \ncorrect in their understanding of this matter and the Committee will \ncontinue efforts to preserve consolidated federal law enforcement \ntraining at FLETC.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I would like to clarify with the \nchairman the intent of this bill regarding the Federal Law Enforcement \nTraining Center and its facilities in Glynco, GA. Is it the Chairman's \nbelief that the appropriations bill now before this body, S. 1282, \npreserves the intent and function of FLETC and takes the appropriate \nsteps to move forward with FLETC's five year modernization plan?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Senator for his question. Yes, I do believe \nthat this bill preserves the intent and function of FLETC. FLETC serves \nan important role for federal law enforcement training and through this \nbill I have taken steps to help it toward completion of its five year \nplan.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the chairman. I understand that $4.6 million \nhas been funded in FLETC's base construction account and the Committee \nis directing the Treasury Department to use the money for a chilled \nwater system expansion at FLETC's facility in Glynco, GA even though it \nwas not specifically mentioned in the bill or report language.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. The Senator is correct. These funds along with $900,000 \nfor the completion of a new classroom in Artesia, NM will complete \nFLETC's fiscal year 2000 5-year plan funding requirements and will keep \nthe effort to expand FLETC's capacity moving forward and on time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the chairman for his support of this important \nprogram and for his commitment to FLETC's modernization effort.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the two Senators for their statement. I am very \npleased that this bill continues the commitment of the Committee, and \nthe Subcommittee, to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. FLETC \nis a model state-of-the-art facility which is critical to the training \nof our Nation's law enforcement personnel.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I would like to engage the esteemed \nchairman on a matter important to out Nation's Federal law enforcement \ntraining and the Glynco, GA site at which this training is conducted. \nAs the chairman knows, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center was \ndeveloped to consolidate federal law enforcement training. This was \ndone to ensure efficiency, prevent redundancy, and save taxpayer \ndollars. The Chairman is also aware that FLETC has a five year plan for \nits sites in Artesia, NM and Glynco, GA to modernize the facilities and \naddress a training overflow issue. I understand that the Chairman's \nbill preserves FLETC's intent and keeps the five-year plan moving\n\n[[Page S8049]]\n\ninto the next fiscal year. Understanding the Chairman's work continues \nFLETC's viability, will he be willing to communicate to the Treasury \nDepartment not only his commitment to this program but his desire to \nsee that Treasury take steps towards funding design money for two \ndormitories at Glynco during this fiscal year?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Senator for his question and for his \ncomments about FLETC's role and the Committee's work on behalf of \nFLETC. I believe in the intent for which FLETC was created and believe \nthis bill reflects that belief. I also understand the need to take \nfurther steps to continue FLETC's 5-year plan. I say to the Senator \nfrom Georgia that I am willing to communicate with the Treasury \nSecretary Robert Rubin my hope that the Treasury Department provide \ndesign money for the two dormitories.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The chairman's remarks are appreciated. As the Senator \nfrom Colorado knows this design money will assist with the dormitories \nscheduled for full funding in fiscal year 2001. Funding for design \nmoney will provide important continuation of and commitment to FLETC's \n5-year plan. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nSenator from Colorado, the Chairman of the Subcommittee, in a colloquy.\n  Mr. President, I want to begin by applauding the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Treasury-General Government Appropriations Subcommittee \nfor what they have done under difficult budgetary circumstances. The \nAdministration's fiscal year 2000 budget request for Customs included a \ncontroversial $312.4 million user fee to fund 5,000 existing Customs \npersonnel. That budget gimmick essentially forced the Committee to \neither reduce Customs staffing levels or reduce or deny many needed \nprojects and new initiatives. Under those difficult circumstances. I \nbelieve that Committee made the right choice.\n  The Customs Service has added to the problem by failing to include \ncomprehensive air interdiction and marine enforcement fleet \nmodernization plans requested by Congress in its Fiscal Year 2000 \nbudget request. Has the subcommittee received either of these plans?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. We have not received either of the requested plans from \nthe Customs Service. In my view, the Administration clearly has missed \nan opportunity. In the absence of these reports and in response to \nconcerns expressed by the Senator from New Mexico and others we have \nurged the Customs Service to look at cost-effective force multiplying \ntechnologies to improve border control and support other federal, state \nand local law enforcement agencies.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As the Chairman knows, I believe that the AS350 AStar \nhelicopter is a proven force-multiplier for Customs that has been used \nalong the Southwest border, and elsewhere in the country, to support \noperations by the Border Patrol, and other federal, state, and local \nlaw enforcement agencies. According to information provided by the \nCustoms Service, in the past year these Customs helicopters assisted in \nthe seizure of approximately $14 million 7,800 pounds of cocaine, \nalmost 25 tons of marijuana, 88 vehicles, 1 aircraft, 12 illegal \nweapons, 5 vessels, and 210 arrests. In addition, the Executive \nDirector of the Customs Air Interdiction Division, has indicated that \nAStar is the most cost-effective element of the Customs air fleet. \nBased on this track record, the AS350 AStar has become the light \nenforcement helicopter of choice for the U.S. Customs Service.\n  Mr. President, I understand the budget constraints facing the \nSubcommittee. I would simply ask that as we proceed with this bill in \nconference or later in the year, the Chairman and the distinguished \nRanking Member of the Subcommittee, Mr. Dorgan, consider making \ninvestments in proven, cost-effective force multipliers--like the AStar \nhelicopters--that can help strengthen law enforcement and improve our \nefforts to combat the inflow of drugs into this country a funding \npriority.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I share the concern expressed by the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico about the inflow of drugs into \nthis country. In addition to urging the Customs Service to transmit the \nrequested air and marine modernization plans to the Committee, we \nworked with the Senator from new Mexico and others to add report \nlanguage urging the Customs Service to consider additional investments \nin proven counterdrug assets like the AS350 AStar helicopter and other \ntechnologies in its current and future plans to try to maximize the \neffectiveness of Customs counterdrug personnel and resources. If \nadditional resources become available to the Committee, cost-effective \nforce-multipliers like the AS350 AStars will be among our top \ncounterdrug priorities.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chairman.\n\n\n                hartsfield atlanta international airport\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention \nof the chairman the tremendous need for the speedy assignment of \nadditional Customs Inspectors for Hartsfield Atlanta International \nAirport.\n  There has been a 100% increase in the number of international gates \nat Hartsfield from 1994 to 1999 and yet only a 14% increase in Customs \nInspectors during the same period. In addition, there has been a 102% \nincrease in metric tons of cargo and no increase in inspectors to \nhandle that growth.\n  Hartsfield airport officials and the business community believe this \nlack of Customs Inspectors to handle the rapid growth in both \npassengers and cargo will soon place the airport at a serious \ncompetitive disadvantage. It is my understanding that millions of \ndollars a year will be lost by business travelers and industries in the \nAtlanta region due to inefficient movement of passengers and goods if \nthis problem is not addressed soon.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Is it not true that the INS recently assigned 15 new \ninspectors to Hartsfield to handle the airport's tremendous growth?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes, the chairman is correct.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to state my concern to the \nchairman on this matter as well. Hartsfield recently surpassed O'Hare \nas the busiest airport in the world. I, too, strongly urge the U.S. \nCustoms Service to address their lack of sufficient personnel at \nHartsfield and respond as the INS has done in assigning the proper \nstaff to this vital economic engine for the metro Atlanta region.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank my two colleagues for their comments on this \nmatter and I encourage the Customs Service to work to address these \nissues.\n  Mr. President, I know of no further amendments to be offered. I \nbelieve we are ready for third reading of the bill. Senator Dorgan is \nprepared for that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think we are ready for third reading.\n  Let me, in 10 seconds, thank the staff on both sides who have worked \nso hard on this legislation.\n  I think all of the amendments have been disposed of. We are ready for \nfinal passage.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I also thank Senator Dorgan for all of his work. I ask \nnow for a voice vote on final passage.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will we have a recorded vote on the \nconference report?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Third reading.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The bill (S. 1282), as amended, was passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know there may be some wrap-up statements.\n  I commend the managers of the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations \nbill. They have worked together very well today. They have been able to \ncomplete a bill in 1 day that ordinarily takes days, or as much as a \nweek. I commend them for that.\n\n[[Page S8050]]\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in light of the vote that just occurred on \nthe Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill, and the agreement just \nreached a few moments ago with respect to the District of Columbia \nappropriations, the Senate has conducted its last vote for the week. \nThere will be no further votes tonight and no votes in the morning.\n  The next vote will occur on Tuesday, July 13. The Senate will \nreconvene on Monday, July 12, at noon. However, no votes will occur \nduring Monday's session of the Senate.\n  Votes will occur during the session of the Senate beginning Tuesday, \nJuly 13, through Friday, July 16. There will be votes on Friday, July \n16. So be prepared for that. That was under a previously agreed to \ncloture vote at 10:30 on Friday, the 16th, concerning the Social \nSecurity lockbox issue.\n  We will be in session some tomorrow. But there will be no recorded \nvotes in the morning.\n  I thank all of our colleagues for their cooperation. Senator Daschle \nand our whips have all worked to make it possible to complete not one \nbut two appropriations bills. I wish all of our colleagues a safe and \nhappy holiday. I look forward to seeing you back on the 12th.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate receives from the House of Representatives the companion bill to \nS. 1282, the Senate immediately proceed to the consideration of that \nmeasure; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of \nSenate bill S. 1282, as passed, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the \nHouse bill, as amended, be read for the third time and passed; that the \nSenate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on \nthe disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon, and that the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate; and that the \nforegoing occur without any intervening action or debate.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the bill, S. 1282, not be \nengrossed; that it remain at the desk pending receipt of the House \ncompanion bill, and that upon passage by the Senate of the House bill, \nas amended, the passage of S. 1282 be vitiated and the bill be \nindefinitely postponed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, we agreed to a statement, after passage \nof the bill, of Senator Torricelli. I think that was the only one \nagreed to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for \nhis consideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8050-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8050-S8051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          UNFAIR COMMUTER TAX\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I have this evening withdrawn \nconsideration of an amendment that I offered with Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Dodd, and Senator Lautenberg. But I do so in the hope that in \nthe intervening weeks the Finance Committee will consider this measure \nwith the near certainty that my colleagues from Connecticut and I will \nreturn with Senator Lautenberg and offer this in the coming weeks. I \nrise tonight very simply and very briefly to make our case.\n  There is nothing more fundamental in this Federal union than the \nequal protection of all of our citizens. It is the very purpose of the \nunion. A citizen can travel State-by-State, live anywhere in this \nNation, and be subject to the same application of the law.\n  This principle, while 200 years old, is now tested again. Some weeks \nago, the State of New York repealed the commuter tax for commuters into \nthe city of New York. That tax had been in place for more than 30 \nyears. But they did a peculiar thing that is offensive to our concept \nof national union. They repealed the tax for people who live in New \nYork State and commute to New York City, but they retained the tax for \nthe citizens of Connecticut, 80,000 strong, and 250,000 commuters in \nthe State of New Jersey. Those people who I represent alone were \ncontributing $110 million to the city of New York.\n  It is not as if the legislature of the State of New York in doing \nthis did not recognize they were trampling upon sacred constitutional \ngrounds, because indeed in their State legislation they put a provision \nthat if this was found unconstitutional for anybody, the law would be \nrevoked. It was a political statement. It was not a sincere effort to \nlegislate.\n  Indeed, as could be predicted, last week a judge did, indeed, rule \nthat it was not only unfair to repeal this tax for New York commuters \nwhile imposing it on Connecticut and New Jersey, but it was \nunconstitutional and a violation of the privileges in the immunity \nclause of the U.S. Constitution.\n  I quote the judge who called this residency tax ``arbitrary and \nirrational.'' The judge further recognized that ``the only substantial \ndifference between the two classes of commuters is in the State in \nwhich they reside.''\n  It might be argued that the State of New York, having recognized this \nmight be unconstitutional, a judge now having ruled it is \nunconstitutional, that we might let the matter rest. I do not believe \nthat would be in the best interests of the Congress. Indeed, last week, \nthe House of Representatives on a voice vote, without apparent \nobjection, unanimously found this is bad policy and it should never \nhappen again.\n  The legislation, the Computer Tax Fairness Act, that I have \nintroduced with Senators Dodd, Lieberman, and Lautenberg, would have \nthis Senate reach the same conclusion. I rise tonight not to offer an \namendment but in the hopes of asking the Finance Committee in the next \nfew weeks to review, as the Ways and Means in the House of \nRepresentatives has done, to review this legislation, and to reach its \nown judgment, so in future weeks we can come back to the floor of the \nSenate and ask the Senate to make an informed judgment.\n  I believe it is important. Today it may be the people of Connecticut \nand New Jersey. This is a principle we will visit again. People who \nlive in Indiana may one day commute to Chicago and find the city of \nChicago thinks it is a good idea to tax somebody else for their \nservices. I daresay the people of Alabama may one day find they are \ncommuting to Mississippi and finding they are paying a tax subjected \nonly on their own citizens. This is anathema to our national union. It \nis taxation without representation. It is a violation of privilege of \nimmunities. It is a problem of equal protection. Indeed, it violates \nour sense of union.\n  While I do not insist on the amendment tonight, we will return to \nthis moment in the hope that as the courts have found and as the House \nof Representatives has found, we can once again establish this \nprinciple.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. I commend my colleague from New Jersey for taking a \nleadership role on this.\n  We should point out to our neighbors in New York how much we \nappreciate and support our great neighbor. The city of New York is a \nsource of great economic vitality for our region. Our citizens are \nproud to live in our respective States of New Jersey and Connecticut, \nhappy to work in the State of New York, but we want to be treated \nequally.\n  My colleague from New Jersey has rightfully raised this issue and \npointed out that almost 100,000 constituents of mine who commute every \nday to the city of New York, and the almost 300,000 from the State of \nNew Jersey, have raised a very important issue. We are confident our \ncolleagues from New York are going to be tremendously sympathetic to \nthis injustice that could be heaped on their neighboring States of New \nJersey and Connecticut.\n  I thank my colleague from New Jersey for raising this issue.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, New York state legislature exempted \nNew York state residents from paying the New York City commuter tax. \nBut out-of-state residents--including people who live in New Jersey--\nare not exempt. They're supposed to keep paying the tax.\n  Commuting between states is an inescapable reality of modern life. As \nour population grows, the physical boundaries that used to divide one \ncity from another are breaking down.\n  More and more everyday, our country is becoming a collection of \nregions. And that's especially true on the east coast, where urban \npopulations are already closer together than they are anywhere else.\n\n[[Page S8051]]\n\n  Should we punish people for this? Is it fair to single people out for \nharsher tax treatment just because they live in one state and work in \nanother? Of course not. It's economic discrimination. And even worse, \nit's unconstitutional.\n  It's especially unfair in the case of New Jersey residents who work \nin New York City. Those people work hard. And their work brings real, \ntangible benefits to New York--benefits that translate into a stronger \neconomy for New York City and the rest of the state.\n  New York needs those commuters. But that fact seems to escape the \nstate's lawmakers. Their message to New Jersey residents is this--\n``You're second-class citizens. You don't live on our side of the state \nline, so you don't count.''\n  In 1996 alone, nearly 240,000 New Jersey residents paid $75 million \nin commuter taxes to New York. I'm sure they didn't like paying it, but \nat least in 1996 the tax was applied with a sense of fair play. Not \nanymore. Those commuters are plenty mad. And who can blame them?\n  Commuting to work is a necessity for millions of people. Often, it's \nan economic necessity. Or a desire to be close to family members.\n  When you tax people just for driving across state lines to work, \nyou're essentially telling them they shouldn't have a choice about \nwhere they live.\n  That is wrong, Mr. President. I ask my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I very much appreciate the encomia that the Senator from \nConnecticut has given to our State of New York.\n  I want to thank my colleague from New Jersey for not forcing this \ndubious amendment tonight. First of all, there are two reasons to \nreject this amendment. One is that it is moot. Six days ago, as the \nSenator from New Jersey indicated, a court knocked out the entire \ncommuter tax. To spend time debating this amendment right now, at this \nlate hour, when people are eager to leave, and when the good work of \nthe Senator from Texas and the Senator from Illinois has to be \ncompleted, does not make much sense.\n  Second, I caution that for the Senate to do this amendment without \nany hearings, without it going to the Finance Committee, might \njeopardize all sorts of other complex decisions. Many States have pacts \nand agreements and covenants with neighboring States. How much this \namendment affects those pacts and agreements, I don't know--but neither \ndoes anybody else in this Chamber.\n  To move this legislation which might have an effect on so many \nthings, I am told, without nary a hearing or a discussion, would be a \nserious mistake. In fact, the Federation of Tax Administrators, on June \n21, wrote about the companion bill in the House. They said:\n\n       Just what this bill is trying to do that has not already \n     been done is the question. Unfortunately, when Congress \n     attempts to restate existing constitutional law, the courts \n     are left to cast about for a meaning for the new law. The \n     resulting interpretations lead to countless examples of \n     ``unintended consequences.'' Because of the bill's widespread \n     impact, its confusing language, and the fact that the \n     protections Congress hopes to bestow upon the taxpayers of \n     New Jersey are already firmly established in the U.S. \n     Constitution, the Federation [that is the Federation of Tax \n     Administrators] would urge you at a minimum to withhold \n     consideration of the House companion bill.\n\n  So I appreciate the fact we have done that in the House. We will \ndebate this another day, this already moot point, and to not take any \nfurther time from my colleagues who are eager to debate other issues.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and wish my colleagues a happy \nFourth of July.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8051-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8051-S8053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    OPEN-MARKET REORGANIZATION FOR THE BETTERMENT OF INTERNATIONAL \n                         TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to \nconsideration of S. 376 as reported by the Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \njust want to commend the Senator from Montana for his dogged \ndetermination to move this legislation. I am sure that all of its \nimperfections will be resolved in conference. I commend him for his \nefforts.\n  I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 376) a bill to amend the Communication Satellite \n     Act of 1962 to promote competition and privatization in \n     satellite communications, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will pass a measure that \nwill usher in a new era in the international satellite communications \nmarketplace. This bill is the result of months of deliberation among \nmany of my colleagues and builds upon a debate from last Congress.\n  First and foremost, I extend my appreciation to the distinguished \nchairman of the Communications Subcommittee, Senator Conrad Burns, for \nhis unrelenting diligence in working with all parties involved, both in \nthe Senate and in the private sector. There were numerous players who \nhad a stake or an interest in this reform measure. Senator Burns was \nwilling to accommodate their perspectives while remaining true to his \ncommitment to move forward. I thank him for that.\n  Along with Senator Burns, other Members in this Chamber, Senator \nBreaux, Senator Hollings, Senator Stevens, and others were actively \nengaged in the process. Their contributions enhanced the final product \nin many respects and helped produce a more balanced bill. Let me also \nrecognize Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee. His leadership and his support has been instrumental in \nhelping to advance this effort, and I want to thank him as well.\n  Reaching a unified unanimous, Senate position on legislation of this \nmagnitude was not a simple task. Although the bill garnered widespread \nagreement on principle, the technical issues have not been easy. Some \nwere complex, given the marketplace transition from one dominated by \nintergovernmental organizations to one of private sector competition. \nOther issues were straightforward but contentious. This made it \nnecessary to take the time and work through some of these areas in a \nfair and open manner. We did, and I am pleased that the Senate has now \nmoved forward.\n  S. 376 enacts timely reform of a visionary policy adopted by Congress \nin the early 1960s to blaze the trail of a global communications \nnetwork. It was the right policy at the right time. A solid foundation \nwas laid as a result, and commercial satellite service has come of age. \nNow, over 35 years later, it is the right time for Congress to enact \nanother visionary public policy. One that will move us from a \nmarketplace dominated primarily by intergovernmental organizations to \none of competitive, privately owned companies offering viable \nopportunities and real choices. A marketplace that will reflect today's \nmarket realities and encourage robust competition in our new satellite \ncommunications community for years to come. Such services are growing \nin demand, and Congress should act on behalf of consumers. They deserve \nit.\n  I always say that nothing could get done in the Senate without \ndedicated staff. Several individuals worked hard to prepare this \nlegislation for passage. They include Mark Ashby, Lloyd Ator, Mark \nBuse, Greg Elias, Paula Ford, Leo Giacometto, Carole Grunberg, Maureen \nMcLaughlin, Mike Rawson, Greg Rhode, Mitch Rose, Ivan Schlager, and \nHoward Waltzman. I thank them all for their time and their efforts.\n  It is my hope this is the year Congress will pass an international \nsatellite privatization bill.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns \nabout S. 376, the international satellite reform legislation. While I \ncommend my colleagues who have worked hard on this very important \nissue, I am concerned that there is still more work to do to ensure \nreform that results in a truly competitive market.\n  Comprehensive satellite reform is long overdue. The 1962 \nCommunications Satellite Act is based on a 1960s\n\n[[Page S8052]]\n\nera notion that telecommunications services must be provided by \nnational or international monopolies. This thinking gave rise to two \ntreaty organizations, INTELSAT and Inmarsat, to provide international \nsatellite communications services. Comsat, a private company, was \ncreated by Congress in 1962 and has been the U.S. representative--known \nas the Signatory--to these intergovernmental organizations. Today, we \nknow that technology and the marketplace demand that this monopoly, \ngovernmental model must give way to private competition.\n  S. 376 may be a first step toward reaching the goal of privatizing \nthe treaty organizations and reforming the 1962 Act. But more remains \nto be done.\n  One important issue that is very troubling to me involves the legal \nimmunity that Comsat enjoys as the U.S. Signatory to INTELSAT. This is \na critical issue. The FCC has found that Comsat's immunity gives it \nsignificant competitive advantages. Comsat is a publicly-traded private \ncompany. Legal immunity is an extraordinary advantage in the \nmarketplace. It is rare for Congress to grant such a powerful advantage \nto a private commercial company. We must be very careful here.\n  I understand that Comsat might remain as the U.S. Signatory until \nINTELSAT is fully privatized, and, therefore, it would retain some \nofficial responsibility to represent the U.S. government. I understand \nthat, in that capacity, it might need legal immunity when it is acting \nat the instruction of the U.S. government. But in every other action it \ntakes, at INTELSAT or elsewhere, it should not and does not enjoy legal \nimmunity. S. 376 limits Comsat's legal immunity.\n  My concern here is a simple one. If Congress by law is bestowing \nlegal immunity on a private company, Congress has an obligation to be \nvery clear and precise as to what actions are protected. The provisions \nin S. 376 that limits Comsat's immunity is not precise and specific \nenough. However, the intent and wording is plain that as long as Comsat \nrepresents the U.S. officially at INTELSAT prior to its privatization, \nit may enjoy legal immunity, but that immunity is clearly limited to \nthe actions it takes pursuant to the written instruction it receives \nfrom the U.S. government.\n  While the intent is clear that Comsat obtains immunity only when it \nis acting under written government instruction, the language in this \nbill regarding immunity requires further clarification at conference.\n  We have a duty to be clear and precise when we grant such an \nextraordinary benefit as legal immunity to a private company. I raise \nthis today because I want this issue to be further resolved in the \nConference Committee, prior to enactment.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues, Senators Hollings, \nMcCain, Lott, Stevens, Burns and others on the Commerce Committee to \nensure that this clarification problem is corrected.\n  Mr DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased that today we will pass S. 376, \nwhich concerns the important topic of International Satellite Reform. I \nhave followed the issue with interest for years, in part because in my \nForeign Relations Committee work, we have addressed the market access \nconcerns that are a critical part of opening up this industry.\n  Although it is significant to finally have the Senate on record \nsupporting the need for a competitive restructuring of the \ninternational satellite market, this bill will need some work before it \ncan achieve that goal. It does not make sense to address this issue for \nthe first time in over 35 years, and to leave some issues unresolved. I \nbelieve that there is room for improvement with respect to balancing \nincentives and leverage in making the international marketplace more \ncompetitive. I also believe we need to move quickly to normalize our \nrelations with Intelsat, and its U.S. component, Comsat.\n  I urge the Senate conferees from the Commerce Committee to continue \ntheir good work by tightening up this bill and removing unnecessary \nloopholes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1221\n\n  Mr. BURNS. There is a managers' amendment at the desk, and I ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns], for himself, Mr. \n     Lott, and Mr. Stevens, proposes an amendment numbered 1221.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Section 4 of S. 376 (as amended by the ``ORBIT'' \n     substitute) is amended by striking proposed\n       Section 603 of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 and \n     inserting the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 603. RESTRICTIONS PENDING PRIVATIZATION.\n\n       (a) INTELSAT shall be prohibited from entering the United \n     States market directly to provide any satellite \n     communications services or space segment capacity to carriers \n     (other than the United States signatory) or end users in the \n     United States until July 1, 2001 or until INTELSAT achieves a \n     pro-competitive privatization pursuant to section 613 (a) if \n     privatization occurs earlier.\n       (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), INTELSAT shall be \n     prohibited from entering the United States market directly to \n     provide any satellite communications services or space \n     segment capacity to any foreign signatory, or affiliate \n     thereof, and no carrier, other than the United States \n     signatory, nor any end user, shall be permitted to invest \n     directly in INTELSAT.\n       (c) Pending INTELSAT's privatization, the Commission shall \n     ensure that the United States signatory is compensated by \n     direct access users for the costs it incurs in fulfilling its \n     obligations under this Act.\n       (d) The provisions of subsections (b) and (c) shall remain \n     in effect only until INTELSAT achieves a pro-competitive \n     privatization pursuant to section 613(a).''\n       On line 21, page 32, Section 612(b), insert ``subsection'' \n     after the word ``under''.\n       On line 21, page 32, Section 612(b), replace ``consider'' \n     with ``determine whether''.\n       On line 23, page 32, Section 612(b), insert ``exist'' after \n     the word ``connections''.\n       On line 9, page 33, Section 612(b)(4), after ``ownership'', \n     insert ``and whether the affiliate is independent of IGO \n     signatories or former signatories who control \n     telecommunications market access in their home territories.''\n       On line 19, page 35, section 613(c)(1), after ``taxation'', \n     insert ``and does not unfairly benefit from ownership by \n     former signatories who control telecommunications market \n     access to their home territories.''\n       On line 13, page 37, Section 613(d), replace ``consider'' \n     with ``determine''.\n       On line 14, page 37, Section 613(d), insert ``and \n     Inmarsat'' after ``INTELSAT''.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered \nas read and agreed to, the committee substitute be agreed to, as \namended, and the bill be read for the third time and passed, the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1221) was agreed to.\n  The committee substitute, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read \nthe third time, and passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished Majority Leader \nand Senator Stevens for working with me, Senator McCain, Senator \nHollings, and Senator Breaux on the passage of S. 376, the Open-Market \nReorganization for the Betterment of International Telecommunications \nAct, better known as ``ORBIT.''\n  The passage of ORBIT by unanimous consent today clearly indicates the \nSenate's overwhelming support for the approach taken in ORBIT to reform \nour satellite communications laws. I look forward to working with my \ngood friend in the other body, Chairman Bliley, on getting this \nlegislation enacted into law this year.\n  ORBIT is a truly bipartisan bill that updates the Satellite \nCommunications Act of 1962, expands competition, and encourages new \nmarket entrants in satellite communications. It will help to secure the \nrapid and pro-competitive privatization of INTELSAT by a date certain \nof January 1, 2002. The bill provides new incentives for INTELSAT's \nprivatization, while at the same time, carries tough consequences if \nINTELSAT fails to achieve this important objective.\n  The bill also brings needed reform to the U.S. signatory to INTELSAT, \nCOMSAT, by removing its special\n\n[[Page S8053]]\n\nprivileges and immunities. In addition, the bill eliminates outdated \nstatutory restrictions on the ownership of COMSAT, which will allow \nCOMSAT to function like a normal, private commercial company.\n  ORBIT will enhance competition in satellite communications, bringing \nfar reaching and long-term benefits to consumers both here and abroad. \nI thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I especially want \nto thank the staff. The staff of all parties was involved in this. \nThere have been long hours and long days devoted to this particular \nissue.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at this time I call up Calendar No. \n170, S. 1283, the D.C. appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1283) making appropriations for the government \n     of the District of Columbia and other activities chargeable \n     in whole or in part against the revenues of said District for \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2000, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from Georgia if he \nwould allow me to make a general statement about the bill for about 5 \nminutes, and then I will defer to Senator Durbin if he has a statement?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Absolutely.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring to the Senate \nfloor the bill making appropriations for the government of the District \nof Colombia for fiscal year 2000. This bill is largely the result of \nthe cooperation between Mayor Williams, the city council, and the \nFinancial Control Board. As a result of the hard work of locally \nelected officials, the Congress and the Financial Control Board, we \nbegin to see signs of a healthier financial picture in the District.\n  At the end of fiscal year 1998, the District boasted an annual \nsurplus of $445 million. This surplus allowed the District to eliminate \nthe accumulated deficit.\n  Having paid that off, the District still realized a $112 million \npositive fund balance. The District is projecting a $282 million fund \nbalance by the end of this year, which is 6 percent of the gross \nbudget. The District's healthy fund balance and improved economic \nforecasts have helped the District achieve investment grade bond \nratings on Wall Street, which will save the District millions in \nborrowing costs. One of the important provisions in the committee bill \ncreates a mechanism that will help improve this situation even more. I \nam looking toward a higher bond rating for the city than the level at \nwhich it now rests.\n  While the economic condition of the District is improving, service \ndelivery in our Nation's Capital still has a way to go. The public \nschool system is still in serious condition. Chief among these concerns \nare recent reports of convicted felons walking away from district-run \nhalfway houses and committing violent crimes. The District government \nwill not be able to attract new families, middle-class families, to the \ncity unless its streets are safe, the schools are effective, and its \ntax structure is competitive with surrounding jurisdictions.\n\n  Despite these problems, the budget moves the city in the correct \ndirection, and I think we are making great progress. The subcommittee \nhas adopted the District's consensus budget with a few modifications. \nThese are the few:\n  We have again required the District to hold a $150 million reserve \nfund, and there are tight restrictions on the use of the reserve fund. \nIt can now serve as a true ``rainy day'' fund for the city. In \naddition, we require the District to hold a 4-percent budget surplus. \nThe combination of the reserve and the required surplus will give the \nDistrict a solid financial cushion that is slightly above what other \nmajor cities hold, but it is appropriate for the District in order to \nimprove its bond rating. Any funds above the 4-percent surplus are \ndirected to be used in this manner: No less than half for debt \nreduction, no more than half for spending on nonrecurring expenses.\n  Currently, the District spends 13 percent of its budget servicing its \ndebt. The highest normal ratio for a city is 10 percent. The reforms \nenvisioned by this bill would bring this more in line with other \ncities.\n  The city's debt was at one time so bad that it was not even rated by \nthe major agencies. The city's bond rating is now investment grade, \nalthough it is the lowest rank of investment grade. I think this budget \nwill start the process by which that rating will be upgraded. This is \nso important for the District to save millions in borrowing costs in \nthe future.\n  In addition, our budget has education reform. The committee has \nprovided $17 million for the D.C. College Tuition Assistance Program, \nsubject to authorization. I will wait and talk about that a little more \nwhen Senator Durbin discusses it as well.\n  We have also addressed the issue of charter schools in the city. Many \nbelieve that charter schools are an important force for improving \neducation in the city. Our bill adopts the D.C. City Council program to \nensure that pupils in both public schools and charter schools receive \nthe same amount of funding. This way, charter schools will remain an \neducation alternative for students in the District.\n  Everyone knows crime in the District is still too high. We have \nprovided $5.8 million for drug testing of people on probation. This has \nworked in other cities and we hope it will bring down the crime rate in \nthe District of Columbia as well. We provided $1 million to the D.C. \npolice to combat open-air drug markets. This was a special concern \nexpressed by Senator Durbin, and I think a correct one. These are dens \nof criminal activity that ruin a neighborhood and spread drugs to \nchildren. This money we hope will be used to start wiping out those \nopen-air drug markets.\n  We have also permitted the District to use economic development funds \nthat we appropriated last year to be used for local tax relief for \ncommercial revitalization. Rebuilding or refurbishing a blighted \nneighborhood is the most important thing we can do to bring it back \ninto the economic mainstream and keep it safe. The District has found \njust recently, as the landlord of a number of abandoned properties, \nthat such properties are a magnet for crime and drug use. So these \nfunds can be used for revitalization and public/private partnerships.\n  The committee tried to address the concerns of the mayor and the \ncouncil. We certainly intend to improve the education system in the \nDistrict. We are not where we want to be to make the Capital City the \nvery best city in the whole United States, the beacon for what America \nis, but we are heading in that direction. It is the goal of Congress to \nmake sure that our Capital City is one that all Americans feel they own \nand they can be proud of.\n\n  I am pleased the Appropriations Committee reported this bill \nunanimously and look forward to working through the conference with \nSenator Durbin, my ranking member, who has been very cooperative and \nhelpful in getting a bill through that will address the needs the \nDistrict has and provide for those needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say this is a new assignment for me \nas a ranking Democrat on the subcommittee on D.C. appropriations. I \nserved in a similar capacity in the House and it has become a subject \nwhich I am more familiar with each time the appropriation process \nbegins. But it has been a special pleasure to work with the chairman of \nthis committee, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas. This is the \nfirst time we worked this closely together. It has been a very \nprofessional relationship, and I think a very productive one for the \npeople of the District, as well as the Senate.\n  I salute, as well, Mary Beth Nethercutt and Jim Hyland of her staff, \nfor their cooperation. I thank, on my side, Terry Sauvain, who is not\n\n[[Page S8054]]\n\nonly the minority clerk for this bill but who also serves as the \nminority deputy staff director for the Appropriations Committee. I \nappreciate very much Senator Byrd making him available to help me on \nthis my maiden voyage on the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  My staff member, Marianne Upton, of the D.C. authorization \nsubcommittee of the Governmental Affairs Committee has worked \ntirelessly as well, and I extend my gratitude to her, as well as Liz \nBlevins and Suzanne Bailey of the committee staff.\n  May I say at the outset that I am heartened at the election of Mayor \nWilliams in the District of Columbia. I do believe it is a new day for \nthe District. The District has a better chance for a better future than \nit has had in many years. Those of us who had lost faith in the future \nof the District of Columbia have had it renewed by the earliest days of \nhis administration. He is a man who is honest. He is a man who is \ndedicated. He truly wants the very best for the District of Columbia \nand I am anxious to work with him.\n  People whom he has hired to this point in his administration include \nsome for whom I have a high regard. Police Chief Ramsey, who was a \nmember of the Chicago police force, was well respected there and I am \ncertain will do a good job here. Terry Gainer, who was the \nSuperintendent of the Illinois State Police, works as an assistant to \nChief Ramsey, and he, too, brings extraordinary expertise in the field \nof law enforcement.\n  Mr. President, having said that, Senator Hutchison has explained this \nunusual situation where the Congress of the United States, the Federal \nGovernment, appropriates money to give to a city government, the D.C. \ngovernment. Of course, that is why we are here this evening. We have a \nspecial interest in the District of Columbia, not just because the \nCapitol is located here, but because we believe, as every American \ndoes, that this is our city, too. Whatever our hometowns happen to be, \nthe District of Columbia, Washington, DC, is our capital city, and we \nare very proud of it.\n  The millions of visitors who come each year really come to enjoy the \ninstitutions, the landmarks, the monuments, and all of the things that \nmake this such a wonderful city and respected across the face of the \nEarth. The building we work in, the U.S. Capitol, is one of the most \nrecognizable buildings in the world, and we are proud to work here, to \nbe part of it, and we understand that Washington, DC, is part of the \nfuture of this country and part of our heritage.\n  Having said that, though, I have to be very candid. When my friends \nin Illinois and others tell me they are going to visit the District of \nColumbia, I tell them: Be careful. You have to be careful because, \nsadly, the crime in the District of Columbia is the worst in the \nNation. The murder rate in the District of Columbia is more than twice \nany other city in the United States and certainly more than any other \ncity in the world, from all the information I have been given. The \nnumber of auto thefts is higher in the District of Columbia than \nanywhere else in the United States of America. The schools, sad to say, \nare some of the worst. They may be getting better, and we hope they \nwill, but, unfortunately, there are many problems.\n  When the mayor of the city came to testify before our committee, he \nsaid the Annie E. Casey Foundation has done an evaluation of children \nin the District of Columbia on how our kids are doing in Washington, \nDC. Time after time, we find they are doing worse than virtually every \ncity in the United States or any State in the Union. As good as the \nDistrict of Columbia may be, as inspiring as the monuments may be, \nthere are endemic problems in this city which are horrible.\n  I am happy the revitalization plan has really given the District more \nvoice in its own future. I have tried throughout the years to overcome \nthe temptation to meddle in the politics of the District of Columbia \nand to let them govern themselves as much as humanly possible.\n  I can tell you as a person who has spent a good part of his adult \nlife in the District, it has been tempting sometimes to speak up. \nTonight I will speak up on an action taken by the D.C. City Council \nwhich I think is absolutely irresponsible. I will get to that a little \nlater. But this appropriations bill tries to strike that balance where \nthe Federal Government comes in with its contribution to the District \nof Columbia and respects the right of this city to make its own \ndecisions, even if, in the judgment of some Senators here this evening, \nwe think those decisions are wrong.\n  I, once again, salute Senator Hutchison. I know during the course of \nthe debate on the amendments before us we will have a chance to get \ninto more specific issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement, \nat this time we will go to Senator Coverdell's amendment, and the time \nwill be divided, 20 minutes under the control of Senator Coverdell and \n10 minutes under the control of Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1222\n\n       (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for the distribution \n     of sterile needles or syringes for the hypodermic injection \n     of any illegal drug.)\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell], for himself and \n     Mr. Ashcroft, proposes an amendment numbered 1222.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.  . None of the funds contained in this Act may be used \n     for any program of distributing sterile needles or syringes \n     for the hypodermic injection of any illegal drug, or for any \n     payment to any individual or entity who carries out any such \n     program.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the amendment, in a sense, is a \nreflection of the comments just made by the Senator from Illinois about \nsome of the difficulties in the Nation's Capital, and the amendment is \ndrafted in the belief that a needle exchange program in the Nation's \nCapital is not conducive to the safety of the citizens of the Nation's \nCapital.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a New York Times op-ed dated Wednesday, \nApril 22, 1998, by James L. Curtis, a professor of psychiatry at \nColumbia University Medical School and the director of psychiatry at \nHarlem Hospital, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the op-ed was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, April 22, 1998]\n\n                           Clean But Not Safe\n\n                          (By James L. Curtis)\n\n       Donna Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \n     wanted it both ways this week. She announced that Federal \n     money would not be used for programs that distribute clean \n     needles to addicts. But she offered only a halfhearted \n     defense of that decision even stating that while the Clinton \n     Administration would not finance such programs, it supported \n     them in theory.\n       Ms. Shalala should have defended the Administration's \n     decision vigorously instead, she chose to placate AIDS \n     activists, who insist that giving free needles to addicts is \n     a cheap and easy was to prevent H.I.V. infection.\n       This is simplistic nonsense that stands common sense on its \n     head. For the past 10 years, as a black psychiatrist \n     specializing in addiction, I have warned about the dangers of \n     needle-exchange policies, which hurt not only individual \n     addicts but also poor and minority communities.\n       There is no evidence that such programs work. Take a look \n     at the way many of them are conducted in the United States. \n     An addict is enrolled anonymously, without being given an \n     H.I.V. test to determine whether he or she is already \n     infected. The addict is given a coded identification card \n     exempting him or her from arrest for carrying drug \n     paraphernalia. There is no strict accounting of how many \n     needles are given out or returned.\n       How can such an effort prove it is preventing the spread of \n     H.I.V. If the participants' are anonymous and if they aren't \n     tested for the virus before and after entering the program?\n       Studies in Montreal and Vancouver did systematically test \n     participants in needle-exchange programs. And the studies \n     found that those addicts who took part in such exchanges were \n     two to three times more likely to become infected with H.I.V. \n     than those who did not participate. They also found that \n     almost half the addicts frequently shared needles with others \n     anyway.\n       This was unwelcome news to the AIDS establishment. For \n     almost two years, the Montreal study was not reported in \n     scientific\n\n[[Page S8055]]\n\n     journals. After the study finally appeared last year in a \n     medical journal, two of the researchers, Julie Bruneau and \n     Martin T. Schechter, said that their results had been \n     misinterpreted. The results, they said, needed to be seen in \n     the context of H.I.V. rates in other inner-city \n     neighborhoods. They even suggested that maybe the number of \n     needles given out in Vancouver should be raised to 10 million \n     form 2 million.\n       Needle-exchange programs are reckless experiments. Clearly \n     there is more than a minimal risk of contracting the virus. \n     And addicts already infected with H.I.V., or infected while \n     in the program, are not given antiretroviral medications, \n     which we know combats the virus in its earliest stages.\n       Nedle exchanges also affect poor communities adversely. For \n     instance, the Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center is one of \n     New York City's largest needle-exchange programs. According \n     to tenant groups I have talked to, the center, since it began \n     in 1992, has become a magnet not only for addicts but for \n     dealers as well. Used needles, syringes and crack vials \n     litter the sidewalk. Tenants who live next door to the center \n     complain that the police don't arrest addicts who hang out \n     near it, even though they are openly buying drugs and \n     injecting them.\n       The indisputable fact is that needle exchanges merely help \n     addicts continue to use drugs. It's not unlike giving an \n     alcoholic a clean Scotch tumbler to prevent meningitis. Drug \n     addicts suffer from a serious disease requiring comprehensive \n     treatment, sometimes under compulsion. Ultimately, that's the \n     best way to reduce H.I.V. Infection among this group. What \n     addicts don't need is the lure of free needles.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am going to read several of the \nstatements made by Mr. Curtis in the op-ed. He says:\n\n       For the past 10 years, as a black psychiatrist specializing \n     in addiction, I have warned about the dangers of needle-\n     exchange policies, which hurt not only individual addicts but \n     also poor and minority communities.\n       There is no evidence that such programs work. . . .\n       Studies in Montreal and Vancouver . . . found that those \n     addicts who took part in such exchanges were two to three \n     times more likely to become infected with HIV than those who \n     did not participate. They also found that almost half the \n     addicts frequently shared needles with others anyway. . . .\n       Needle-exchange programs are reckless experiments. . . .\n       Needle exchanges also affect poor communities adversely. \n     For instance, the Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center is \n     one of New York City's largest needle-exchange programs. \n     According to tenant groups I talked to, the center, since it \n     began in 1992, has become a magnet not only for addicts but \n     for dealers as well. . . .\n       The indisputable fact is that needle exchanges merely help \n     addicts continue to use drugs. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, I point out the last time that an amendment like this \nappeared before the Senate, it was adopted 96-4.\n  General McCaffrey, the Nation's drug czar, says:\n\n       As public servants, citizens and parents, we owe our \n     children an unambiguous no use message. And if they should \n     become ensnared in drugs, we must offer them a way out, not a \n     means to continue addictive behavior.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The problem is not dirty needles, the problem is heroin \n     addiction . . . the focus should be on bringing help to the \n     suffering population--not giving them more effective means to \n     continue their addiction. One doesn't want to facilitate this \n     dreadful scourge on mankind.\n\n  A spokesman for the Office of Drug Control Policy also said that \n``addicts who took part in needle-exchange programs in Vancouver and \nMontreal had higher HIV infection rates than addicts who did not \nparticipate.''\n  Just a word or two about the Vancouver experiment. In the case of \nVancouver's needle exchange program, one of the biggest in the world, \nstudies show that intravenous drug use increased by 20 percent and \ndeaths from overdose have increased five-fold since 1988 when the \nprogram started. Some needle exchange programs actually encourage \ncocaine and crack injection providing so-called safe crack kits with \ninstructions on how to inject crack intravenously.\n  I have one of the kit's brochures. It is the one issued by the \nBridgeport Needle Exchange Program in Bridgeport, CT. It makes an \ninteresting menu. It starts off:\n\n       Get your stuff ready.\n       Have a cooker, water, syringe, citric or ascorbic acid, \n     cotton and alcohol wipes ready.\n       Put crack and citric or ascorbic acid (about a pinch to a \n     slab), in a cooker. Add plenty of water (about) 30 to 40 I.U. \n     of water. Smash and mix well.\n       Add cotton and draw up into the syringe.\n       Get your vein ready.\n       Tie off, find a good vein and clean with a alcoholic wipe.\n       Inject, make sure you are in a vein, register, look for \n     blood back flow in syringe.\n       Slowly push plunger in for injection. This helps to avoid \n     vein trauma and collapse.\n       Withdraw needle. Apply pressure for about a minute. Use \n     clean gauze tissue. . . .\n\n  Well, anyway, it goes on to say: Take care of yourself. Use vitamin \nC, eat a good diet, and things will be just fine.\n  I agree with General McCaffrey. I especially agree that in the \nNation's Capital we do not want to send the messages of a needle \nexchange program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Ashcroft of Missouri be added as \na cosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I can assure the Senate and the Nation \nthat we will continue pressing for this amendment. I believe we are \ngoing to succeed and overcome our foes that have caused us to have to \nwithdraw this tonight. I think we are going to be successful because I \nthink common sense, in this case, will prevail again.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the time assigned to Senator Durbin \nexpires this amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I believe under the unanimous consent \nagreement I am given 10 minutes to speak in opposition to this \namendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, sir.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  This is a tough topic. I not only don't care to talk about \nintravenous drug injection, I can't stand watching it on television.\n  I find myself in the middle of a debate where you have to face the \nreality of what this is all about. The reality is that too many people \nin the District of Columbia--wait a minute--too many people in America \nhave become IV drug users. We are trying to reduce that number, not \nonly because addiction to drugs can ruin your life but also because \nthere are other dangers associated with it, such as HIV and AIDS and \nhepatitis, and so many other things that cause problems.\n  I find it interesting that the Senator from Georgia, together, I \nunderstand, with the Senator from Missouri, comes here to try to stop \nthe needle exchange program in the District of Columbia, because as we \nlook at a map of the United States showing the States that have needle \nexchange programs, we see there is a needle exchange program in the \nhome State of the Senator from Georgia and there is a needle exchange \nprogram in the home State of the Senator from Missouri.\n  As you look across the Nation, you see that many States are trying \nthese programs. I am certain that the Senator from Georgia has spent a \ngreat deal of time trying to overturn the decision in his own State. \nThat is probably why he comes here in this crusade against the D.C. \nneedle exchange program.\n  But before we dismiss this as something that might encourage drug \nuse, please, let's look at the facts.\n\n       The highest rate of new HIV infections is in [Washington, \n     DC.] AIDS kills in the District like no other cause of death \n     for residents between ages 30 and 44.\n\n  I am quoting from a July 1, 1999, Washington Post editorial. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 1, 1997]\n\n                       How to Spread HIV in D.C.\n\n       When the Senate takes up the District's fiscal year 2000 \n     budget, a floor amendment may be offered to ban a needle-\n     exchange program in the city. A yes vote is a green light to \n     allow HIV to spread unimpeded among intravenous drug users.\n       The District has strong reason for an effective needle-\n     exchange program. The highest rate of new HIV infections is \n     in the nation's capital. AIDS kills in the District like no \n     other cause of death, for residents between ages 30 and 44. \n     The city has the distinction of\n\n[[Page S8056]]\n\n     having an AIDS death rate seven times the national average. \n     As if this weren't tragic enough, the city also has to \n     contend with needle-exchange opponents attacking a program \n     that has--through the Whitman Walker Clinic--reduced the \n     spread of HIV by causing a 29 percent drop in the number of \n     drug injections.\n       Opponents will argue that needle-exchange programs promote \n     drug use. That has not been the District's experience. Nor \n     has it been the experience of more than 113 other state and \n     local government-supported programs across the nation. Maybe \n     that's why the American Medical Association, the National \n     Academy of Sciences, the American Bar Association and the \n     U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have thrown \n     their weight behind the program.\n       Last year Congress unwisely added to another District law a \n     prohibition on funding a needle-exchange program. In an act \n     of legislative overkill, it also required that private groups \n     spending their own money on such programs lose any federal \n     funds they might receive. That took the Whitman Walker Clinic \n     out of the picture. As a result, a local group receiving only \n     private funds is trying to fight the spread of HIV on a \n     shoestring budget. That's the wrong way to fight a killing \n     disease. The District should be able to spend its own money \n     on this lifesaving program.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will continue:\n\n       [Washington, DC] has the distinction of having an AIDS \n     death rate seven times the national average. As if this \n     weren't tragic enough, the city also has to contend with \n     needle-exchange opponents attacking a program that has--\n     through the Whitman Walker Clinic--reduced the spread of HIV \n     by causing a 29 percent drop in the number of drug \n     injections.\n\n  So we have a terrible scourge of HIV and AIDS right here in the \nNation's Capital--seven times the national average. We have a program \nthat tries to convince HIV users, through a needle exchange, to stop \nit, to go through drug rehab, to end their addiction. And it is \nsuccessful.\n  As a result of the program, there was a 29-percent drop in the number \nof drug injections. The Senator from Georgia--and he is going to \nwithdraw the amendment, in fairness to him--the Senator from Georgia \nsays the best thing we can do is eliminate that program. That is an \ninvitation for more HIV and AIDS and more addiction.\n  Mr. President, 75 percent of the cases of babies born with HIV are \ndue to the use of dirty needles by either the mother or the father, and \n70 percent of the cases of women with HIV are due to their own or their \npartner's use of contaminated needles.\n  That is what the debate is all about. It pains me to even talk about \nthis topic. I am not comfortable with it. But I think we have to be \nhonest if we want to deal with public health issues. We should say--and \nI think it should be a standard--that we will not support a needle \nexchange program unless it fits two criteria: First, it has a valid \npublic health purpose--and I certainly believe that the elimination or \nreduction of HIV and AIDS in the District of Columbia is such a valid \npurpose--and, secondly, it must not encourage addiction to drugs.\n  There is absolutely no evidence that this program in the District \nencourages addiction. In fact, just the opposite is true. Those who \ncome to these clinics end up getting in programs where they finally--\nperhaps after a lifetime of addiction--find themselves drug-free so \nthat their babies can be born drug-free.\n  I am glad that the Senator from Georgia is going to withdraw this \namendment. As difficult as it is to talk about some of these issues, we \nmust face the reality that it is part of our responsibility.\n  The needle exchange program, which he would have restricted, is \nsupported by many groups that I think have great stature in our \ncountry: The American Medical Association, the National Academy of \nSciences, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Bar \nAssociation, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and many others.\n  Again, I am happy the Senator is going to withdraw his amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1222 Withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I just say, I commend Senator \nCoverdell for offering the amendment. I think that because of the \nopposition, he withdrew it. But if this is a subject that will come up \nin our conference committee, I will be supportive of the amendment. I \nthink it is a tragedy to give any credence to the notion that it is OK \nto use drugs and we just wanted to make sure you have clean needles to \ndo it.\n  So this may come back. When it does, I will certainly be favorable to \nmaking sure we do not send any kind of signal that would make this an \nacceptable occasion in our country.\n  Mr. President, I think Senator Daschle has asked to put his amendment \nup next. I am happy for him to do that.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have no objection to changing the order so the minority \nleader can offer his amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the minority leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1223\n\n  (Purpose: To direct the Secretary of the Interior to implement the \nnotice of decision approved by the National Capital Regional Director, \n                          dated April 7, 1999)\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1223.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 53, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 1______.--Wireless Communications.--(a) In General.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, not later than 7 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National \n     Park Service, shall--\n       (1) implement the notice of decision approved by the \n     National Capital Regional Director, dated April 7, 1999, \n     including the provisions of the notice of decision concerning \n     the issuance of right-of-way permits at market rates; and\n       (2) expend such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     paragraph (1).\n       (b) Antenna Applications.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, a Federal agency that receives an \n     application to locate a wireless communications antenna on \n     Federal property in the District of Columbia or surrounding \n     area over which the Federal agency exercises control shall \n     take final action on the application, including action on the \n     issuance of right-of-way permits at market rates.\n       (2) Guidance.--In making a decision concerning wireless \n     service in the District of Columbia or surrounding area, a \n     Federal agency described in paragraph (1) may consider, but \n     shall not be bound by, any decision or recommendation of--\n       (A) the National Capital Planning Commission; or\n       (B) any other area commission or authority.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank my colleagues for their cooperation and \nindulgence. I appreciate very much the opportunity to go out of order. \nThis should not take very long.\n  Mr. President, I want to just take a couple of minutes to talk about \nwhy I believe this amendment is needed, primarily for the Record, but \nalso for those who may be interested in knowing of a problem that I \nthink is a serious one that has to be addressed.\n  After 4 years of delay, the National Park Service tentatively \napproved applications to locate two cellular antennae in Rock Creek \nPark on April 8 of this year. These antennae will be located in areas \nthat are already developed; namely, the Park Service Maintenance Yard \nand the Fitzgerald Tennis Center. Engineering tests show that the \nantennae cannot be seen by park users.\n  In March of 1999, the Park Service completed the environmental \nassessment and concluded that these antennae pose no significant \nenvironmental impact.\n  Federal law directs agencies to make their property available to \ncommunications facilities so long as they comply with the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, which these antennae do.\n  Unfortunately, even though the decision was approved on April 8, even \nthough we have now waited 4 years, the\n\n[[Page S8057]]\n\nNational Park Service has yet to announce its final decision. This \namendment would simply require them to finish the process within 1 week \nof enactment--now after 4 years.\n  The U.S. Park Police has testified repeatedly that communication \nantennae are needed in Rock Creek Park because large sections of the \npark lack a reliable communications service. The police rely on \ncommercial wireless communications for their own protection and to \nrespond to the public's calls. Joggers, emergency medical groups, and \nother park users also testified these antennae will provide key links \nto police and rescue personnel. When someone is injured, rapid response \nmay mean the difference between life and death.\n  The U.S. Park Police reported in Rock Creek Park over 3,500 safety \nincidents, including 348 violent crimes, 1,600 criminal offenses, and \n1,664 traffic accidents in that 4-year period, from July 1995 to April \n1999. When these incidents occur, there is no way for a victim or a \nGood Samaritan to call 911.\n  Our amendment ensures the intention of the Telecommunications Act is \nsimply carried out. The act recognizes that Federal property should be \navailable for locating the antennae so essential services for wireless \ncommunication can be provided.\n  In many locations in the D.C. area, Federal property holdings are \nextensive and afford the only reasonable location for such antennae. \nThis amendment supports these initiatives. When the consideration of \napplications determines that the antennae meet applicable Federal \nenvironmental and other requirements, neither the Federal agencies nor \nlocal administrations should have any cause to block them. This \namendment clarifies the current law for the Washington region like \nother jurisdictions and requires approval of these facilities if they \nmeet all the Federal requirements.\n  That is an explanation of my amendment. I hope that, and I appreciate \nvery much, under the unanimous consent agreement, we will have a voice \nvote on this matter. I certainly hope it can be maintained in \nconference, because I think this is a critical issue for public safety \nand also for the need for Federal responsiveness on issues of this \nimport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the explanation of the amendment \nsounded very good. I had not seen the amendment until earlier this \nevening. I am happy to go forward with a vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment having expired, the \nquestion is on agreeing to amendment No. 1223.\n  The amendment (No. 1223) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill, the \nSenator from Texas, and my colleague, the Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1224\n\n   (Purpose: To strike Federal funding for the District of Columbia \n                   resident tuition support program)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the next item on the unanimous consent \nagreement is Senator Durbin's tuition assistance program amendment. \nTwenty minutes will be given to Senator Durbin, and I will control 10 \nminutes, at the end of which time Senator Durbin will withdraw.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1224.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 5, strike beginning with line 17 through page 6, \n     line 4.\n       On page 11, line 1, after the semicolon insert ``up to''.\n       On page 11, line 2, after ``resident'' insert ``college''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a bipartisan group of legislators, \nCongressmen from this region, came up with an idea that is a very good \none. It is an effort to try to promote higher education among the \nresidents of the District of Columbia.\n  Washington, DC, does not have a major public university. The young \npeople in D.C. are disadvantaged. People living in the State of Texas, \nyoung people living in the State of Illinois can consider a number of \npublic universities and colleges and qualify for in-State resident \ntuition, which is usually much lower than those out of State.\n  That same benefit is not available for the young people in the \nDistrict of Columbia by and large, and this scholarship idea, which was \npromoted by the Clinton administration, as well as local Congressmen \nand many others in this area, has come forward. It is one that I \nwholeheartedly support. I think this tuition assistance program is an \nexcellent idea. The estimated cost is about $17 million a year. That \nsum is appropriated in this bill.\n  Having said that, though, I have taken exception to a fact of life in \nthe District of Columbia. I mentioned at the outset that the District \nof Columbia is going through major reform, major revitalization. We \nhave changed the Federal contribution to help the District in some \nregards. For example, we are paying more Medicaid in the District of \nColumbia than in my home State of Illinois. We are paying for certain \nbenefits, like a $5,000 tax credit for those first-time homebuyers in \nthe District, things to encourage the District of Columbia to stand on \nits own feet.\n  They have made progress. I give credit to Mayor Williams and the city \ncouncil for a lot of positive things that have occurred in a very short \nperiod of time.\n  Having said that, though, there is an action by the D.C. City Council \nwhich I consider to be the height of irresponsibility. That was a \ndecision by this city council this year to give $59 million in tax cuts \nto D.C. residents.\n  Mark my words, any politician would like to stand up and say: I am \ngoing to give you a tax cut. Everyone applauds. That is a natural \napplause line. But when you take a look at the District of Columbia and \nthe situation that it faces, it is almost incredible that they would \ndecide at this moment in history that they have $59 million they can't \nfigure out how to spend; $59 million they want to return in tax cuts, \nsome of them in the neighborhood of $100 or $150 a year, $2 a week, $3 \na week, for a total of $59 million. This is a tax cut in a city that \nhas serious infrastructure problems and serious problems when it comes \nto the very basic things.\n  Let me give you an example. Here we are at the Capitol Building. A \nlot of my staff members live nearby. One of my staffers said to me the \nother evening: I am going home.\n  I said: Do you need a ride?\n  He said: I just live five blocks away. He paused and said: But come \nto think of it, a woman was stabbed and murdered in my neighborhood \nlast week. I will take a ride, if you don't mind.\n  I said: Do you know what you need in your neighborhood, where murders \nare occurring? You need a tax cut.\n  Well, I think we know better. The people in the District of Columbia, \nmore than anything else, need police protection. They need protection \nbecause we have the highest murder rate in the Nation right here in the \nDistrict of Columbia, more than twice the next city in any State in \nthis entire country.\n  I had some time to look over what has happened with the D.C. Police \nDepartment. The D.C. City Council can't seem to see any need there \nbeyond the current budget. In fact, they want to give away $59 million.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about the D.C. Police Department. I \nthink it has a good chief. Chief Ramsey comes from Chicago. I think he \nis making changes. But they wanted to have 3,800 policemen in the \nDistrict of Columbia, and they can't find them. They found about 3,500, \nso they are short of the mark of even having the force in the city that \nthey hope to have.\n\n  When the new chief took over a year ago, he looked around the \nDistrict of Columbia Police Department and learned that 75 percent of \nthe telephones in the D.C. Police Department were rotary phones. This \nis like traveling in Eastern Europe after the wall came down and \ndiscovering what is left of the Soviet empire. You travel around the \nD.C. city government and wonder how in the world did it get so bad.\n  This D.C. City Council can look beyond that. They can look beyond the\n\n[[Page S8058]]\n\nfact that the policemen in the District of Columbia were not receiving \nfirearms training a year ago. They can look beyond the fact that the \nD.C. policemen were not even trained for conducting sobriety tests. Can \nyou imagine that? They didn't pull over speeders who were drunk because \nonly 200 of the policemen, out of 3,800, had been trained in giving a \nbasic sobriety test. In most cities in the Nation, 100 percent of the \nforce receives that training.\n  The deficiencies, one after another, stack up until the people in \nthis poor city worry more about getting hit in the head than whether \nthey are going to get a tax cut. This is really, in my mind, quite a \ntragedy. If it were a family situation and you were trying to draw an \nanalogy, the D.C. City Council decided to go out and buy a big screen \nTV although it couldn't afford to buy a lock for the front door of the \nhouse. That is what the tax cut is all about.\n  Give away $59 million in a city with these problems? That is not it \nalone. As I mentioned earlier, the D.C. public schools really need \nhelp. They have brought on some new people in an effort to try to deal \nwith that. I hope it works. But the belief by the D.C. City Council \nthat putting money into summer programs, early childhood development, \nafterschool programs is unnecessary, really strikes me as insensitive \nto the reality of the need for improving public education in the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  When the Mayor came and spoke to us, incidentally, he told us \nsomething which was troubling--I have a chart that demonstrates it--on \nchildren in the District of Columbia. The Casey Foundation took a look \nat kids in the District of Columbia, kids in Washington, DC. With one \nexception--and they looked at all the different criteria for children, \nand that was the high school dropout rate--the District of Columbia \nranked worst in the Nation in every category involving children.\n  D.C. City Council, are you listening? The children you represent in \nthese wards out here are the worst in the Nation in every single \ncategory. You can't figure out where to put $59 million, so you want to \ndeclare a dividend and give it away.\n  Why don't you consider, for a moment, the percent of low-birth-weight \nbabies in the District of Columbia, the worst in the Nation, worse than \nany other State; the infant death rate in the District of Columbia is \nthe worst in the Nation, twice the national average; the child death \nrate; the rate of teen deaths by accident and homicide; the teen birth \nrate; the percent of teens not attending school and not working; the \npercent of children living with parents who do not have full-time, \nyear-round employment is last place in the District of Columbia; the \npercent of children in poverty; the percent of families headed by a \nsingle parent is the worst in the Nation.\n  The D.C. City Council has blinders on when it comes to the kids in \nthe District of Columbia. They are more intent on the theory of a tax \ncut; they want to give $100. What is $100 worth when you are holding a \npremature baby who has to stay in the hospital for week after week and \nmonth after month in the hope that when it is all said and done, that \nchild will have enough strength and intelligence to lead a normal life? \nWouldn't you, as a member of the D.C. City Council, stop and say: Maybe \nwe ought to dedicate a few dollars to the kids; maybe we ought to \ndedicate a few dollars to the police department?\n  I can't tell you, in my experience here in Washington, DC, how many \ntimes I have heard about the incidence of crime and how close it has \ncome. I was a student here; I went to college and law school here. I \nhave lived a big part of my life in Washington, DC. I have seen a lot \nof it. There is crime in other cities, make no mistake; but the rate of \ncrime in this town is just incredible. The rate of auto theft is the \nworst in the Nation. A year ago, there was 1 police officer out of \n3,500 who was assigned this responsibility of auto theft. These sorts \nof things, I suggest, the D.C. City Council ought to be taking into \nconsideration--things that, frankly, cry out for a response.\n  The D.C. City Council says: No, we are not going to spend the money \non the kids, we are not going to spend the money on the crime.\n  Pick up the Washington Post any morning of any day of any week, and \nyou will find another story that is scandalous about what is happening \nin the District of Columbia. We have quotes here about homicides. Just \nin the last few months, a girl, 15, died in gang crossfire; an \nanticrime activist--he worked in one of the neighborhoods near Capitol \nHill--was killed; a victim feared for family safety; four were arrested \nafter a woman was killed by a stray bullet.\n  Last week, a grandmother--an innocent person--was killed by a stray \nbullet in a drive-by shooting. Little babies are being killed by guns. \nThe D.C. City Council, when it reads headlines in the morning, must say \nthat crime is so bad in the District that we need a tax cut.\n  That is what it is all about. If there is a belief that a tax cut is \ngoing to bring people back to the District to live, it is such a naive \nbelief. People will live in the District of Columbia when it is safe to \nlive in this District, when the schools are good schools, when the city \nmeets its most basic needs. This idea, this perfidy that we can somehow \nanswer the needs of the District with a tax cut, I find troubling.\n  That is why I raised the concern about this college tuition program. \nTo think that we would take $17 million from the Federal Treasury and \ngive it to the District of Columbia for this college assistance program \nat a time when the District of Columbia is giving away $59 million, I \nfound to be particularly offensive--not that the program for college \ntuition isn't a good one, but the District of Columbia, apparently, has \nmoney to burn, money to give away, money to award in tax cuts, in a \ncity that is in shambles, when you look at the basics.\n  I don't want to get into graphic details here. This mayor said he is \ngoing to do everything in his power to eradicate rats in this city. It \nis estimated that the rat population is larger than the human \npopulation in Washington, DC, and that doesn't include politicians in \nCongress. It is estimated that these problems cause public health \nhazards that, frankly, are rampant across Washington, DC. D.C. City \nCouncil says: We are not going to spend any of that $59 million on rat \neradication; we are going to give a tax cut.\n  I think if they want to bring people to the District and businesses \nto the District, tax cuts can be part of the answer--after you have met \nthe basics. If you can't afford a roof on your home, you won't go out \nand buy a swimming pool. If you can't afford the basics of food in the \ncupboard, you don't rent a caterer for a patio party. The D.C. City \nCouncil just doesn't get it; they are going to give away this $59 \nmillion.\n  I have been prepared to offer an amendment that would have said the \nmoney that was going to be allocated in this bill for this program \nwould be stricken, $14 million. For the sake of the Record at this \npoint, I want to offer the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1224\n\n   (Purpose: To strike Federal funding for the District of Columbia \n                   resident tuition support program)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1224.\n       On page 5, strike beginning with line 17 through page 6, \n     line 4.\n       On page 11, line 1, after the semicolon insert ``up to''.\n       On page 11, line 2, after ``resident'' insert ``college''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am going to withdraw the amendment. I \nreceived a telephone call from the White House today, and it is very \nclear that this college tuition assistance program is very important to \nthe President, and I understand it. It is something that was part of \nhis budget, something that he believes would be very good for the \nchildren of the District of Columbia.\n  I have asked and received the assurance of the administration that \nwhen the District of Columbia makes next year's budget request, we are \ngoing to hold them to a very sensible yardstick. We are going to ask \nthem whether their experiment worked. We are going to ask them whether \nor not this idea of a $59 million tax cut did, in fact, not only \nimprove the quality of life in the District, but address the most basic \nproblems--whether or not the crime\n\n[[Page S8059]]\n\nrate has come down, whether or not children are better off, and whether \nor not the schools are improved.\n  The District of Columbia will be held accountable. With that \nassurance, I can assure those who are listening that if I am still \nserving on the subcommittee, as I expect to be, I will apply the same \nstandard. To the D.C. City Council, I say: I don't think you can have \nit both ways. I don't think you can give away the money in a tax cut \nand meet basic needs in the city. You have 12 months to prove me wrong. \nI will be watching.\n  I will be offering a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in a few moments \nthat addresses some of the yardsticks and criteria we hope to use in \nmeasuring the performance of the D.C. City Council.\n  At this point, I ask how much time I have remaining under the \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. At this point, I ask that my 5 minutes be held until \nSenator Hutchison has an opportunity to respond. If I may close, I will \nappreciate that.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have listened to Senator Durbin's \narguments on his amendment, and I have to say I am pleased that he is \nwithdrawing the amendment, because I think his amendment is absolutely \nflat wrong.\n  Let's talk about what would give kids a chance in the District of \nColumbia. A better education system would give kids a better chance in \nthe District of Columbia. We are funding health care for children in \nthis District with the Federal programs that are available throughout \nour country. We are providing better support for education--well, we \nare not providing it; in fact, I think the District is providing it, \nand I think they are doing a good job. They are saying that charter \nschools should be given a chance, that if a child cannot be given a \ngood public education in this system and that child chooses to go to a \ncharter school, they will have an equal allocation of resources as if \nthey were going to a public school--which a charter school is.\n  So the District is addressing education, because they want their kids \nto have a chance. We are putting more in crime prevention in this bill, \nin crime control, because we do think it is important to clean up \nneighborhoods. But a very important part of cleaning up neighborhoods \nis the tax cuts the District consensus budget envisions.\n  Now, the Senator from Illinois refers to these as giving away $59 \nmillion. Well, first of all, I don't think income tax cuts are giving \nmoney away. They are letting people who earn the money keep more of \nwhat they earn. Now, why would we support the District's decision to do \nthat? Because the District is trying to clean up the neighborhoods, to \ndo exactly what the Senator from Illinois wants to do--that is, have \nsafe and clean neighborhoods throughout the District of Columbia.\n  The way they are doing this is with, I think, a quite balanced tax \ncut program. The tax cuts for business will attract business into the \ncity. This city needs more business investment. It is a government \ncity. There isn't much commercial activity. The commercial activity \nwill clean up property. It will provide jobs. It will have economic \nviability. But it will also have more investment in beautification of \nthe city.\n  Attracting business through tax cuts is something that is being done \nall over this country by cities that are trying to be progressive and \nimprove their quality of life.\n  The tax cuts on the income tax side are so modest that I don't see \nhow anyone could possibly disagree with them. People in the District \nwho make $10,000 pay 6 percent in income taxes, and it would be lowered \nto 4 percent. It also gives breaks to the middle-income families that \nwe want to be able to live in the District.\n  We want to have a full range of families able to live in the \nDistrict, and we are trying to support the District's efforts to do \nexactly that--to make this a family-friendly city.\n  That is why it is so incredible that we would have any opposition to \nthe tuition assistance plan, because one of the factors that a family \nuses to choose where it lives is the higher education potential for \ntheir children. I have had people tell me that it is like getting a \n$25,000-a-year pay raise to move to Texas because in-State tuition at \nTexas University is so low. I mean, it is ridiculously low. It is about \n$1,000.\n  So a person moving to Texas getting a first-rate education from the \nUniversity of Texas, Texas A, all of our colleges, and universities \nthat are rated in the top 10, top 20, in many fields, have a good \nbargain.\n  But what about a child who is growing up in the District of Columbia? \nThey don't have a State university where they have an equal opportunity \nto go with in-State tuition because people are paying taxes to that \nState. This bill gives them that equal chance. This bill will equalize \nout-of-State tuition costs for D.C. students. So if they qualify to go \nto the University of Maryland, or the University of Virginia, or I hope \nthe University of Texas, they will be able to have that added tuition \nthey would have as an out-of-State student with these tuition \nassistance programs.\n  I think it is part of the overall strategy of the District to make \nthis city family friendly. They are making every attempt in the budget \nthey presented to us to give them a better chance for education at the \ngrade school, middle school, and high school level. This bill gives \nthem the chance to have out-of-State tuition lowered to in-State \ntuition, where they would qualify anywhere in the country.\n  This bill gives them more in crime prevention, more in crime control, \nand it says to businesses: We want you to come to the District, we want \nyou to make an investment in the District, because we want to clean up \nthe neighborhoods; and we know it is going to take a public-private \npartnership to do it.\n  But I think this bill is quite balanced. I think the District has \ndone a terrific job in trying to use the money it has--both the Federal \nbudget side and the local budget side--to do what is necessary to \nattract families back into the District to live, and to keep the \nfamilies that are here living here. If they don't do something about \nthe income tax rate, they are never going to attract people, because \nthe income tax rates on either side of them in Maryland and Virginia \nare half of what they are in the District.\n\n  I think the Mayor and the council should be commended for saying: We \nare going to make our city attractive, we are going to do it in a \nbalanced way, and we are going to meet the needs of the children in the \nDistrict. But every city in the country is looking for ways to make \ntheir cities attractive.\n  I am going to support the District in their efforts to make this city \nattractive for families. I am going to continue to work with Senator \nDurbin to try to make sure we are funding crime control in open air \ndrug markets. I am going to continue to work with the District in \ntrying to give charter schools a chance, if public education isn't \nserving the needs of individual children.\n  Let's give competition a chance. I think the District has been quite \nprogressive in doing that in their budget.\n  I defend the tax cuts. I defend the tuition assistance program, which \nhas bipartisan support, and the support of the President and the \nsupport of the District. I think we are going to see this city turn \naround.\n  I am going to support the council in every way I can when I think \nthey are going in the right direction. I think they are going in the \nright direction with tuition assistance. I hope Congress will authorize \nthis program so we can put it into effect for the next university year.\n  I think we will see a lot of activity in the District with people \nwanting to come here, stay here, and raise their families here. That \nwill be good for every American, because a safe city, a clean city, and \na city that has a low crime rate is going to be a city that every \nAmerican wants to bring their families to visit as our Capital City.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I respect what the Senator from Texas has said. I agree with much of \nwhat she said. I certainly agree the college tuition assistance program \nis a good one. I support it.\n\n[[Page S8060]]\n\n  I hope you can tell from the debate that our point of disagreement is \non the tax cut, and my belief is that tax cut money--at least a portion \nof it--should be dedicated toward making the District a safer place to \nlive, and making D.C. schools better schools--and addressing some of \nthe serious problems the children in this District face, problems which \nare, frankly, of a third world nature and seem to be ignored by this \nD.C. City Council.\n  Let me tell you, you shouldn't take the word of a Senator from \nIllinois, nor a Senator from Texas, about what D.C. residents are \ninterested in; you should take their own word.\n  When you look at the surveys of the people of the District of \nColumbia, Washington, DC, and their priorities, you search down that \nlist for a long way before they start talking about taxes. High on the \nlist is their concern about safety and crime in their neighborhoods. \nHow low could you bring taxes to attract a person into a neighborhood \nwhere they felt as though they were not safe?\n  So many members of my staff who would love to live on Capitol Hill \nwhere I live have finally reached the conclusion that they can't. One \nmember of my staff, after she was mugged a second time on Capitol Hill, \nand her face was swollen for about a week, gave up and moved out of \nWashington, DC, to a neighboring suburb. The taxes had nothing to do \nwith that.\n  I talked to another young couple, just the kind of people who should \nbe living in the District to make a great contribution. They said it \nfinally just wore them down--their concern about crime, their concern \nabout the filth they saw in the streets, and the rats running across \nthe streets as they came home in the evening. It finally just wore them \ndown, and they picked up and moved to a neighboring suburb. They didn't \nmention taxes. I am sure it is a concern. Nobody wants to pay any more \ntaxes than they have to.\n  But I think if this District were more livable when it came to the \nbasics of protecting families in their own homes and neighborhoods that \nyou would attract more people to live in what is otherwise in many \nplaces one of the most beautiful cities in America. The Senator from \nTexas said she wants Washington, DC, to be family friendly. I couldn't \nagree more. But first it has to be family safe. Unfortunately, it isn't \nclose.\n\n  When they did a survey of the people in the District of Columbia, 48 \npercent said they live in fear of crime in their neighborhood. When \nthey asked people in the District of Columbia, they had the highest \npercentage of residents among 12 cities surveyed indicating the \npresence of abandoned cars and rundown buildings. When they asked the \nresidents in the District of Columbia whether or not they had problems \nof public drug sales, they had the highest response in the Nation. \nPanhandling and begging was the highest in the Nation.\n  These are quality-of-life issues that need to be addressed by the \ncity council that should get its head out of the clouds and down on the \nstreet, talking to the people they represent.\n\n\n                      amendment no. 1224 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask my amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1224) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Illinois would strike the $17 million which is included in this \nbill to support a program offering tuition assistance to DC students \nwho are pursuing postsecondary education. As the author of legislation \nto authorize this program, I strongly oppose the Durbin amendment.\n  In crafting my legislation--which is cosponsored by Senators \nHutchison, Warner, and Moynihan--I have been mindful of the need for \nfiscal responsibility. The $17 million included in the DC \nappropriations bill is the amount recommended in the President's \nbudget. Although I would agree that any amounts above this figure \nshould come from sources other than the Federal treasury, I do believe \nit is appropriate for the Federal government to participate in an \neffort to place DC students on an even keel with students in other \nparts of the country.\n  The authorization process for the DC tuition bill is well underway. \nUnder the leadership of Representative Tom Davis and DC Delegate \nEleanor Holmes Norton, the House of Representatives approved ``The \nDistrict of Columbia College Access Act'' without a dissenting vote. \nThe Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, \nRestructuring and the District of Columbia--chaired by Senator \nVoinovich--recently held a hearing on this initiative. I am working \nactively with him and other members of the Senate to move forward with \nsound legislation.\n  The legislation I have introduced and the measure approved by the \nHouse share the same goal. That goal is to provide citizens of the \nDistrict with a greater range of options in pursuing postsecondary \neducation by having the Federal government offer support that, in other \nareas of the country, is provided by State governments.\n  Throughout my career in Congress, I have made support for education \none of my top priorities, and I have regarded the education of DC \nstudents as being an important part of my efforts.\n  I am therefore delighted at the level of interest and support which \nthe DC tuition concept has received.\n  With respect to public postsecondary education, DC students exploring \ntheir options find they have a more limited set of choices than any \nother group of students in the country. A student in any of the 50 \nstates who wishes to attend a public institution of higher education \nhas a number of institutions among which to choose. That student can \nbase his or her decision on considerations such as the size of the \ninstitution and the strengths of the various programs it offers. A \nstudent in the District of Columbia finds that only one public \ninstitution is available.\n  As a practical matter, the District cannot expand its boundaries, nor \ncan it establish a system of public higher education that can offer the \ndiversity of offerings available in the various states. Every State \nprovides support for higher education from which their residents \nbenefit through lower in-state tuition, while out-of-state residents \npay a premium to attend. I believe it is appropriate for the Federal \ngovernment to assume the role of the State, effectively pushing the \nboundaries to a point where District students are placed on an equal \nfooting in terms of the public education choices available to them.\n  The legislation also recognizes that many District residents choose \nto attend one of the many private postsecondary institutions in the DC \narea. Many of these institutions have made extraordinary efforts to \nenable District residents to succeed in their pursuit of advanced \neducation. A number of states have developed programs, such as the \nVirginia Tuition Assistance Grant (TAG), to assist students at private \ninstitutions in defraying costs. The program authorized in my bill is \nmodeled after these initiatives.\n  This legislation also complements not only those programs such as \n``Everybody Wins!'' and the Potomac Regional Education Partnership \n(PREP) with which I have been directly involved, but also the many \nother initiatives undertaken by individuals and institutions who work \ntirelessly to nurture the potential of the children of our Nation's \ncapital. Members of the business community have recently launched a \nprogram known as the D.C. College Access Program (DC-CAP) which will \noffer both financial support for students pursuing postsecondary \neducation and assistance to high school students to assure they are \nprepared to tackle the challenges of higher learning.\n  An investment in education is one of the most important investments \nwe as a society and we as individuals can make. There are boundless \nopportunities in the DC area for individuals with education and \ntraining beyond high school. DC residents should not be left behind in \nobtaining the capacity to take advantage of these opportunities.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as part of last October's Omnibus \nAppropriations bill, a provision (Section 130) in the District of \nColumbia's FY 99 appropriations placed a $50 per hour/$1,300 per case \ncap on attorney's fees in cases brought under the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act (IDEA) in the District.\n  In signing the bill, President Clinton singled out the cap in his \nremarks, calling it ``unacceptable'' and he\n\n[[Page S8061]]\n\npledged to eliminate the cap this year. However, it has again been \nincluded in this bill to fund the District. (Sec. 128)\n  This cap has made it virtually impossible for local special education \nattorneys to accept cases on contingency, which is required for \nindigent parents and court-supervised children. Attorneys are forced to \ndemand retainers from these residents, which precludes low-income \nparents from obtaining legal representation at all. In the end, the \npoorest kids in the District receive inadequate services from DCPS.\n  Federal law under the IDEA provides for the recovery of reasonable \nattorneys' fees at market rates. IDEA was passed with the understanding \nthat it applied to cases in all jurisdictions. Congress, however, has \nsingled out the District of Columbia and in effect has singled out poor \nfamilies and children who struggle to get even a basic education.\n  DCPS spends $165 million per year on about 12,000 special education \nstudents. The average per-pupil cost comes out to be $17,000 per year. \nOne in 10 District students are in need of special education program \nservices.\n  Yet, services rendered to these students are substandard at best. \nDisabled children wait months, and in some cases years, to have their \nspecial education needs evaluated by DCPS. Since DCPS doesn't have \nnearly enough special education programs to accommodate its students, \nstudents wait lengthy periods of time to be placed in an appropriate \nclassroom setting where they can receive essential related services.\n  In order to get these deserving kids assessed, parents have had to \nresort to litigation to get their children the services the law allows \nthem. The tangled system of DCPS is unnavigable without an experienced \nattorney and most parents can't afford to hire and retain counsel for \ntheir children.\n  So for years, lawyers have sued the system on behalf of thousands of \nchildren with physical, emotional or learning disabilities who have not \nreceived proper assessments or services. The school system is required \nto pay legal fees when the child's case prevails--which has occurred \nmost of the time.\n  The Washington Times reported in March that DCPS has committed funds \nto hire eight private attorneys to defend the school system in special \neducation cases. It is disconcerting that the District is willing to \npay the prevailing rate to ``defense'' attorney's to oppose parents, \nbut it claims it can't afford to pay the prevailing rate to attorneys \nto represent parents seeking to have their children assessed.\n  Three class action suits have been filed against DCPS and recently, \ntwo of those lawsuits were settled. Under the terms of the settlement, \nthe school system has agreed to hold hearings or otherwise resolve the \nbacklog of hearing requests, estimated at more than 700, by the end of \nsummer. The backlog of some 400 unimplemented decisions will be cleared \nup in stages, with the goal of reaching compliance with all decisions \nand agreement by the end of the first semester of the 1999-2000 school \nyear. One more class-action suit against the division remains \nunresolved.\n  In one of those cases, Federal District Court Judge Paul Friedman \nruled on May 11 that:\n  $4 million assessed for failure to comply with past court orders \n``has to be paid'';\n  The school system violated legal provisions by trying to apply the \ncongressional cap on fees for work performed before the cap was set;\n  The school system must pay more than $400,000 to one law firm, \nFeldman, Tucker, Leifer, Fidell & Bank, which has been handling a \nclass-action lawsuit for several years and has not been paid in more \nthan a year; and\n  Nothing in the law prevents judges from awarding attorney fees in \nspecial-education cases that continue longer than the one-year cap \nimposed this year. The city would simply be liable to pay the rest next \nyear, or whenever the cap is lifted [``The statute doesn't tell me I \ncan't award more than $50 an hour. It tells you can't pay more that $50 \nan hour.'']\n  The special education problems are an embarrassment and need to be \nresolved. The school system has to address this and the kids are \nentitled to counsel and counsel deserve to be paid fairly and \nreasonably for their work and the time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. This is a matter we can take up in conference.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, according to the unanimous consent \nagreement, it is now appropriate for Senator Durbin's sense of the \nSenate on D.C. quality of life. He has 15 minutes under his control; I \nhave 5 minutes under my control.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Texas. I will make it brief \nbecause I have spoken on my concerns about the District of Columbia. My \nreason for withdrawing the last amendment is my belief that not only is \nit a high priority of the White House, it is fundamentally a sound \nprogram, as I said from the start.\n  My quarrel is what I consider to be the irresponsible action of the \nD.C. City Council with the so-called tax cut they have enacted. The \nsense of the Senate, which I make a part of this appropriations bill, \nsays the D.C. City Council has a chance to prove their theory; they \nhave a chance to prove the $59 million in tax cuts is more important \nthan $59 million spent on police protection; $59 million, a part of \nwhich could be spent on the schools; $59 million, a part of which could \nbe spent to try to help these poor babies who are dying because of low \nbirthweight and other problems.\n  You have your chance. That is what home rule is all about. The sense \nof the Senate says it is a sense of the Senate that in considering the \nDistrict of Columbia's fiscal year 2001 budget, the Senate will take \ninto consideration progress or lack of progress in addressing the \nfollowing issues: crime, including the homicide rate; implementation of \ncommunity policing; the number of police officers on local beats; and \nthe closing down of open-air drug markets.\n  Second, access to drug abuse treatment, including the number of \ntreatment slots, the number of people served, the number of people on \nwaiting lists, and the effectiveness of treatment drugs. Remember that \nHIV-AIDS is seven times more prevalent in the District of Columbia than \nin other city.\n  The third item on the sense of the Senate is management of parolees \nand pretrial violent offenders, including the number of halfway house \nescapees, and steps taken to improve monitoring and supervision of \nhalfway house residents to reduce the number of escapees.\n  Pick up the paper with regularity and you will find that the so-\ncalled halfway houses have revolving doors. Those accused of felonious \nconduct and violent crime are back on the street, walking in the \nneighborhoods of the District of Columbia, shoulder to shoulder with \nthe people who live here and those who come to visit the Nation's \ncapital.\n  That has to change. It is one of the criteria which I will personally \nuse, and I hope others will use, during the course of this \nconsideration of criteria for future appropriations for the District of \nColumbia.\n  Fourth, education including access to special education services and \nstudent achievement.\n  Fifth, improvement in the city's basic services, including rat \ncontrol and abatement.\n  Six, the application for and management of Federal grants. This D.C. \ncity government has not even applied for the money it is eligible for \nfrom the Federal Government. They have to reach a level of competence \nand it may mean achieving some in phases. I hope the Mayor is \nlistening, and I hope the members of the D.C. City Council will be \nresponsible for that.\n  Finally, the indicators of child well-being, which I mentioned \nearlier. Let's see next year, when we gather to debate this \nappropriation, whether the District of Columbia is still in last place \namong all the States in the Nation in so many categories which reflect \nthe well-being of the children who live here.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1227\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the urgent need \n to address basic quality of life concerns in the District of Columbia)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I retain the remainder of my time and offer the \namendment, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S8062]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1227.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____ (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The District of Columbia has recently witnessed a spate \n     of senseless killings of innocent citizens caught in the \n     crossfire of shootings. A Justice Department crime \n     victimization survey found that while the city saw a decline \n     in the homicide rate between 1996 and 1997, the rate was the \n     highest among a dozen cities and more than double the second \n     highest city.\n       (2) The District of Columbia has not made adequate funding \n     available to fight drug abuse in recent years, and the city \n     has not deployed its resources as effectively as possible. In \n     fiscal year 1998, $20,900,000 was spent on publicly funded \n     drug treatment in the District compared to $29,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 1993. The District's Addiction and Prevention and \n     Recovery Agency currently has only 2,200 treatment slots, a \n     50 percent drop from 1994, with more than 1,100 people on \n     waiting lists.\n       (3) The District of Columbia has seen a rash of inmate \n     escapes from halfway houses. According to Department of \n     Corrections records, between October 21, 1998 and January 19, \n     1999, 376 of the 1,125 inmates assigned to halfway houses \n     walked away. Nearly 280 of the 376 escapees were awaiting \n     trial including 2 charged with murder.\n       (4) The District of Columbia public schools system faces \n     serious challenges in correcting chronic problems, \n     particularly long-standing deficiencies in providing special \n     education services to the 1 in 10 District students needing \n     program benefits, including backlogged assessments, and \n     repeated failure to meet a compliance agreement on special \n     education reached with the Department of Education.\n       (5) Deficiencies in the delivery of basic public services \n     from cleaning streets to waiting time at Department of Motor \n     Vehicles to a rat population estimated earlier this year to \n     exceed the human population have generated considerable \n     public frustration.\n       (6) Last year, the District of Columbia forfeited millions \n     of dollars in Federal grants after Federal auditors \n     determined that several agencies exceeded grant restrictions \n     and in other instances, failed to spend funds before the \n     grants expired.\n       (7) Findings of a 1999 report by the Annie E. Casey \n     Foundation that measured the well-being of children reflected \n     that, with 1 exception, the District ranked worst in the \n     United States in every category from infant mortality to the \n     rate of teenage births to statistics chronicling child \n     poverty.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that in considering the District of Columbia's fiscal year \n     2001 budget, the Senate will take into consideration progress \n     or lack of progress in addressing the following issues:\n       (1) Crime, including the homicide rate, implementation of \n     community policing, the number of police officers on local \n     beats, and the closing down of open-air drug markets.\n       (2) Access to drug abuse treatment, including the number of \n     treatment slots, the number of people served, the number of \n     people on waiting lists, and the effectiveness of treatment \n     programs.\n       (3) Management of parolees and pretrial violent offenders, \n     including the number of halfway house escapes and steps taken \n     to improve monitoring and supervision of halfway house \n     residents to reduce the number of escapes.\n       (4) Education, including access to special education \n     services and student achievement.\n       (5) Improvement in basic city services, including rat \n     control and abatement.\n       (6) Application for and management of Federal grants.\n       (7) Indicators of child well-being.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Illinois has \na very good sense of the Senate. I think having benchmarks and \naccountability we can look at next year is very appropriate. I commend \nhim for caring about these crime issues and the issues that we all want \nto solve.\n  I certainly support his amendment and suggest we approve it \nunanimously.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1227) was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1228 Through 1231, En Bloc\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have a group of managers' amendments \nwhich I will send to the desk and ask for their immediate \nconsideration. They have been cleared on both sides. I urge their \nadoption. There are two amendments by Senator Dorgan and two amendments \nby myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes amendments \n     numbered 1228 through 1231, en bloc.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1228\n\n(Purpose: To encourage the Major of the District of Columbia to adhere \n to the recommendations of the Health Care Development Commission with \n    respect to the use of Medicaid Disproportionate Share payments)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.  . The Mayor, prior to using Federal Medicaid payments \n     to Disproportionate Share Hospitals to serve a small number \n     of childless adults, should consider the recommendations of \n     the Health Care Development Commission that has been \n     appointed by the Council of the District of Columbia to \n     review this program, and consult and report to Congress on \n     the use of these funds.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1229\n\n(Purpose: To allow the District of Columbia Public Schools to consider \n          funding of a program to discourage school violence)\n\n       On page 13, line 17, insert the following: ``Provided \n     further, That the District of Columbia Public Schools may \n     spend $500,000 to engage in a Schools Without Violence \n     program based on a model developed by the University of North \n     Carolina, located in Greensboro, North Carolina.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1230\n\n(Purpose: To require a GAO study of the criminal justice system of the \n                         District of Columbia)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

TERMINATION OF PAROLE FOR ILLEGAL DRUG USE.\n\n       (a) Arrest For Violation of Parole.--Section 205 of title \n     24 of the District of Columbia Code is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``If the'' and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(a) If the''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), with respect to a \n     prisoner who is convicted of a crime of violence (as defined \n     in Sec. 23-1331) and who is released on parole at any time \n     during the term or terms of the prisoner's sentence for that \n     offense, the Board of Parole shall issue a warrant for the \n     retaking of the prisoner in accordance with this section, if \n     the Board, or any member thereof, has reliable information \n     (including positive drug test results) that the prisoner has \n     illegally used a controlled substance (as defined in Sec. 33-\n     501) at any time during the term or terms of the prisoner's \n     sentence.''.\n       (b) Hearing After Arrest; Termination of Parole.--Section \n     206 of title 24 of the District of Columbia Code is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, \n     with respect to a prisoner with respect to whom a warrant is \n     issued under section 205(b), if, after a hearing under this \n     section, the Board of Parole determines that the prisoner has \n     illegally used a controlled substance (as defined in Sec. 33-\n     501) at any time during the term or terms of the prisoner's \n     sentence, the Board shall terminate the parole of that \n     prisoner.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1227 through 1231) were agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1283, the \nDistrict of Columbia Appropriations bill for FY 2000 as reported by the \nSenate Appropriations Committee.\n  The bill provides $410 million in new budget authority and $401 \nmillion in new outlays for federal contributions to the District of \nColumbia government. When outlays from prior-year budget authority and \nother completed actions are taken into account, the Senate bill totals \n$410 million in budget authority and $405 million in outlays for FY \n2000.\n\n[[Page S8063]]\n\n  I commend the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee, Senator \nHutchison, for her hard work and diligence in fashioning this bill. The \nbill is exactly at the Senate Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. The \nbill is $17 million in budget authority and $12 million in outlays \nabove the President's request due to the inclusion of a tuition \nassistance program for D.C. students who attend out-of-state colleges. \nThe Administration has requested these funds, however, through the \nDepartment of Education rather than directly to the District of \nColumbia.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate Budget \nCommittee scoring of the District of Columbia Appropriations bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    S. 1283, D.C.

Totals adjusted\n  for consistency with scorekeeping conventions.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is all the amendments we have pending. If there \nare no further amendments, I ask that the bill be read for a third \ntime.\n  The bill was ordered to be read for a third time.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will take a couple of minutes to express my appreciation \nto the two managers of this bill. I chaired the subcommittee on \nappropriations for the District of Columbia for 7 years, beginning in \n1961 and ending in 1968.\n  This is not just an ordinary city, as we all know. I have traveled in \nmany areas of the world, as have most Senators. I have been in many \ncities of the world, but this is the only Federal city in the world. \nThis is the only Federal city in the United States.\n  Referring to the words of the Constitution, article I, section 9, it \nis the seat of the Government of the United States. It is not ``a'' \nseat of the Government of the United States, it is ``the'' seat of the \nGovernment of the United States.\n  So it is a unique city. It is the only city of its kind in this \ncountry. It is the only city of its kind in the universe.\n  I compliment these two Senators. It is 20 minutes after 9 o'clock on \nwhat will be the last day the Senate will be in session until after \nnext week. These two Senators are here discussing important matters.\n  As I sat here, I thought this bill is one that the Senate should vote \non. Senators should be here and should vote on this bill.\n  Next year, all things being equal, it is my intention at the present \ntime to see that we have a vote on this bill, a rollcall vote. I think \nSenators should indicate that much interest in ``the'' city of the \nFederal Government of the United States.\n  I happen to agree with the distinguished Senator from Illinois in \nrespect to his comments concerning a tax cut. Senators will not find me \nsupporting very many tax cuts, whether it is for the District of \nColumbia or elsewhere. I will have plenty to say about that in due \ntime. But every Senator has a right to his own viewpoint. Every Senator \nis here representing his own State, trying to do the best he can. That \nis what I am trying to do. But we all have a responsibility toward this \ncity.\n  I referred to the job of the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mrs. \nHutchison, and the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, as \nbeing a thankless task. What did I mean by that? That was not spoken in \npejorative terms, it was not in derogation of the District of Columbia, \nbut it is a thankless task insofar as getting any credit from the folks \nback home is concerned. It doesn't get any Senator any votes back home, \nif that is what one expects. So in that respect, it is a thankless \ntask.\n  But we all, all 100 Senators and every person in the United States, \nowe our thanks to the Senators who give of their time to fulfill this \nresponsibility. It is a responsibility; it is a duty. Nobody wants this \njob. I didn't want it, but I held it for 7 years and gave it my best \nbecause I thought that the District of Columbia was entitled to the \nbest of my talents, my energy, and whatever limited wisdom I possessed. \nSo we owe that to the District of Columbia. It is our capital. It is \nour seat of our Federal Government.\n  So I thank both Senators. They spend a lot of time on this matter, I \ncan tell you, and it is not easy. And they are subject to many \ncriticisms from editorials in papers in the District and from \neditorials, probably, in their own States. They are subject to these \ncriticisms. In return, as I say, they won't get many thanks. But they \nget my thanks. I hope to call this to the attention of the Senate, as I \nam now trying to do, as I am saying to the people of the United States \nwho may be watching at this hour: These two Senators are entitled to \nthe thanks and the congratulations of the people of the United States \nand the people of the District of Columbia.\n  There are people in the District of Columbia who do not look back \nwith great satisfaction on certain recent years. There is a Delegate to \nthe U.S. House of Representatives. She has the privilege of the floor. \nShe is not sitting in the gallery. The rules say that we cannot call \nattention to people in the galleries. I hope Senators will read that \nrule and refresh their memory. I trust the Presiding Officers will keep \nthat in mind in the future and call it to the attention of any Senator \nwho refers to people in the gallery; a person, name those persons. But \nwe can refer to an elected Delegate to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives who has the privilege of this floor. I do that now with \nrespect to Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton. She is highly respected, \nhighly regarded, and she gives the best of her talents and services to \nthe people of the District of Columbia who elected her. I salute her.\n  Again, I close by thanking the two fine Senators who have labored \nhere and worked so late. I daresay the Senator from Texas would \nprobably be on her way home, home in Texas. And the Senator from \nIllinois, I am quite sure, would be on his way home in Illinois. But he \nhad a job to do here. He had a responsibility. I salute him, I thank \nhim, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think that was a very special \nstatement made by the Senator from West Virginia, and I appreciate very \nmuch that he loves this Capitol and the seat of Government for all \nAmericans. The fact that he spent 7 years on the Appropriations \nCommittee chairing this subcommittee means that there was a lot of \nattention and a lot of care paid to this city.\n  I think he is right. I think we need to make sure this is a job well \ndone. This is every bit as important as what I do for my constituents \nin Texas, because this is part of what I do for my constituents in \nTexas, and that is to make this the city that we all want it to be.\n  I am very pleased the Senator recognized Delegate Eleanor Holmes \nNorton. I was going to do that as well, because Delegate Norton is so \ninterested in everything that applies to the District and she is always \nthere, making sure that her constituents are represented. I have been \nvery pleased to work with her and talk to her about these issues that \naffect her constituents. I hope she knows that all of us look at this \nCapital City as all America's city, which does give it a very special \nplace in everyone's heart and means that all of us are going to take a \nspecial interest in making it a great city.\n\n[[Page S8064]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I might just take a moment of time here \nto thank the Senator from West Virginia. His kind words are high praise \nindeed.\n  This Washington, DC, has many museums which contain many national \ntreasures, but the Senate has its own treasure in the Senator from West \nVirginia, and his dedication to this institution is just unparalleled. \nThe fact that he would praise us for staying after 9 o'clock to do our \njob of course is belied by the fact that he is still here, prepared to \nsay a few words as well, doing his job, as he always does, for the \npeople of West Virginia.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia, as well as my colleague from \nTexas, for their kindnesses during consideration of this bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank both Senators.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think we need to pass the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on final passage of the bill.\n  The bill (S. 1283) was passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate receives from the House of Representatives the companion bill to \nS. 1283, the Senate immediately proceed to the consideration of that \nmeasure, that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of \nthe Senate bill, S. 1283, as passed, be inserted in lieu thereof, that \nthe House bill, as amended, be read for a third time and passed, that \nthe Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House \non the disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate and that the \nforegoing occur without any intervening action or debate.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the bill, S. 1283, not be \nengrossed, that it remain at the desk pending receipt of the House \ncompanion bill, and that upon passage by the Senate of the House bill \nas amended, the passage of S. 1283 be vitiated and the bill be \nindefinitely postponed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to thank profusely the staff \nwho have worked so hard on this bill. As Senator Byrd said earlier, \nthis takes a lot of time, because there are a lot of issues that are \naffected by this bill. I want to thank Mary Beth Nethercutt on the \nAppropriations Committee and Terry Sauvain, her counterpart on the \nminority side. They have done a wonderful job making sure that all the \nt's are crossed and the i's are dotted and the agreements are made and \nthe agreements to disagree are put on the table. They have done a \nwonderful job.\n  On my staff, my legislative director Jim Hyland and Robb Woodson, who \nis the legislative assistant who has done so much to try to make sure \nthat this is a very good and solid bill supporting the District of \nColumbia.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank everyone for a job well done and \nappreciate once again Senator Durbin's cooperation. We have had a great \nrelationship. We have agreed to disagree on some issues, but I think he \nspeaks from the heart, and I understand, even when we disagree, that we \nwant the same goal. For that reason, I know we will have a good bill to \ncome back out of conference for the Senate to adopt, and then we will \ncontinue to work with the District government to make sure our views \nare implemented and their views are implemented.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8064-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1186, As Modified\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Mr. President, a thoughtful and detailed article appeared \nabout a week ago in the Portland Oregonian indicating public \nexpenditures of close to $1 billion during the current year directed at \nthe recovery of salmon runs in the Pacific Northwest. That is an \nextraordinarily large amount of money for a purpose of that nature.\n  A modest portion of it comes from State appropriations of the four \nStates in the Columbia River drainage area. The largest single share of \nthat almost $1 billion is paid for through the charges for electric \npower produced by the Bonneville Power Administration and others, and, \ntherefore, by the residents of the region, but a very substantial share \nof that money comes from appropriations approved by this Congress.\n  As recently as 1 year or 18 months ago, I and many others in the \nregion were critical of the billions of dollars of spending for this \npurpose on the grounds that they had shown few, if any results, and \nthat, in fact, salmon runs had declined during that period of time.\n  That criticism is no longer entirely correct. We have had some recent \nsuccesses, and I will mention a few of them in just a moment. But I \nthink all would agree that those successes are not at this point a \nproper return on an investment of almost $1 billion a year.\n  For example, with the aid and assistance of my friend and colleague, \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia, the Interior appropriations bill \nfor the current year included $20 million appropriated to the State of \nWashington for these purposes. And this Senator has to confess that he \nis not entirely certain what the people of the United States have \ngotten for that $20 million at this point.\n\n  This Senator cannot point to a single significant success as a \nresult. Part of the reason, of course, is that in the current year, the \nspending of that money has not been completed. Part of it is that the \nprograms which it funds are new, and part of it is the fact that the \nvery nature of the salmon resource requires a number of years to tell \nwhether or not any positive results will take place. But nonetheless, \nwe are faced with that very real challenge of determining whether or \nnot we are getting our money's worth out of these investments.\n  For the next year, for fiscal year 2000, I can identify in our own \nwork in this body significant amounts of money coming from the energy \nand water appropriations bill, especially through the Army Corps of \nEngineers, through the agriculture appropriations bill, through the \nCommerce-State-Justice appropriations bill, particularly\n\n[[Page S8065]]\n\nclose to $100 million for the enforcement and maintenance of a recent \ntreaty signed with Canada on the subject of salmon in the Northwest, \nthrough the Environmental Protection Agency, and once again, through \nthe appropriations bill the Senator from West Virginia and I will \nmanage for the Department of Interior and related agencies.\n  In addition, of course, there will be those huge amounts of money, \nclose to half a billion dollars a year, through rates charged for \nelectricity by the Bonneville Power Administration and somewhat \nenhanced appropriations from the four States.\n  There are many, and I have been occasionally tempted toward this \nposition myself, who will say that if we are not getting our money's \nworth and if there are so many different entities spending money on \nsalmon recovery, would it not be appropriate to have a single federally \nappointed salmon czar who would determine how all of this money would \nbe spent.\n  The argument for that proposition, I think, would be much stronger if \nthere were a single salmon science; that is to say, if we knew \nprecisely what we were doing, if there were one accepted way of getting \nthe most for our money in connection with salmon recovery.\n  Of course, at this point, there is not. There are serious, well-\nfounded debates throughout the country and in the Pacific Northwest as \nto various, widely different policy prescriptions for salmon recovery.\n  To have one decisionmaker for all of these expenditures is perhaps \nnot wise, at least until we have learned a good deal more about how we \ngo about attaining our goals.\n  I do think, however, there could be considerably more coordination \nthan there is at the present time. Three years ago, I persuaded the \nCongress, as a rider on an appropriations bill, to create an \nindependent scientific review board to advise the Bonneville Power \nAdministration on how to spend the more than $100 million a year in \nactual cash grants that it gives for salmon recovery. I had learned in \nthe previous year that those decisions were made by various self-\ninterested parties who awarded almost all of the money themselves \nwithout any discernible positive impact at all, and the situation with \nrespect to that roughly 10 percent of the money spent on salmon \nrecovery has been considerably improved by that independent scientific \nreview.\n  I introduced a bill this year that would expand its authority to all \nthe decisions made by the Bonneville Power Administration, not just \ndirect money grants, but revenue foregone from its power cells, and I \nhope that the Congress will soon consider and pass that proposal.\n\n  Nevertheless, there remains a great deal of room for additional \nexperimentation in connection with salmon recovery.\n  The bill which will be presented by the Senator from West Virginia \nand myself in a few weeks for the Department of the Interior will \ninclude a modest $4 million figure that will not go directly to the \nState of Washington, in this case, but will go, I hope, through a \nnonprofit organization which tells us that it can more than match the \namount of money that we will appropriate and will direct most of its \nmoney at private volunteer citizen organizations.\n  I have found that those organizations do give us very much value for \nthe money. Earlier this year, one local group of salmon recovery \nvolunteers joined forces with a landowner on Snow Creek in my State. \nThey received the cooperation of the Association of General Contractors \nin the State of Washington, an association that has a huge investment \nin connection with salmon recovery because of the impact of the \nEndangered Species Act on its ability to build.\n  Together, these volunteer organizations and private donors and \nrepresentatives of the building industry have come up with an extremely \nconstructive and almost certainly effective salmon recovery plan for a \nsingle stream. Like them, an organization of volunteers called Long \nLive the Kings is one of the dozen or more such organizations in the \nState of Washington, each of which is working on a single stream or \ngroup of streams with tremendous volunteer labor and great enthusiasm. \nAid and assistance to them without detailed regulation from the State \nseems to me to be a wise investment of a modest portion of our money in \nthis respect.\n  There are some in this body and others who say this is a regional \nproblem and it should be paid for entirely by the region itself. And \ncertainly the people of the Pacific Northwest put a very high value on \nsalmon recovery.\n  But the way in which they must approach that salmon recovery is \ngoverned almost entirely, some would say distorted, by the Endangered \nSpecies Act, an act of the Congress of the United States which is both \nbroad in one sense and very narrow in another sense in its scope, and \ngoverns many decisions in the State far beyond simply the management of \nour waters and of our salmon recovery itself.\n  So the Federal Government, having imposed these requirements, has an \nobligation at least substantially to help fund them. Nevertheless, I am \nhere today to say that while this is a very high priority of the \nCongress, an extremely high priority of the people in my State and the \nother States in the Columbia River Basin, it is one on which we know \nand believe we should be held accountable by the Congress. We will do \nthe best job we possibly can with the moneys appropriated by Congress \nor directed by Congress to see to it that we are successful.\n  Recent listings in the Puget Sound area now have the Endangered \nSpecies Act, for the first time, as having an immense impact on a major \nmetropolitan area in the United States. The people of my State are \neager to take on that task. They have asked for modest help from us \nhere. We are giving them that modest help. We will keep Congress and \nthe people of the United States advised of how well we are doing with \nthe generous assistance that my colleagues have helped me to provide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8065-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8065-S8066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE ALABAMA STURGEON\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the story of the efforts to protect the \nAlabama Sturgeon has been a very long and very ugly one. For many years \nCongress has been involved. Just three years ago, Congress thought they \nhad put an end to the listing battle when a partnership was formed \nbetween the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the Alabama Department \nof Natural Resources and Conservation. A five-year recovery plan was \nestablished to repopulate the Tennessee-Tombigbee with Sturgeon. Now \nthis program has fallen to pieces, because the FWS pulled the plug by \ntaking the dedicated funds and proceeding directly to a formal listing \nunder the Endangered Species Act.\n  The FWS needs to do the right thing. For me, this means the FWS \nshould honor the partnership it set up with Alabama's Department of \nConservation and Natural Resources. This program is at year three of a \n5-year program and there is no evidence that the state of Alabama was \nperforming poorly. However, it is clear the FWS wants to renege on the \ndeal. Renege on a program that provides more direct and dedicated \nfunding, and thus more resources, for the Alabama Sturgeon restoration \nthan any funds the Fish and Wildlife Service spent under its own \nauspices. This simply does not make fiscal or scientific sense.\n  In both 1993 and 1994 Congress opposed the endangered species listing \nof the Alabama Sturgeon because of the lack of sound science. Congress \nalso recognized the tremendous economic impact this listing would have \non our region. The listing would have caused billions of dollars in \nriver commerce to be disrupted. Nothing has changed in six years--no \nnew science--no difference in the economic impact.\n  The FWS promised that the habitat designation will not require the \nstopping of dredging. However, someone forgot to tell the FWS office in \nDaphne, Alabama, what their position is supposed to be. The FWS office \nin Daphne, Alabama, has stated in writing that maintenance dredging \nwill harm the sturgeon, and thus must not occur. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the attached letter written to the Mobile, Alabama, office \nof the Army Corps of Engineers on June 17, 1999, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S8066]]\n\n\n                                  U.S. Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                    Fish and Wildlife Service,\n\n                                        Daphne, AL, June 17, 1999.\n     District Engineer,\n     U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,\n     Mobile, AL.\n       Dear Sir: This is the report of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \n     Service (Service) concerning public notice AL99-01811-F, in \n     which the applicant, Boise Cascade Corporation, is proposing \n     to hydraulically maintenance dredge approximately 2,000 cubic \n     yards of silt, sand, and clay, per year, for five years from \n     the Tombigbee River, near mile 89, Washington County, \n     Alabama. All excavated material would be placed in the \n     applicant's upland disposal site. The proposed maintenance \n     dredging is currently authorized by Department of the Army \n     General Permit Number ALG98-02923-E. This report is prepared \n     in accordance with the requirements of the Fish and Wildlife \n     Coordination Act (16 U.S.C. 661-667e) and is to be used in \n     your determination of 404(b)(1) guidelines compliance (40 CFR \n     230) and in your public interest review (33 CFR 320.4) as \n     they relate to protection of fish and wildlife resources.\n       We do not believe that this project would have significant \n     impacts on non endangered fish and wildlife resources. \n     However, we have determined that the federally threatened \n     gulf sturgeon (Acipenser axyrhincus desotoi) occurs in the \n     project area. Our records indicate that this species has been \n     found in the Tombigbee River both upstream and downstream of \n     the proposed dredge site. The Gulf Sturgeon is an anadromous \n     fish that migrates from salt water into coastal rivers to \n     spawn and spend warm months. The majority of its life is \n     spent in fresh water. Major population limiting factors are \n     thought to include barriers (dams) to historical spawning \n     habitats, loss of habitat, poor water quality, and over \n     fishing. However, we have determined that the proposed \n     project will likely not affect this species if the following \n     recommendations are adopted and used:\n       (1) No dredging work shall be performed during the months \n     November through April.\n       (2) No work should be conducted across the entire river \n     channel at any one time. (All underwater activity shall be \n     limited to one general location within the river channel at \n     any time.)\n       (3) No work barges or vessels should be moored in shallow \n     waters along the shorelines from November through April.\n       If the applicant agrees to these conditions, formal \n     consultation under the Endangered Species Act, Section 7, \n     will not be necessary at this time. Implementation of these \n     measures should provide adequate protection to avoid any \n     impact on Gulf sturgeon inhabiting these waters during winter \n     months or migrating to/from the Gulf of Mexico. Therefore, if \n     they are followed, no further endangered species consultation \n     will be required for this portion of the project unless: (1) \n     the identified action is subsequently modified in a manner \n     that causes an effect on this listed species; (2) new \n     information reveals the identified action may affect another \n     Federally protected species or a critical habitat in a manner \n     or to an extent not previously considered; or (3) a new \n     species is listed or a critical habitat is designated under \n     the Endangered Species Act that may be affected by the \n     identified action. Our positions on the proposed maintenance \n     dredging project is based on the assumption that Best \n     Management Practices will be followed and the Alabama State \n     Section 401 CWA certification is not violated.\n       If you have any questions, please contact Mr. Dean \n     Heckathorn at 334/441-5181.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       E.R. Roach,\n                                          Acting Field Supervisor.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. This letter clearly states that dredging can only occur \nduring six months of the year, and at no time can work be conducted \nacross the entire river channel. It is clear to me, and it is clear to \nall my colleagues in the chamber today that dredging will be stopped. \nAlso, on May 10, 1999, the FWS office in Daphne, Alabama, again wrote \nthe Mobile Corp about another maintenance dredging project in Mobile. I \nask unanimous consent that this letter to the Mobile Corp of Engineers \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  U.S. Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                    Fish and Wildlife Service,\n\n                                         Daphne, AL, May 10, 1999.\n     District Engineer,\n     U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,\n     Mobile, AL.\n       Dear Sir: This is the report of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \n     Service (Service) concerning public notice AL99-01328-S in \n     which the applicant, Kimberly-Clark Corporation, is proposing \n     to maintenance dredge within an existing dry dock slip on \n     David Lake, near Mobile River, Mobile County, Alabama. A 200-\n     foot-long by 52-foot-wide area would be dredged to a depth of \n     minus 24 mean low water (MLW). All material would be placed \n     within an existing upland disposals area. This report is \n     prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Fish and \n     Wildlife Coordination Act (16 U.S.C. 661-667e) and is to be \n     used in your determination of 404(b)(1) guidelines compliance \n     (40 CFR 230) and in your public interest review (33 CFR \n     320.4) as they relate to protection of fish and wildlife \n     resources.\n       The Service does not object to this proposed project. \n     However, the federally listed Gulf sturgeon (Acipenser \n     oxyrinchus desotoi--Threatened) and the proposed for listing, \n     Alabama sturgeon (Scaphirhyncus suttkusl) are found in these \n     waters. The Gulf sturgeon is an anadromous fish which \n     migrates from salt water into large coastal river to spawn \n     and spend the warm months. According to our records the Gulf \n     sturgeon seasonally occurs and the Alabama sturgeon is a \n     permanent resident within the Mobile River. Throughout their \n     ranges these species have had their forage and spawning \n     habitats adversely affected from dams. In addition, dredging, \n     desnagging, and spoil deposition carried out in connection \n     with channel improvement and maintenance represent an ongoing \n     threat to these sturgeon species.\n       In order to avoid adverse impacts to these species covered \n     by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, (16 U.S.C. \n     1531 et seq.) (ESA), we recommend that the applicant \n     implement appropriate Best Management Practices (BMPs) \n     including the use of turbidity screens, as necessary to \n     minimize turbidity downstream of the project site. Dredging \n     activities should not exceed ambient water clarity of more \n     than 50 Nephelometric turbidity units (NTU's). The Service \n     believes that your project will not have an adverse effect on \n     these sturgeon species, if these BMPs are followed. If these \n     conditions are not acceptable then further consultation with \n     this office is recommended in accordance with Section 7 of \n     the ESA.\n       Should you have any questions or require additional \n     information, please contact Mr. Dean Heckathorn at (334) 441-\n     5181.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       E.R. Roach,\n                                          Acting Field Supervisor.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. This letter stated ``dredging, desnagging, and spoil \ndisposition carried out in connection with channel improvement and \nmaintenance represent an ongoing threat to these sturgeon species.'' \nAgain this proves dredging will be stopped, and the FWS will not hold \ntrue to its oral promises here in Washington.\n  During this time frame a lawsuit has also been pending in the United \nStates District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, styled \nAlabama Sturgeon. et al. v. Bruce Babbitt, as Secretary of the \nInterior, et al. Two months ago, on April 26, 1999, the court issued an \nOrder noting the parties were engaged in ``settlement negotiations'' \nwhich were likely to lead to dismissal of the lawsuit. Four days later, \non April 30, 1999, for some unknown reason the court issued the Order \nproposing to dismiss the lawsuit upon the payment of $20,000 in \nattorneys' fees and costs to the plaintiffs by the government. Neither \nthe Court Order nor the Joint Stipulation of Dismissal and Notice of a \nCompromise Settlement of Attorney's fees and Costs makes any attempt to \njustify the rationale for this result. For some reason the Justice \nDepartment apparently decided to simply make a gift of $20,000 to the \nlawyers in this case.\n  This Administration has not only given away $20,000 to these lawyers \nto sweep this lawsuit under the rug, it also stole more than $400,000 \ndesignated for sturgeon restoration. I am disappointed by these \nactions.\n  It is my firm belief that Alabama's Federal partner is not motivated \nby a desire to restore the sturgeon. Clearly, making a decision to list \nthe Alabama Sturgeon as an endangered species, while having no new \nscientific information must be based in politics--not science. Why an \nadversarial approach? The solution to this politically driven problem \nis simple. Let Alabama finish its 5-year program. The Fish and Wildlife \nService action is wrong for Alabama . . . wrong for Mississippi . . . \nwrong for America.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to call the \nattention of my colleagues to an important day for one of our former \ncolleagues; and that is, Senator Jim Sasser, who is returning from \nChina where he has served this country very well as our Ambassador for \nthe last 3\\1/2\\ years. He was confirmed in this Senate on December 19, \n1995, and with an overwhelming vote.\n  We are proud of the service he has performed, particularly in recent \nmonths, because of the strained relations we have had and the genuine \nmisunderstanding which has existed concerning the bombing of the \nChinese Embassy in Belgrade.\n\n[[Page S8067]]\n\n  I think all of us were proud to see the way former Senator Sasser, \nAmbassador Sasser, conducted himself, and how all of the American \nEmbassy personnel conducted themselves in that circumstance. I think \nthat is typical of the service he provided throughout the time he was \nin China.\n  We are glad to see him back in the United States. We, of course, look \nforward to many years of friendship with him in the future.\n  I think it is worth noting, because I understand he is returning \ntoday from China and has distinguished himself in that position and \ndeserves recognition.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to honor one of our former \ncolleagues, Jim Sasser, who today completes his term as United States \nAmbassador to China.\n  I was honored to serve with Jim Sasser during my first two years as a \nmember of this body. He served the people of Tennessee with \ndistinction. As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, \nI was pleased to support his nomination to be our Ambassador to China \nboth in Committee and on the Senate floor. Although I have serious \nconcerns about United States policy toward China, I believe that \nAmbassador Sasser served this country admirably during a period of \nimmense strain in the complex relationship between the two countries.\n  In particular, he displayed enormous poise and courage in the days \nthat followed the unfortunate, tragic, and accidental bombing of the \nChinese embassy in Belgrade. For more than four days, Ambassador Sasser \nand numerous staff members were literally trapped inside the United \nStates embassy in Beijing as thousands of demonstrators chanted anti-\nAmerican slogans and threw rocks at the embassy from the streets \noutside. I commend him for the calm and diplomatic manner in which he \ndealt with this tense situation. He reminded us that ambassadors are \nmore than just the official representatives of the United States; they \nare also the chiefs of mission with responsibility for the staff of \nmany U.S. agencies, as well as the responsibility for the safety of \nAmerican citizens living or traveling in the countries in which they \nserve. Our former colleague carried out all of these functions \nadmirably under difficult conditions.\n  I wish Ambassador Sasser well in his future endeavors.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like now to take a moment to \nacknowledge the accomplishments of my former colleague and friend James \nSasser, the United States Ambassador to the People's Republic of China. \nI need not remind the Senate of the quality of his leadership as fellow \nmember, and former chairman, of the Budget Committee. It is not his 18 \nyear tenure in the Senate that I want to discuss at this time, but his \ndistinguished work as Ambassador to China.\n  Over the past three years, the People's Republic of China has been \nturbulent both socially and economically. From the reversion of Hong \nKong in 1997, to the heightened concern about human rights violations, \nto the recent developments in Kosovo, it is an understatement to say \nthat the task set before James Sasser was daunting. From the onset of \nhis appointment in 1996, during the Chinese missile testing in the \nTaiwan straits, James Sasser has worked tirelessly towards a ``strong, \nstable, prosperous China,'' and towards the realization of an equally \nhealthy relationship with United States.\n  The frontier of Chinese-US relations is a fast changing one, and \nSasser's efforts have been considerable. Through the continued \npromotion of tariff reduction he has helped to launch American business \ntowards the exploration of the Chinese market and helped to secure \nimportant trade commitments in the negotiations of the PCR's accession \nby the WTO.\n  There has also been considerable progress on the human rights front \nduring the term of Sasser's Ambassadorship. Coupled with the release of \nprominent political and religious leaders, the PRC's ratification of \nthe International Covenant of Economic and Social Rights is one of the \nmost significant signs of progress with respect to civil rights in \nChina. Sasser has also pioneered agreements with the PCR concerning the \nnonproliferation of nuclear technology, striving'' to cooperate on the \npeaceful uses of nuclear energy and halt the spread of nuclear weapons \ntechnology.''\n  It is with regret that I acknowledge James Sasser's departure. His \ncounsel will be greatly missed. His accomplishment as US Ambassador to \nChina will be remembered as important in advancing the opportunity for \na sound relationship between the two countries. I would like to extend \nmy sincere thanks for a job well done.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to \ncongratulate one of our former colleagues and a dedicated public \nservant, Jim Sasser, who leaves Beijing this week as our longest-\nserving ambassador to the People's Republic of China. I commend him for \nhis distinguished and accomplished record in that demanding post.\n  I was proud to serve with Jim Sasser for eight years here in the \nSenate. I observed his fine work as Chairman of the Budget Committee, \nand as a key member of the Appropriations, Banking and Government \nAffairs Committees. He did much for the people of his home state of \nTennessee, and for the people of this Nation.\n  When Senator Sasser assumed the chairmanship of the Budget Committee \nin 1989, we faced growing budget deficits as far as the eye could see. \nWhen he left the Senate in 1995, he had worked to set us on a course of \nfiscal discipline that has created unprecedented economic prosperity \nand led to the largest budget surpluses in our history. He made the \nhard choices, he made the tough political judgments, and he displayed \ntremendous legislative skill in helping put an end to the huge budget \nshortfalls that plagued our country for far too many years.\n  We were fortunate, them, when Jim Sasser again answered the call to \npublic service when his third term in the Senate came to an end. As our \nambassador to China, he has confronted important issues and major \nproblems at a crucial time in our relationship. He traveled first to \nBeijing during the crisis in the straits of Taiwan in early 1996. He \ncomes home in the wake of the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy \nin Belgrade. In the three-and-one-half years in between, Ambassador \nSasser has worked tirelessly to ensure that such incidents will not \nfundamentally alter the course of our relations with the world's most \npopulous nation.\n  During Ambassador Sasser's tenure, we have seen the exchange of \nvisits between our countries' presidents and the very successful U.S. \ntour of Premier Zhu Rongji. Those exchanges highlight the hundreds of \nless prominent, but no less productive, meetings and negotiations that \nhave taken place at various levels of government and business over \nthese 40 months.\n  Clearly, we have important differences with the Chinese. They existed \nbefore Jim Sasser went to China, and they will persist after his \ndeparture. But the interests that unite us--in trade, in a cleaner \nenvironment, in combating drugs and terrorism, in controlling the \nspread of weapons of mass destruction--also remain the same. By helping \nfind the common ground on these issues, by maintaining a constructive \ndialogue based on those common interests even at the worst of times, \nAmbassador Sasser has strengthened one of our most important bilateral \nrelationships. And he has done it with the personal touch and political \nskill those of use who were privileged to serve with him in the Senate \nknow so well.\n  So, today I say thank you to Jim Sasser. Thank you again for your \nservice as a member of the United States Senate, and thank you for \nskillful diplomacy as our ambassador to China. I know all my colleagues \nwill join me in congratulating Ambassador Sasser for a job well done, \nand in welcoming him and his wife Mary back home.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today marks another milestone in the \nremarkable career of a remarkable man--former Senator James Sasser of \nTennessee. Today, after three-and-a-half tumultuous years, Jim Sasser \nformally relinquishes his post as U.S. Ambassador to the People's \nRepublic of China and prepares to return home.\n  I am told that Henry Kissinger gave a speech in Beijing the other day \nand called Jim Sasser ``the best Ambassador we have sent to China.'' \nHaving served with Jim for 18 years in the United States Senate, I am \nnot surprised at the accolades he has received for his service as U.S. \nAmbassador in one of the most difficult and sensitive posts in the \nworld.\n\n[[Page S8068]]\n\n  Jim Sasser is a man of decency, integrity, and honor. Throughout his \nglobe-spanning career, as a lawyer, a United States Senator, and a \ndiplomat, he has never strayed far from his rural west Tennessee roots, \nwhere he learned the core values that have guided his actions ever \nsince. In 1989, when I became chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nJim took over the chairmanship of the Senate Budget Committee. \nTogether, we successfully tackled many of the thorny budget and \nappropriations issues that arose in the early 1990's. I was privileged \nto work closely with him for many years on the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, where he served with distinction as Chairman of the Military \nConstruction Subcommittee.\n  It is clear that the hard work, talent, and leadership that he \ndemonstrated throughout his Senate career served Jim well when he took \nover the post of Ambassador to China in 1996. U.S. relations with that \nnation have experienced dizzying swings during Jim's tenure, reaching \ntheir lowest point when the U.S. embassy in Beijing came under siege \nduring the Kosovo conflict, but Jim has always remained above the fray, \nearning the respect of U.S. and Chinese officials alike. Few of us who \nknow him can forget the haunting photograph of Jim Sasser standing \nbehind the shattered window of the embassy at the height of the anti-\nAmerican demonstrations in China just two months ago.\n  Mr. President, four-and-a-half years ago, I stood in this spot to bid \nSenator Sasser farewell upon his retirement from the Senate. Today, I \nam pleased to welcome him home to America again. He has served our \nnation with distinction, and I am confident that he will continue to do \nso in the coming years wherever the future may lead him.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a friend and former \ncolleague of many of us in this Chamber, Jim Sasser. Jim will complete \nhis assignment as our Ambassador in Beijing this week, an assignment \nthat has lasted forty months, longer than any previous American \nAmbassador to China.\n  After three terms in the Senate, including his excellent leadership \nas Chairman of the Budget Committee, Jim spent a year in the private \nsector before taking up residence in Beijing in February of 1996. Since \nthen, Jim has watched over the U.S.-China relationship during an \nincredibly tumultuous period.\n  Jim arrived in Beijing just as the crisis began in the Taiwan straits \nin early 1996. Three years later, he watched over the first exchange of \nPresidential visits between our two countries when Jiang Zemin visited \nthe United States and President Clinton paid a return visit to China \nearlier this year. I had the distinct honor to lead the Congressional \ndelegation accompanying the President to China and can attest that I \nwas profoundly impressed by Jim Sasser's understanding and management \nof this critically important and complex bilateral relationship.\n  Then, most recently, we all watched with great worry and anticipation \nas Jim was trapped inside the Embassy during the violent demonstrations \nagainst the United States. We saw him ably represent and defend \nAmerican interests during that extremely difficult and tense week.\n  Jim Sasser has represented this country through the most difficult of \ncircumstances. When Jim left the Senate, I was proud that to have \nserved in this body with him. As he leaves China, I am proud that he \nwas my country's representative there. I wish him the best and know \nthat my colleagues do so as well.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to our former \ncolleague, a dear friend and a great American, Ambassador James R. \nSasser, whose distinguished service as United States Ambassador to the \nPeople's Republic of China ended yesterday. Ambassador Sasser helped \nguide US-China relations through an interesting and complicated period, \nand as he and his family return to the United States I want to thank \nhim for his dignified representation of our country.\n  I was privileged to serve with Jim Sasser when he was a member of the \nUnited States Senate. From 1977-1995, Jim Sasser distinguished himself \nfirst as the junior Senator, then later as the senior Senator from the \nState of Tennessee. While a member of the United States Senate, Senator \nSasser served as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and as chair \nof numerous subcommittees on a variety of domestic and foreign policy \nareas. During his tenure in the Senate, Senator Sasser introduced \nlegislation to improve child nutrition, increase regulation of savings \ninstitutions and enhance research and training for geriatric diseases. \nHowever, Senator Sasser was best known for his role as chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee where he worked with the White House to secure \npassage of the 1993 Budget Reconciliation and Deficit Reduction Act, an \naccomplishment that is in large part responsible for the unprecedented \nperiod of economic growth our nation enjoys and the transformation of \nan escalating federal budget deficit into an impressive surplus.\n  Moreover, Senator Sasser distinguished himself on foreign policy \nissues, courageously speaking his mind on issues such as the Reagan \nAdministration policies in Central America. He was well respected by \nhis colleagues and was known for his sharp intellect and genial \npersonality. His campaign slogan during his 1976 Senate campaign was \n``in behalf of a government that reflects our decency.'' Senator Sasser \nlived up to that promise through his distinguished record in the United \nStates Senate.\n  After returning to private life in 1995, Jim Sasser served as a \nFellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University before \nhe was nominated as Ambassador to China. On January 10, 1996, Jim \nSasser was sworn in by Vice President Al Gore as United States \nAmbassador to the People's Republic of China. Knowing that Sino-\nAmerican relations were at an all time low, Ambassador Sasser went to \nthe People's Republic of China with the same diligence that \ndistinguished him as a Senator. The first motto that he graced the \nChinese Embassy with, ``We may doze, but we never close,'' typifies the \njob that Ambassador Sasser did for three remarkable years.\n  Ambassador to China is one of the most difficult assignments for a \ndiplomat. Dealing with the government of the most populous country in \nthe world can be an intimidating task. Ambassador Sasser rose to the \nchallenge and quickly established amicable relationships with President \nJiang Zemin and most recently with premier Zhu Rongji. So tight were \nthere bonds that Premier Zhu said after his trip to America with Jim \nSasser last year. ``I would never have made it without the \nAmbassador.'' The relationships allowed Ambassador Sasser to \nnavigate through the tough times in United States-China relations and \nhave helped build and sustain cordial relations between the President \nof the United States and the President of the People's Republic of \nChina. Moreover, his 18 years of distinguished service in the U.S. \nSenate helped prepare him for dealing with domestic and foreign \npolicymakers in both countries.\n\n  Just weeks after Ambassador Sasser was sworn in, his diligence was \ntested when China began missile tests over the Taiwan Strait. Recently, \nUnited States-China relations were strained once again by the tragic, \naccidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during NATO air \nstrikes and reports of Chinese espionage of our national nuclear \nweapons laboratories. Ambassador Sasser distinguished himself and the \nentire American contingent of diplomats in China by acting in a \nrespectful and sympathetic manner to the Chinese government during this \nunfortunate incident. I will never forget the photographs of Ambassador \nSasser in the ruins of our embassy in Beijing. The calm, composed, and \ndignified manner in which he responded to the seige at our embassy and \nambassador's residence are the benchmark for grace under fire and will \nforever symbolize the sacrifice and skills of our nation's diplomatic \ncorps and foreign service personnel.\n  I had the opportunity to visit and talk with Ambassador Sasser on \nnumerous occasions in Beijing. His assistance and advice was always \ncourteous and on point. From human rights issues to intellectual \nproperty copyrights, Ambassador Sasser has done a tremendous job \nrepresenting and communicating American interests in the People's \nRepublic of China. During his 40 months of service as American \nAmbassador to China, the longest tenure\n\n[[Page S8069]]\n\nof any American Ambassador to China, Jim Sasser has accomplished so \nmuch in helping to improve Sino-American relations. His achievements \nare numerous and commendable. Ambassador Sasser's service has helped \nadvance cooperation between American and Chinese political and security \nofficials. Economic relations between our two countries have improved \nunder Ambassador Sasser's leadership including ongoing negotiations for \nadmitting China into the World Trade Organization. In the area of \nnuclear nonproliferation, Ambassador Sasser has seen the Chinese \ngovernment address U.S. concerns about providing assistance to rogue \nnations, as well as issuing a State Council directive controlling \nexport of dual-use items with potential nuclear weapons uses. The U.S. \nEmbassy in China has also helped to secure relief assistance to Chinese \nearthquake victims. The list of accomplishments of Ambassador Sasser \nand his corps of diplomatic officials goes on and on. His record as \nAmbassador speaks for itself.\n  Although United States-China relations have been damaged by the \naccidental bombing of the Belgrade embassy, we can say that relations \nwith China are better now than they were 3 years ago when Ambassador \nSasser assumed his post in Beijing.\n  Now that Jim and Mary have returned safely home, I would like to take \none final opportunity to thank them and his family for their courageous \nservice and commitment to serving America in China. I have to agree \nwith former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's assessment of \nAmbassador Sasser as ``the best Ambassador to China we've ever had''. \nTo Jim Sasser and his family, I say maholo nui loa, thank you very \nmuch, for your service and bid you aloha, welcome home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8069-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CHANGES TO THE BUDGETARY AGGREGATES AND APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE \n                               ALLOCATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, the Supreme Court ended its term last week \nwith a trio of deeply disturbing decisions regarding the role of the \nStates and Congress in our federal system. In Alden v. Maine, the Court \nmade it impossible for State employees to enforce their rights under \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act, which for decades has guaranteed public \nand private employees nationwide a fair minimum wage.\n  In College Savings Bank, the Court deprived private parties of the \nability to enforce federal unfair competition law against the States. \nAnd in Florida Prepaid, the Court held that Congress can execute its \nconstitutional mandate to protect patents as against States only if the \nCourt is satisfied that there is a sufficient ``pattern of \nconstitutional violations'' of patent rights by the States. The Court \nalso made an unprecedented suggestion about how we must write \nlegislation: that we must expressly invoke a constitutional provision \nbefore it will honor our authority to legislate.\n  These three decisions, all by the same bare majority, are disturbing \non three fronts. First, they seem to be premised on obsolete notions of \nnatural law, with no basis in the text of the Constitution, and they \nexpressly depart from established constitutional precedent. Second, \nthey will make it harder for ordinary Americans to enforce their \nfederally-protected rights against States. Third, they will make it far \nmore difficult for Congress to enforce uniform policies on matters of \nnational concern.\n  Justice Souter has eloquently explained how the Court's decisions \nwill harm individuals. Dissenting in the Alden case, Justice Souter \npointed out that the majority's decision left Maine's employees with a \nfederal right to get paid for overtime work, but no way to enforce it. \nThis flies in the face of logic, precedent, and common sense. As every \nfirst-year law student knows, where there is a right, there must be a \nremedy.\n  The maintenance of State sovereignty is clearly a matter of great \nimportance. For this reason, I have been critical of the increasing \nintrusion of federal regulation into areas traditionally reserved to \nthe States.\n  In particular, I have expressed concern about the seemingly \nuncontrollable impulse to react to the latest headline-grabbing \ncriminal caper with a new federal prohibition. This Congress has also \nextended the federalization of State laws to civil law matters \ntraditionally the province of the States, as in the Y2K bill. But \nthough I watch the federalization of the law with concern, I cannot \nagree with the Court's decisions, which privilege States' rights over \nthose of both the individual citizen and the federal Government. It is \none thing to say that Congress should forbear from interfering in areas \nthat are adequately regulated by the States; it is quite another thing \nto say that Congress may not exercise its constitutionally-delegated \nauthority even when the national interest so demands.\n  We on the Senate Judiciary Committee hear a good deal of rhetoric \nabout judicial activism. Here we have the real thing. The Court's so-\ncalled conservatives, who routinely limit individual constitutional \nrights on the basis of supposed strict adherence to the constitutional \ntext, have suddenly developed a natural law concept of State \nsovereignty that even they admit has no basis in the constitutional \ntext.\n  These conservative activists have reached out to overrule solid legal \nprecedent. Thirty-five years ago, in Parden v. Terminal Railway \nCompany, the Court held that States may lose their immunity by engaging \nin ordinary commercial ventures. This makes a good deal of sense.\n  Why should States that choose to act outside their core sovereign \npowers and compete in the marketplace get an edge over their regulated \nprivate competitors? Certainly, nothing in the Constitution suggests \nthat they should. By overruling Parden, the Court's ``conservatives'' \nabandoned all pretense of judicial restraint.\n  Let me turn now to the flip-side of the Court's new emphasis on \nStates' rights. In strengthening the power of the States, the Court has \nweakened the power of Congress and the federal Government.\n  We should, I believe, pay particular attention to the Court's \nrestrictive reading of Congress's authority to enforce the Fourteenth \nAmendment.\n  This amendment grants the Congress the power to enforce, by \nappropriate legislation, federal constitutional rights. Last week, for \nthe second time in as many years, the Court invalidated an Act of \nCongress because of the perceived deficiency of the legislative\n\n[[Page S8070]]\n\nrecord. The Court held, in effect, that Congress may not exercise its \npower pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment unless it justifies itself, \nin advance, to the satisfaction of the federal courts. This \ndemonstrates a breathtaking lack of respect for a co-equal branch of \nGovernment. Congress is not an administrative agency, and it should not \nbe required to dot every ``i'' and cross every ``t'' before taking \naction in the public interest.\n  The Court's ``no-deference'' approach could complicate a broad range \nof current legislative initiatives. I will note just two that are of \ncritical importance to me: civil rights and intellectual property.\n  The Religious Liberty Protection Act, which was recently reported by \nthe House Judiciary Committee, is an important congressional effort to \nprotect religious liberty after the Court struck down our previous \nattempt in the 1997 City of Boerne case. To the extent that any new \nbill rests on our authority under the Fourteenth Amendment, we must now \ndo the work of an administrative agency to develop an evidentiary \nrecord that will satisfy the Supreme Court.\n  The end-of-term decisions will also make it harder for Congress to \ndesign a uniform system that will apply throughout the nation to \nprotect important intellectual property interests. Intellectual \nproperty rights are deeply rooted in the Constitution, which provides \nin Article I that ``The Congress shall have power . . . [t]o promote \nthe progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times \nto authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective \nwritings and discoveries.'' I have worked hard over the years to \nprovide the creators and inventors of copyrighted and patented works \nwith the protection they may need in our global economy.\n  Yet, the Court's decisions will have far-reaching consequences about \nhow these intellectual property rights may be protected against even \negregious infringements and violations by the States. For example, in \nlight of the Court's decisions, will Congress now have to write one law \nfor private universities, libraries and educational institutions, while \nState-run institutions are free to do whatever they please. This is a \nmatter that Chairman Hatch and I will have to examine closely in the \nJudiciary Committee as we consider a host of intellectual property \nmatters ranging from distance education, database protection, \ncyberpiracy of domain names, and others.\n  The Court's new conception of federalism poses an interesting \nchallenge to Congress. Over the coming years, we can expect a flurry of \nlawsuits aimed at testing the limits of last week's rulings and of this \nbody's legislative authority. In fact, the Court has already agreed to \ndecide next term whether States are immune from suits charging that \nthey have violated the federal law against age discrimination and \nwhether they may be sued for defrauding the federal government.\n  I have risen to discuss the Court's end-of-term decisions for two \nreasons. First, I agree with the four dissenting Justices that these \ndecisions are an egregious case of judicial activism and a \nmisapplication of the Constitution. The four dissenters expressed their \nbelief that the Court's new direction will eventually be reversed. I \nhope this is so. In the interim, however, we need to determine what \nmeans remain to Congress to fulfill the promise of the Constitution, \nwhich guarantees national supremacy to federal law and to federally-\nprotected rights.\n  At least three paths remain open to us. First, Congress can require \nStates to waive their immunity from suit as a condition of receiving \nfederal funds. Second, since the States are not immune from suit by the \nfederal Government, Congress can empower federal authorities to collect \ndamages on behalf of private citizens whose federal rights have been \nviolated by States. Third, Congress can give more emphasis to \npreventative remedies, since nothing in the Court's decisions affects \nthe ability of individuals to sue States for injunctive relief.\n  I urge all Senators to study the Court's decisions. We need to work \ntogether with a clear understanding of the Court's new constitutional \norder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8070-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n KAREN SCHREIER'S CONFIRMATION AS UNITED STATES FEDERAL DISTRICT JUDGE \n                            FOR SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my appreciation of my \ncolleagues for their overwhelming and bipartisan support for \nconfirmation of Karen Schreier as a United States Federal District \nJudge for South Dakota. Karen Schreier has established an extraordinary \nreputation for skill and integrity during her years of private law \npractice, and as a very successful United States Attorney.\n  It is of historic note, that Karen is about to become the first \nfemale federal judge in South Dakota's 110-year history, and her \noutstanding achievements as an attorney, community leader, and federal \njudge will serve as a model for countless other talented young people \nthroughout our state--both men and women. Most importantly, however, \nher ascension to the federal bench is a victory for justice and the \nrule of law. South Dakota and our nation will be very well served by \nKaren Schreier's tenure as Federal District Judge for South Dakota.\n  I also must observe that even the most talented of individuals does \nnot achieve the highest career success without the support and \nassistance of other important people in their lives. I had the great \nhonor and pleasure of serving in the South Dakota legislature with \nKaren's father, Harold Schreier. Harold represented the very best of \npublic service in our state, and I know that Karen's success would be \nof enormous pride and satisfaction to him. Karen's mother, Maysie \nSchreier, has been a wonderful resource in the Flandreau community in \nher own right, and her values and determination are reflected in her \ndaughter. Karen's husband, Tim Dougherty, is a talented lawyer, \ncommunity leader and source of never-ending support and encouragement. \nTim's father, Bill Dougherty, has for many years been one of South \nDakota's foremost political leaders and voice for common-sense and \nprogressive public policy. Bill has been the father of a great deal of \nlegislative accomplishment in our state, but I have a feeling that \nKaren's success will always be one of his greatest sources of pride.\n  Mr. President, it is with wonderful personal satisfaction, that I can \ntoday offer my congratulations to Karen Schreier on her confirmation. \nCongratulations as well, to the Schreier and Dougherty families--\noutstanding South Dakota families, and valued personal friends!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8070-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8070-S8071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SILVERY MINNOW--CRITICAL HABITAT DESIGNATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss recent \ndevelopments regarding the Rio Grande River in New Mexico, an \nendangered species called the silvery minnow, and praiseworthy action \nby the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee earlier this week.\n  As I have previously outlined before to my colleagues, a complicated \nand potentially chaotic situation involving literally hundreds of \nthousands of water users along the Rio Grande in my state could emerge \nthis year. Yesterday, the Fish and Wildlife Service designated almost \n170 miles of the Rio Grande channel as critical habitat for the silvery \nminnow. This designation, as Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbitt \ntestified earlier this year, is prematurely driven by a court order \nbefore the needs of the minnow and economic impacts are known. Indeed, \nthis is a ``cart before the horse'' situation that would be comical if \nits consequences weren't potentially so tragic.\n  In light of this situation, the action by the Senate Environment and \nPublic Works Committee Tuesday is heartening in two respects. First, I \nwant to profoundly thank Senator Chafee, chairman of the committee; \nSenator Baucus, ranking member; and Senator Crapo, chairman of the \nrelevant subcommittee, and their staffs, for their help on S. ll00, a \nprecisely crafted bill that would bring a logical and commonsense \nreform to the present Endangered Species Act. Second, I also thank the \nvarious environmental organizations and their staffs that helped us in \nthis effort. This was a unique, bi-partisan undertaking. I think the \ncommittee's work shows that intelligent reform can occur in this highly \ncharged\n\n[[Page S8071]]\n\narena. I will do all I can to assist in ``clean'' passage of this \nlegislation, without the burden of multiple amendments that will \nfracture the consensus that has developed.\n  S. ll00 simply requires that the designation of critical habitat for \nan endangered species occur, in the future, after the scientific work \nnecessary to develop a comprehensive recovery plan for that species is \ncompleted. That sounds logical to my colleagues, I suspect, but the \npresent Endangered Species Act provides for just the opposite: that is, \nit requires a designation of habitat before science has told us what a \nspecies needs to survive.\n  I have been asked what relationship exists between S. 1100 and the \nRio Grande/silvery minnow situation. The answer will clearly depend on \nhow the courts resolve this particular case. However, S. 1100 provides \nthat designation of critical habitat should occur concurrently with the \ndevelopment of a recovery plan. That is a significant step forward, but \nonly a first step. It will prevent the situation now found on the Rio \nGrande in the future.\n  A court has forced the Fish and Wildlife Service to prematurely \ndesignate critical habitat, a premature designation that everyone \nagrees could be counter-productive. Mr. President, you know that a full \nEnvironmental Impact Statement is required by law in the case of a \n``major federal action.'' If any case cries out for a full EIS, it is \nthe case of the silvery minnow. The potential impact of this federal \naction by the Fish and Wildlife Service, compelled by the court, could \nhave consequences well beyond the normal definition of the word \n``major.'' At stake is the water, literally the water used every second \nof every day by all users of the Rio Grande system. Unfortunately, even \nwith legal precedent on the need for an EIS in habitat designations, \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service chose not to do one.\n  Some try to portray this particular case as one dividing farmers and \nranchers from the more extreme environmentalists in our state, a \nsituation described quite accurately and colorfully by Secretary \nBabbitt earlier this year as ``intransigence.'' Yet, this issue is much \nbroader than that kind of confrontation: hundreds of thousands of \nusers, people who depend upon the Rio Grande for their water in their \ntaps at home, residents of Santa Fe and Albuquerque, and the \ncommunities in between, could find their water endangered.\n  In light of this potential, I believe that a full-scale Environmental \nImpact Statement must be done on the silvery minnow issue. It is only \nafter we know the impact that critical habitat designation may have on \nall users, and its relationship to saving the species, that we can \nintelligently move forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8071-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8071-S8073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          A BUDGET SURPLUS TO REFORM AMERICA'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to spend a few moments today to talk \nabout one of the great questions to which I believe the Senate has yet \nto take a stand. That is the question of reform of our public school \nsystem. And Mr. President, I would suggest that today the \nresponsibility to be creative, to be resourceful, and to empower our \nschools resides right here in the United States Senate.\n  I am grateful that President Clinton has recently taken a position a \nnumber of us have advocated in this age of budget surpluses. Now it's \ntime for all of us to acknowledge that some proportion of these \nprojected budget surpluses should be set aside for education reform--\nset aside in a lockbox. And, Mr. President, I would suggest that we \nshould all be able to agree that any budget we conclude this year--if \nit is a budget that reflects the American people's most urgent need--\nmust include more funding for school reform.\n  Let's be honest--as a society, there is no decision of greater \nimportance to the long term health, stability, and competitiveness of \nthis nation than the way we decide to educate our children. We look to \npublic schools today to educate our children to lead in an information \nage and a global economy where borders have vanished--and the wealth of \nnations will be determined by the wisdom of their workers--by their \nlevel of training, the depth of their knowledge, and their ability to \ncompete with workers around the world.\n  Mr. President, two hundred years ago Thomas Jefferson told us that \nour public schools would be ``the pillars of the republic''--he was \nright then, he is right now--but today there is a caveat: those public \nschools must also be--more than ever--the pillars of our economy and \nthe pillars of our communities.\n  And I would respectfully suggest to you that there has not been a \nmore urgent time than the present to reevaluate the way America's \ngreatest democratic experiment is working--the experiment of our \nnation's public schools.\n  Those pillars of the republic have never before had to support so \nheavy a burden as they do today. In our world of telecommuting; the \nInternet; hundreds and soon thousands of television channels; sixty, \nseventy and eighty hour work weeks--there are fewer and fewer places \nwhere Americans come together in person to share in that common civic \nculture, fewer ways in which we unite as citizens. And more reasons, I \nbelieve, why this nation must have a great public school system.\n  And what can we say of the system before us today? I think we must \nsay that--although there are thousands of public schools in this \ncountry doing a magnificent job of educating our children to a world \nclass level--too many of our schools are struggling and too many kids \nare being left behind.\n  I believe we have a responsibility to be the true friends of public \neducation--and the best friends are critical friends, and it is time \nthat we seek the truth and offer our help to a system that is not doing \nenough for a large proportion of the 50 million children in our public \nschools today--children whose reading scores show that of 2.6 million \ngraduating high school students, one-third are below basic reading \nlevel, one-third are at basic, only one-third are proficient and only \n100,000 are at a world class reading level; children who edge out only \nSouth Africa and Cyprus on international tests in science and math, \nwith 29 percent of all college freshmen requiring remedial classes in \nbasic skills.\n  This year we have already passed the Ed-Flex Bill, a step forward in \ngiving our schools the flexibility and the accountability they need to \nenact reform, making it a matter of law that we won't tie their hands \nwith red tape when Governors and Mayors and local school districts are \ndoing all they can to educate our kids, but also emphasizing that with \nadded flexibility comes a responsibility to raise student achievement.\n  But EdFlex was just one step to balance accountability and \nflexibility--to continue the process of real education reform--and that \nis why my colleague, the Senator from Oregon, Gordon Smith, and I have \ncome together, in a bipartisan way--through the Kerry-Smith approach to \neducation reform we've introduced with Ted Kennedy, Max Cleland, Evan \nBayh, John Edwards, Carl Levin, Patty Murray, Richard Bryan, as well as \nJohn Chafee, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe from Maine. Ours is an \napproach which will make a difference in our schools and which can \nbring together leaders from across the political spectrum around good \nideas which unite us.\n  For too long in this country the education debate has been stuck both \nnationally and locally. Leaders have been unable or unwilling to answer \nthe challenge, trapped in a debate that is little more than an echo of \nold and irrelevant positions with promising solutions stymied by \nideology and interest groups--both on the right and on the left.\n  Nowhere more than in the venerable United States Senate, where we \npride ourselves on our ability to work together across partisan lines, \nhave we--in so many debates--been stuck in a place where Democrats and \nRepublicans seem to talk past each other. Democrats are perceived to be \nalways ready to throw money at the problem but never for sufficient \naccountability or creativity; Republicans are perceived as always ready \nto give a voucher to go somewhere else but rarely supportive of \ninvesting sufficient resources to make the public schools work.\n  Well, I think it is in this Congress, this year, that we can finally \ndisengage ourselves from the political combat, and acknowledge that \nwith so much on the line, such high stakes in our schools, you can't \njust talk past each other and call it reform.\n\n[[Page S8072]]\n\n  We all need to do our part to find a new answer, and Mr. President I \nwould respectfully suggest that in the bipartisan support you see for \nthis approach, there is a different road we can meet on to make it \nhappen.\n  Together we are introducing the kind of comprehensive education \nreform legislation that I believe will provide us a chance to come \ntogether not as Democrats and Republicans, but as the true friends of \nparents, children, teachers, and principals--to come together as \ncitizens--and help our schools reclaim the promise of public education \nin this country. We need to ask one question: ``What provides our \nchildren with the best education?'' And whether the answer is \nconservative, liberal or simply practical, we need to commit ourselves \nto that course.\n  Our bill is built on the notion of providing grants for schools with \nreal accountability to pursue comprehensive reform and adopt the proven \nbest practices of any other school--Voluntary State Reform Incentive \nGrants so school districts that choose to finance and implement \ncomprehensive reform based on proven high-performance models can bring \nforth change. We will target investments at school districts with high \nnumbers of at-risk students and leverage local dollars through matching \ngrants. This component of the legislation will give schools the chance \nto quickly and easily put in place the best of what works in any other \nschool--private, parochial or public--with decentralized control, site-\nbased management, parental engagement, and high levels of \nvolunteerism--while at the same time meeting high standards of student \nachievement and public accountability. I believe public schools need to \nhave the chance to make changes not tomorrow, not five years from now, \nnot after another study--but now--today.\n\n  So if schools will embrace this new framework--every school adopting \nthe best practices of high achieving schools, building accountability \ninto the system--what then are the key ingredients of excellence that \nevery school needs to succeed?\n  Well, I think we can start by guaranteeing that every one of our \nnation's 80,000 principals have the capacity to lead--the talents and \nthe know-how to do the job; effective leadership skills; the vision to \ncreate an effective team--to recruit, hire, and transfer teachers and \nengage parents. Without those abilities, the title of principal and the \nfreedom to lead means little. We are proposing an ``Excellent \nPrincipals Challenge Grant'' which would provide funds to local school \ndistricts to train principals in sound management skills and effective \nclassroom practices. This bill helps our schools make being a principal \nthe great calling of our time.\n  But as we set our sights on recruiting a new generation of effective \nprincipals, we must acknowledge what today's best principals know: \nprincipals can only produce results as good as the teachers with whom \nthey must work. To get the best results, we need the best teachers. And \nwe must act immediately to guarantee that we get the best as the United \nStates hires 2 million new teachers in the next ten years, 60% of them \nin the next five years. In the Kerry-Smith Bill we will empower our \nstates and school districts to find new ways to hire and train \noutstanding teachers: through a focus on teacher quality and training--\nin Title V of this bill--we can use financial incentives to attract a \nlarger group of qualified people into the teaching profession and we \ncan provide real ongoing education and continued training for our \nnation's teachers.\n  This legislation will allow states to reconfigure their certification \npolicies and their teaching standards to address the reality that our \nstandards for teachers are not high enough--and at the same time, they \nare too rigid in setting out irrelevant requirements that don't make \nteaching better; they make it harder for some who choose to teach. We \nknow we need to streamline teacher certification rules in this country \nto recruit the best college graduates to teach in the United States. \nToday we hire almost exclusively education majors to teach, and liberal \narts graduates are only welcomed in our country's top private schools. \nOur legislation will allow states to rewrite the rules so principals \nhave a far greater flexibility to hire liberal arts graduates as \nteachers, graduates who can meet high standards; while at the same time \nallowing hundreds of thousands more teachers to achieve a more broad \nbased meaningful certification--the National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards certification with its rigorous test of subject \nmatter knowledge and teaching ability.\n  This legislation will build a new teacher recruitment system for our \npublic schools--providing college scholarships for our highest \nachieving high school graduates if they agree to come back and teach in \nour public schools.\n  We will demand a great deal from our principals and our teachers--\nholding them accountable for student achievement--but Mr. President we \nalso hope to build a new consensus in America that recognizes that you \ncan't hold someone accountable if they don't have the tools to succeed.\n  Our bill helps to close the resource gap in public education: helping \nto eliminate the crime that turns too many hallways and classrooms into \narenas of violence by giving school districts incentives to write \ndiscipline codes and create ``Second Chance'' schools with a range of \nalternatives for chronically disruptive and violent students--\neverything from short-term in-school crisis centers, to medium duration \nin-school suspension rooms, to high quality off-campus alternatives, \nproviding the resources that can, in tandem with values and character \neducation, prevent senseless tragedy before it happens; the resources \nto help every child come to school ready to learn by funding \nsuccessful, local early childhood development efforts; and making \nschools the hubs of our communities once more by providing support for \nafter school programs where students receive tutoring, mentoring, and \nvalues-based education--the kind of programs that are open to entire \ncommunities, making public schools truly public.\n  And our legislation will help us bring a new kind accountability to \npublic education by injecting choice and competition into a public \nschool system badly in need of both. We are not a country that believes \nin monopolies. We are a country that believes competition raises \nquality. And we ought to merge the best of those ideas by ending a \nsystem that restricts each child to an administrator's choice and not a \nparent's choice where possible. It is time we adopt a competitive \nsystem of public school choice with grants awarded to schools that meet \nparents' test of quality and assistance to schools that must catch up \nrapidly. That is why our bill creates an incentive for schools all \nacross the nation to adopt public school choice to the extent \nlogistically feasible.\n  We are not just asking Democrats and Republicans to meet in a \ncompromise, a grand bargain to reform public education. We are offering \nlegislation that helps us do it, that forces not just a debate, but a \nvote--yes or no, up or down, change or more of the same. Together we \ncan embrace new rights and responsibilities on both sides of the \nideological divide and admit that the answer to the crisis of public \neducation is not found in one concept alone--in private school vouchers \nor bricks and mortar alone. We can find answers for our children by \nbreaking with the instinct for the symbolic, and especially the notion \nthat a speech here and there will make education better in this \ncountry. It can't and it won't. But our hard work together in the \ncoming year--Democrats and Republicans together--can make a difference. \nEducation reform can work in a bi-partisan way. There is no shortage of \ngood ideas or leadership here in the Senate--the experience of Gordon \nSmith who spent years in the Oregon legislature working to balance \nresources and accountability to raise the quality of public education; \nwith tireless leadership from former Governors like Evan Bayh and John \nChafee; bi-partisan creativity from Patty Murray and Olympia Snowe; and \nthe leadership and passion, of course, of the senior Senator from my \nstate, Senator Kennedy, who has led the fight on education in this \nSenate, and who has provided this body with over 30 years of unrivaled \nleadership and support for education.\n  We look forward to working with all of our colleagues this year to \npass this legislation, in this important year as we undergo the process \nof reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary\n\n[[Page S8073]]\n\nEducation Act, to find common ground in ideas that we can all support--\nbold legislation that sends the message to parents and children \nstruggling to find schools that work, and to teachers and principals \nstruggling in schools simultaneously bloated with bureaucracy and \nstarved for resources--to prove to them not just that we hear their \ncries for help, but that we will respond not with sound bites and \nsalvos, but with real answers. And Mr. President, I would suggest that \nin this time when the United States, the richest nation on the face of \nthe earth, leading a global economy, pushing our stock market well over \n10,000, with budget surpluses we all herald at every turn, I would \nsuggest that at this time we need to make the commitment--together, \nDemocrats and Republicans--to give every school the chance to give \nevery child in our country a world class education. That is an \ninvestment we can not afford to pass up--and Mr. President this is the \ntime to do it. I look forward to working with all colleagues, Mr. \nPresident, in fashioning a budget that takes serious the American \npeople's call for real and comprehensive education reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8073-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8073-S8075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today because I am concerned \nthat there is a growing national crisis in America. Although we do not \nknow its exact dimensions, the early evidence is extremely troubling.\n  Nearly three years ago, against my objections, Congress passed and \nPresident Clinton signed the welfare reform law. The stated purpose of \nthe law was to move people off welfare and toward economic self-\nsufficiency.\n  By now, we all know that the welfare caseloads have dramatically \ndeclined. The welfare caseloads are at their lowest point in nearly 30 \nyears. Since welfare reform became law, 1.6 million families have left \nthe welfare rolls. Approximately 4.6 million are no longer receiving \ncash assistance. Clearly, the law has been successful at moving people \noff welfare. On this basis, nearly everyone is jumping at the \nopportunity to proclaim welfare reform as a ``success.'' But, Mr. \nPresident, I have my doubts. How can we call welfare reform a success \nwithout knowing what has happened to these people after leaving \nwelfare? How can we call it a success without knowing how people are \ndoing? Mr. President, declining caseloads do not answer the \nfundamentally important questions. They don't tell us if families are \nmoving toward economic self-sufficiency. They don't tell us if people \nhave been able to escape poverty. They don't tell us if mothers have \nbeen able to find work. They don't tell us if children have food and \nare covered by health insurance.\n  Mr President to be honest, the declining welfare caseloads tell us \nvery little. We should not be trumpeting the success of welfare reform \nbefore we know about the living conditions of the people who have been \nmoved off welfare. And right now, no one seems to know. Over and over \nagain I have asked my colleagues if they know of any research \ndemonstrating that the decrease in the number of families receiving \nassistance means that people are escaping poverty, but no one has \nproduced such a study. No one!\n  My fear is that these people are simply disappearing.\n  Mr. President, we've got a similar problem with the recent reports \nabout Food Stamps. Lately we've been hearing a lot about the plunge in \nFood Stamp participation. Over the last four years the number of people \nusing food stamps dropped by almost one-third, from 28 million to 19 \nmillion people.\n  Some want to interpret this decline as an indication of diminished \nneed. But, just like the decline in welfare rolls, there are important \nquestions that are left unanswered. I hope that the drop means that \nfewer people are going hungry. But, I have my doubts.\n  If people are no longer needy, then how can we account for the fact \nthat 78 percent of cities surveyed by the United States Conference of \nMayors for its Report on Hunger reported increases in requests for \nemergency food in 1998?\n  If people are no longer needy, then how can we explain why Catholic \nCharities USA reported early this year that 73 percent of dioceses had \nincreases of as much as 145 percent in requests for emergency food \nassistance compared to a year before.\n  Mr. President, how can we account for these findings without \nquestioning whether the reformers' claims of success are premature?\n  What is going on here? A story from the New York Times suggests one \ntroubling explanation:\n  ``[One welfare recipient was told] incorrectly . . . that she could \nnot get food stamps without welfare. So, though she is scraping by \nraising a family of five children and sometimes goes hungry, she has \nnot applied [for food stamps]. . . . `They referred me to the food \npantry,' she said. `They don't tell you what you really need to know. \nThey tell you what they want you to know.'' (4/17/99).\n  Mr. President, I am here today to propose an amendment. It is an \namendment that I hope will receive widespread support. It is simple and \nstraightforward. It will help us find out how people who have left \nwelfare are doing. It will provide us with the information we need in \norder to properly evaluate the success or failure of welfare reform.\n  Mr. President, the 1996 welfare law sets aside $1 billion for ``high-\nperformance'' bonuses. Currently, the money is awarded to states using \na formula that takes into account state effectiveness in increasing \nemployment among TANF recipients. My amendment would add three more \ncriteria:\n  Food stamp participation among poor children,\n  The proportion of families leaving TANF who are covered by Medicaid \nor child health insurance, and\n  The number of children in working poor families who receive some form \nsubsidized child care.\n  In other words, states would have to provide this information in \naddition to the job entry, job retention, and earnings data they \nalready must provide in their high-performance bonus applications.\n  Mr. President, some of my colleagues might suggest that these \nadditional requirements will be too difficult for the states to meet. I \nwill address this issue in detail in a little while. Right now, let me \njust reassure everyone that no state will be required to conduct any \nnew surveys. In fact, no state will have to collect any new data. All \nthat my amendment will require is that states report data they already \nhave.\n  Mr. President, as I have already suggested, I am here today because \nof my deep concern for the millions of Americans who struggle each day \nto get by. These are the people who worry about:\n  How to keep a roof over their families' heads, How to get food in \ntheir children's stomachs, How to earn a wage that pays their bills, \nand How to obtain medical help when they are sick.\n  I am especially concerned about our nation's children who all too \noften are the innocent victims of poverty.\n  Mr. President, we live in the richest country in the world. We live \nin a country that has experienced what many call ``an unprecedented \nperiod of prosperity.'' But Mr. President, this prosperity has not \nextended to all families and their children. While our country is \nsupposedly doing so well, we've got about 14 million--That's one in \nfive--children who live in poverty. And, 6.5 million children live in \nextreme poverty. Their family income is less than one-half the poverty \nline.\n  This poverty has profoundly terrible consequences on the lives of \nthese children. On the basis of research, we now know that poverty is a \ngreater risk to children's overall health status than living in a \nsingle parent family. A baby born poor is less likely to be alive to \ncelebrate its first birthday than a baby born to an unwed mother, a \nhigh school dropout, or a mother who smoked during pregnancy.\n  Mr. President, poor children must walk a gauntlet of troubles, that \nbegin even before they are born and often last a lifetime. Not only are \npoor children more likely to die during childhood, they are:\n  More likely to have low birth weights and be born premature; More \nlikely to be deaf; More likely to be blind; More likely to have serious \nphysical or mental disabilities, and More likely to suffer from stunted \ngrowth.\n  Mr. President, I am worried that welfare reform is making these \nproblems worse. I think that we really need to pay attention to the \nquality of people's lives not just to the numbers of people on \nassistance.\n\n[[Page S8074]]\n\n  Mr. President, the purpose of my amendment is to help us to \nunderstand at a national level what is happening in our country in the \nwake of welfare reform. I've spent a lot of time trying to figure this \nout and have come to the conclusion that what we currently know is not \nsufficient. I am not alone in this belief. One of the organizations I \nwork is called NETWORK. It's a National Catholic Social Justice lobby. \nThe people at NETWORK wrote the following in their recent report on \nwelfare reform:\n\n       Even though government officials are quick to point out \n     that national welfare caseloads are at their lowest point in \n     30 years, they are unable to tell us for the most part what \n     is happening to people after they leave the welfare rolls--\n     and what is happening to people living in poverty who never \n     received assistance in the first place.\n\n  Mr. President, although we lack a national portrait, some of the \nresearch I read about what is going on in the states deeply concerns \nme.\n  For example: In Alabama, a professor found that intake workers gave \npublic assistance applications to only 6 out of 27 undergraduate \nstudents who requested them, despite state policy that says that anyone \nwho asks for an application should get one.\n  In Arizona, after holding fairly steady from 1990 to 1993, the number \nof meals distributed through Arizona's statewide food-charity network \nhas since risen 50 percent.\n  In California, tens of thousands of welfare beneficiaries are dropped \neach month as punishment. In total, half of those leaving welfare are \ndoing so because they did not follow the rules.\n  In Florida, more than 15,000 families left welfare during a typical \nmonth last year. About 3,600 reported finding work, but nearly 4,200 \nleft because they were punished. The state doesn't know what happened \nto almost 7,500 others.\n  In Georgia, nearly half of the homeless families interviewed in \nshelters and other homeless facilities had lost TANF benefits in the \nprevious 12 months.\n  In Iowa, 47 percent of those who left welfare did so because they did \nnot comply with requirements such as going to job interviews or \nproviding paperwork. And in Iowa's PROMISE JOBS experiment, the \nmajority of families punished for failure to meet welfare-to-work \nrequirements told researchers that they didn't understand those \nrequirements.\n  In my own State of Minnesota, care managers found that penalized \nfamilies were twice as likely to have serious mental health problems, \nthree times as likely to have low intellectual ability, and five times \nmore likely to have family violence problems when compared with other \nrecipients.\n  In the Mississippi Delta, workfare recipients gather at 4 a.m. to \ntravel by bus for two hours to their assigned work places, work their \nfull days, and then return--another two hours--home each night. It is \nno surprise, therefore, that they are having trouble finding child care \nduring these nontraditional hours, and for such extended days.\n  In New York, a September 1998 survey found that 71 percent of former \nrecipients who last received TANF in March 1997 did not have any \nemployer-reported earnings.\n  In a rural Appalachian community in Ohio, there is a lack of jobs at \ndecent wages that has resulted in dramatic increases in requests for \nfood. The Congressional Hunger Center tells us that, ``As people are \nbeing moved off of the rolls in rural areas, there is very little \nsupport structure to help them become self-sufficient--government \nprograms are unavailable due to time limits, there is little private \nindustry in the area, and neighbors struggle to get by on their own.''\n  And then there is the so-called success story in Wisconsin. Only one \nin four families that permanently leave welfare have incomes above the \npoverty line. The typical recipient actually lost income during the \nyear after leaving welfare. Only one in three of those who left welfare \nincreased their economic resources. In La Crosse, Wisconsin, the number \nof children sleeping in Salvation Army homeless shelters shot up by 50 \npercent between 1994 and 1996. In contrast, the number of homeless \nmen--a group that is largely unaffected by welfare changes--rose by \nonly one percent during the same period. And, a recently released study \nby the Institute for Wisconsin's Future says that the number of \nfamilies in extreme poverty jumped from about 1,700 in 1989 to 11,200 \nin 1997.\n  Mr. President, clearly we need to be careful about pronouncing \nwelfare reform a ``success'' simply because the caseloads are down. \nPeople are continuing to suffer and struggle to meet their basic needs.\n  Mr. President, I have already discussed the dramatic decline in \nwelfare caseloads. Let me remind everyone that the caseload decline has \nnot been matched by a similar decline in poverty indicators.\n  I think we need to know, on a national level, what's going on. The \nresearch we do have suggests that moving people off of welfare is not \nhaving the intended effect of putting them on the road to economic \nself-sufficiency.\n  The NETWORK study reports that people continue to experience severe \nhardship. For example:\n  Nearly half of the respondents report that their health is only \n``fair'' or ``poor.'' 43% eat fewer meals or less food per meal due to \ncost. 52% of soup kitchen patrons are unable to provide sufficient food \nfor their children. Even the working poor are suffering as 41% of those \nwith jobs experienced hunger.\n  Mr. President, NETWORK is not the only group out there trying to find \nout what is going on. In another study, seven local agencies and \ncommunity welfare monitoring coalitions in six states compared people \ncurrently receiving welfare to those who stopped getting welfare in the \nlast six months.\n  The data show that people who stopped getting welfare were:\n  Less likely to get food stamps; Less likely to get Medicaid; More \nlikely to go without food for a day or more; More likely to move \nbecause they couldn't pay rent; More likely to have a child who lived \naway or was in foster care; More likely to have difficulty paying for \nand getting child care, and; More likely to say ``my life is worse'' \ncompared to six months ago.\n  The National Conference of State Legislatures' analyzed 14 state \nstudies with good information about families leaving welfare. It found:\n\n       Most of the jobs [that former recipients get] pay between \n     $5.50 and $7 an hour, higher than minimum wage but not enough \n     to raise a family out of poverty. So far, few families who \n     leave welfare have been able to escape poverty.\n\n  And then there is the recent study by Families USA, which presents a \nvery troubling set of findings. It reports:\n\n     over two-thirds of a million low-income people--approximately \n     675,000--lost Medical coverage and became uninsured as of \n     1997 due to welfare reform. The majority (62 percent) of \n     those who became uninsured due to welfare reform were \n     children, and most of those children were, in all likelihood, \n     still eligible for coverage under Medicaid. Moreover, the \n     number of people who lose health coverage due to welfare \n     reform is certain to grow rather substantially in the years \n     ahead.\n\n  Mr. President, sometimes with all these numbers and studies we lose \nsight of the fact that they are based on the lives of real people--\npeople who want the best for themselves and their children. But, we \nmust not forget this reality.\n  Here is the story of one family that one of the Sisters in the \nNETWORK study workeed with:\n\n       Martha and her seven year-old child, David, live in \n     Chicago. She recently began working, but her 37-hour a week \n     job pays only $6.00 an hour. In order to work, Martha must \n     have childcare for David. Since he goes to school, she found \n     a sitter who would receive him at 7 a.m. and take him to \n     school. This sitter provided after school care as well. When \n     Sister Joan sat down with Martha to talk about her finances, \n     they discovered that her salary does not even cover the \n     sitter's costs.\n\n  The Families USA Report tells us the following story:\n  Terry (This is not her real name)\n\n     had been on welfare for about two years when she got a job at \n     McDonald's. Working 30 hours a week, Terry earned $600 a \n     month. When she told her welfare caseworker about her new \n     job, Terry and her 5-year-old son, James, were cut off of \n     cash assistance and Medicaid. Her Food Stamps stopped, too, \n     although she was promised they would continue. When Terry \n     left welfare for work, no one told her that she was eligible \n     for Transitional Medicaid. And her son James should have \n     continued to receive Medicaid until Terry earned at least \n     $1,200 a month--twice as much as she made at her job at \n     McDonald's.\n  Mr. President, these three cases I just mentioned are about families \nwhere a parent is working. There is an even scarier situation--families \nthat neither receive government assistance\n\n[[Page S8075]]\n\nnor have a parent with a job. We don't know for certain how large this \npopulation is, but in the NETWORK study 79% of the people were \nunemployed and not receiving welfare benefits. Of course this study was \nfocused on the hardest hit and therefore overestimates the overall \npercentage of former recipients who are unemployed. But, it still \nrepresents a 50% increase over the level it found before welfare \nreform.\n  How are these families surviving? Mr. President, I am deeply \nconcerned and worried about them. They are no longer receiving aid and \nthey don't have jobs. They are literally falling through the cracks and \ndisappearing. I call these families, which are composed primarily of \nwomen and their children, The Disappeared Americans.\n  We must find out what is going on. That is why this amendment is so \nimportant. It will provide us with valuable information we need in \norder to be responsible policymakers.\n  Mr. President, this is not the first time I have come to the floor of \nthe US Senate to offer an amendment designed to find out what is \nhappening to poor people in this country. Last month I offered a \nsimilar amendment and it lost by one vote. Although 50 Senators voted \nagainst it, not one spoke in opposition. Not a single Senator rose to \ndebate me on the merits of the measure. At that time, I promised and I \nwould return to the Senate floor with the amendment, and today I am \nfulfilling my promise.\n  Since I first offered the amendment, we have received some valuable \ninput about the best way to gather the kind of data we need to \nunderstand on a national level what is going on. In the original \namendment, states would have been required to conduct new studies to \ntrack all former TANF recipients. In the version of the amendment I \noffer today, states can simply rely on administrative data that they \nalready collect. For example, in order to provide Medicaid and child \nhealth insurance data, states would just have to do a match between \ntheir TANF and Medicaid/CHIP computer systems. And, if states choose \nnot to apply for the TANF bonus money, they would only need to provide \ndata on a valid sample of former recipients, not the entire population.\n  In other words, Mr. President, we have reworked the amendment to make \nit significantly less burdensome of the Secretary of HHS and the \nstates. Frankly, with these changes, I don't see a reason why anyone \nwould vote against this amendment. If there is going to be opposition, \nI expect that we will have a debate. Let's identify our differences and \ndebate them.\n  Mr. President, let me wrap things up by reminding us all that it is \nour duty and our responsibility to make sure that the policies we enact \nfor the good of the people actually are doing good for them. Evaluation \nis one of the key ingredients in good policy making and it does not \ntake a degree in political science to realize what anyone with common \nsense already knows: When you try something new, you need to find out \nhow it works.\n  As policy makers--regardless of our ideology or intuitions--it is our \nrole to ensure that the programs we enact to provide for American \nfamilies' well-being are effective and produce the outcomes we intend.\n  We need to know what is happening with the families who are affected \nby welfare reform. We need to know whether reform is, in fact, \neffectively helping low income mothers and their children build a path \nto escape poverty and move toward economic self-sufficiency.\n  As I have already explained, the data we do have does not provide us \nwith all the information we need. We need to go beyond simply assuming \nthat welfare and food stamp declines are ``good'' news.\n  The Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal once said, ``Ignorance is never \nrandom.'' Sometimes we choose not to know what we do not want to know. \nIn the case of welfare reform, we must have the courage to find out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8075-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8075-S8076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PLIGHT OF THE DOMESTIC OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Wall Street Journal yesterday wrote:\n\n       What is not in dispute is how hard a hit small domestic oil \n     took during the recent downturn in oil prices. While larger \n     oil companies with their huge asset bases and integrated \n     businesses were able to weather the storm, many of the \n     smaller producers, which operate on low margins and minuscule \n     volumes, lurched toward ruin.\n       These small producers, who mop up the tailings of the \n     country's once-great oil fields primarily in the West and the \n     Mid-west collectively produce about 1.4 million barrels of \n     oil daily, an amount roughly equivalent to that imported to \n     Saudi Arabia. And the total number of such subsistence wells, \n     defined by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission as \n     ones producing 10 barrels of crude a day or less were \n     abandoned at an accelerated rate during the downturn, experts \n     say.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal is not the only entity noticing the plight of \nthe domestic independent oil and gas industry. DOE recently wrote: \n``Domestic crude oil producers have seen the price of their product \n(adjusted for inflation) fall to levels not seen since the 1930's.''\n  Independent oil and gas producers have wells in 32 States. Senators \nfrom these producing States have heard from the producers, oil and gas \nservice small businesses, Governors, mayors and county commissioners. \nThe situation was so bad in Oklahoma that the Governor held a special \nsession of the legislature. In New Mexico, we have oil and gas \nproducers organizing marches and rallies calling attention to their \ncrisis. When the oil and gas industry suffers a cash flow problem and \ncredit crunch, so do Federal, State and local governments. The recent \noil and gas crisis has cost States and localities $2.1 billion in lost \nroyalties alone. One community had to chose between keeping the \nhospital or the school open. Oil tax revenues were, not sufficient to \nkeep both operating.\n  The number of oil and gas rigs operating in the United States is at \nthe lowest count since 1944, when records of this tally began. The \nindustry is predicting that the U.S. will loss an additional million \nbarrels a day of domestic production as a result of the last price \ncollapse. This production shrinkage will be felt in the marketplace in \n12 to 18 months.\n  Beginning in November 1997, the oil and gas exploration and \ndevelopment industry began experiencing the lowest inflation-adjusted \noil prices in history.\n  Recent Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) statistics \nspeak for themselves:\n   55,000 jobs lost out of an estimated 338,600 total industry \njobs.\n   Additional 68,000 oil and natural gas jobs (20 percent) are \nat risk of being lost.\n   136,000 oil wells (25 percent of total U.S.) and 57,000 \nnatural gas wells shut down.\n  Every barrel of domestic that we lose will have to be replaced with \nbarrel of foreign produced oil and our dependence on foreign oil is \nalready too high--in excess of 57 percent and trending higher.\n  The industry we are trying to help includes royalty owners in all 50 \nStates. Many of these royalty owners are retired and depend on their \noil royalty checks to pay for their daily expenses. When the price of \noil dipped to $10 a barrel several months ago, these royalty owners saw \ntheir royalty checks drop by half.\n  At $18 to $19 a barrel our independent producers barely break even. \nAt $14 a barrel they lose $10.30 a day per well or $3,752 a year per \nwell.\n  The oil and gas industry is a very capital intensive industry on the \nfront end--exploring and drilling wells and also on the back end--\nshutting in wells or going out of business. The drilling costs for a \nwell range from $600,000 to $15 million for an off-shore deep water \nwell. Getting out of the business is capital intensive industry, too. \nOn average it costs $5,000 to $10,000 a well to decommission a well.\n  It is an industry dependent on banks and credit. The independents get \nabout 40 percent of their capital from financial institutions. The \nprice of oil has just recently improved, but the bankers have been \nreluctant to restructure loans or to make new loans.\n  Capital budgets to develop new production and replace depleting \nexisting production have been cut dramatically. Most independents are \nnot drilling new wells. The industry has a viable future but they have \nto get through this current credit crunch, and they need loan \nrestructuring to keep them going until they can recover from the big \nprice drop of 1997 through mid-1999.\n  This is why I joined with Senator Byrd to propose an emergency loan\n\n[[Page S8076]]\n\nprogram for oil, gas and steel--two important core industries. I am \nhopeful that the House will quickly name conferees and move the bill \nthrough the legislative process. Domestic oil and gas production is \nAmerica's true national strategic petroleum reserve and we need to make \nsure there is an industry in the U.S. capable of meeting our strategic \noil and gas needs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article that appeared in the June 30, \n1999, Wall Street Journal be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 30, 1999]\n\n                  Oil Producers File Antidumping Suit\n\n\ngroup of independent firms says four countries sold at cheap prices in \n                                  u.s.\n\n               (By Helene Cooper and Christopher Cooper)\n\n       WASHINGTON--Thirty years ago, after a two-day debate over \n     the difference between material injury and immaterial injury \n     in America's dense antidumping laws, Sen. Russell Long issued \n     a commentary still bandied about in international trade \n     corridors today. The antidumping debate, he said, ``sounds \n     more like the difference between mumbo-jumbo and jumbo-\n     mumbo.''\n       Yesterday, that jumbo-mumbo erupted into a case that could \n     smack consumers right in the wallets--and just before an \n     election year, no less. A group of independent oil producers \n     has filed an antidumping suit with the Commerce Department \n     and the International Trade Commission. The oil companies--\n     representing an industry that 20 years ago was a cartel that \n     kept prices high--say four countries ``dumped'' cheap oil on \n     the U.S. market in 1998 and 1999.\n       The group, called Save Domestic Oil Inc., wants the Clinton \n     administration to impose dumping duties on oil from the four \n     alleged offenders--Mexico, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Iraq--\n     which together account for more than half of the oil imported \n     into the U.S. The duties requested range from 33.37% (Mexico) \n     to 177.52% (Venezuela). Many of the bigger U.S. oil \n     companies, which import much of their oil, oppose the \n     complaint.\n       In Washington, where politicians are still reeling from the \n     steel industry's recent attempt to limit steel imports, the \n     case is bound to be politically explosive. ``This oil thing \n     could kill us,'' says one Clinton administration official. \n     Indeed, if the oilmen win--and in the world of U.S. \n     antidumping statutes, he who complains usually wins--the \n     Clinton administration could well find itself blamed for \n     increased prices at the pump.\n       Energy Secretary Bill Richardson called the complaint a \n     ``serious charge, with potentially serious consequences.'' He \n     added that the administration should seek to ``bring all the \n     parties together to see whether there is a way to resolve the \n     concerns raised by this petition.''\n       Many economists and trade lawyers who dislike the U.S. \n     antidumping law say it's crazy to file an oil antidumping \n     complaint because oil is a commodity regulated by world \n     markets; as a commodity, oil's properties tend to be \n     consistent, so the markets set a standard price. But Danny \n     Briggs, proprietor of tiny Pickrell Oil Co. in northwest \n     Kansas and a member of Save Domestic Oil's executive \n     committee, says he's tired of watching cheap oil from \n     abroad drive down the prices here. ``We tried everything \n     we could think of'' before turning to the trade action, \n     Mr. Briggs says. ``It's been used by the apple growers and \n     the steel manufacturers--why not the oil producers?''\n       Although most of the plaintiffs, advancing the trade \n     complaint are small oil producers--strippers, as they're \n     known in the business--one exception is Houston's Apache \n     Corp., one of the nation's largest independent oil companies. \n     Raymond Plank, Apache's chief executive, said he personally \n     put up $10,000 and his company anted up another $10,000 to \n     help pay the costs of the trade complaint, which is \n     ultimately expected to cost the plaintiffs $1.5 million in \n     legal fees.\n       They hired Charles Verrill, a powerful Washington trade \n     lawyer who, for 30 years, has represented U.S. businesses, \n     including steelmakers, that complain about unfairly low \n     prices from foreign competition. In this oil case, he says, \n     ``imports have increased significantly while prices have \n     declined,'' noting that the price per barrel plunged to close \n     to $10 earlier this year before rebounding in the second \n     quarter.\n       Economists opposed to the antidumping law said they want \n     the oilmen to lose, but they relish the thought of a win \n     embarrassing politicians into changing the law, which they \n     see as protectionist and biased, ``If this case succeeds, it \n     may actually help put antidumping reform on the international \n     trade agenda, where it should have been all along,'' says \n     Robert Litan, an economist at the Brookings Institution and \n     co-author of ``Down In The Dumps,'' a book about antidumping \n     law.\n       ``Any economist who knows this subject will tell you these \n     laws are ridiculous,'' Mr. Litan says. ``They punish \n     foreigners for selling below cost, activities which American \n     companies do all the time in their domestic markets.''\n       U.S. lawmakers, prodded by companies that wanted to protect \n     their domestic sales from competition from cheap foreign \n     imports, devised and refined the antidumping law as one \n     weapon in the home-team arsenal. The rationale behind the law \n     was simple: Hit the foreign countries with stiff duties to \n     stop them from flooding the U.S. market with cheap goods and \n     sending the U.S. companies out of business.\n       The wildcatters complain that Mexico, Venezuela and Iraq \n     have been selling their oil in the U.S. at below the cost of \n     production--the most widely accepted definition of dumping. \n     Saudi Arabia, they complain, sold oil in Japan at higher \n     prices than the oil it sold in the U.S.\n       Most trade lawyers say the oilmen have a good shot at \n     victory. That's because U.S. antidumping law--conceived in \n     the 1920s--has been refined by successive lawmakers to \n     heavily favor the plaintiff. Indeed, in more than 90% of the \n     cases filed, the Commerce Department finds in favor of the \n     plaintiff.\n       The case will work its way through the Commerce Department \n     and the International Trade Commission. The Commerce \n     Department has as many as 20 days to decide whether to \n     initiate an investigation. If the investigation goes forward, \n     the department has 190 days to determine if dumping occurred. \n     The ITC then determines whether ``material injury'' to the \n     oilmen occurred. Duties, if warranted, would follow.\n       The four countries deny the allegations and say they will \n     fight them. Roberto Mandini, president of Venezuelan state-\n     oil monopoly Petroleos De Venezuela SA, says that ``pushing \n     down oil prices would be suicidal for Venezeuela.'' Adds Luis \n     de la Calle, Mexico's undersecretary for international trade \n     negotiations: ``Mexico is not in the practice of unfair \n     commercial practices.''\n       What is not in dispute is how hard a hit small domestic oil \n     took during the recent downturn in oil prices. While larger \n     oil companies with their huge asset bases and integrated \n     businesses were able to weather the storm, many of the \n     smaller producers, which operate on low margins and miniscule \n     volumes, lurched toward ruin.\n       These small producers, who mop up the tailings of the \n     country's once-great oil fields primarily in the West and the \n     Mid-west collectively produce about 1.4 million barrels of \n     oil daily, an amount roughly equivalent to that imported to \n     Saudi Arabia.

Mr. President, I wish to call attention to an important \nGovernmental Affairs Committee hearing on export controls held last \nweek.\n  In August 1998, the Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nrequested the Inspectors General of the Departments of Commerce, \nDefense, Energy, State, and Treasury and the Central Intelligence \nAgency to conduct a review of their export license processes and to \nfollow-up on an earlier set of reports that were done in 1993.\n  In their reports and at the hearing, the Inspectors General raised a \nnumber of important issues which, I believe, will require further \noversight and clarification. These issues are especially important in \nlight of the recent Cox Committee Report which highlighted espionage \nactivities at our National Laboratories and the release of classified \nnuclear information. As we begin to debate the reauthorization of the \nExport Administration Act, the recommendations made by the Inspectors \nGeneral should be considered in this context.\n  The Inspectors General concluded that the export control processes \nwork relatively well, but they also highlighted additional issues that \nthe Congress should continue to monitor.

Mr. President, in compliance with paragraph 11(a) of \nrule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources has obtained a letter from the Congressional \nBudget Office containing an estimate of the costs of S. 1287, the \nNuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1999, as reported from the \nCommittee. In addition, pursuant to Public Law 104-4, the letter \ncontains the opinion of the Congressional Budget Office regarding \nwhether the S. 1287 contains intergovernmental mandates as defined in \nthat Act. I ask unanimous consent that the opinion of the Congressional \nBudget Office be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the opinion was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for the Nuclear Waste \n     Policy Amendments Act of 1999.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Kim \n     Cawley (for federal costs), who can be reached at 226-2860, \n     and Marjorie Miller (for state and local impact), who can be \n     reached at 225-3220.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Dan L. Crippen.\n       Enclosure.\n       Summary: This bill would amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \n     by directing the Department of Energy (DOE) to make a final \n     decision by December 31, 2001, whether to recommend to the \n     President that the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada be developed \n     as a permanent waste repository. The bill would, under \n     certain conditions, provide for storage of waste at Yucca \n     Mountain before a permanent repository is completed, and \n     would allow DOE to enter into agreements with nuclear \n     utilities to assume responsibility for some waste at a \n     utility's current storage site. In addition, the bill would \n     authorize training programs and grants to states to prepare \n     for transshipment of nuclear waste, and it would authorize \n     the establishment of an Office of Spent Fuel Research in DOE.\n       Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO \n     estimates that implementing this legislation would cost about \n     $1.9 billion over the 2000-2004 period to continue DOE's \n     efforts to characterize the Yucca Mountain site and submit a \n     license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n     (NRC). Enacting this bill would not affect direct spending or \n     receipts; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not \n     apply.\n       The state of Nevada and localities in the state would incur \n     some additional costs as a result of this bill, but CBO is \n     unsure whether the provisions causing those costs would be \n     considered intergovernmental mandates, as defined in the \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). We estimate that the \n     costs incurred by state and local governments would total \n     significantly less than the threshold established in the law \n     ($50 million in 1996, adjusted annually for inflation). This \n     bill contains no new private-sector mandates as defined in \n     UMRA.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of this bill is shown in the following \n     table. The costs of this legislation fall within budget \n     functions 270 and 050 (energy and defense).\n\n                [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 1999   2000   2001   2002   2003   2004\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\nSpending on Nuclear Waste\n Disposal Under Current Law:\n    Budget Authority \\1\\......    358      0      0      0      0      0\n    Estimated Outlays.........    324     55      0      0      0      0\nProposed Changes:\n    Estimated Authorization         0    390    365    340    430    455\n     Level....................\n    Estimated Outlays.........      0    312    370    345    412    450\nSpending on Nuclear Waste\n Disposal Under the Bill:\n    Estimated Authorization       358    390    365    340    430    455\n     Level \\1\\................\n    Estimated Outlays.........    324    367    370    345    412    450\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 1999 level is the amount appropriated for that year.\n\n       Basis of estimate: This estimate is based on DOE's current \n     plan for the nuclear waste program, issued in July 1998. For \n     purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes the bill will be \n     enacted before the end of fiscal year 1999. We assume DOE \n     will apply to the NRC for authorization to build a permanent \n     repository at the Yucca Mountain site by March 31, 2002, so \n     that the NRC may decide whether to authorize construction by \n     December 31, 2006, as directed by section 101 of this bill.\n       Yucca Mountain. This legislation would authorize DOE to \n     proceed with its Civilian Radioactive Waste Management \n     Program plan of July 1998. This plan calls for continuing to \n     evaluate the Yucca Mountain site as a permanent repository \n     for nuclear waste and applying for a construction license \n     from the NRC in 2002, if the site appears to be viable for \n     this use. Based on information from DOE, CBO estimates that \n     this effort would require appropriations averaging nearly \n     $400 million annually and totaling about $2 billion over the \n     2000-2004 period. Substantial additional costs would be \n     incurred after 2004 to construct and operate a nuclear waste \n     repository at Yucca Mountain if the NRC issues a license to \n     the department. In its December 1998 report, Analysis of the \n     Total System Life Cycle Cost of the Civilian Radioactive \n     Waste Management Program, DOE estimates the future cost to \n     complete the program is ``approximately $26.6 billion, in \n     constant 1998 dollars from 1999 through closure and \n     decommissioning, assumed to be in 2116.''\n       Backup storage. Section 102 would direct DOE to take title \n     to any amounts of nuclear waste that the NRC determines \n     cannot be stored at a utility's site, provided that such a \n     utility would agree to waive any claim for damages against \n     the United States because of DOE's failure to begin disposing \n     of waste in 1998. DOE would be directed to transport this \n     waste to the Yucca Mountain site following NRC authorization \n     to construct a permanent repository there, or to transport it \n     to a privately run facility for nuclear waste storage. DOE \n     could incur additional discretionary costs for building waste \n     storage capacity at the Yucca Mountain site before the \n     facility opened or transporting waste to a private storage \n     facility (if any private facilities are constructed), if any \n     utilities require backup storage.\n       This cost estimate does not include any potential costs for \n     backup storage, however, because it is not clear that there \n     will be any demand for backup storage. Thus, there may not be \n     a need for additional DOE spending over 2003-2006 period. In \n     addition, it is uncertain whether or not the NRC will \n     authorize construction of a repository at the Yucca Mountain \n     site in 2006. This authorization would be required before \n     backup storage could be provided since it appears unlikely \n     that any privately owned waste storage facilities will be \n     developed over the next few years. If DOE were required to \n     prepare the Yucca Mountain site for backup storage, \n     additional costs could be substantial. Based on information \n     from DOE, we estimated such costs could approach $1 billion \n     over the 2003-2006 period, subject to the availability of \n     appropriated funds.\n       Settlement agreements. Section 105 would allow DOE to enter \n     into settlement agreements with any utilities that were \n     scheduled to have nuclear waste removed from their sites by \n     DOE starting on January 31, 1998. If a utility waives any \n     claim for damages against the United States because of DOE's \n     failure to begin disposing of waste in 1998, then the \n     department may take title to the utility's waste, provide \n     waste storage casks to the utility, operate an existing \n     dry cask storage facility for the utility, or compensate \n     the utility for the cost of providing storage for this \n     waste at the utility's site. The bill would restrict DOE \n     from making expenditures from the Nuclear Waste Fund to \n     pay for any settlement costs that would not otherwise be \n     incurred under the existing contracts for nuclear waste \n     disposal between DOE and nuclear utilities.\n       This estimate does not include any additional discretionary \n     costs for settlement agreements that may be entered into \n     between DOE and nuclear utilities as a result of enacting \n     this bill. Under current law, and consistent with the \n     standard contract for nuclear waste disposal between the \n     department and the nuclear utilities, these parties may agree \n     to reduce the annual nuclear waste fee (referred to as ``fee \n     credits'') paid to the government by the utilities in the \n     event of an avoidable delay in the schedule for disposing of \n     waste. CBO has assumed that DOE and those utilities that have \n     experienced an avoidable delay in the disposal of their waste \n     will choose to invoke this provision of their contracts and \n     that the mandatory nuclear waste fee will be reduced by a \n     total of about $400 million over the 2000-2009 period to \n     compensate these utilities for the incremental cost of \n     continued waste storage at their sites of 10,000 metric tons \n     of waste.\n       If nuclear utilities choose to enter into settlement \n     agreements with DOE following enactment of this bill, it is \n     possible that DOE would agree to provide compensation greater \n     than or less than the amount CBO has assumed under current \n     law. It is also possible that DOE would choose to use \n     appropriated funds to provide compensation instead of fee \n     credits as we have assumed. In this case, the discretionary \n     costs of this legislation would be higher than we have \n     estimated here, and nuclear waste fee collections would be \n     greater than the amount we have estimated. CBO cannot predict \n     whether or not utilities would choose to enter into \n     settlement agreements under the terms defined in this bill, \n     nor whether DOE would use fee credits or appropriated funds \n     to implement any settlement agreements.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.\n       Estimated impact on state, local, and tribal governments: \n     Mandates. CBO is unsure whether the bill contains \n     intergovernmental mandates, as defined in UMRA, but we \n     estimated that costs incurred by state, local, and tribal \n     governments as a result of the bill would total significantly \n     less than the threshold established in the law ($50 million \n     in 1996, adjusted annually for inflation).\n       Although this bill would, by itself, establish no new \n     enforceable duties on state,\n\n[[Page S8078]]\n\n     local, or tribal governments, shipments on nuclear waste for \n     surface storage at the Yucca Mountain site, as authorized by \n     the bill, probably would increase the cost to the state of \n     Nevada of complying with existing federal requirements. CBO \n     cannot determine whether these costs would be considered the \n     direct costs of a mandate as defined by UMRA.\n       Additional spending by the state would support a number of \n     activities, including emergency communications, emergency \n     response planning and training, inspections, and escort of \n     waste shipments. These costs are similar to those that the \n     state would eventually incur under current law as a result of \n     the permanent repository planned for Yucca Mountain. This \n     bill would, however, authorize DOE to receive and store waste \n     at Yucca Mountain once the NRC has authorized construction of \n     a repository at that site and would set a deadline of \n     December 31, 2006, for NRC to make that decision. This date \n     is about three years earlier than DOE expects to begin \n     receiving material at the site under current law.\n       Other impacts. This bill would authorize planning grants of \n     at least $150,000 for each state and Indian tribe through \n     whose jurisdiction radioactive waste would be transported and \n     annual implementation grants for those states and tribes \n     after they have completed their plans. Further, the bill \n     would prohibit shipments through the jurisdiction of any \n     state or tribe that has not received technical assistance and \n     funds for at least three years.\n       Estimated impact on the private sector: This bill contains \n     no new private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.\n       Previous CBO estimate: On May 4, 1999, CBO prepared a cost \n     estimate for H.R. 45, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1999, \n     as ordered reported by the House Committee on Commerce on \n     April 21, 1999. The provisions of the bill ordered reported \n     by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and \n     H.R. 45 are different and the two cost estimates reflect \n     those differences. In particular, H.R. 45 would authorize \n     construction of an interim repository at the Yucca Mountain \n     site, while the Senate bill does not contain any similar \n     provision. In contrast to H.R. 45, the Senate bill contains \n     provisions relating to settlement agreements between DOE and \n     nuclear utilities and to backup storage.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal costs: Kim Cawley (226-2860); \n     Impact on State, local, and tribal governments: Majorie \n     Miller (225-3220).\n       Estimate approved by: Paul N.

Mr. President, when we look at Asia these days, \nAmericans' primary focus is on China and the many difficult challenges \nthat we face in that relationship. Next on our list of what we are \nwatching in the region is Japan where our economic and security \nrelationship remains the linchpin of our presence in Asia. These days, \nhowever, Japan seems to get scant attention from either the public or \nthe policymaking community. That is a mistake, but I will leave that \nissue to another day.\n  After Japan in our focus comes the Korean Peninsula where we are \nconcerned particularly about North Korea and its nuclear weapons \ndevelopment, missile technology, military adventurism, possible \neconomic collapse, and internal instability. As we continue down the \nlist of important things to think about in Asia, we come to Indonesia \nand the future of economic and political reform and internal stability \nin that hugely important nation.\n  Some may differ with my analysis, but it appears to me that, right or \nwrong, these days, our nation is looking at Asia in this way.\n  Today, however, I would like to call the Senate's attention to two \nimportant developments in other countries in Asia, specifically \nSoutheast Asia, that are not on this list. These developments have been \nreported in our media, but, generally, on the back pages. They should \nnot be ignored, because they relate to America's broad strategy toward \nthe region where our interests are in security, stability, and open \nmarkets.\n  The two developments are the passage by the Philippine Senate of a \nU.S.-Philippine Visiting Forces Agreement and the progress being made \ntoward completion of a U.S.-Vietnam trade agreement.\n  After a decade of stable democracy and economic reform, the \nPhilippines may be the strongest economy in Southeast Asia after \nSingapore. Security ties, however, have remained at a very low level \nsince the end of the base arrangement in 1991. This changed \ndramatically two weeks ago when the Philippine Senate ratified the new \nVisiting Forces Agreement.\n  This arrangement, typical of the relationship we have with many of \nour allies, allows us to apply U.S. military law to American soldiers \nand sailors overseas. Its ratification will permit us to renew joint \nmilitary exercises, pay naval port visits, and develop a stronger and \nmore cooperative relationship than we have had in the decade since we \nleft Subic Bay and Clark Field. President Estrada and the Philippine \nSenate deserve great credit for their statesmanship in bringing these \ntalks to conclusion.\n  The Visiting Forces Agreement also comes at an opportune time. \nDisputes between Southeast Asian states and China in the South China \nSea are becoming more frequent. The financial crisis has forced most \nSoutheast Asian nations to concentrate on internal economic issues. \nThis agreement should give Southeast Asian countries more confidence in \nthe U.S. commitment to the region, and, hence, serve as a long-term \nforce for stability.\n  In the case of Vietnam, we appear to be getting close to a bilateral \ntrade agreement, which will promote economic reform in Vietnam and \nallow us to grant them Normal Trade Relations status, NTR.\n  Vietnam, the fourth largest country in Asia and one that shares a \nland border with China, is an essential part of any regional policy. We \nhave obvious historic sensitivities to address as we develop closer \nrelations with Vietnam. We have taken a number of steps in the past few \nyears--lifting the trade embargo, normalizing diplomatic relations, \ndispatching Pete Peterson as Ambassador, and concluding a Copyright \nAgreement, all in association with a commitment by Vietnam for full \ncooperation on resolving POW/MIA issues. As time passes, a normal and \nproductive relationship with Vietnam will contribute immensely to \nstability and security in the southern Pacific.\n  We are now negotiating an agreement that would begin to open the \nVietnamese market to foreign trade and investment. This will support \neconomic reform and market opening in Vietnam while also creating new \ncommercial opportunities for Americans in a market of 80 million \npeople. The strategic implications of this agreement, which will move \nus down the road to a normal bilateral relationship with Vietnam, are \nimportant. It will strengthen Southeast Asia, reduce chances for \nconflicts in the wider Asian region, and place the United States in a \nstronger regional position.\n  Of course, an agreement must be meaningful in trade policy terms. It \nis not a WTO accession and, therefore, need not meet WTO standards, but \nit should include elements such as reform of trading rights and opening \nof key service sectors, in addition to other market-opening steps. For \nour part, if the Vietnamese are willing to conclude such an agreement, \nwe should proceed rapidly to grant them Normal Trade Relations. This is \nin our trade and commercial interest, and also in our strategic \ninterest. We have an opportunity to integrate Vietnam more fully into \nthe Asian and world economies. I encourage our Administration, and the \nVietnamese government, to complete the Commercial Agreement \nexpeditiously.\n  We should, parenthetically, also proceed to Normal Trade Relations \nwith Laos, where a trade agreement has already been completed.\n  The Philippine Visiting Forces Agreement and the bilateral trade \nagreement with Vietnam, once completed, mean we have taken additional \nsteps toward creating a post-Cold War framework involving open trade \nand security relationships in the Pacific. This is very much in our \nnational interest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8078-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8078-S8079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Subcommittee \non International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services, I want \nto stress the importance of the United States implementing in a timely \nmanner the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, \nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their \nDestruction, commonly referred as the Chemical Weapons Convention \n(CWC).\n  The Convention is an important multilateral agreement that serves to \nreduce the threat posed by chemical\n\n[[Page S8079]]\n\nweapons. It bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of \nchemical weapons by signatory states. The Convention also requires the \ndestruction of all chemical weapons and production facilities by \nsignatory states.\n  The Convention does not, however, prohibit the manufacture, use, and \nconsumption of chemicals that could be used as warfare agents or their \nprecursor chemicals as long as these chemicals are used for legitimate \npeaceful purposes.\n  Although the Convention has been in force for 2\\1/2\\ years, the \nUnited States is not in the compliance because the administration has \nnot yet submitted the required industrial declarations to the \nInternational Organization on the Proliferation of Chemical Weapons. \nThis is a disappointment since the United States played a central role \nin spearheading development of this treaty.\n  Most of our allies have complied with their treaty obligations, but \nit is likely that they will not agree to a second round of inspections \nuntil the United States has submitted declarations and U.S. industry \nhas undergone inspections.\n  The United States has the largest chemical industry in the world. \nThis industry is involved in legitimate production, use, consumption, \nexport and import of chemicals subject to verification under the \nConvention. The United States must serve as a model of compliance with \nthe Convention to build confidence with our friends and foes and also \nto ensure that chemical weapons are never used again.\n  On June 25, 1999, President Clinton issued Executive Order 13128 to \nimplement the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1998, \nwhich Congress passed on October 21, 1998.\n  However, the administration still has not issued regulations for \nindustry to comply with the declaration and inspection requirements \nunder the treaty.\n  The American chemical industry is poised to comply with our treaty \nobligations. I hope the administration quickly issues these regulations \nso the United States is in compliance with our treaty obligations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8079-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO NELSON RHONE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Nelson began his \nSenate career December 21, 1964, as a laborer with Sergeant at Arms' \ncustodial service operation. During his tenure with the Sergeant at \nArms office, Nelson also worked in the Legislative Garage as a garage \nattendant and driver. In 1988, Nelso was promoted to Labor Foreman in \nthe Sergeant at Arms' Environmental Service operation.\n  That account of his career here does not adequately convey the \naffection and respect he has earned at all levels of this institution. \nHe is one of those rare individuals who, by virtue of both his tenure \nand his character, come to represent all that is best in the Senate of \nthe United States.\n  In describing him, the word that immediately comes to mind is \n``gentleman.'' These days, that can seem like a quaint or old-fashioned \nterm, but it is the most accurate compliment for someone like Nelson, \nwho, by personal example, has set a standard for others to follow. It \nis an understatement to say that we will miss him. He is a gem.\n  Now, after nearly 35 years of devoted service to the Senate, he is \nretiring to spend more time with his wife, Mary Jane, and his family. \nNelson is an avid bowler and enjoys traveling. He and Mary Jane look \nforward to having the time to travel and spend more time with their \nfriends and family.\n  Nelson has been a dedicated and valuable member of the Senate \ncommunity, and I know all members join with me in wishing him many \nyears of health and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8079-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MARCIA KOZIE\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

I know the old addage \ngoes, ``no one is irreplaceable,'' but Marcia's boots will be difficult \nto fill. She has trailblazed for me these many years and her calm \ndemeanor and soothing voice can smooth out the many wrinkles we often \nencounter.\n  When you cross the threshold of the Fairbanks office, you are always \nwelcomed by a cheerful smile, a kind word and a sympathetic ear. Marcia \nKozie has always had these winning ways, even during the most difficult \nof times. We all sometimes shoot the messenger by mistake, but Marcia's \ndemeanor has always worked like a charm. Her ability to see the glass \nhalf full instead of empty, her cool head in times of crises and her \ngenuine concern for my constituency have been worth more to me and \nNancy and my office than a ton of Alaska gold. You just can't buy this \nkind of service.\n  Even though Marcia made her way to Alaska via Vermont, New Hampshire, \nColorado, and Texas, she lived in the Fairbanks community for over 19 \nyears before she came to work for me. In typical Marcia fashion, she \nimmersed herself in the community getting involved with her three \nchildren and their activities, her husband Walt's business and many \nphilanthropic groups who provided a special insight into Fairbanks \ncommunity affairs.\n  She told me in her first interview that even though she had not \nworked for many years, she was adaptable and proficient in whatever the \ntask. She continued by saying this was a God-given talent and that she \ndidn't think He had taken it away from her, yet. And I have never \nregretted that decision to hire Marcia. While her Federal service will \nend, I know she will be devoting her time to spreading those God-given \ntalents around the community.\n  She will be missed by all the staff members in both the Washington, \nDC, and State offices. It is with deep appreciation and gratitude that \nI thank her for 18 years of a job well done. As a matter of fact, the \nmayor of Fairbanks has proclaimed today, June 30, 1999, as Marcia Kozie \nDay in Fairbanks.\n  Toodle-loo, my loyal friend. Thank you for your service to this \ncountry, the State of Alaska and the people of Fairbanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8079-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8079-S8080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEDICARE HOME HEALTH EQUITY ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on June 10th we held a hearing on home \nhealth care in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nSubcommittee where we examined how the so called ``reforms'' of the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 were holding up. I continue to believe that \nthe answer to that question is, ``not well.'' That is why I am joining \nwith my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, the Chairman of the PSI \nSubcommittee, in introducing an important bill, the Medicare Home \nHealth Equity Act of 1999.\n  Home health care agencies provide a vital service to many elderly \nAmericans. In my own state of Michigan there are over 1.3 million \nMedicare beneficiaries. Over 100,000 of these beneficiaries use the \nservices of Michigan's 223 home health agencies. People prefer to \nrecuperate in their own homes, and it is also less costly for the \ngovernment since the alternative is nursing home care which is \nextraordinarily expensive for the Medicare program.\n  I am concerned about potential access problems. Although HCFA and the \nGAO have reported that they have not seen a decline in access for \nbeneficiaries, the home health care witnesses that spoke before the PSI \nSubcommittee all stated that they believed there was an access problem. \nIn fact, Barbara Markham Smith, from the George Washington University \nMedical Center, testified that ``many seriously ill patients, \nespecially diabetics, appear to have been displaced from Medicare home \ncare.'' Sometimes it takes a while for the people in the field to \nactually get the numbers back to the people in Washington, and I think \nthis is one of those instances.\n  We all know that during the early 90's home health care expenditures \ngrew at a rapid pace. According to the GAO, Medicare spent $3.7 billion \nto pay for home health visits in 1990 compared to $17.8 billion in \n1997. This growth led to changes, like the interim payment system, \n(IPS) that were implemented\n\n[[Page S8080]]\n\nunder the Balanced Budget Act. While some of the changes under the \nBalanced Budget Act were good, some of the changes are now negatively \nimpacting Medicare beneficiaries.\n  I have heard from many constituents regarding home health care \nchanges under the Balanced Budget Act and the various regulations that \nHCFA has imposed. In fact, last year, I received some 1500 letters from \nboth home health care providers and beneficiaries. I echo their \nconcerns when I say that the interim payment system penalizes cost \nefficient home health providers, like those in Michigan, while \nrewarding higher cost agencies.\n  Not only does the IPS penalize agencies that attempted to keep their \ncosts down in 1994, but the new regulations which HCFA has imposed on \nthe agencies are quite burdensome. There is no more poignant story to \ndemonstrate the undue burdens being placed on home health care \nproviders than that of Linda Stock, a Michigan home health care \nprovider. This month Ms. Stock testified before the PSI Subcommittee \nabout the problems that home care providers were having, particularly \ncost efficient home care providers like her own. Last week Ms. Stock \ncalled to let me know that she has resigned from her job because she \ndid not feel that she could ask her staff to implement regulations such \nas OASIS (Outcome and Assessment Information Set) and the 15 minute \nincrement home health reporting requirement. It is tragic that a \ncommitted health care provider such as Linda Stock would feel the need \nto resign from her job rather than implement regulations which she \nbelieved were unfair to both beneficiaries and providers.\n\n  So what can be done in the face of these problems? I believe that the \nbill we are introducing today, if enacted, could go a long way towards \nhelping Ms. Stock and others like her.\n  Last year I worked on a bill with Senator Collins to revise the \npayment formula used to calculate the per beneficiary limit. That bill \nwould have created new winners and losers under the IPS. This year's \nbill does not attempt to revise the formula, and therefore avoids the \nformula fight which made action on this issue so difficult last year. \nOur new bill makes needed adjustments to the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997 and related federal regulations.\n  Though technical in nature, I would like to read the major provisions \nfound in the bill:\n  (1) The bill will eliminate the automatic 15 per cent reduction in \nMedicare home health payments now scheduled for October 1, 2000.\n  (2) The bill will provide supplemental payments to home health \nagencies on a patient by patient basis if the cost of care for an \nindividual is considered by the Secretary to be significantly higher \nthan average due to the patient's particular health and functional \ncondition.\n  (3) The bill will increase the per beneficiary cost limit for \nagencies with limits below the national average to the national average \ncost per patient over a three year period or until the Medicare home \nhealth prospective payment system is implemented.\n  (4) The bill will revise the surety bond requirement for home health \nagencies to more appropriately target fraud\n  (5) The bill will extend the IPS overpayment recoupment period to \nthree years without interest\n  (6) The bill will eliminate the 15 minute incremental reporting \nperiod\n  (7) The bill temporarily maintains the Periodic Interim Payment (PIP) \nprogram, a program that permits HCFA to make payments to agencies-based \non historical payment levels--prior to the final settlement of claims \nand cost reports.\n  I believe that this bill provides an opportunity for us to move \nforward in solving some of the problems caused by the Balanced Budget \nAct. We should pass this common sense bill that will ensure that home \ncare is accessible to those seniors who so desperately need it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8080-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the Kyoto \n     Protocol on greenhouse gas emissions; to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 98\n\n       Whereas, The people of Michigan join other Americans in the \n     concern that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse \n     gases may pose a risk of adding to natural long-term changes \n     in climate, such as warming of the Earth, shifts in climate \n     patterns and weather conditions, and other atmospheric \n     aberrations; and\n       Whereas, Scientists are continuing to investigate and \n     debate the merits of existing evidence of climate change. \n     Researchers are developing more information about the extent, \n     causes, and solutions related to greenhouse gases; and\n       Whereas, Michigan's citizens want government leaders to \n     seek affordable, effective ways to address climate change; \n     and\n       Whereas, in July 1997, the United States Senate adopted \n     Senate Resolution 98, which directs the United States not to \n     adopt any agreement emerging from the Kyoto, Japan, summit on \n     climate change that would commit this nation to limits or \n     reductions in greenhouse gas emissions without also requiring \n     commitments by developing nations or that would impose undue \n     economic burdens on all Americans; and\n       Whereas, Despite well-documented uncertainties about the \n     scientific basis of climate change and contrary to the \n     directives contained in Senate Resolution 98, the United \n     States signed the Kyoto Climate Treaty. This treaty, often \n     referred to as the Kyoto Protocol, commits this nation to \n     reducing its emissions of greenhouse gases to amounts that \n     are seven percent below their 1990 levels between the years \n     2008 and 2012 (an amount requiring more than a 30 percent \n     reduction in projected United States carbon emissions \n     achieved by reductions in energy use). The treaty, however, \n     exempts more than 130 developing nations from similar \n     constraints; and\n       Whereas, Energy provides valuable services to citizens \n     through the heating and cooling of homes, transportation, \n     processing of fuel, and other services vital to our citizens' \n     well-being and our security; and\n       Whereas, Achieving the Kyoto Protocol targets will not \n     mitigate climate changes or its effects, but according to the \n     United States Department of Energy's Energy Information \n     Administration, it may cause the loss of 2.4 million jobs \n     throughout most industry sectors and increase the price of \n     electricity (up to 86%), gasoline (66 cents per gallon), fuel \n     oil (76%), and natural gas (147%); and\n       Whereas, Studies by the Heartland Institute and the Sparks \n     Companies show that the Kyoto Protocol would increase \n     production costs and cut farmers' incomes by one-quarter to \n     one-half. This would force many family farms out of business, \n     reduce agricultural exports, and increase food prices, which \n     would be especially detrimental to America's poorest \n     families; and\n       Whereas, According to the United States Energy Information \n     Administration, meeting the emissions reduction targets in \n     the Kyoto Protocol could cost the average household in the \n     United States $4,100 per year beginning in 2010 resulting \n     from the increase in the price of utilities, fuel, and \n     consumer goods and services. It is projected to cause the \n     loss of 96,500 jobs in Michigan; and\n       Whereas, Other alternatives to reducing greenhouse gas \n     emissions, such as research and development and voluntary \n     emissions reduction programs, should be investigated and \n     considered. It is vital to use a balanced approach to \n     promoting economic progress and protecting the environment; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we oppose \n     the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol and memorialize the \n     United States Senate not to ratify the Kyoto Climate Treaty. \n     We urge federal authorities to consider strategies to protect \n     the environment that apply to all nations and encourage \n     alternative, voluntary proposals to reduce greenhouse gases; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-232. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Illinois relative to Social \n     Security; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 95\n\n       Whereas, Social Security is America's premier family \n     protection system, providing working families with crucial \n     income insurance in the event of the retirement, death or \n     disability of a family wage earner; and\n       Whereas, Social Security is the only secure source of \n     retirement income for the overwhelming majority of Americans, \n     with two in three older American households relying on Social \n     Security for half or more of their income; and\n       Whereas, Many of the proposals being discussed would \n     require sharp and misguided benefit cuts, including raising \n     the normal retirement age and reducing the cost of living \n     adjustments; and\n       Whereas, The Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and \n     Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds are \n     reporting that Social Security is secure and can pay full \n     benefits until 2032, with 70 to 75 percent of benefits \n     covered by expected revenues after that time; and\n       Whereas, Many Americans are concerned about Social \n     Security's long-term financial viability; therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     First General Assembly of the State of Illinois, That (1) \n     Congress should take steps soon to strengthen Social Security \n     so that all Americans can be assured that the program will be \n     there for them; (2) Social Security should continue to \n     provide an unreduced foundation of economic security for \n     American families; (3) Social Security benefits should not be \n     subject to the whims of the market, and private investment \n     accounts should never be substituted for the core defined \n     benefits Social Security currently provides; (4) Working \n     families should be able to count on full disability and \n     survivor protections that grow to meet the needs of families, \n     including spouses and children; (5) Americans who do not \n     spend full careers in the paid workforce because they work at \n     home caring for children or other family members should not \n     be penalized by reform; and (6) Responsible Social Security \n     reforms must be based on realistic assumptions about the \n     economy as well as about the uncertainty and risk inherent in \n     markets; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     presented to the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, \n     and each member of the Illinois congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-233. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Illinois relative to the Social \n     Service Block Grant/Title XX program; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 160\n\n       Whereas, Congress and the White House have funded the \n     Social Service Block Grant/Title XX program at a relatively \n     stable level for the past 5 years; and\n       Whereas, The FFY 99 funding level for this program \n     unexpectedly dropped 17% during budget negotiations at the \n     close of the last congressional session; and\n       Whereas, This federally funded program is almost \n     exclusively devoted to community based human services \n     throughout the State of Illinois, including adoption \n     services, case coordination services, intervention for \n     victims of domestic violence, youth development services, day \n     care for children, employment development services, family \n     support, foster care for children, homemaker services, \n     outpatient treatment, protective intervention, rehabilitation \n     and training for handicapped adults, and treatment for \n     substance abuse, among other funded services, extending into \n     every county and legislative district in the State serving \n     over 130,000 individuals or families in Illinois; and\n       Whereas, The National Conference of Mayors, the National \n     Council of State Legislatures, and the National Governors \n     Conference have all strongly recommended the restoration of \n     full funding to this important program; therefore be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     First General Assembly of the State of Illinois, That the \n     Illinois congressional delegation be informed of our concern \n     regarding this essential source of funding for critically \n     important State programming and services; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Illinois House of Representatives urges \n     the Illinois congressional delegation to influence and guide \n     the federal budgeting process for FFY 2000 and beyond to \n     restore full funding for the Social Service Block Grant/Title \n     XX program and incrementally increase funding for this \n     essential program as future federal budget opportunities \n     present themselves; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be forwarded to \n     the members of the Illinois congressional delegation \n     immediately.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-234. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Illinois relative to the proposed \n     ``Dollars to the Classroom Act''; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 228\n\n       Whereas, H.R. 2 is a bill that was introduced this year in \n     the U.S. House of Representatives to send more dollars to the\n\n[[Page S8083]]\n\n     classroom and for certain other purposes; and\n       Whereas, In this bill, Congress urges the Department of \n     Education, states, and local educational agencies to work \n     together to ensure that not less than 95% of all funds \n     appropriated for elementary and secondary education programs \n     administered by the Department of Education is spent for \n     children in their classrooms; the bill also provides for an \n     educational flexibility program under which the Secretary of \n     Education allows a State educational entity to waive \n     statutory and regulatory requirements for the State \n     educational agency or any local education agency or school \n     and provides for the modification of arbitrage rebate rules \n     applicable to bonds used to finance public schools; therefore \n     be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     First General Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we urge \n     the U.S. Congress to pass H.R. 2; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     delivered to the Speaker of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the President pro tempore of the U.S. \n     Senate, and each member of the Illinois congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-235.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Illinois relative to Phase II \n     Reformulated Gasoline; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 303\n\n       Whereas, The federal Clean Air Act requires a new type of \n     motor fuel to be sold in the Nation's ozone non-attainment \n     areas beginning January 1, 2000; and\n       Whereas, This new fuel is known as Phase II Reformulated \n     Gasoline or RFG; and\n       Whereas, Illinois has 2 ozone non-attainment areas: the 8-\n     county Chicago Metropolitan area which will have to sell \n     Phase II RFG exclusively and the 3-county Metro-east area; \n     and\n       Whereas, Most of the present Phase I RFG fuel sold in the \n     Chicago Metropolitan area, through a partnership between corn \n     growers, ethanol processors, and gasoline refiners and \n     marketers, contains 10% ethanol; and\n       Whereas, The Chicago RFG market accounts for 400 million \n     gallons of ethanol demand, making it the foundation of the \n     domestic ethanol industry today; and\n       Whereas, The General Assembly is greatly concerned that \n     present United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     regulations for Phase II RFG could severely limit or prohibit \n     the blending of ethanol in gasoline by refiners, especially \n     in the summer months, thereby endangering the Illinois \n     ethanol industry's core market; and\n       Whereas, To date, the Chicago Area and Illinois have made \n     extraordinary progress in meeting the demands of the Clean \n     Air Act, leading to greatly improved air quality, much of \n     which is attributed to the use of existing RFG fuels; and\n       Whereas, The USEPA's proposed Phase II RFG regulations for \n     January 1, 2000, constitute a real threat to the economic \n     viability of Illinois; ethanol industry and Illinois' \n     gasoline refining industry; and\n       Whereas, Illinois' ethanol industry supports over 50,000 \n     jobs in the corn farming and ethanol processing sector, with \n     major facilities in Peoria, Decatur, and elsewhere in the \n     State; and\n       Whereas, Illinois' gasoline refining and marketing industry \n     employs over 40,000 Illinois workers, including 6 major \n     refineries producing over one million barrels a day of \n     gasoline and other products in the Chicago area, St. Louis \n     area, and Southeastern Illinois location; therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     First General Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we \n     encourage and support Governor George Ryan's decision to \n     immediately engage the Administrator of the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency in a dialogue towards meeting \n     and resolving the technical challenges of using ethanol in \n     Phase II RFG; that the dialogue shall include presentation of \n     recent research data suggesting ethanol benefits and the \n     request that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency permit \n     the continued use of ethanol under phase II of the RFG \n     Program in a way that will not economically disadvantage \n     Illinois' ethanol and gasoline refining industries; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That if urban airshed modeling is required as a \n     necessary component of the presentation to the U.S. \n     Environmental Protection Agency, the General Assembly will \n     support funding for the Illinois EPA to conduct the modeling; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     delivered to the Governor, the Director of the Illinois \n     Environmental Protection Agency, the Administrator of the \n     United States Environmental Protection Agency, the President \n     of the United States, and each member of the Illinois \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-237.

A bill to ensure full and expeditious enforcement of the \nprovisions of the Communications Act of 1934 that seek to bring about \ncompetition in local telecommunications markets, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n       the telecommunications competition enforcement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, S. 1312, the \nTelecommunications Competition Enforcement Act of 1999.\n  The United States has a telecommunications system that is unequaled. \nWe have worked hard to ensure that consumers in all parts of the \ncountry have access to this system and enjoy services at an affordable \nprice. Therefore, when the Bell companies asked us to allow them to \nenter the long distance market, it was with great caution that we began \nto develop policies that would change the existing framework. We did \nnot want to jeopardize existing service as we phased in competition \ninto local markets and allowed local phone companies to enter the long \ndistance market.\n  Bell companies worked with Congress to create the fourteen point \nchecklist and they celebrated the passage of the 1996 Act. They then \nfiled applications with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to \nenter the long distance market. However, the FCC found that the Bell \ncompanies had not opened their local markets to competition, and \ntherefore, under the 1996 Act, could not enter the long distance \nmarket. Once the Bell companies realized that they were not going to \nget into the long distance market before they complied with the 1996 \nAct, they began a strategy of litigation to delay competition into \ntheir local markets and hold on to their monopolies. They appealed the \nFCC's decisions to the Court of Appeals and challenged the \nconstitutionality of the Act taking their case to the Supreme Court. \nHaving lost in those forums they have now come to Congress seeking \nchanges to the Act that only three years ago they championed. As a \nresult bills have been introduced in the Senate and the House that \nsignificantly amend the 1996 Act, harm competition in the local \nmarkets, and slow the delivery of advanced, affordable services to \nconsumers.\n  Therefore, I introduce this legislation as part of a continuing \neffort to promote competition in the local telecommunications markets. \nI am frustrated by the broken promises of the Bell companies given that \nnot a single Bell company has adequately opened its local phone market \nto competition since the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of \n1996. According to wall street analysts, as of the end of last year new \nentrants had only 2.5 percent of all access lines while Bell companies \nand incumbent local exchange carriers continued to control over 97 \npercent of those lines into the home.\n  Three years ago when we passed the 1996 Act, Bell companies \nproclaimed that they would open their markets immediately and begin \ncompeting. In fact, they and their lawyers helped write the 14 point \nchecklist--their roadmap into the long distance market in their region. \nAll these companies have to do to provide long distance service in \ntheir regions is to follow that roadmap and meet the requirements of \nSection 271.\n  I remember the excitement by the local phone companies at the time of \nthe 1996 Act. On March 5, 1996, Bell South-Alabama President, Neal \nTravis, stated that the ``Telecommunications Act now means that \nconsumers will have more choices . . . We are going full speed ahead . \n. . and within a year or so we can offer [long distance] to our \nresidential and business wireline customers.''\n  And, on February 8, 1996, USWest's President of Long Distance, \nRichard Coleman, issued this statement: ``The Inter-LATA long distance \npotential is a tremendous business opportunity for USWest. Customers \nhave made it clear they want one-stop shopping for both their local and \nlong distance service. We are preparing to give them exactly what \nthey've been asking for.'' He went on to predict that USWest would meet \nthe 14 point checklist in a majority of its states within 12-18 months.\n  Ameritech's chief executive office, Richard Notebaert February 1, \n1996,\n\n[[Page S8086]]\n\nnoted his support of the 1996 Act by stating that, ``[t]he real open \ncompetition this bill promotes will bring customers more choices, \ncompetitive prices and better quality services . . . [T]his bill will \nrank as one of the most important and far-reaching pieces of federal \nlegislation passed this decade . . . It offers a comprehensive \ncommunications policy, solidly grounded in the principles of the \ncompetitive marketplace. It's truly a framework for the information \nage.''\n  Those were the statements of the local phone companies in 1996. What \nhas happened since then? The answer is very little. In fact, rather \nthan meet their promises, the local phone companies were in federal \ncourt challenging the FCC's implementation of the Act less than one \nyear after its enactment. In addition, only five applications for \nSection 271 relief have been filed at the FCC--and none have met the \nrequirements of section 271. On more than one occasion, the FCC's \ndecision to deny a 271 application has been upheld by the D.C. Circuit \nCourt. One of the regional Bell companies even challenged the \nconstitutionality of section 271--a challenge the court of appeals \ndenied and the Supreme Court refused to hear. Today, there are no 271 \napplications on file at the FCC and not a single application has been \npresented to the FCC since July 1998.\n  What this means for the customer is that the choice and the local \ncompetition we tried to create with the passage of the \nTelecommunications Act has been thwarted by the very companies that \npromised to compete. Instead, they have chosen to litigate, complain, \nand combine. Just two days ago, the Chairman of the FCC decided to \ngrant SBC and Ameritech approval to merge their operations. In \npermitting the merger to go forward, the FCC has conditioned approval \non future performance--performance which SBC has not met in the three \nyears since the passage of the 1996 Act. In fact, on the same day \nconditional approval of the SBC and Ameritech merger was announced, SBC \nagreed to pay $1.3 million to settle disputes surrounding alleged \nviolations of sections of the 1996 Act dealing with the provision of \nlong distance service. One company will now control one-third of all \naccess lines in the United States even though its market is not open to \ncompetition. Competition again becomes a casualty of the unwillingness \nof Bell companies, to open their markets and let go of their \nmonopolies.\n\n  Today, there are companies seeking to connect to the Bell networks \nand provide service to consumers. However, these companies often times \nexperience significant difficulties in obtaining access to these \nnetworks. Thus, while I applaud the efforts of the competitive local \nexchange carriers, long distance carriers, and the cable industry to \nprovide facilities-based local competition, I must express my \ndisappointment that not a single regional bell operating company has \nsufficiently opened its markets to competition.\n  Since the beginning of this Congress, many of the Bell companies have \nbeen meeting with Senators and Representatives, often accompanied by \nthe same lawyers who helped write the Telecommunications Act. But this \ntime their message is different. They are asking us to change the rules \nof the game. They now want to offer lucrative high-speed data services \nfor long distance customers without first having to open their local \nmarkets to competition. They maintain that they should be permitted to \ncontinue their hold on the local customer as they provide data services \nbecause the 1996 Act did not contemplate the provision of such \nservices. To state it plainly--they are wrong. The Telecommunications \nAct clearly contemplated the provision of advanced services--data and \notherwise. In fact, the Act had an entire section dedicated to \npromoting the development and deployment of advanced services. To quote \nthe Act, ``advanced telecommunications capability'' is defined as \n``high-speed switched, broadband telecommunications capability that \nenables users to originate and receive high-quality voice, data, \ngraphics, and video telecommunications using any technology.''\n  Regardless, nothing in the 1996 Act prevents phone companies from \nproviding high speed data services to consumers inside and outside \ntheir region. They are already providing DSL service to customers \ninside their region. And, under the 1996 Act, Bell companies can \nprovide long distance service in their region once they open their \nlocal markets. We must hold to this principle if we want consumers to \nhave a choice of service providers. In fact, a number of Bell companies \nare working to meet Section 271 requirements. I applaud those attempts \nwhich, if successful, will ultimately provide new and innovative \nservices at low prices to consumers.\n  Therefore, I reject their proposed legislative solutions, and \ninstead, forward a different proposal. By 2001, five years will have \npassed since the Telecommunications Act became law. I believe, it is \nreasonable to expect Bell companies to have at least one-half of their \nmarkets in their region open to competition by 2001 and all of their \nmarkets in their region open to competition by 2003. The legislation \nthat I introduce today accomplishs just that. My bill requires the \nFederal Communications Commission to assess a forfeiture penalty of \n$100,000 per day if a Bell operating company has not met the section \n271 checklist in at least half of the states in its region by February \n8, 2001--the five year anniversary of President Clinton signing the \nTelecommunications Act into law. Moreover, if the FCC finds that a Bell \noperating company has not met the section 271 checklist throughout its \nregion by February 8, 2003, the Commission is required to order the \ncompany to divest its telecommunications network facilities within six \nmonths, in states in which it is not in compliance with the checklist.\n  With respect to non-Bell incumbent local exchange carriers with more \nthan 5 percent of the access lines in the nation, the Commission, upon \nthe petition of any interested party, is required to investigate \nwhether the carrier's markets are open to competition to determine \nwhether such carrier has complied with the interconnection requirements \nof the Act. A determination that such an incumbent local exchange \ncompany has not opened its markets shall result in a $50,000 per day \nforfeiture penalty, to be imposed by the FCC, if the company does not \ncome into compliance within 60 days. In addition, the FCC shall order \nthe company to cease and desist in marketing and selling long distance \nservices to new customers, if it has not complied within the 60 day \ngrace period.\n  Lastly, to protect competition once the Bell companies have met the \nsection 271 checklist requirements, this bill provides the FCC with \nadditional enforcement tools. If, at some point after meeting the \nchecklist requirements, a Bell company fails to meet one or more \nprovisions of the checklist, the FCC shall impose a forfeiture penalty \nof $100,000 for each day of the continuing violation. Moreover, if, \nafter meeting the checklist requirements, the Bell company willfully, \nknowing, and repeatedly fails to meet one or more provisions of the \nchecklist, the FCC shall require the Bell company, within 180 days, to \ndivest its telecommunications network facilities in states in which the \nrepeated violations have occurred.\n  While these penalties may appear severe, severe action needs to be \ntaken to force dominant market providers to open their markets to \ncompetition. During the debate over the Telecommunications Act, we did \nnot include such a strong approach. Rather, we settled on a rational \nand reasonable set of procedures--endorsed by the local phone \nmonoplies--that provided incentives to open their local markets while \npreserving the integrity of the premier communications networks in the \nworld. That approach seemed particularly palatable in light of the \nstatements issued at the time of enactment of the 1996 Act by the local \nphone companies promising an early opening of the local phone market \npursuant to the requirements of the Section 271 checklist.\n\n  Today, our communications networks remain the envy of the world and \nthe development of innovative advanced services is accelerating \nrapidly. Unfortunately, the rollout of those services on a competitive \nbasis to all Americans is being thwarted by the failure of Bell \ncompanies to open their markets to competition. Those same monopolists \ntold us their markets\n\n[[Page S8087]]\n\nwould be open months ago. This legislation seeks to hold them to their \nword.\n  I ask consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The Telecommunications Competition Enforcement Act of 1999\n\n\n                                SUMMARY\n\n       A Bell Operating Company (BOC) is required to meet the \n     market opening requirements of the section 271 checklist of \n     the Telecommunications Act of 1996 for half of the states in \n     its region by February 8, 2001. The FCC is required to assess \n     a forfeiture penalty of $100,000 for each day a BOC is in \n     violation of this requirement.\n       A BOC is required to meet the market opening requirements \n     of the section 271 checklist of the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996 for all the states in its region by February 8, 2003. \n     The FCC is required to order a BOC to divest its \n     telecommunications network facilities within 180 days in \n     which it is in violation of this requirement.\n       Upon petition by any interested party, the FCC is directed \n     to investigate whether incumbent local exchange carriers \n     (ILEC) with more than 5 percent of the nation's access lines \n     (that are not Bell Companies) have opened their markets to \n     competition pursuant to Section 251(c) of the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n       Upon a determination that such ILECs are not in full \n     compliance with Section 251(c), the FCC shall set forth the \n     reasons for non-compliance and grant 60 days for the ILEC to \n     come into full compliance. Absent such compliance after that \n     60 day period, the FCC is required to assess a civil \n     forfeiture penalty of $50,000 for each day of the continuing \n     violation and order the company to cease and desist in \n     marketing and selling long distance services to new \n     customers.\n       If upon meeting the checklist requirements, a BOC fails to \n     meet one or more provisions of the checklist, the FCC shall \n     impose a forfeiture of $100,000 for each day of the \n     continuing violation. If upon meeting the checklist \n     requirements, the BOC knowingly, willfully, and repeatedly \n     fails to meet one or more provisions of the checklist, the \n     FCC shall require the BOC, to divest its telecommunications \n     network facilities, within 180 days, in states in which \n     repeated violations have occurred.\n\n\n                             JUSTIFICATION\n\n       The Telecommunications Act of 1996 required Bell Operating \n     Companies (BOCs) to open their markets to competition. Yet, \n     not a single BOC has met the market opening requirements of \n     the Section 271 checklist. No Section 271 applications have \n     been filed at the FCC since July of 1998. Only five \n     applications have been filed since 1996--none of which \n     complied with Section 271.\n       In the three years since enactment, however, the BOCs have \n     pursued a strategy of stonewalling and litigation that has \n     delayed implementation of the critical interconnection, \n     unbundling, collocation, and resale requirements of the Act.\n       Now, BOCs are seeking legislative relief from the pro-\n     competitive provisions of the Telecommunications Act. They \n     argue that they will provide rural America with advanced \n     communications services, but only if they are allowed to \n     provide long distance service to their current customers. The \n     truth is that BOCs can provide advanced services today. \n     However, to get into the long distance market, they must open \n     their local markets to competition. This bill provides an \n     incentive for them to do just that.\n       By requiring a date certain by which the local phone \n     monopolies must open their markets, and by accompanying that \n     requirement with federal enforcement authority, we can be \n     assured that American consumers will obtain the benefits of \n     local competition.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. DeWINE, and Mr. ROBB):\n  S. 1314. A bill to establish a grant program to assist State and \nlocal law enforcement in deterring, investigating, and prosecuting \ncomputer crimes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     computer crime enforcement act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Computer \nCrime Enforcement Act. This legislation establishes a Department of \nJustice grant program to support state and local law enforcement \nofficers and prosecutors to prevent, investigate and prosecute computer \ncrime. I am pleased that Senator DeWine, with whom I worked closely and \nsuccessfully last year on the Crime Identification Technology Act, and \nSenator Robb, who has long been a leader on law enforcement issues, \nsupport this bill as original cosponsors.\n  Computer crime is quickly emerging as one of today's top challenges \nfor state and local law enforcement officials. A recent survey by the \nFBI and the Computer Security Institute found that 62% of information \nsecurity professionals reported computer security breaches in the past \nyear. These breaches in computer security resulted in financial losses \nof more than $120 million from fraud, theft of proprietary information, \nsabotage, computer viruses and stolen laptops. Computer crime has \nbecome a multi-billion dollar problem.\n  I am proud to report that the States, including my home state of \nVermont, are reacting to the increase in computer crime by enacted \ntough computer crime control laws. For example, Vermont's new law makes \ncertain acts against computers illegal, such as: accessing any computer \nsystem or data without permission; accessing a computer to commit \nfraud, remove, destroy or copy data or deny access to the data; \ndamaging or interfering with the operation of the computer system or \ndata; and stealing or destroying any computer data or system. These \nstate laws establish a firm groundwork for electronic commerce, an \nincreasingly important sector of the Vermont economy and of the \nnation's economy. Now all fifty states have enacted some type of \ncomputer crime statute.\n  Unfortunately, too many state and local law enforcement agencies are \nstruggling to afford the high cost of enforcing their state computer \ncrime statute. The Computer Crime Enforcement Act would provide a \nhelping hand by authorizing a $25 million grant program to help the \nstates receive Federal funding for improved education, training, \nenforcement and prosecution of computer crime. Our bill will help \nstates take a byte out of computer crime.\n  Congress has recognized the importance of providing state and local \nlaw enforcement officers with the means necessary to prevent and combat \ncyber attacks and other computer crime through the FBI's Computer \nAnalysis and Response Team (CART) Program and the National \nInfrastructure Protection Center. Our legislation would enhance that \nFederal role by providing each state with much-needed resources to join \nFederal law enforcement officials in collaborative efforts to fight \ncomputer crime.\n  In Vermont, for instance, only half a dozen law enforcement officers \namong the more than 900 officers in the state have been trained in \ninvestigating computer crimes and analyzing cyber evidence. As \nDetective Michael Schirling of the Chittenden Unit for Special \nInvestigations recently observed in my home state: ``The bad guys are \nusing computers at a rate that's exponentially greater than our ability \nto respond to the problem.'' Without the necessary educational \ntraining, technical support, and coordinated information, our law \nenforcement officials will be hamstrung in their efforts to crack down \non computer crime.\n  Computers have ushered in a new age filled with unlimited potential \nfor good. But the computer age has also ushered in new challenges for \nour state and local law enforcement officers. Let's provide our state \nand local partners in crime fighting with the resources that they need \nin the battle against computer crime.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Computer Crime Enforcement Act \nand its quick passage into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Computer \nCrime Enforcement Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1314\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to permit the leasing of oil and gas rights on \ncertain lands held in trust for the Navajo Nation or allotted to a \nmember of the Navajo Nation, in any case in which there is consent from \na specified percentage interest in the parcel of land under \nconsideration for lease; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                           fractionated lands\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a bill that I have \nsent to the desk. It relates to a very serious problem faced by a large \nnumber of Navajo people in my State. The issue is referred to as \n``fractionated lands.''\n  Around the turn of the century, the Federal Government attempted to \nforce Indian people to assimilate by breaking up traditional tribal \nlands and allotting parcels of the land to individual tribal members. \nIn New Mexico, this policy created what is known as the \n``checkerboard,'' because alternating tracts of land are now owned by \nindividual Navajos, the state, the federal government, or private \nlandowners. A Navajo allotment was generally 160 acres. Under the \nallotment system, the Navajo owner was granted an undivided interest in \nthe entire parcel. The heirs of the original owner also inherit an \nundivided interest, geometrically compounding--or fractionating--the \nnumber of owners of the original 160 acres.\n  This allotment policy, coupled with other federal laws governing \nIndian land ownership, land management, and probate, have not served \nthe Navajo people well during this century. I am introducing \nlegislation today to help address this problem.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to take a few minutes to illustrate why the \nlegislation I am proposing is needed. If a Navajo was allotted a 160-\nacre parcel and had four heirs, the heirs did not inherit 40 acres each \nwhen the original owner died. Rather, each heir inherited a 25 percent \nundivided interest in the full 160-acre allotment. Going forward, when \nthe current four owners died, assuming again four heirs each, sixteen \nheirs inherited a 6.25 percent undivided interest in the allotment. The \nnext generation would result in 64 heirs each with a 1.5625 percent \nundivided interest. And so forth.\n  What makes this situation so unique is that each heir inherits an \nundivided interest in the allotment. Over time, individual owners may \ninherit tiny fractions in many different allotments around the \nreservation. In my state, there are about 4,000 individual allotments \ncovering nearly 700,000 acres. At this point, these 4,000 Navajo \nallotments have a total of 40,000 listed owners, and the number grows \nevery day. It doesn't take a Ph.D. in math to figure out what's wrong \nwith this policy.\n  Mr. President, in April I held a town meeting with Navajo allottees \nin Nageezi, New Mexico, a small chapter house in the Northeast section \nof the Navajo Reservation. The allottees talked about the serious \nproblems that fractionated ownership has caused. Over 100 members of \nthe Navajo Nation came from as far away as Aneth, Utah, to speak at the \nmeeting. As you know, the Navajo Nation extends into three states, New \nMexico, Arizona and Utah, and there are allottees living in all three \nstates.\n  Record keeping of individual land ownership has become a nightmare. \nIn many cases, owners can no longer be located. Also, ownership can be \nclouded when an owner dies without a legal will--a common situation in \nIndian Country.\n  Some individuals do not even realize they own one or more of these \nallotments. Often, individuals are surprised to find out that they are \nan heir to an allotment on another reservation.\n  Mr. President, we all recognize there are serious problems with BIA's \nmanagement of its trust responsibilities for allotted lands in New \nMexico. The management problems were brought out very clearly at a \njoint Senate hearing in March. The hearing also revealed the extent to \nwhich the government's allotment policy contributed to BIA's current \ntrust management problems.\n  On the Navajo reservation, a three-year pilot project is underway in \nFarmington, New Mexico, to try to unravel some of the management \nproblems with allotted Navajo lands. This project, called the \nFarmington Indian Minerals Office, or FIMO, is trying to cut through \nthe red tape created by three different Bureaus in the Department of \nInterior, BIA, BLM, and MMS, which share responsibility for management \nof allotted lands. The FIMO has worked hard to assist Navajo allottees \ndetermine who their fellow allottees are and what land each allottee \nowns. I support the efforts of FIMO. If this legislation is passed, \nFIMO could accomplish even more on behalf of the Navajo allottees in \nthe three states.\n  Mr. President, over the years, Congress has tried to deal with the \nproblem of fractionated lands, and has failed every time. The long \nhistory of trust management problems is not going to be corrected \nquickly. Developing and implementing a comprehensive solution is going \nto take time. The Indian Land Working Group is one of\n\n[[Page S8089]]\n\nthe leaders in this area and has submitted a proposal for Congress to \nconsider. I applaud the efforts of Senators Campbell and Inouye and the \nmembers of the Indian Affairs Committee for taking on this difficult \nissue. Some of the proposals include improved record keeping, probate \nand estate planning programs, and new processes for consolidating \nfractionated lands. I look forward to working with the Committee to \ncraft a comprehensive solution.\n  While the larger issue of fractionated ownership is being considered \nby the Senate, I believe it is appropriate to consider a stop-gap \nmeasure to help stimulate near-term economic development on \nfractionated Navajo lands. There is an abundance of oil and gas beneath \nthe Navajo allotments, yet the allottees are unable to benefit from \nthis wealth because of federal laws that make it very difficult for \nIndian allottees to lease their land. To illustrate, during the last 12 \nyears, $7 million in leasing bonuses has been paid to the state and \nfederal government for leases in the checkerboard region of New Mexico, \nwhile only $27,000 has been paid to owners of Navajo allotments.\n  The problem lies in the 1909 Mineral Leasing Act. The Act requires \nall persons who have an undivided interest in any particular parcel to \nconsent to its lease. In the case of Navajo allottees, 100 percent of \nthe allottees must consent to a lease of their land. Because of the \nfractionated land problem, obtaining 100 percent consent is often \nimpossible because many owners cannot be located. Consequently, the \nNavajo allottees are precluded from the beneficial use of their land.\n  The bill I am introducing today will facilitate the leasing of Navajo \nallotted land for oil and gas development. In the case of non-Indians, \nmost states already allow mineral leases with less than 100 percent \nconsent of the owners as long as all persons who own an interest \nreceive the benefits from the lease. My bill simply extends similar \nbenefits to Navajo allottees. The bill would authorize the Secretary of \nthe Interior to approve an oil or gas lease connected to Navajo \nallotted land when less than 100 percent of the owners consent to such \na lease. A similar bill was passed in the 105th Congress to facilitate \nmineral leasing of allotted lands on the Ft. Berthold Reservation in \nNorth Dakota.\n  My bill proposes a graded system for lease approval. In situations \nwhere there are 10 or fewer owners of an allotment, 100 percent of the \nowners must consent to a lease. However, where there exists 11 to 50 \nowners of an allotment, only 80 percent of the owners need consent. \nAnd, with more than 50 owners, 60 percent consent would be required. \nThis graded system was suggested by the Navajo allottees.\n  Mr. President, unemployment on the Navajo Reservation now exceeds 50 \npercent. The opportunities for economic development on this land are \nfew. It is not appropriate for the federal government to continue to \ndeprive the legal owners of Navajo allotted lands the option to develop \ntheir land as they choose. This bill is a small step toward correcting \nthe mistakes of the past and a bigger step towards providing economic \nprosperity for future generations of Navajo allottees.\n  The bill has the support of the Navajo Nation and the Shii Shi Keyah, \nthe principal Navajo Allottees' Association.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a resolution from the \nShii Shi Keyah Association and a letter from the Navajo Nation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Shii Shi Keyah Association Resolution of the Board of Directors\n\n       Whereas, the Board of Directors of Shii Shi Keyah \n     Association (``SSKA''), an unincorporated association of \n     Navajos who have ownership interests in allotments on or near \n     the Navajo Reservation, generally referred to as Navajo \n     Indian Country, has considered a number of issues relating to \n     oil and gas rights and revenues which require its attention;\n       Whereas, United States Senator Jeff Bingaman will introduce \n     in the 106th Congress, 1st Session, a bill which begins ``To \n     permit the leasing of oil and gas rights on certain lands in \n     New Mexico held in trust for the Navajo Tribe or allotted to \n     a member of the Navajo Tribe, in any case in which there is \n     consent from a specified percentage interest in the parcel of \n     land under consideration for issue;''\n       Be it Resolved that SSKA will support Senator Bingaman's \n     bill if it is amended to include the states of Utah and \n     Arizona.\n\n\n                             certification\n\n       The foregoing Resolution was adopted by the Board of \n     Directors of Shii Shi Keyah Association of Bloomfield, NM \n     with no votes against and no abstentions at a regular meeting \n     of the Board held on June 4, 1999.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            The Navajo Nation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 1999.\n     Re: Proposed Bill to Permit the Leasing of Oil and Gas Rights \n         on Certain Lands in New Mexico Held in Trust for the \n         Navajo Tribe or Allotted to a Member of the Navajo Tribe, \n         in any Case in which There Is Consent from a Specified \n         Percentage Interest in the Parcel of Land under \n         Consideration for Lease\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Senator Bingaman: Thank you for scheduling the April 8, \n     1999 meeting at the Nageezi Chapter. The Navajo Nation \n     appreciates your interest in the problems faced by Navajo \n     people regarding their allotted lands in northwestern New \n     Mexico.\n       The Navajo Nation supports your efforts toward solving the \n     problems engendered by increasingly fractionated interests \n     held by Navajo individuals in allotted lands. We support the \n     intent of the bill, provided that it is supported by a \n     consensus of Navajo individuals that will be affected. In \n     addition, we can support most of the particulars of the bill, \n     although the Navajo Nation would request some minor revisions \n     to the bill before it is introduced, as explained below.\n       Initially, we are concerned whether a consensus of affected \n     Navajo individuals support the proposed bill. The Navajo \n     Nation is concerned that the Shii Shi Keyah Association \n     apparently opposes the bill, as indicated in a letter to you \n     dated March 11, 1999 from the Association's attorney, Alan R. \n     Taradash, copy attached. We understand that the Shii Shi \n     Keyah Association is a respected organization comprised of \n     Navajo individuals numbering in the thousands.\n       The approach suggested by Mr. Taradash, the conveyance of \n     fractionated interests into family trusts, appears to have \n     much to commend it. However, we are not sure that the family \n     trust approach and the approach reflected in the proposed \n     bill are mutually exclusive. The Navajo Nation \n     respectfully requests that your office continue to work \n     with affected Navajo individuals to assure that the bill \n     reflects the best approach or combination of approaches to \n     solve the problems facing those individuals. The Navajo \n     Nation would be happy to work with your office in this \n     regard, and stands ready to provide any assistance your \n     office may need.\n       In addition, the Navajo Nation is very concerned with the \n     effect of section 1(b)(3)(A) of the proposed legislation, \n     which would appear to make the Navajo Nation a party to any \n     lease of oil and gas rights in allotted lands in which it \n     might own a minority interest. While the Navajo Nation has no \n     objection to any minority interest it might hold being leased \n     in accordance with the provisions of the bill, if that is the \n     approach that a consensus of affected Navajo individuals \n     support, the Navajo Nation must opposed being made a party to \n     any such lease. The Navajo Nation has very deliberate \n     policies and requirements regarding terms and conditions in \n     leases to which it is a party. In the present judicial \n     climate, lease terms and conditions can have a profound \n     effect on the sovereignty of an Indian nation. Therefore, we \n     must respectfully request that section 1(b)(3) of the bill be \n     changed to read in its entirety as follows:\n       ``(3) Effect of approval.--On approval by the Secretary \n     under paragraph (1), an oil or gas lease or agreement shall \n     be binding upon each of the beneficial owners that have \n     consented in writing to the lease or agreement and upon all \n     other parties to the lease or agreement and shall be binding \n     upon the entire undivided interest in a Navajo Indian \n     allotted land covered under the lease or agreement.''\n       Finally, the Navajo Nation respectfully requests that all \n     references to the ``Navajo Tribe'' be changed to refer to the \n     ``Navajo Nation,'' and that the reference be deleted in \n     section 1(a)(3) to the Navajo Nation as ``including the \n     Alamo, Ramah and Canoncito bands of Navajo Indians.'' The \n     Term ``Navajo Nation'' is the legal name of the Navajo \n     Nation, and by Navajo Nation statute is preferred over the \n     term ``Navajo Tribe.'' We must object to the reference to the \n     three bands (but not others) because of the possible negative \n     inference that there exists some ambiguity as to whether such \n     bands are constituent parts of the Navajo Nation. There is no \n     such ambiguity now, and we wish to avoid creating any. The \n     reference can safely be deleted without causing any \n     uncertainty in the definition.\n       Unfortunately, fractionated interests remains a significant \n     problem within the Navajo Nation, as we understand it is also \n     within our Indian nations. The Navajo Nation would like to \n     work your office and with other members of Congress on \n     comprehensive, long-term solution to this problem. If you \n     have any questions, or need additional information, please \n     contact the Navajo Nation Washington Office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Estelle J. Bowman,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n[[Page S8090]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1317. A bill to reauthorize the Welfare-to-Work program to provide \nadditional resources and flexibility to improve the administration of \nthe program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   welfare-to-work amendments of 1999\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that would \ncontinue a program vital to helping welfare recipients who face the \ngreatest barriers to finding and securing employment, called the \nWelfare-to-Work Amendments of 1999. My bill targets resources to \nfamilies and communities with the greatest need, simplifies eligibility \ncriteria for participation, and helps non-custodial parents get jobs to \nenable them to make child support payments. It also opens more \nresources to Native Americans, the homeless, those with disabilities or \nsubstance abuse problems, and victims of domestic violence. This is \nsimilar to a proposal unveiled by the Clinton Administration earlier \nthis year and introduced as H.R. 1482 by Representative Benjamin Cardin \nof Maryland. I would also like to thank my colleagues Senators \nMoynihan, Feinstein, Wellstone, Murray, and Lautenberg for joining me \nas original cosponsors of my bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter which I received \nfrom the Secretary of Labor, Alexis Herman, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Secretary of Labor,\n\n                                         Washington, July 1, 1999.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: I congratulate you on the introduction \n     of the ``Welfare-to-Work Amendments of 1999.'' I am pleased \n     that your legislation joins that introduced by Rep. Benjamin \n     Cardin earlier this year in the House in seeking to \n     accomplish the Administration's objectives in reauthorizing \n     the Welfare-to-Work (WtW) Grants Program. President Clinton \n     and I believe the Welfare-to-Work Grants Program is a key \n     component of the overall welfare reform effort. While welfare \n     caseloads have declined by nearly half over the last six \n     years, many individuals remaining on welfare are long-term \n     recipients who face significant barriers to employment. As \n     the President said in his April 10th radio address, ``We \n     can't finish the job of welfare reform without doing more to \n     help people who have the hardest time moving from welfare to \n     work--those who live in the poorest neighborhoods and have \n     the poorest job skills. That's why I call on Congress to pass \n     my plan to extend the Department of Labor's Welfare-to-Work \n     program.''\n       This legislation incorporates the President's proposal to \n     extend the WtW Program, reflecting key suggestions the \n     Administration has received from State and local service \n     providers since the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997. The WtW program funds job creation, job placement, and \n     job retention efforts to help long-term welfare recipients \n     and non-custodial parents move into lasting, unsubsidized \n     employment. In addition to helping long-term welfare \n     recipients make the transition from welfare to work, this \n     bill will help more low-income fathers increase their \n     employment and their involvement with their children. Demand \n     for WtW has been great. Last year, over 1,400 applicants from \n     local communities across the nation applied for more than $5 \n     billion in WtW Competitive Grants, but DOL had sufficient \n     resources to fund less than 10 percent of these projects. In \n     addition, 44 states covering 95 percent of the welfare \n     caseload applied for formula funds. While the fundamental \n     principles and features of the program are maintained \n     (including the focus on work, targeting resources to \n     individuals and communities with the greatest need, and \n     administration through the locally administered, business-led \n     workforce investment system) we are also pleased to see the \n     principles of the original legislation further carried out by \n     the addition of the following enhancements:\n       A simplification of eligibility criteria which continues to \n     focus on long-term welfare recipients but provides that at \n     least one, rather than two, specified barriers to employment \n     must be met.\n       The provisions of even greater flexibility to serve those \n     with the greatest challenges to employment by the addition of \n     long-term welfare recipients who are victims of domestic \n     violence, individuals with disabilities, or homeless as \n     eligible to participate.\n       A strong focus on the family by targeting at least 20 \n     percent of the WtW Formula Grant funds to help noncustodial \n     parents (mainly fathers) with children who are on or have \n     exhausted Temporary Assistance to Needy Families fulfill \n     their responsibilities to their children by committing to \n     work and pay child support.\n       An increase in the reserve for grants to Indian tribes from \n     the current 1 percent of the total to 3 percent, and an \n     authorization for Indian tribes to apply directly to the \n     Department of Labor for WtW Competitive Grants.\n       A procedure which allows unallotted formula funds to be \n     used to award competitive grants in the subsequent year, \n     providing a preference in awarding these funds to those local \n     applicants and tribes from States that did not receive \n     formula grants.\n       The development of streamlined reporting requirements \n     through the Department of Labor.\n       The establishment of a one percent reserve of Fiscal Year \n     2000 funds for technical assistance which includes sharing of \n     innovative and promising practices and strategies for serving \n     noncustodial parents.\n       In addition to the changes proposed by the Administration, \n     the legislation also provides for:\n       The inclusion of children aging out of foster care as \n     eligible service recipients and\n       The addition of job skills training and vocational \n     educational training.\n       While our welfare reform efforts have resulted in some \n     important early successes, much remains to be done. \n     Reauthorizing the WtW program, together with the \n     Administration's proposals to provide welfare-to-work housing \n     vouchers, transportation funds, and employer tax credits, \n     will provide parents the tools they need to support their \n     children and succeed in the workforce. Your introduction of \n     the ``Welfare-to-Work Amendments of 1999'' provides \n     significant opportunities to hard-to-employ welfare \n     recipients to make the transition to stable employment and \n     assist noncustodial parents in making meaningful \n     contributions to their children's well-being. I applaud and \n     support your efforts.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that it has no \n     objection to the transmittal of this report from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Alexis M. Herman.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I quote from that letter to me.\n\n       President Clinton and I believe the Welfare-to-Work Grants \n     Program is a key component of the overall welfare reform \n     efforts.\n\n  Mr. President, the Welfare-to-Work program has helped numerous \nwelfare parents--both custodial and non-custodial--find and keep jobs \nthat pay a living wage and allow them to fulfill basic obligations to \ntheir children. Children have fundamental needs for food, shelter, and \nclothing, yet many parents find themselves barely scraping by, in order \nto obtain these things. Many families are unable to go much beyond the \nessentials to enroll their children in sports and other activities that \nbuild strong bodies and social skills, or to provide them with decent \nschool supplies, books or computers to develop strong minds. Most \nfamilies take these things for granted because they live without the \nanxiety of wondering when the next paycheck or child support payment \nmight be coming in. They have the finances to pay for child care to \nenable parents to work during the day. They have cars or other access \nto transportation that will take them to work every morning. Or they \nhave a telephone so that they may receive calls for job interviews. The \nfamilies that cannot make ends meet continue to live in dire need and \nfind their children living at risk.\n  Mr. President, 14.5 million American children live in poverty. \nFurthermore, as reported in Kids Count 1999, 32 percent of children do \nnot live with two parents and 19 percent live in a home where the head \nof household is a high school dropout. Twenty-one percent of children \nare in families with incomes below the poverty line, 28 percent are \nliving with a parent or parents lacking steady full-time employment, \nand 15 percent do not have health insurance. It is a shame that, in the \nmost prosperous nation in the world, we continue to be faced with these \ndismal statistics for our children--young Americans who hold the \npromise of this country's future in their hands.\n  Many of these children were helped when the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997 created the Welfare-to-Work program as a new system for providing \nassistance to welfare recipients most in need. This followed on the \nheels of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \nReconciliation Act of 1996, which replaced the Aid to Families with \nDependent Children cash assistance program with the Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.\n  The 1996 welfare reform law addressed the bulk of the welfare \npopulation but lacked a component to help the hardest to employ welfare \nrecipients. Thus, Welfare-to-Work was passed to assist this population \nfind jobs and achieve independence so they no longer\n\n[[Page S8091]]\n\nwould need public support. The Welfare-to-Work program became an \nessential component of the Administration's welfare reform effort by \nproviding recipients with a good alternative to welfare.\n  Since 1996, the number of people in the system dropped by a record \nnumber: forty percent from a peak of about five million families in \n1994 down to three million families as of June, 1998, according to the \nGeneral Accounting Office. However, the job is not finished. Welfare-\nto-Work is needed now more than ever because those remaining on the \nrolls are increasing likely to have multiple barriers to employment \nsuch as poor work experience, inadequate English or computer skills, or \nsubstance abuse problems.\n  We need to invest much more to help these individuals reach self-\nsufficiency than we did in those who have already left welfare-these \nindividuals might have already had an educational record, special \nskills or significant family support behind them to help them to their \nfeet. In contrast, Welfare-to-Work participants are the welfare \nrecipients who need the most help. In addition, extending Welfare-to-\nWork will become even more important when TANF recipients and their \nchildren reach welfare time limits in 19 states by year's end and have \ntheir benefits reduced or completely removed.\n  These are the hard luck cases, Mr. President. These are the people \nwho continue to be left out of the economic boom of the 1990s. And \nthese are the people whom Welfare-to-Work was designed to help. If we \nlet the program expire this year, even if states have three years from \nthe date of award to spend their program funds, we will be saying to \nthese people, ``We've forgotten the promises we made to you in 1996 \nthat we would continue to help you. Now, there is no more help for \nyou.''\n  This would be particularly harmful in my state of Hawaii which has \nstruggled due to the Asian financial crisis and has been the only state \nwhere welfare rolls have increased. Welfare-to-Work has assisted many \nof Hawaii's welfare recipients through this period of financial \nhardship for the state by helping them find unsubsidized employment. \nThe program must be extended so that it may help other recipients and \ntheir families in my beleaguered state.\n  My bill not only extends the Welfare-to-Work program, but it also \nmakes a number of important improvements to the program that states, \ncounties, and cities have requested. Currently, most funds allocated to \nWelfare-to-Work state formula grants cannot be used because of \neligibility criteria that are difficult to meet. Currently, an \nindividual must have been receiving assistance for at least 30 months \nor must be within 12 months of reaching the maximum period for \nassistance. In addition, they must have two of three characteristics, \nincluding: lacks a high school diploma or GED and has low math or \nreading skills; has a poor work history; or requires substance abuse \ntreatment for employment. These criteria have excluded many TANF \napplicants who, for instance, may have a GED or high school diploma but \nstill cannot read; these criteria have proven unrealistic.\n\n  Instead, under my bill, criteria would be changed to require \nparticipants to have one out of seven characteristics: lacks a high \nschool diploma or GED; has English reading writing, or computer skills \nat or below the 8th grade level; has a poor work history; requires \nsubstance abuse treatment for employment; is homeless; has a \ndisability; or is a victim of domestic violence. This revision in \neligibility criteria would allow the program to better match the \nparticipant pool. It is necessary because current criteria have left \nmore than 90 percent of Welfare-to-Work state formula grants unspent. \nIn Hawaii alone, only 37 percent of our TANF recipients have been \neligible to participate in the program, and this figure would double \nunder my bill. Furthermore, officials of the Hawaii Department of Human \nServices which administers TANF and Welfare-to-Work in my state predict \nthat unless the Federal law is changed, it is unlikely that they will \nbe able to refer clients in sufficient numbers to meet WtW \nexpectations. Similar situations exist in all states, and these \ncriteria revisions respond to State and local entities that have been \ndoing the work of Welfare-to-Work and want to serve as many \nparticipants as possible. In Texas, 21,000 people would be able to \nparticipate in the program, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. \nUnder my bill, figures like this could be seen across the nation, and \nmore people in need would be able to find employment.\n  A related improvement contained in my bill is that it transfers any \nunallocated Welfare-to-Work formula grant funds into the competitive \ngrant program. This competitive grant program has been tremendously \npopular.\n  Out of the 1400 applications submitted requesting a total of $5 \nbillion, only 126 applications for $470 million in funds were awarded \nin FY 1998. This portion of Welfare-to-Work needs more funding. Under \nmy bill, preference is given to grant applications submitted from \nstates that did not receive a formula grant.\n  Mr. President, my bill also provides a re-emphasis on the whole \nfamily. This past Father's Day, I had the opportunity to celebrate with \nseveral of my children and their families, as it was a day to celebrate \nand honor the family. However, many fathers were not as fortunate as \nmyself and were not able to celebrate with their children because they \nwent through divorce and did not receive custody of the children. Even \nworse, many of these fathers are dismissively labeled ``dead beat \ndads'' because they are not a presence in their children's lives and do \nnot pay child support. What we have found, Mr. President, is that many \nof these fathers do not want to abandon their children. Rather, they \nare ``dead broke dads'' and face the same barriers to finding and \nholding employment that many welfare mothers do. This prevents them \nfrom fulfilling child support obligations, which many want to do. If \nthese fathers can provide for their children, they will be more likely \nto see them more often. Hopefully, renewed financial and emotional \ninvolvement of fathers will mean that these children's lives will \nimprove.\n  For these non-custodial fathers, my bill will make it easier for them \nto participate in Welfare-to-Work. Currently, non-custodial parents \nface the same problems in attempting to qualify for Welfare-to-Work as \nother applicants because of the same overly-restrictive criteria. Under \nmy bill, the eligibility requirements for non-custodial parents will be \nrevised to allow them to demonstrate that they are unemployed, \nunderemployed, or having difficulty paying child support payments. In \naddition, at least one of the following characteristics must apply to \nthe minor child or non-custodial parent: the child or non-custodial \nparent has been on public assistance for over 30 months, or is within \n12 months of becoming ineligible for TANF due to a time limit; the \nchild is receiving or eligible for TANF; the child has left TANF within \nthe past year; or the child is receiving or is eligible for \nfood stamps, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicaid, or the \nChildren's Health Improvement Program (CHIP).\n\n  The bill increases funding for non-custodial parents by requiring \nthat at least 20 percent of state formula funds be used for this \npopulation. The bill also provides that a non-custodial parent will \nenter into an individual responsibility contract with the service \nprovider and state agency to say that he or she will cooperate in the \nestablishment of paternity and in the establishment or modification of \na child support order, make regular child support payments, and find \nand hold a job. These revisions are an attempt to permit and encourage \nnon-custodial parents to provide for their children, become more \ninvolved in their children's lives, and pursue better lives for \nthemselves and their families.\n  Mr. President, Native American communities will benefit from my bill \nfrom a doubling of the Native American set-aside from $15 million to \n$30 million. This funding increase in necessary because Native \nAmericans currently receive one percent of the total Welfare-to-Work \nfunds but serve 3.2 percent of total program participants, according to \na recent U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Welfare-to-Work \nEvaluation. In recognition of their sovereignty, the bill also provides \nNative American tribes with flexibility in designing programs that are \neffective for their territories. It is a gross understatement to say \nthat our Native\n\n[[Page S8092]]\n\nAmerican communities have not had the chance to experience the economic \nsuccess that our nation has been enjoying. We must do what we can to \nmake up for this shortfall, fulfill our Federal responsibilities to \nNative Americans, and help families and children in Native American \ncommunities who face obstacles to self-sufficiency.\n  Mr. President, children who leave foster care at age 18 make up \nanother hard-to-help population that faces numerous barriers to \nemployment. My bill introduces new support for these individuals when \nthey attempt to start out on their own by allowing them to take \nadvantage of Welfare-to-Work programs. According to DOL, 20,000 \nchildren leave foster care annually. Of these, 32 to 40 percent receive \nsome type of government assistance within the first 18 months after \nleaving the foster care system. This bill provides funds to help them \nfind alternatives to welfare as they leave their state care system.\n\n  My bill simplifies Welfare-to-Work reporting requirements so that the \nprogram can be evaluated effectively. This evaluation will allow \nCongress and DOL access to better statistics on how the program is \nperforming nationwide. In addition, one-percent of the funds are \nprovided for technical assistance so that DOL can ensure cooperation \nbetween states, local governments, TANF and child support agencies, and \ncommunity-based organizations so that all are able to work together and \nbe better able to provide services to those who are in need.\n  Finally, the bill eases Welfare-to-Work's ``work first'' requirements \nthat mean that TANF recipients must find jobs first, before they are \nable to take advantage of stand-alone programs such as job training, \nbasic education or vocational education programs. My bill would \ndesignate these as allowable work activities under Welfare-to-Work. \nThis change is in response to requests from states who want to use \nprogram funds to better prepare recipients for the workforce before \nsending them off to a job. This approach seeks to improve TANF \nrecipients' chances at maintaining steady employment.\n  Although my colleagues may have disagreed on welfare reform in the \npast, Welfare-to-Work is a program that all should be able to support. \nIt represents a Federal-state-local partnership, as well as a \npartnership between government, private industry, and community-based \norganizations. It encourages people to take responsibility for \nthemselves, find work, and contribute to their families and society in \na meaningful way. We cannot abandon these welfare recipients who are \nthe most difficult to employ and must instead invest in them in a way \nthat will help them find jobs paying a living wage, become self-\nsufficient, and allow them to break out of the cycle of dependency on \npublic assistance.\n  I would again like to thank my colleagues Senators Moynihan, \nFeinstein, Wellstone, Murray, and Lautenberg for joining me as original \ncosponsors of my bill, and I urge other colleagues to join us in \nsupporting this important Welfare-to-Work reauthorization bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Grams, Mr. Sarbanes, \n        and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 1318. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to award grants to States to supplement State and local \nassistance for the preservation and promotion of affordable housing \nopportunities for low-income families; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n              affordable housing preservation act of 1999\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nwith Senator Kerry, Senator Grams, and Senator Wellstone the Affordable \nHousing Preservation Act of 1999.\n  My work on this bill began several weeks ago out of discussions with \nVermont housing advocates and private section 8 property owners, and as \nwell as with Senator Allard, Senator Grams and Senator Gramm during \nconsideration of the Financial Modernization bill. We all acknowledge \nthat this issue has rapidly become a serious national problem--one \nwhere thousands of low income elderly, disabled, and families with \nchildren are increasingly unable to afford privately-owned low income \nhousing units.\n  Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo and Commissioner \nApgar recently took the step of exercising authority provided by \nCongress to use additional vouchers to stem the tide of Section 8 opt \nouts and prepayments. The Affordable Housing Preservation Act will \nprovide a more permanent solution to this crisis.\n  The Jeffords/Kerry Affordable Housing Preservation Act will provide a \nlongterm solution by building on local partnerships between non-\nprofits, state and local governments, and private landlords to keep \nexisting projects available for low income tenants. The bill preserves \nexisting low income projects, as well as increase the units to expand a \ntight housing marketplace through new acquisition and rehabilitation.\n  In Vermont rents have increased 11 percent over the past three years, \nmaking it increasingly difficult to find affordable shelter. To make \nmatters worse, the lack of low income housing makes it simply \nimpossible to find a place to live in areas like Burlington, where the \nvacancy rate is less than one percent.\n  The need to preserve existing housing from opt outs and prepayments \nis only exceeded by the need to expand the number of housing units for \nlow-income families, elderly and disabled. The affect of more Section 8 \nvouchers is undermined when there is nowhere to use them. On any given \nday in Burlington there are just 60 available rental units in a city of \nmore than 40,000 people.\n  In such circumstances, low income families cannot even find a place \nto live, much less find one that's affordable. This problem has been a \nkey factor in increasing homelessness, as families seeking help from \nBurlington's emergency shelter rose over 60 percent between 1997 and \n1998.\n  As Section 8 federal subsidies come up for renewal more often, the \nrisk of opt outs by private landlords increases. Housing projects in \nBrattleboro and Montpelier currently face opt out situations where \nlandlords will raise rents to levels that Section 8 tenants cannot \nafford.\n  The Affordable Housing Preservation Act will build foundations for \ncooperation where efforts to raise public and private money are \nenhanced through federal matching grants. Vermont's community based \nnon-profit organizations have achieved much success by encouraging \nprivate landlords seeking to exit the affordable housing business to \ntransfer ownership to these groups.\n  Although ``sticky vouchers'' provide much needed short term relief, \nthe Affordable Housing Preservation Act offers a long term solution to \nthe opt out and prepayment problem by expanding community-based housing \npreservation and acquisition initiatives. This bill will give hope by \nproviding help for those elderly, disabled, and families facing \neviction or homelessness.\n  I look forward to working with the Chairmen and Members of the \nHousing Committees in the Senate and House to fix this problem and \nprovide a new direction for the nation in affordable housing.\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am pleased to have worked with \nSenator Jeffords to draft the legislation we are introducing today, the \nAffordable Housing Preservation Act of 1999. The legislation will \nestablish a matching grant program that provides money to states and \nlocalities that are willing to put up some of their own funds for the \npurposes of preserving affordable housing. In order to receive a grant \nunder this program, the owner would have to commit to maintaining the \nexisting affordability restrictions for a minimum of 15 years.\n  In addition, the legislation will encourage transfer of ownership of \nthese properties to non-profit housing corporations that work closely \nwith residents. We believe that non-profit ownership will, in the long \nrun, ensure the maximum possible commitment to affordability at the \nlowest possible cost. The current ownership structure for assisted \nhousing constantly puts us in this bind of having to provide more and \nmore money just to keep what we have already built and paid for. With \nnon-profits, we will not face the constant dilemma of opt-outs, \nprepayments or expiring affordability restrictions. Nonetheless, \nprivate owners who want to continue to provide affordable housing will \nbe eligible under this bill.\n\n[[Page S8093]]\n\n  I appreciate the efforts of Senator Jeffords in facing this problem \nhead-on. We are facing an increasing crisis in affordable housing. \nIronically, this crisis worsens as the strong economy pushes rents ever \nhigher, out of the reach of many working Americans and the poor. This \nlegislation will help us preserve this crucial affordable housing \nresource.\n  In the long run, however, preservation of affordable housing, while \nnecessary, won't solve the problem facing millions of American \nfamilies. The real problem in many cities around the country is that \nthere is not enough production of new housing. We need to find ways to \nfund the construction of new, affordable, multifamily housing for low \nincome and working families, and we need to fund the 100,000 additional \nvouchers we authorized in last year's public housing bill. This is not \njust a poor person's issue. In many states around the country--\nMassachusetts, Nevada, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Alaska, and \nothers--a family would need to work as many as three full time jobs at \n$7 per hour, well above the minimum wage, just to afford the rent on a \ntypical 2 bedroom apartment. This is unsustainable economically, and it \nis simply not fair.\n  In sum, Mr. President, the Jeffords-Kerry bill builds effectively on \nefforts HUD is taking to save existing housing stock. Now, we need to \nprovide the funding to make sure these efforts can move forward, as we \nconsider longer term solutions in the months ahead.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 1319. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to renew project-based contracts for assistance under \nsection 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 at up to market rent \nlevels, in order to preserve these projects as affordable low-income \nhousing, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                        save my home act of 1999\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I stand before you today to introduce \nthe Save My Home Act of 1999. This legislation is intended to provide a \nblueprint for HUD to address the problem of owners opting out of the \nsection 8 program by not renewing their section 8 project-based \ncontracts. This is a housing crisis. In my state of Missouri alone, \nsection 8 contracts on over 23,000 units will expire over the next 5 \nyears. Nationwide, section 8 contracts on over 14,000 multifamily \nhousing projects with over 1 million units will expire over the same \nperiod of time.\n  The ``Save My Home Act of 1999'' will restate and reemphasize the \nneed for HUD to use its best efforts to renew all expiring section 8 \nproject-based contracts. The bill also provides new authority for \nsection 8 enhanced or ``sticky'' vouchers to ensure that families in \nhousing for which owners do not renew their section 8 contracts will be \nable to continue to live in their housing with the Federal government \npicking up the additional rental costs of the unit. The use of sticky \nvouchers is intended as a last resort. HUD must push for the renewal of \nthe section 8 project-based contracts first. The bill also focuses on \nappraisals so that the cost of this housing reflects the true market \nvalue of the rental units. This has been a huge problem and will \ncontinue to be a problem until HUD develops the capacity and expertise \nto appraise adequately these multifamily housing projects.\n  This legislation is needed because HUD has, until recently, refused \nto renew section 8 project-based contracts at market levels. In \nresponse to this policy, many owners of this housing have refused to \nrenew their section 8 contracts and the housing has been converted to \nmarket rate housing and lost as affordable, low-income housing \ninventory. This means that the assisted low-income families in this \nhousing often have to move because the new rents will be too high for \nthe section 8 rental subsidies. This is a huge problem, especially for \nthe elderly and for persons with disabilities who have come to see this \nhousing as their homes.\n\n  And this has become a crisis. For example, according to the National \nHousing Trust, during 1998 alone, owners of 219 properties with some \n25,488 units section 8 units voluntarily opted out of receiving federal \nrental subsidies under the section 8 project-based program. Moreover, \nit has been estimated that we are losing another 3,000 section 8 units \na month because of HUD's inaction. I wish we had better numbers but HUD \nis not providing us or the housing advocates with this information, and \nit is not clear that HUD even has this information.\n  However, I do want to be clear about the parameters of section 8 opt-\nout crisis. HUD currently has the legal authority to renew expiring \nsection 8 contracts at the market rent, but has failed to implement \nthis authority. Congress in the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and \nAffordability Act of 1997, as enacted on October 27, 1997 in the VA/HUD \nFY 1998 Appropriations bill, provided HUD with the authority to renew \nsection 8 contracts up to the rental market level. This was almost 2 \nyears ago, and HUD has only announced recently a renewal policy that it \nhas not yet been able to implement. And despite press releases to the \ncontrary, I am not convinced that HUD intends to renew these contracts \nexcept with an additional push from the Congress.\n  I also want to be clear about funding. HUD has enough funds to pay \nfor section 8 contract renewals, even though HUD would have you believe \notherwise. In particular, HUD has at least $2 billion in the Housing \nCertificate fund in excess of what is needed for renewing all expiring \nsection 8 contracts this year. Instead of committing any of these funds \nfor the renewal of section 8 project-based contracts, HUD has dedicated \nthese funds as part of its FY 2000 budget for general section 8 \ncontract renewals. Nevertheless, this money is available now and can be \nused to renew these expiring section 8 contracts. The real problem is \nthat HUD does not have the ``will'' or ``commitment'' to fund these \ncontracts. In fact, the biggest problem is commitment because you \ncannot legislate commitment. We need to find a way to make HUD renew \nthese section 8 project-based contracts.\n  HUD's lack of commitment to section 8 project-based housing has been \na problem through this Administration. From the start, both HUD and the \nAdministration have had a stated policy of opposing section 8 project-\nbased assistance in favor of vouchers. And this is true whether we are \ntalking about elderly housing, housing for persons with disabilities, \nor housing that is located in very low vacancy areas, such as rural \nareas where there is no available housing or high-cost urban areas like \nBoston and San Francisco. This has been a problem in the past with the \nSection 202 program and with the Mark-to-Market inventory.\n  One final point is that I know there is interest in both the House \nand Senate in funding a grant program to assist in the sale of section \n8 projects to nonprofits and tenant groups. While I support the concept \nof selling section 8 projects to nonprofits and tenant groups, I am \ntroubled by the thought of buying projects that the Federal Government \nhas already paid for several times over. This program sounds like \nanother reiteration of the preservation program which we misguidedly \nfunded over several years through the VA/HUD Appropriations \nSubcommittee, resulting in fraud and abuse as we vastly overpaid the \nvalue of these projects when we could have been using those funds for \nmore fiscally responsible, affordable housing purposes.\n  I look forward to working with interested Members of Congress on \nthese very important issues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 1320. A bill to provide to the Federal land management agencies \nthe authority and capability to manage effectively the Federal lands \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n      PUBLIC LANDS PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today represents \na significant modification of S. 1253, which I introduced in the last \nCongress. This effort represents a large body of work--both oversight \nand legislative--to modernize the laws governing our stewardship over \nfederally-owned, multiple-use lands.\n  For those of you who have just tuned in, this bill is the result of \n15 oversight hearings that my Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land \nManagement held during the 104th Congress. These hearings involved over \n200 witnesses,\n\n[[Page S8094]]\n\nrepresenting all points of view, and reviewing all aspects of the \nmanagement of the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands. \nThe overwhelming conclusion from all of these witnesses--developers and \nenvironmentalists alike, public and private sector employees alike--was \nthat the statutes governing federal land management--the 1976 Federal \nLand and Policy Management Act and the 1976 National Forest Management \nAct--are antiquated, and in need of updating. These statutes were \npassed by Congress in the mid-1970s to help solve land management \nproblems. Today, they are a large part of the problem.\n  I look at laws as ``tools'' for use by professional land managers and \nresource scientists that help establish priorities and make management \ndecisions. These two tools are as antiquated as the slide-rule and \ncomputer punch cards that were the tools used by land managers at the \ntime that these statutes were passed.\n  As a consequence of this oversight review during the 104th Congress, \nand subsequent oversight hearings since, I drafted S. 1253 and \ncirculated it at the outset of the 105th Congress. That draft, and the \nsubsequently-introduced bill were, in turn, the subject of six informal \nworkshops and another eight formal, legislative hearings to review the \nconcepts embodied in both the first draft and the introduced version of \nS. 1253. The ideas that emanated from the oversight hearings were \nmodified to reflect the suggestions of witnesses, and in recognition of \nhow resource management problems have subsequently evolved.\n  Also, during the course of the last eighteen months, we have held \nadditional hearings, reviewed subsequent correspondence, and enjoyed \nadditional dialogue about how to best modify the 1976 statutes. For \ninstance, we held one hearing where all four of the former Chiefs of \nthe Forest Service and one former Bureau of Land Management Director \nshared their views about the current state of federal land management, \nand where legislative action could assist their successors in \ndischarging the public trust more effectively.\n  During this time period there has been at least one seminal decision \nfrom the Supreme Court.  In Ohio Forestry Association versus Glickman, \nthe Supreme Court has, in my view, significantly devalued the \nimportance of the land management planning process authorized under the \nNational Land Management Act, and probably FLPMA as well. In that \ndecision, the Court denied standing to challenge resource management \nplans, essentially on the basis that no real decisions are made. While \nproperly decided on the basis of existing law, I believe that decision \nproduced the wrong result insofar as effective resource planning is \nconcerned. The bill I am introducing today would explicitly set a new \ncourse, reversing the effect of this decision in order to make resource \nmanagement plans more meaningful documents. In various other ways of a \nless significant nature, the bill I am introducing today also reflects \nthe product of court decisions that have been rendered during the \nperiod that we have been reviewing these issues.\n\n  The bill that I am introducing today is also the direct result of \nfour important pieces of information. Let me describe each of these in \nturn.\n  First, we held an extraordinary pair of hearings with the President \nof the Wilderness Society as the sole witness. These hearings were \nsignificant in the sense that we were not limited to the usual, five-\nto-ten minute exchange to communicate with one another. Instead, we \nactually discussed the Wilderness Society's concerns and views about \nNational Forest management for several hours.\n  Second and equally important was the assistance provided by the \nSociety of American Foresters. The Society laudably took on the task of \nappointing a working group of resource scientists and professionals to \nreview the current state of federal land management and the proposals \nthat we made in the last Congress, and to offer suggestions for \nimprovement. I commend their report as an authoritative guide to needed \nchanges in the current system. Most notably, the Society is emphatic, \nas am I, that many, if not most, of the problems that plague federal \nland management today can be resolved only through a cooperative effort \nbetween the Administration and Congress to produce a revised \nlegislative charter for the land managing agencies.\n  Third, we were in many important respects guided by Secretary of \nAgriculture, Dan Glickman's, Committee of Scientists Report, also \nissued earlier this year. I commend this report to the attention of \nSenators as well. In many areas, we find ourselves in agreement with \nthe Committee of Scientists, particularly with regard to defining a new \nmission for the Forest Service. We would submit that this is needed for \nthe Bureau of Land Management as well--even though that was beyond the \nCommittee's charter. One area where the Committee's views are unclear \nis whether or not these improvements can be made exclusively through \nthe rule-making process. The Committee seems to be of two minds about \nthis. It is clear to us that the kinds of changes the Committee seeks \ncannot be accomplished through regulation. They must involve \nfundamental statutory changes to the agencies' missions. Any other path \nis, in our view, doomed to failure.\n  Finally, we were informed at the time of the Administration's budget \nsubmission that the Administration would be sending forward a series of \nseven important legislative proposals governing federal land \nmanagement. We were pleased that the Administration had at last come to \nthe conclusion that legislative changes are necessary. This has been a \nsource of intense dialogue between myself, Secretary Glickman, \nUndersecretary Lyons, and others in the Administration for more than \ntwo years. Given this recognition on their part, we felt duty-bound to \nwait for these proposals before going forward. In the bill I am \nintroducing today, we have adopted, in pertinent part, five of the \nAdministration's seven legislative proposals. A sixth proposal is the \nsubject of a separate piece of legislation that was introduced in the \nHouse yesterday (HR 2389). I am working on a companion Senate bill to \nintroduce shortly. Thus, I found the Administration's proposals \nsomething that I could agree with, and want to be responsive to.\n\n  So, my work product is the result of a number of sources of \ninformation. It has taken at least six months longer to produce than I \nanticipated it would, but in the interest of: (1) securing the advice \nof Secretary Glickman's Committee of Scientists; (2) evaluating the \nSociety of American Foresters' report; and (3) being responsive to the \nAdministration's legislative proposals, I believe the wait was \nworthwhile.\n  We will now move forward with additional hearings on this proposal \nconfident that we are on the correct path to improve the quality of \nfederal land management and, through a variety of means, increase \npublic support for the future management of our federal forest lands.\n  We invite both the Administration and Members on both sides of the \naisle to join us in this effort. We move forward knowing that this \nproposal, like any other, is a working draft that will by necessity \nchange, probably significantly, as we move forward.\n  However, we also move forward knowing that legislative change in this \narea is both inevitable and vital. It is clear to me that this area of \npublic discourse vitally needs a vibrant legislative debate and a new \nlegislative charter so that our federal land managers can be provided \nwith tools a little more modern than the slide-rule and mainframe \ncomputer punch cards.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Section-by-Section Description--Public Lands Planning and Management \n                        Improvement Act of 1999\n\n       Sec. 1. Short Title; Table of Contents.--This legislation--\n     ``Public Lands Planning and Management Improvement Act of \n     1999''--provides new authority and gives greater \n     responsibility and accountability to the Forest Service, \n     Department of Agriculture, and Bureau of Land Management \n     (BLM), Department of the Interior, for planning and \n     management of federal lands under their jurisdiction. The two \n     statutes governing the agencies' land planning and \n     management--the National Forest Management Act (NFMA) and the \n     Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA)--are now more \n     than two decades old; this legislation preserves those laws' \n     policies and requirements while it updates those laws to \n     reflect\n\n[[Page S8095]]\n\n     the agencies' subsequent performance and experience.\n       The need for new statutory authority is one of the \n     principal findings of a recent report on the planning and \n     management of national forest and BLM lands commissioned by \n     the Society of American Foresters (SAF), entitled Forest of \n     Discord: Options for Governing our National Forests and \n     Federal Public Lands. The report states that ``new \n     legislation seems the best approach for improving federal \n     land management * * * Because the problems that exist are \n     both serious and complex, the problems cannot be resolved \n     through regulatory reform or through the appropriations \n     process. Rather, new legislation is warranted.''\n       The first version of this bill was introduced as S. 1253 on \n     October 3, 1997. Since then the Energy and Natural Resources \n     Committee has devoted significant attention to the \n     legislation. It has been the subject of 8 hearings and 6 \n     workshops, including one hearing in which 4 former chiefs of \n     the Forest Service and one former director of the BLM spoke \n     about the need for legislation to modernize the existing \n     statutory base for federal land planning and managing, and \n     analyzed this bill through the prisms of their experiences as \n     agency heads, and two hearings in which the President of the \n     Wilderness Society provided an in depth critique of the \n     bill's provisions. Toward the end of 1998, the legislation \n     was substantially altered to accommodate numerous useful \n     suggestions of, and to remedy a number of concerns raised by, \n     the many witnesses.\n       In the Spring of 1999, two important documents were \n     published: (1) the SAF-commissioned critique of Forest \n     Service and BLM planning and management and call for \n     legislation, authored by prominent academics, state \n     foresters, consultants, federal officials, and private \n     forestland managers; and (2) the report of the Committee of \n     Scientists appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture to \n     provide advice in the course of a new rulemaking governing \n     Forest Service planning, Sustaining the People's Lands: \n     Recommendations for Stewardship of the National Forests and \n     Grasslands into the Next Century. This bill was redrafted \n     again before its introduction to incorporate many suggestions \n     and concepts from these two landmark documents. As a result \n     of the two rewrites, this legislation is significantly \n     different from, and reflects a much broader array of views \n     and ideas than did, its predecessor in the 105th Congress.\n       Sec. 2. Findings.--This section contains numerous findings \n     which explain the need for this legislation. Many of these \n     findings are shared by the Committee of Scientists and SAF \n     reports, and the language of the most prominent findings cite \n     those documents. The findings--\n       Note the widespread public support for the twin principles \n     of federal land management--multiple use and sustained \n     yield--imposed on Forest Service lands in NFMA and on BLM \n     lands in FLPMA.\n       Recognize that NFMA and FLPMA, enacted in 1976, established \n     resource management planning processes as the means to apply \n     these land management principles to the federal lands.\n       State that, in the 2 decades since the enactment of NFMA \n     and FLPMA, fundamental flaws in the planning processes have \n     been exposed, to the dissatisfaction of all stakeholders.\n       Find that these flaws threaten the planning and management \n     decisionmaking processes and undermine the agencies' ability \n     to fulfill their statutory land management responsibilities \n     and to accomplish management that is well grounded in \n     science.\n       Note that Congress' desire for planning to be completed \n     within discrete time frames and to provide secure management \n     guidance has not been achieved.\n       Describe how planning has yet to be completed 2 decades \n     after the enactment of NFMA and FLPMA, and how the Forest \n     Service and BLM are now engaged in an apparently perpetual \n     planning cycle that deprives both the agencies and the public \n     of stable and predictable management of federal lands.\n       State that the two levels of planning contemplated and \n     required by NFMA and FLPMA have been expanded by the agencies \n     and the courts to include various planning exercises on \n     multiple, often conflicting, broader and narrower planning \n     scales that in many cases are focused on only a single \n     resource, are conducted without the procedural and public \n     participation safeguards required by those laws, and \n     result in guidance that conflicts with the planning that \n     is conducted in accordance with those laws.\n       Find that the procedures and requirements of NFMA and FLPMA \n     often are not compatible, and even conflict, with procedures \n     and requirements of other, more generally applicable \n     environmental laws. The result is often the de facto transfer \n     of planning and management decisionmaking authority from the \n     land management agencies--the Forest Service and BLM--to \n     other environmental agencies--most notably the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Marine \n     Fisheries Service--that do not possess comparable land \n     management expertise.\n       Find ``without doubt'' that Congress has failed to \n     reconcile the procedures and requirements of other \n     environmental laws with the planning and management processes \n     established by NFMA and FLPMA.\n       State that the land management planning is conducted \n     without regard for likely funding constraints on plan \n     implementation and that the agencies' budgets and \n     Congressional appropriations are not linked to the plans.\n       Describe how, even when the Forest Service and BLM retain \n     planning and management authority, they are often paralyzed \n     by an escalating number of administrative appeals and \n     lawsuits.\n       Note that existing law does not recognize, nor integrate \n     into planning, important new land management concepts such as \n     ecosystem management and adaptive management which are being \n     imposed or incorporated in federal land planning and \n     management without statutory authority or clear public \n     understanding.\n       State that new processes developed by stakeholders to \n     better participate in federal land planning and decision \n     making, such as the community collaborative deliberations of \n     the Quincy Library Group and Applegate Partnership, are not \n     recognized or encouraged by NFMA and FLPMA.\n       Find that these flaws in planning and plan implementation, \n     including the administrative and judicial challenges, have \n     escalated Forest Service and BLM land management costs and \n     thereby reduced land management capability.\n       Note that FLPMA and NFMA were enacted when federal land \n     ecosystems were regarded generally as healthy, but numerous \n     watersheds are degraded, species are declining because of \n     habitat loss, and forested areas are undergoing or are \n     threatened by an unprecedented forest health crisis.\n       State that monitoring to develop an adequate basis for \n     planning and to determine whether plans are being implemented \n     adequately or conditions have changed sufficiently to warrant \n     new planning is often promised but rarely conducted.\n       State that these flaws in planning and subsequently \n     inability to secure plan implementation have injured--both \n     environmentally and economically--all stakeholders, but \n     particularly local resource-dependent communities which have \n     no protection nor recourse under NFMA and FLPMA.\n       Find that NFMA and FLPMA, and their implementing \n     regulations provide much guidance on planning, but virtually \n     none on plan implementation, thereby devaluing the term \n     ``Management'' common to both Acts' titles.\n       Report the finding of the United States General Accounting \n     Office (GAO) that the statutory flaws and public distrust \n     discussed in these findings have contributed to, and been \n     compounded by, the agencies' lack of a clear mission \n     statement.\n       And find that additional statutory direction for planning \n     and plan implementation is needed to secure stable and \n     predictable federal land management and to free the Forest \n     Service and BLM to exercise fully their professionalism in \n     making management decisions.\n       Sec. 3. Definitions.--This section defines the terms used \n     in this legislation. For the purpose of this section-by-\n     section description only two terms need definition here. \n     ``Federal lands'' means all federal lands managed by the BLM \n     (excluding Outer Continental Shelf lands) and Forest Service \n     (including national grasslands). The four ``Committees of \n     Congress'' are the authorizing committees with jurisdiction \n     over the Forest Service and BLM: the Committee on Resources \n     and Committee on Agriculture in the House of Representatives \n     and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry in the \n     United States Senate.\n       Sec. 4. Supplemental Authority.--This section makes clear \n     that this legislation supplements the NFMA, FLPMA, and other \n     applicable law. Any inconsistency: between this bill and the \n     NFMA or FLPMA is resolved in favor of this bill; and between \n     this bill and the statutes governing management of units of \n     the National Wilderness Preservation, National Wild and \n     Scenic Rivers, and National Trails Systems is resolved in \n     favor of those statutes.\n       Sec. 5. Transition.--This section makes clear that existing \n     plans, policies, and other guidance concerning the federal \n     lands that are in effect on the date of enactment of this \n     legislation remain valid until they are revised, amended, \n     changed, or terminated in accordance with this legislation.\n\nTITLE I--ENSURING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF FEDERAL LAND \n                                PLANNING\n\n       Sec. 101. Purposes.--The purposes of Title I are to provide \n     a mission statement for the Forest Service and BLM and \n     provide Congressional direction to those agencies on the \n     preparation and implementation of resource management plans \n     for, and the planning of management activities on, the \n     federal lands. This mission and direction are intended to \n     avoid the environmental, economic, and social injuries caused \n     by the existing flaws and past absence of mission and \n     direction in federal land planning. Most importantly, this \n     mission and direction are expected to achieve more stable, \n     predictable, timely, sustainable, and cost-effective \n     management of federal lands. This title is also intended to \n     encourage collaborative processes in federal land planning, \n     to ensure adequate monitoring, and to establish uniform, \n     expeditious procedures for administrative and judicial \n     appeals. Finally, this title would provide for consideration \n     during planning of funding constraints on, and during budget \n     setting of funding needs for, plan implementation. The \n     collaborative planning, monitoring, and budgetary purposes \n     were not in this bill's predecessor.\n\n[[Page S8096]]\n\n                           Part A. In General\n\n       Sec. 102. Mission of the Land Management Agencies.--A \n     common theme of the SAF report (pp. 17-18), the Committee of \n     Scientists report (pp. xiv-xvi), and a 1997 GAO report \n     entitled, ``Forest Service Decision-making: A Framework for \n     Improving Performance.'' (p. 5) is the need for a new mission \n     direction for the Forest Service and BLM that provides \n     guidance beyond the multiple use and sustained yield \n     principles and incorporates the newer management concepts \n     concerning ecosystems, landscape management, and biological \n     diversity. This section provides that new mission statement. \n     It is: to manage the federal lands to assure the health, \n     sustainability, and productivity of the lands' ecosystems; \n     where consistent with that objective, to furnish a \n     sustainable flow of multiple goods, services, and amenities; \n     to preserve or establish a full range and diversity of \n     natural habitats of native species in a dynamic manner over \n     the landscape, and to designate discrete areas to conserve \n     certain resources or allow certain uses. This section was \n     rewritten, consistent with the Committee of Scientists and \n     SAF reports' recommendations, to accord priority to ecosystem \n     concerns and to clarify and ensure that the agencies are to \n     deliver amenities as well as goods and services.\n       Sec. 103. Scientific Basis for Federal Land Decisions.--To \n     ensure that federal land planning and management is well \n     grounded in science (a particular concern of the Committee of \n     Scientists), this section requires the Forest Service and BLM \n     to use in all federal land decisions the ``best scientific \n     and commercial data available.'' Congress first adopted this \n     stringent standard in the Endangered Species Act of 1973; \n     this bill's standard is identical to that Act's.\n\n           Part B. Resource Management and Activity Planning\n\n       Sec. 104. Levels of Planning.--To reduce the proliferating \n     number of federal land planning exercises, this section \n     limits the levels of Forest Service and BLM planning to two--\n     multiple-use resource management planning for designated \n     planning units and site-specific planning for management \n     activities. The two agencies are given complete discretion to \n     designate planning units of whatever size and number they \n     consider appropriate in which to conduct the resource \n     management planning.\n       The agencies may also conduct analyses or assessments for \n     geographical areas other than the planning units (including \n     ecoregion assessments as provided in Part F of this title). \n     The results of those analyses or assessments may be applied \n     to the federal lands by amending or revising the applicable \n     resource management plans.\n       This section establishes a 3-year deadline for amending or \n     revising existing resource management plans to include \n     policies developed in planning conducted outside of the two \n     prescribed planning levels. Non-complying planning will no \n     longer apply to the federal lands at the end of the 3-year \n     period.\n       Sec. 105. Contents of Planning and Allocations of Decisions \n     to Each Planning Level.--To eliminate redundant planning that \n     is time-consuming and costly, this section assigns specific \n     analyses to the two levels of planning established in section \n     104 and clarifies that the analyses may not be repeated \n     elsewhere in the planning process. This assignment of \n     planning tasks to specific planning levels is regarded as a \n     critically important change by the authors of the SAF report \n     (pp. 51, 59): ``The current land management planning \n     process is unclear about which decisions are made at which \n     points in the planning process. No public organization or \n     management system can be effective without clearly \n     articulated goals and an unambiguous decisionmaking \n     process, and in current planning, neither of these \n     conditions obtains. . . . Once the overall mission of the \n     lands has been identified, the most important questions \n     about land management planning on the national forests and \n     public lands relate to clarifying which issues are decided \n     at which levels of the decisionmaking process.''\n       This section requires that resource management plans \n     contain 5 basic elements: (1) statement of management goals \n     and objectives; (2) allocation of land uses to specific areas \n     in the planning unit; (3) determination of outputs of goods, \n     services, and amenities from the unit; (4) environmental \n     protection policies; and (5) a description of the desired \n     future conditions of the unit's lands and the expected \n     duration of time needed to achieve those conditions. Basic \n     elements (1) and (3) are specifically recommended by the SAF \n     report (p. 57): ``Resource management plans should identify \n     and quantify (to the extent feasible) appropriate goals and \n     outcomes, including vegetation management goals and commodity \n     and amenity outputs.'' Element 2--land allocations--is, of \n     course, the historic backbone of planning and is recommended \n     by the Committee of Scientists report (p. xxxiii). ``Desired \n     future conditions'' is a new, basic element added to this \n     bill; this concept is recommended in the Committee of \n     Scientists report (p. xxviii) as ``[t]he central reference \n     point for strategic planning.'' The agencies are admonished \n     to tailor the environmental protection policies in element 4, \n     to the maximum extent feasible, not to be prescriptive \n     requirements generally applicable to the entire planning \n     unit, but rather to provide guidance for determining specific \n     requirements suitable for the precise conditions at \n     identified sites during the planning of individual management \n     activities.\n       The agencies are tasked with describing the basic elements \n     in a manner that provides a basis for monitoring required by \n     section 116 and adaptive management required by section 117. \n     This requirement is new to this bill and is recommended by \n     SAF report (p. 57): ``The goals and outputs (including fiscal \n     expectations and downstream effects) should be set forth in a \n     manner that provides a basis for monitoring, evaluating, and \n     reporting agency performance.''.\n       Additionally, the resource management plans are required to \n     contain: (1) a statement of historical uses, and trends in \n     conditions of, the resources covered by the plans; (2) a \n     comparison of the projected results of the basic elements \n     with recent agency performance and a discussion of any \n     expected, significant changes in management direction, \n     including any steps to be taken to ameliorate any adverse \n     economic, social, and economic consequences that might result \n     from those changes; (3) a schedule and procedure for \n     monitoring plan implementation, management of the covered \n     federal lands, and trends in the covered resources' uses and \n     conditions as required by section 116; (4) criteria for \n     determining when circumstances on the covered federal lands \n     warrant adaptive management of the resources as required by \n     sections 116(a)(3) and 117(c). The requirement to compare \n     projected results with past performance and discuss \n     significant differences is a new element in this bill that is \n     recommended in the SAF report (p. 57): ``The plans should \n     compare and contrast the goals and outcomes with recent \n     performance, highlighting situations where a significant \n     change in direction is proposed.'' The requirement for a \n     schedule and procedures for monitoring is recommended by both \n     the Committee of Scientists report (``An adequate plan \n     contains the methods and proposed measurements for monitoring \n     . . .''. (p. 108) and the SAF report (``The [planning] \n     decision document needs to specify the monitoring process . . \n     .''. (p. 27)).\n       Another provision designed to reduce plan redundancies and \n     the time consumed in repetitive planning requires the \n     agencies to assign by a notice-and-comment rulemaking \n     specific analyses and decisions to each of the two planning \n     levels (as recommended in the SAF report (p. 59): ``Forest \n     planning regulations should identify the analyses and \n     decisions that must be made at each planning level''). The \n     agencies may not conduct or reconsider those analyses or \n     decisions in the planning level to which they are not \n     assigned. This section also assigns a number of analyses and \n     decisions by statute. In addition to the 5 basic elements \n     discussed previously, assigned to resource management \n     planning are resource inventories, cumulative effects \n     analyses (including effects on water quality), discussion of \n     relationship to State and local plans, identification of \n     federal lands which might be exchanged or otherwise disposed \n     of, and decisions on wilderness, unsuitability of lands for \n     certain uses (e.g., coal mining as required by section 522 of \n     the Surface Mining Control and reclamation Act and timber \n     harvesting as required by section 6 of the National Forest \n     Management Act), and visual objectives.\n       Assigned to management activity planning are analyses of \n     site-specific resources and environmental effects, and \n     decisions concerning the design of, and requirements for, the \n     activity, including decisions related to water quality \n     effects of the activity, method for harvesting forest \n     products, revenue benefits, and a schedule and procedures for \n     monitoring the effects of the activity. These assignments of \n     decisionmaking comport with the recommendations in the SAF \n     report (p. 59): ``Forest or area plans might be the \n     appropriate place to analyze and decide wilderness \n     recommendations, output targets, supply-demand relationships, \n     and community impacts. [Localized] plans might be the \n     appropriate place to analyze and decide on \n     silvicultural practices and restoration activities and the \n     mix of habitats for species viability . . . [and] access \n     and management unit boundaries.''\n       Among the more significant changes in this section from the \n     language of this bill's predecessors are the addition of \n     desired future uses to the plan's basic elements, the \n     emphasis on monitoring and adaptive management in resource \n     management planning, the requirement to address adverse \n     consequences of significant changes in management direction, \n     and the assignment of water quality analyses to both planning \n     levels.\n       Sec. 106. Planning Deadlines.--To break the cycle of \n     perpetual planning, this section would set deadlines for \n     conducting the two-level planning. These deadlines are: (1) \n     for resource management planning--36 months for plan \n     preparation, 18 months for amendments defined as significant \n     by regulations, 12 months for amendments defined as non-\n     significant by regulations, and 30 months for revisions; and \n     (2) for management activity planning--12 months for planning \n     significant activities, and 9 months for planning non-\n     significant activities. All of these deadlines are longer \n     than those in the predecessor bill, as suggested by the \n     former agency heads and other witnesses. Also added is a \n     provision that adjusts the deadlines if an activity must be \n     submitted to Congress as a ``rule'' under section 251 of the \n     Contract with American Advancement Act of 1996 (110 Stat. \n     868-874, 5 U.S.C. 801-808). Both the Committee of Scientists \n     report (``Planners should aim to complete the planning phases \n     from assessment through formal adoption of small landscape \n     plans within three years and preferably less than two.'' (p. \n     181)) and the SAF\n\n[[Page S8097]]\n\n     report (``deadlines for decisions should therefore be set'') \n     (p. 46)) recommend planning deadlines.\n       Sec. 107. Plan Amendments and Revisions.--This section \n     ensures that the 5 basic elements of the resource management \n     plans are accorded equal dignity and that one element is not \n     arbitrarily sacrificed or ignored to achieve another. It \n     prohibits the Forest Service and BLM from applying a policy \n     to, or making a decision on, a resource management plan or a \n     management activity which is inconsistent with one of the \n     basis elements. To ensure that the agencies discover any such \n     inconsistency, this section requires each agency either to \n     report in writing with each land management activity decision \n     that the activity contributes to or does not preclude \n     achievement of the basic elements or to amend or revise the \n     plan to remove or reconcile the affected element. This \n     decision to amend would be made whenever the inconsistency is \n     discovered whether it is during the planning for a specific \n     management activity or during the monitoring of plan \n     implementation required by section 116. The agencies are \n     given the authority to waive an inconsistency without \n     amending the resource management plan for a single specific \n     management activity within any class of management activities \n     once during the life of the plan if the inconsistency does \n     not violate a nondiscretionary statutory requirement and the \n     determination is made that the waiver is in the public \n     interest.\n       This section also requires that any change in federal land \n     management that is imposed by new law, regulation, or court \n     order or that is warranted by new information must be \n     effected by amending or revising the appropriate resource \n     management plans. Further, unless the agency determines that \n     the law or court requires otherwise and publishes that \n     determination, the change in management does not become \n     effective until the amendment or revision is adopted.\n       This section directs that, when resource management plans \n     are revised, all provisions of those plans are to be \n     considered and analyzed in the environmental analysis \n     (environmental impact statement (EIS) or environmental \n     assessment (EA)) and decision documents. This ensures that \n     the agency does not consider only those portions of the plans \n     that are particularly important to the most vociferous \n     advocates for a particular land use or management policy or \n     are of particular interest to the officials involved in the \n     planning exercise.\n       Finally, this section clarifies that, while a resource \n     management plan is being amended or revised, management \n     activities are to continue and not be stayed in anticipation \n     of changes that might be made by the amendment or revision. \n     Exceptions to this stay prohibition include whenever a stay \n     is required by this bill, court order, or a formal \n     declaration by the Secretary (without delegating the \n     authority). However, the agencies can stay particular \n     activities for purposes that are unrelated to the purpose or \n     the likely effect of the amendment or revision. To ensure \n     that de facto stays do not occur, this section provides that, \n     except as described above, a plan amendment or revision may \n     not become effective until final decisions on management \n     activities that are scheduled to be made during the plan \n     amendment or revision process have been made.\n       Changes to this section include wording that responds to a \n     concern expressed by the President of the Wilderness Society \n     that environmental policies could be made secondary to other \n     commodity-oriented policies. This was accomplished by \n     clarifying that no basic element--including the environmental \n     policies--can be made inconsistent and ignored, and that \n     exception can be made only once for any class of management \n     activities over the plan's life.\n       Sec. 108. Consideration of Communities Dependent on Federal \n     Lands and Resources.--This section requires that, in \n     preparing, amending, or revising each resource management \n     plan, the Forest Service and BLM must consider if, and \n     explain whether, the plan will maintain to the maximum extent \n     feasible the stability of any community that has become \n     dependent on the commodity or non-commodity resources of \n     the federal lands to which the plan applies. Consideration \n     of dependent communities was strongly recommended in the \n     Committee of Scientists report (pp. xxi, 45): ``Within the \n     context of sustainability, planning should consider the \n     needs, resilience, and vulnerability of economies and \n     communities in selecting long-term management \n     strategies.'' ``The national forests and grasslands must \n     serve all of the nation's people; nevertheless, local \n     residents deserve particular attention when the \n     contributions of the forests to economic and social \n     sustainability are being considered.''\n       The procedure for meeting this mandate is to include in the \n     EIS or EA on the plan, amendment, or revision a discussion \n     of: the impact of each plan alternative on the revenues and \n     budget, public services, wages, and social conditions of each \n     federal lands-dependent community; how the alternatives would \n     relate to historic community expectations; and how the \n     impacts were considered in the final plan decision.\n       This section defines a community dependent on the commodity \n     or non-commodity resources of the federal lands as one which \n     is located in proximity to federal lands and is significantly \n     affected socially, economically, or environmentally by the \n     allocation of uses of one or more of the lands' commodity or \n     non-commodity resources. The secretaries are to consult with \n     the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor in establishing by \n     rulemaking criteria for identifying these communities.\n       This section was changed to recognize that many communities \n     are as dependent on non-commodity resources (for professional \n     guiding, river running, hunting and fishing, etc.) as others \n     are dependent on commodity resources and that both types of \n     communities should be given special attention in planning.\n       Sec. 109. Ecosystem Management Principles.--This section \n     provides a statutory basis for the relatively new ecosystem \n     management concept. It requires that this concept be \n     incorporated into planning. As the agencies accomplish this \n     integration of ecosystem management and planning, they are \n     cautioned that this new concept may not supersede other \n     statutory mandates. This section requires that the Forest \n     Service and BLM consider and discuss ecosystem management \n     principles in the EISs or EAs for resource management plans, \n     amendments, and revisions. It also states that these \n     principles are to be applied consistent with, and may not be \n     used as authority for not complying with, the other \n     requirements of this legislation, FLPMA, NFMA, and other \n     environmental laws applicable to resource management \n     planning.\n       ``Ecosystem management'' is defined in section 3. That \n     definition has been altered in this bill to incorporate the \n     basic management mandate recommended by the Committee of \n     Scientists report (pp. xiv, 177): ``ecological, economic, and \n     social sustainability''.\n\n            Part C. Encouragement of Collaborative Planning\n\n       Decentralized, collaborative planning is emphasized in both \n     the Committee of Scientists report (pp. xxiii-xxv) and the \n     SAF report (p. 46). Although the provisions in this part have \n     appeared in earlier versions of this bill, they are arranged \n     here into one part in order to emphasize the collaborative \n     planning concept.\n       Sec. 110. Participation of Local, Multi-Interest \n     Committees.--To encourage local solutions to federal land \n     management issues developed through collaborative planning by \n     neighboring citizens of diverse interests, this section \n     provides for the establishment of two types of local, matter-\n     interest committees. The first is the ``independent committee \n     of local interests'' established without the direction, \n     intervention, or funding of the agencies and including at \n     least one representative of a non-commodity interest and one \n     representative of a commodity interest. Prototypes for this \n     type of committee are the Quincy Library Group and Applegate \n     Partnership.\n       This section encourages these independent committees to \n     prepare planning recommendations for the federal lands by \n     imposing the requirement on the agencies that they include \n     those recommendations as alternatives in the EISs or EAs \n     which accompany the preparation, amendment, or revision of \n     resource management plans. If more than two independent \n     committees are established and submit planning alternatives \n     for the same federal lands, the Forest Service or BLM will \n     include the alternatives of the two committees it determines \n     to be most broadly representative of the interests to be \n     affected by the plan, amendment, or revision, and will \n     attempt to consolidate for analysis or otherwise discuss the \n     other committees' alternatives. Finally, the section \n     authorizes the Forest Service and BLM to provide to any \n     independent committee whose planning alternative is adopted \n     sufficient funds to monitor the alternative's implementation. \n     These independent committees would be exempt from the Federal \n     Advisory Committee Act.\n       Second, the agencies are empowered to establish local \n     committees corresponding to the federal land's planning \n     units. The membership of these committees must be broadly \n     representative of interests affected by planning for the \n     planning units for which they are formed. The agencies must \n     seek the advice of the committees prior to adopting, \n     amending, or revising the relevant resource management \n     plans and provide the committees with funding to monitor \n     plan implementation.\n       Sec. 111. Citizen Petitions for Plan Amendments or \n     Revisions.--Section 122 establishes deadlines for challenging \n     resource management plans, amendments, and revisions. The \n     section provides a procedure for citizens who believe a plan \n     has become inadequate after the deadlines have passed to seek \n     change in the plan and, if unsuccessful in obtaining change, \n     to challenge the plan. This section authorizes any person to \n     challenge a plan after the deadline solely on the basis of \n     new information, law, or regulation. The mechanism for \n     challenge is a petition for plan amendment or revision. The \n     Forest Service or BLM must accept or deny the petition within \n     90 days, and any request for a stay within 5 days, or receipt \n     of the petition. If the agency fails to respond to or denies \n     the petition or stay request, the petitioner may file suit \n     immediately against the plan. If the agency accepts the \n     petition, the process of amending or revising the plan begins \n     immediately. The agency's decision to accept or deny the \n     petition is not subject to the consultation requirement of \n     the Endangered Species Act (ESA) or the environmental \n     analysis requirements of the National Environmental Policy \n     Act (NEPA).\n       The principal change in this section was in response to the \n     testimony of the President of\n\n[[Page S8098]]\n\n     the Wilderness Society. It adds the opportunity for a \n     petitioner to seek a stay of any activities subject to the \n     petitioned plan amendment.\n       Sec. 112. Notice and Comment on Management Activities.--\n     This section adopts a provision from the provision in the \n     Fiscal Year 1993 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriation \n     Act which provided procedures for adminsitrative appeals of \n     Forest Service land management activities. In this bill and \n     its prior versions the appeal procedures were incorporated in \n     a broader administrative appeals section (here, section 122). \n     Consequently, this bill and its predecessors would repeal \n     that 1993 appropriations act rider. As pointed out by the \n     President of the Wilderness Society, inadvertently dropped \n     from the repealed language was a provision requiring notice \n     (by mail and newspaper) and comment (within a 30 day period) \n     on Forest Service land management activities. This section \n     restores that provision and expands it to include land \n     management activities of the BLM.\n\n   Part D. Consideration and Disclosure of Budget and Funding Effects\n\n       Sec. 113. Disclosure of Funding Constraints on Planning and \n     Management.--To ensure that planning decisions are not based \n     on overly optimistic funding expectations and are not \n     rendered irrelevant by enactment of differing appropriations, \n     this section requires that the EIS or EA on ech resource \n     management plan, or plan amendment or revision, contain a \n     determination on how the 5 basic elements (goals and \n     objectives, land use allocations, outputs of goods and \n     services, environmental protection policies and standards, \n     and desired future conditions) will be implemented within a \n     range of funding levels (with at least one level which \n     provides less funds annually, and one level which provides \n     more funds annually, than the level of funding for the fiscal \n     year in which the EIS or EA is prepared).\n       The Committee of Scientists, the SAF report authors, and \n     the GAO (Forest Service Issues Related to Management of \n     National Forests for Multiple Uses, 1996) all recognized the \n     fundamental problem of what the Committee of Scientists (p. \n     107) called the ``disconnect between budgets and plans.'' As \n     described in the SAF report (p. 22), ``Even though the Forest \n     Service has generally received the funds requested for land \n     management planning, it has not delivered the outputs that \n     the plans specify. Some plans have been developed without \n     budget constraints. This gap between plans and reality means \n     that many of the actions called for in the plans and \n     justified on multiple-use grounds can never be realized \n     simply because of lack of funds.'' All three reports \n     basically call for the same remedy (i.e., ``Forest or area \n     plans should explain how the goals and outcomes would be \n     affected by differing budgets.'' SAF report, p. 62) that is \n     provided in this section.\n       Sec. 114. Fully Allocated Costs Analysis.--To ensure that \n     the costs to all uses are revealed, this section directs the \n     Forest Service and BLM to disclose in the EISs and EAs on \n     resource management plans, amendments, and revisions the \n     fully allocated cost including foregone revenues, expressed \n     as a user fee or cost-per-beneficiary, of each non-commodity \n     output from the federal lands to which the plans apply.\n       Sec. 115. Budget and Cost Disclosures.--To better relate \n     the agencies' planning process with Congress' appropriations \n     process, this section requires that the President's budget \n     request to Congress include an appendix that discloses the \n     amount of funds that would be required to achieve 100% of the \n     annual outputs of goods and services in, and otherwise \n     implement fully, each Forest Service and BLM resource \n     management plan. This provision, together with section 113, \n     implements two critical recommendations in the SAF report (p. \n     62): ``A persistent criticism of resource management plans is \n     that annual appropriations have not always matched the \n     funding assumptions. Forest or area plans should explain \n     how the goals and outcomes would be affected by differing \n     budgets. Annual reporting on agency performance can then \n     compare and contrast the goals and targets of the plan \n     with the requested budgets and actual appropriations.''.\n       In the face of escalating planning costs, particularly \n     those associated with ecoregion assessments, this section \n     also requires the agencies to submit to Congress each year an \n     accounting of the total costs and cost per function or \n     procedure for each plan, amendment, revision or assessment \n     published in the preceding year.\n\n               Part E. Monitoring and Adaptive Management\n\n       Set out in this part are the two most important functions \n     conducted by the agencies (in addition to responding to \n     citizen petitions for plan amendment or revision authorized \n     by section 111) to ensure that resource management plans--\n     once prepared--are implemented and kept current. The first of \n     these functions is monitoring. A recurring theme of numerous \n     studies (including both the Committee of Scientists and SAF \n     reports and the 1997 GAO report, Forest Service Decision-\n     making: A Framerwork for Improving Performance) is that, in \n     the words of the SAF report (p. 51), ``[b]oth natural \n     resources monitoring and program implementation monitoring \n     are currently inadequate.'' The Committee of Scientists \n     report emphasizes that the second of these functions--\n     adaptive management--is wholly dependent on adequate \n     monitoring. Because monitoring is expensive (SAF report, p. \n     38) and is not typically a prerequisite to land management \n     decisions, it is usually deprived of necessary funding by \n     both Congress and the agencies. This part provides statutory \n     emphasis for, and attempts to provide more secure funding to, \n     these critical functions. This part consolidates and \n     strengthens various provisions in the previous version of \n     this bill.\n       Sec. 116. Monitoring.--This section requires use of funds \n     from the Monitoring Funds established by section 118 to \n     monitor the implementation of each resource management plan \n     at least biennially. The monitoring is to (1) ensure that no \n     basic element (goal, land allocation, output, environmental \n     policy, or desired future condition) of the plan is \n     constructively changed through a pattern of incompatible \n     management activities or of failures to undertake compatible \n     management activities, (2) determine that no conflict has \n     arisen between any of the basic elements of the plan, and (3) \n     determine if circumstances warrant adaptive management of the \n     plan. The monitoring is to be conducted in accordance with \n     the procedures for monitoring that are required to be \n     included in each resource management plan by section 105. \n     Likewise, the determination of circumstances warranting \n     adaptive management are to be made in accordance with the \n     criteria for such determinations which section 105 also \n     requires be included in each plan.\n       Sec. 117. Adaptive Management and Other Changes Due to \n     Monitoring.--This section requires corrective management \n     actions or plan amendments or revisions whenever, as provided \n     in section 116, the monitoring discloses changed \n     circumstances, conflicts in plan elements, or circumstances \n     warranting adaptive management.\n       Sec. 118. Monitoring Funds.--This section would implement a \n     recommendation in the SAF report (p. 62) that ``[m]onitoring \n     should be separately and adequately funded.'' This section \n     establishes a Public Lands Monitoring Fund for BLM lands and \n     Forest Lands Monitoring Fund for Forest Service lands to \n     provide a supplemental funding source for important \n     monitoring activities. The Funds would receive all monies \n     collected from federal lands in any fiscal year that are in \n     excess of federal land revenues projected in the President's \n     baseline budget (minus the State's and local government's \n     share as required by law). The monies in the Funds may be \n     used, without appropriations, to conduct the monitoring \n     required by section 116 or to fund the monitoring of the \n     local, multi-interest committees under section 110.\n       Added to this section is a provision that encourages each \n     agency to use private contractors, including contractors \n     under the Jobs in the Woods Program, to conduct monitoring, \n     except the monitoring done by the multi-interest committees.\n\n                 Part F. Planning--Related Assessments\n\n       Sec. 119. Purpose and Authorization of Ecoregion and Other \n     Assessments.--The purpose of this part and section is to \n     authorize the new practice of preparing ecoregion and other \n     assessments of environmental, economic, and social issues and \n     conditions that transcend the boundaries of planning units \n     established pursuant to section 104 for the purpose of \n     informing the resource management planning for, and the \n     planning of management activities on, the federal lands. The \n     Committee of Scientists (pp. xxvi-xxvii) endorses assessments \n     as vehicles for ``provid[ing] the context for. . . . \n     planning.''\n       First, this section authorizes the Forest Service and BLM \n     to prepare these ecoregion or other assessments, which may \n     include non-federal lands if the Governors of the affected \n     States or the governing bodies of the affected Indian tribes, \n     as the case may be, agree. It requires the agency to give the \n     four Committees of Congress and the public 90 days advance \n     notice before initiating an assessment. The notice to \n     Congress and Federal Register notice must include: (1) a \n     description of the land involved; (2) the agency officials \n     responsible; (3) the estimated costs of and the deadlines \n     for the assessment; (4) the charter for the assessment; \n     (5) the public, State, local government and tribal \n     participation procedures; (6) a thorough explanation of \n     how the region or area for the assessment was identified \n     and the attributes which establish it; and (7) detailed \n     reasons for the decision to prepare the assessment.\n       Sec. 120. Status, Effect, and Application of Assessments.--\n     This section provides that the assessments must not contain \n     any decisions concerning resource management planning or \n     management activities. The Committee of Scientists (p. xxvi) \n     endorses this approach: ``A critical component of the \n     framework proposed by the Committee is that assessments are \n     not decision documents and should not be made to function \n     under the NEPA processes associated with decision-making.'' \n     The section also establishes a procedure for applying \n     information or analysis contained in ecoregion or other \n     assessments to the planning and management activities. It \n     directs the relevant agency to make a decision within 6 \n     months of completion of an assessment whether any information \n     or analyses in the assessment warrants amendments to, or \n     revisions of, a resource management plan for the federal \n     lands to which the assessment applies. If the decision is \n     made for an amendment or revision, no management activity on \n     federal lands may be delayed or altered on the basis of the \n     assessment while the amendment or revision is prepared. This \n     section also prohibits any federal official from using an \n     assessment as an\n\n[[Page S8099]]\n\n     independent basis to regulate non-federal lands. Finally, as \n     the assessments are non-decisional, this section provides \n     that they will not be subject to the consultation \n     requirements of the Endangered Species Act or the \n     environmental documentation requirements of the National \n     Environmental Policy Act. (``Most critically, assessments do \n     not produce decisions and, therefore, should not be made to \n     function under the NEPA processes associated with decision \n     making.'' Committee of Scientists report, p. 95.)\n       Sec. 121. Reports to Congress on Assessments.--This section \n     mandates three reports on ecoregion and other assessments.\n       First, this section directs the agencies to report \n     biennially to the four Committees of Congress on ecosystem \n     and other assessments, their implications for federal land \n     management, and any resource management plan amendments or \n     revisions based on assessments. The reports also must include \n     the agencies' views of the benefits and detriments of, and \n     recommendations for improving, assessments.\n       Second, this section requires the GAO to prepare and submit \n     to the same Committees of Congress a report on each \n     assessment 3 years after the conclusion of the assessment. \n     The report is to: review the degree of protection for non-\n     commodity resources on, and the level of goods and services \n     from, the relevant federal lands that are projected by the \n     assessment; provide an evaluation of whether such resource \n     protection and amount of goods and services were actually \n     delivered and, if not, why; and recommendations to change \n     assessments to change assessments to secure more accurate \n     projections and better delivery.\n       Third, the GAO is directed to provide the Committees of \n     Congress with an overall evaluation of the efficacy of \n     assessments seven years after enactment.\n       Dropped from this bill was the Pacific Northwest Plan \n     Review provision that was contained in earlier versions and \n     was criticized by witnesses for environmental organizations.\n\n                     Part G. Challenges To Planning\n\n       The purposes of this part are to ensure that challenges--\n     both administrative and judicial--of resource management \n     plans and management activities are brought more timely, and \n     by those who truly participate in the agencies' processes. It \n     does not eliminate challenges or insulate agency decisions \n     from challenges.\n       Sec. 122. Administrative Appeals.--This section directs the \n     Forest Service and BLM to promulgate rules to govern \n     administrative appeals of decisions to approve resource \n     management plans, amendments, and revisions, and of decisions \n     to approve, disapprove, or otherwise take final action on \n     management activities. While allowing the agencies \n     considerable discretion in rulemaking, this section does \n     provide that the rules must: (1) require that, in order to \n     bring an appeal, the appellant must have commented in writing \n     during the agency process on the issue or issues to be \n     appealed if an opportunity to comment was provided and if the \n     issue or issues were manifest at that time (SAF report \n     recommendation (p.58): ``Increase the requirements for filing \n     an administrative appeal by requiring participation in the \n     decision process related to the specific decision''); (2) \n     provide that administrative appeals of plans may not \n     challenge analyses or decisions assigned to management \n     activities under section 105 and administrative appeals of \n     management activities may not challenge analyses or decisions \n     assigned to plans under section 105; (3) provide deadlines \n     for bringing the administrative appeals (not more than 120 \n     days after a plan or revision decision, 90 days after an \n     amendment decision, and 45 days after a management  activity \n     decision); (4) provide deadlines for final decisions on \n     the appeals (not more than 120 days for appeal of a plan \n     or revision, 90 days for appeal of a plan amendment, and \n     45 days for appeal of a management activity, with possible \n     15 days extension for each); (5) provide that, in the \n     event of failure to render a decision by the applicable \n     deadline, the decision on which the appeal is based is to \n     be deemed a final agency action which allows the appellant \n     to file suit immediately; (6) require the agency to \n     consider and balance environmental and/or economic injury \n     in deciding whether to issue a stay pending appeal; (7) \n     provide that no stay may extend more than 30 days beyond a \n     final decision on an appeal of a plan, amendment, or \n     revision or 15 days beyond a final decision on an appeal \n     of a management activity; and (8) establish categories of \n     management activities excluded from administrative appeals \n     (but not lawsuits) because of emergency, time-sensitive, \n     or other exigent circumstances.\n       This section is more comprehensive than the section of the \n     Fiscal Year 1993 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriation \n     Act which concerned appeals only of management activities \n     (not management plans, amendments, and revisions) of the \n     Forest Service (not BLM). As this section supplants that more \n     limited provision, it repeals that provision when the new \n     appeals rules required by this section become effective.\n       Sec. 123. Judicial Review.--This section establishes venue \n     and standing requirements in, sets deadlines for, and \n     otherwise governs lawsuits over resource management plans, \n     amendments, revisions, and petitions and management \n     activities.\n       The venue for plan-related litigation is the U.S. Circuit \n     Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the lands (or the \n     largest portion of the lands) to which the plan applies are \n     located. The venue for litigation over a management activity, \n     or petition for plan amendment or revision is the U.S. \n     District Court in the district where the lands (or the \n     largest portion of the lands) on which the activity would \n     occur or to which the plan applies are located.\n       This section also clarifies that standing and intervention \n     of right is to be granted to the fullest extent permitted by \n     the Constitution. This means those who are economically \n     injured cannot be barred by the non-constitutional, \n     prudential ``zone of interest'' test developed by the \n     judiciary. This section also overturns the Supreme Court's \n     1998 decision in Ohio Forestry Association v. Sierra Club \n     (118 S. Ct. 1665 (1998)) which drastically limited the \n     ability of environmental organizations or other litigants \n     from filing lawsuits challenging resource management plans. \n     On the other hand, this section limits standing to those who \n     make a legitimate effort to resolve their concerns during the \n     agency's decisionmaking process and do not engage in \n     ``litigation by ambush'' by withholding their concerns until \n     after the agency decision is made. Specifically, this section \n     requires that the plaintiff must have participated in the \n     agency's decisionmaking process and submitted a written \n     statement on the issue or issues to be litigated if the \n     opportunity to comment was provided and the issue or issues \n     were manifest at that time, and must have exhausted \n     opportunities for administrative review.\n       Deadlines for bringing suit are 90 days after the final \n     decision on the administrative appeal of a resource \n     management plan, amendment, or revision, and 30 days after a \n     final decision on the administrative appeal of a management \n     activity or final disposition of a petition for plan \n     amendment or revision. If the challenge involves a statute \n     (e.g., Endangered Species Act or Clean Water Act) which \n     requires a period of notice before filing a citizen suit, \n     suit must be filed no later than 7 days after the end of that \n     notice period.\n       This section bars suits brought on the basis of new \n     information, law, or regulation until after a petition for \n     plan amendment or revision is filed and a decision is made on \n     it.\n       This section also clarifies that suits concerning resource \n     management plans and management activities are to be decided \n     on the administrative record.\n       Several changes were made to this section to respond to \n     concerns expressed by the President of the Wilderness \n     Society.\n\n  TITLE II--COORDINATION AND COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS\n\n       Sec. 201. Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to \n     eliminate primarily procedural conflicts among, and \n     coordinate, the various land management and environmental \n     laws without reducing--indeed enhancing--environmental \n     protection. A wide variety of reports from diverse sources \n     have consistently sounded the theme that conflicting laws \n     have made management of federal lands more difficult. Among \n     these reports are both the Committee of Scientists report (p. \n     xli) and the SAF report (pp. 23-24), the 1992 Office of \n     Technology Assessment report Forest Service Planning: \n     Accommodating Uses, Producing Outputs and Sustaining \n     Ecosystems (p. 59), and the 1997 GAO report Forest Service \n     Decision-making: A Framework for Improving Performance (p. \n     11). The SAF report (p. 23) summarizes one fundamental \n     consequence: ``Because [other federal and state] agencies \n     have different missions, they interpret statutes and \n     regulations differently. The result, too often, is that they \n     fail to agree on land management decisions. In recent cases, \n     land management has been guided as much by decisions of the \n     regulatory agencies as by the resource agencies.''\n       The SAF report finds that legislation is required to \n     address this problem; the Committee Scientists report (p. \n     xli), which focuses on recommendations to improve Forest \n     Service regulations, opines that, as to this problem, \n     legislative action may be necessary. This part approaches, \n     but does not go as far as, the principal recommendation of \n     the SAF report (pp. 55-56) relevant to this problem: \n     ``Consistent with sound land management theory, the federal \n     land management agencies should be given broad authority and \n     responsibility to meet all environmental requirements. \n     Consultation is appropriate, but other federal and state \n     agencies should not have the responsibility for approving \n     land management activities. If the federal land management \n     agencies do not act in a prudent, responsible fashion, their \n     actions should be subject to legal challenges.''\n       Sec. 202. Environmental Analysis.--This section describes \n     how compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act \n     will occur in resource management planning and planning for \n     management activities. It requires that EIS be prepared \n     whenever a resource management plan is developed or revised. \n     (Plan amendments may have either and EIS or EA depending on \n     their significance.) This section also provides that, for \n     management activities, an EA ordinarily is prepared. The EA \n     for the management activity is to be tiered to the EIS for \n     the applicable resource management plan. The agency may \n     prepare a full EIS on a management activity if it determines \n     the nature or scope of the activity's environmental impacts \n     is substantially different from, or greater than, the nature \n     or scope of impacts analyzed in the EIS on the applicable \n     resource management plan.\n\n[[Page S8100]]\n\n       Sec. 203. Wildlife Protection.--This section addresses the \n     relationship of the Endangered Species Act to federal land \n     planning and management. First, it provides a certification \n     procedure by which the Forest Service and BLM can become \n     certified by the Fish and Wildlife Service to conduct the \n     consultation responsibilities normally assigned to the Fish \n     and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Services \n     by section 7 of the ESA. If they are certified, the two land \n     management agencies will have the authority to prepare the \n     biological opinions under the ESA just as they now prepare \n     EISs under NEPA.\n       Second, this section addresses situations in which the \n     resource management plan may have to undergo consultation \n     because of a new designation of an endangered or threatened \n     species or of a species' critical habitat, or new information \n     about an already designated species or habitat. This section \n     requires that a decision be reached as to whether \n     consultation is required on the plan within 90 days of the \n     new designation, and that any amendment to or revision of the \n     plan be completed within 12 or 18 months, respectively, after \n     the new designation. It also allows individual management \n     activities to continue under the plan while it is being \n     amended or revised, if those activities either separately \n     undergo consultation concerning the newly designated species \n     or habitat or are determined not to require consultation.\n       Sec. 204. Water Quality Protection.--This section addresses \n     the relationship of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to federal land \n     planning and management. It provides that any management \n     activity that constitutes a non-point source of water \n     pollution is to be considered in compliance with applicable \n     CWA provisions if the State in which the activity will occur \n     certifies that it meets best management practices or their \n     financial equivalent. The agency, however, may choose not to \n     seek State certification and satisfy the separate applicable \n     CWA requirements.\n       Sec. 205. Air Quality Protection.--This section addresses \n     the relationship of the Clean Air Act (CAA) to federal land \n     planning and management. It provides that, when a Forest \n     Service forest supervisor or BLM district manager (after \n     providing an opportunity for review by the appropriate \n     Governor) finds that a prescribed fire will reduce the \n     likelihood of greater emissions from a wildfire, and will be \n     conducted in a manner that minimizes impacts on air quality \n     to the extent practicable, the prescribed fire is deemed to \n     be in compliance with applicable CAA provisions.\n       Sec. 206. Meetings With Users of the Federal Lands.--This \n     section addresses the relationship of the Federal Advisory \n     Committee Act (FACA) to federal land planning and management. \n     It clarifies that the agencies may meet without violating \n     FACA with one or more: holders of, or applicants for, federal \n     permits, leases, contracts or other authorizations for use of \n     the federal lands; other than persons who conduct activities \n     on the federal lands; and persons who own or manage lands \n     adjacent to the federal lands.\n\n   TITLE III--DEVELOPMENT OF A GLOBAL RENEWABLE RESOURCES ASSESSMENT\n\n       Sec. 301. Purposes.--The purpose of this title is to \n     replace the Renewable Resource Assessment and Renewable \n     Resource Program administered by the Forest Service under the \n     Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 \n     with a Global Renewable Resources Assessment administered by \n     an independent National Council on Renewable Resource Policy.\n       Sec. 302. Global Renewable Resources Assessment.--This \n     section emphasizes the vital importance of renewable \n     resources to national and international social, economic, and \n     environmental well-being, and of the need for a long-term \n     perspective in the use and conservation of renewable \n     resources. To achieve that perspective, this section directs \n     that a Global Renewable Resources Assessment be prepared \n     every 5 years. The Assessment must include: (1) an analysis \n     of national and international renewable resources supply and \n     demand; (2) an inventory of national and international \n     renewable resources, including opportunities to improve their \n     yield of goods and services; (3) an analysis of environmental \n     constraints and their effects on renewable resource \n     production in the U.S. and elsewhere; (4) an analysis of the \n     extent to which the renewable resources management programs \n     of other countries ensure sustainable use and production of \n     such resources; (5) a description of national and \n     international research programs on renewable resources; (6) a \n     discussion of policies, laws, etc. that are expected to \n     affect significantly the use and ownership of public and \n     private renewable resource lands; and (7) recommendations for \n     administrative or legislative initiatives.\n       Sec. 303. National Council on Renewable Resources Policy.--\n     This section establishes the National Council on Renewable \n     Resources Policy. Its functions are the preparation and \n     submission to Congress of the Global Renewable Resources \n     Assessment and the periodic submission to the Forest Service, \n     BLM, and four Committees of Congress of recommendations for \n     administrative and legislative changes or initiatives.\n       The Council has 15 members, 5 each appointed by the \n     President, President pro tempore of the Senate, and Speaker \n     of the House. The Chair is to be selected from the members. \n     This section has typical provisions for filling vacancies, \n     appointment of an Executive Director, compensation of the \n     members and the Executive Director, appointment of personnel, \n     authority to contract with federal agencies, and rulemaking \n     and other powers of the Council.\n       This section strives to ensure the independence of the \n     Council in three ways. First, it requires that the Council \n     submit its budget request concurrently to both the President \n     and the Appropriations Committees of Congress. Second, it \n     requires concurrent submission of the Assessment, analyses, \n     recommendations, and testimony to Executive Branch officials \n     or agencies and the four Committees of Congress. Finally, it \n     prohibits any attempt by a federal official or agency to \n     require prior submission of the Assessment, analyses, \n     recommendations, or testimony for approval, comments, or \n     review.\n       Sec. 304. Repeal of Certain Provisions of the Forest and \n     Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act.--This section \n     repeals those provisions of the Forest and Rangeland \n     Renewable Resources Planning Act that direct the Forest \n     Service to prepare a Renewable Resource Assessment and \n     Renewable Resource Program.\n\n                       TITLE IV--ADMINISTRATION.\n\n                           Part A. In General\n\n       Sec. 401. Confirmation of the Chief of the Forest \n     Service.--This section provides for Senate confirmation of \n     appointments to the office of Chief of the Forest Service, \n     thereby establishing the same appointment procedures as those \n     applicable to the Director of the BLM. This section also sets \n     certain minimum qualifications for the appointee: (1) a \n     degree in a scientific or engineering discipline that is \n     relevant to federal land management; (2) 5 years or more \n     experience in decisionmaking concerning management, or \n     research concerning the management, of federal lands or other \n     public lands; and (3) 5 years or more experience in \n     administering an office or program with a number of employees \n     equal to, or greater than, the average number of employees in \n     national forest supervisors' offices.\n       Sec. 402. Interagency Transfer and Interchange Authority.--\n     This section authorizes the BLM and Forest Service to \n     transfer between them adjacent lands not exceeding 5,000 \n     acres or exchange adjacent lands not exceeding 10,000 acres \n     per transaction. These transactions are: (1) to occur without \n     tranfer of funds; (2) to be effective 30 days or more after \n     publication of Federal Register notice; (3) not to affect any \n     legislative designation for the lands involved; and (4) \n     subject to valid existing rights. In response to the \n     testimony of the President of the Wilderness Society, a \n     proviso is added that absolutely prohibits modification or \n     removal of any special designation of, or any special \n     management direction applicable to, lands transferred or \n     interchanged under this section that was made or provided by \n     statute, except by another Act of Congress. The proviso also \n     provides that administrative designations may be altered or \n     removed only by amendments to the applicable resource \n     management plans.\n       Sec. 403. Commercial Filming Activities.--This section \n     requires the agencies to issue permits and charge fees for \n     commercial filming and still photography on federal lands. It \n     is modelled on S. 568, introduced by Senator Thomas.\n       Criteria for setting the fee for commercial filming are \n     based on the scale of the filming activities and their \n     potential impact on the federal lands. The agencies are also \n     to recover any costs they incur as a result of the filming \n     activities. The agencies are required to issue permits and \n     collect fees for still photography when models or props \n     not part of the federal lands or resources are used, and \n     may issue permits and collect fees when there is a \n     likelihood of resource impact, disruption of public use, \n     or risk to public health or safety.\n       The fees and costs collected under this section are to be \n     retained in a special account in the Treasury and used, \n     without appropriation, for high-priority visitor or resource \n     management activities in the federal land units where the \n     permitted activities occurred.\n       Sec. 404. Visitor Facilities Improvement Demonstration \n     Programs.--This section is modeled on legislation prepared by \n     the Forest Service for the Administration's FY 2000 budget \n     request. It directs the agencies to develop demonstration \n     programs to evaluate the use of private funding for the \n     construction, rehabilitation, maintenance, and operation of \n     federally owned visitor centers on federal lands. Each agency \n     is authorized to undertake up to 15 projects in which \n     individuals, corporations, public agencies, and non-profit \n     groups are selected competitively to develop and operate new, \n     or improve and operate existing, visitor centers. The terms \n     of the projects are to be based on the agencies' estimates of \n     the time necessary for the concessionaires to depreciate \n     their capital investments in the projects, but in no case \n     more than 30 years. When a project is terminated or revoked, \n     the agency or succeeding concessionaire will purchase any \n     remaining value in the capital investment that is not fully \n     depreciated. The agencies are also authorized to sell \n     existing federally owned visitor facilities at fair market \n     value, so long as the purchasers agree that any construction \n     will be consistent with the applicable resource management \n     plans.\n       The agencies are directed to charge concession fees \n     established by the concessionaires' competitive bids, and \n     those fees are to be used, without appropriation, for \n     enhancing\n\n[[Page S8101]]\n\n     visitor services and facilities. The concessionaires must \n     provide bonds 5 years before the end of the projects to \n     ensure that the visitor facilities will be in satisfactory \n     condition for future use. The Secretary of Agriculture and \n     the Secretary of the Interior are each required to submit a \n     report to the four Committees of Congress evaluating the \n     demonstration program and making any appropriate \n     recommendations on whether to make the program permanent.\n       Sec. 405. Fees for Linear Rights-of-Ways.--This section \n     incorporates legislation prepared by the Forest Service for \n     the Administration's FY 2000 budget request. It directs each \n     agency to collect rental fees for all linear rights-of-way \n     for power lines, roads, pipelines, etc. under section 501 of \n     FLPMA and the Act of February 25, 1920, except for rights-of-\n     way that are exempted by law or regulation.\n       Sec. 406. Fees for Processing Records Requests.--To \n     discourage inordinately broad ``fishing expedition'' requests \n     under the Freedom of Information Act that severely tax agency \n     funding and personnel, this section prohibits the waiver or \n     reduction of fees under that Act for any records request to \n     the Forest Service or BLM that will cost in excess of $1000 \n     for a single request or for multiple requests of any one \n     party within a 6-month period.\n       Sec. 407. Off-Budget Study.--The SAF report speculates (pp. \n     27-28) that under certain assumptions the BLM and the Forest \n     Service could become ``self-financing.'' The Committee of \n     Scientists report (p. 179) suggests that ``the Forest Service \n     should consider the development of more self-funding \n     activities to reduce its dependence on appropriated funds.'' \n     To test these speculations and suggestions, this section \n     tasks the GAO with the responsibility to conduct a study for \n     Congress of the feasibility of making the Forest Service and \n     BLM self-supporting by taking the agencies off-budget (no \n     appropriated funds) and returning to them all revenues \n     generated on federal lands (with mineral revenues from \n     national forest lands allocated to the Forest Service), \n     except revenues which by other laws are paid to States and \n     local governments.\n       Sec. 408. Exemption From Strict Liability for the Recovery \n     of Fire Suppression Costs. Section 504 of FLPMA directed the \n     Secretary of the Interior to promulgate regulations governing \n     liability of users of rights-of-way granted under that Act. \n     The subsequent regulations imposed liability without fault \n     for, among other things, the recovery of fire suppression \n     costs of up to $1 million (43 C.F.R. Sec. 2803.1-5). This \n     section would amend section 504 to relieve entities that use \n     the rights-of-way for electrical transmission from strict \n     liability for such costs. This provision does not relieve \n     these entities from liability for fire suppression costs when \n     they are at fault.\n\n                        Part B. Nonfederal Lands\n\n       This part seeks to increase the timeliness and cost \n     efficiency of Forest Service and BLM decisionmaking which \n     directly affects private lands.\n       Sec. 409. Access to Adjacent or Intermingled Nonfederal \n     Lands.--This section establishes procedures for processing \n     applications for access to nonfederal land across federal \n     land as guaranteed by section 1323 of the Alaska National \n     Interests Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA). First, this \n     section requires that the application processing be completed \n     within 180 days and, if it is not, the access be deemed \n     approved. It sets a 15-day deadline for notifying the \n     applicant whether the application is complete. This \n     section makes clear that the analyses conducted under the \n     National Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species \n     Act are to consider the effects of the construction, \n     maintenance and use of the access across the federal lands \n     not the use of the nonfederal lands to be accessed. \n     Finally, it clarifies that any restrictions imposed on the \n     access grant pursuant to section 1323 of ANILCA may limit \n     or condition the construction, maintenance, or use of the \n     access across the federal lands, but not the use of the \n     nonfederal lands to be accessed.\n       Sec. 410. Exchanges of Federal Lands for Nonfederal \n     Lands.--This section establishes procedures for exchanges \n     under, and amends, section 206(b) of FLPMA. As any management \n     activity on any federal lands or interests in lands newly \n     acquired under an exchange will be required to undergo full \n     National Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act \n     review, this section provides that on the exchange itself an \n     EA satisfies the environmental analysis requirements of \n     section 102(2) NEPA and any consultation required under ESA \n     will be completed within 45 days instead of the 90-day period \n     provided by section 7 of ESA. Further, this section provides \n     that any exchange mandated by Congress requires no NEPA \n     documentation. This section also explicitly states that no \n     management activity may be undertaken on the newly acquired \n     federal lands or interests in land until NEPA and ESA are \n     fully complied with and, if necessary, the applicable \n     resource management plan is amended or revised. This section \n     requires that processing of the exchange must be completed \n     within one year of the date of submission of the exchange \n     application. Further, the nonfederal land or interests in \n     land in the exchange are to be appraised without restrictions \n     imposed by federal or State law to protect an environmental \n     value or resource if protection of that value or resource is \n     the very reason why the land is being acquired by the federal \n     government.\n       This section also allows the Forest Service and BLM to \n     offer for competitive bid the exchange of federal lands or \n     interests in land that meets certain conditions. It also \n     authorizes the agencies to identify early or ``prequalify'' \n     federal lands or interests in land for exchange. Further, \n     when an exchange involves school trust lands, the agency is \n     excused from conducting a cultural assessment under section \n     106 of the National Historic Preservation Act if it enters \n     into an agreement with the State that ensures State \n     protection after the exchange of archaeological resources or \n     sites to the maximum extent practicable. Further, this \n     section authorizes the Forest Service to exchange federally \n     owned subsurface resources within the National Forest System \n     or acquired under the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937.\n       This section establishes special funds with a cap of \n     $12,000,000 for the agencies to use, subject to \n     appropriations, for processing land exchanges (including \n     making cash equalization payments where required to equalize \n     values of exchange properties). Finally, the maximum value of \n     lands in an exchange which may be undertaken on the basis of \n     approximately equal value (rather than strictly equal value) \n     is raised from $150,000 to $500,000.\n\n                      Part C. The Forest Resource\n\n       This part contains 5 sections concerning sales of forest \n     products on federal lands. This bill drops a provision \n     contained in its predecessors that allowed bidding on timber \n     sales for the express purpose of protecting--not harvesting--\n     the trees. This provision had the distinction of garnering \n     opposition from both the timber industry and the \n     environmental community.\n       Sec. 411. Timber Sale Preparation User Fee.--This section \n     is modeled on legislation prepared by the Forest Service for \n     the Administration's FY 2000 budget request. It authorizes \n     the agencies to develop 8-year pilot programs to recover from \n     timber purchasers the direct costs of timber sale preparation \n     and harvest administration. Alternatively, purchasers can \n     elect to contract with parties on approved agency lists to \n     conduct timber sale administration activities. Exempted from \n     collection under the programs would be the costs of complying \n     with the National Environmental Policy Act, conducting \n     stewardship timber sales under section 347 of the fiscal year \n     1999 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, and \n     conducting timber sales where the fees would adversely affect \n     the sales' marketability or the ability of small businesses \n     to bid on the sales. Fees collected are to be used to pay for \n     the administration of the pilot programs.\n       Sec. 412. Forest Health Credits in Sales of Forest \n     Products.--This section provides the Forest Service and BLM \n     with an optional approach to undertaking forest health \n     management activities that would be impractical for the \n     agencies to accomplish under existing procedures or within \n     existing programs. This approach permits the agencies to \n     include new provisions in the standard contract provisions \n     for any salvage sale of forest products or any sale of forest \n     products constituting a forest health enhancement project \n     under section 413. These new provisions would obligate the \n     purchaser to undertake certain forest health management \n     activities which could logically be performed as part of the \n     sale. In return, the purchaser receives ``forest health \n     credits'' to offset the cost of performing the activities \n     against the purchaser's payment for the forest products. \n     These forest health management activities are subject to the \n     same contractual requirements as all other harvesting \n     activities. Sale contracts with these forest health credits \n     provisions are to have terms of no more than 3 years.\n       Before forest health credits provisions can be included in \n     a contract of sale of forest products, the agency concerned \n     has to identify and select the specific forest health \n     management activities. Forest health activities would be \n     eligible for forest health credits if the agency concerned \n     finds that: (1) they would address the effects of the \n     operation of the sale or past sales, or involve vegetation \n     management within the sale area; and (2) they could be \n     accomplished most effectively when performed as part of the \n     sale contract, and would not likely be performed otherwise. \n     Forest health management activities are defined to include \n     thinning, salvage, stand improvement, reforestation, \n     prescribed burning or other fuels management, insect or \n     disease control, riparian or other habitat improvement, or \n     other activity which has any of 5 purposes: improve forest \n     health; safeguard human life, property, and communities; \n     protect other forest resources threatened by adverse forest \n     health conditions; restore the integrity of ecosystems, \n     watersheds, and habitats damaged by adverse forest health \n     conditions; or protect federal investments in forest \n     resources and future federal, State, and local revenues.\n       Once the determination is made to add forest health \n     management activities requirements to a sale of forest \n     products, the specific activities are identified, and their \n     costs are appraised, the required activities and the forest \n     health credits assigned to those activities are identified in \n     the sale's advertisement and prospectus. (After the sale, the \n     agency, with the concurrence of a sale purchaser, can alter \n     the scope of the forest health management activities or \n     amount of credits when warranted by changed conditions.) This \n     section provides that sales with forest health credits need \n     not return more\n\n[[Page S8102]]\n\n     revenues than they cost and are not to be considered in \n     determining the revenue effects of individual forest, Forest \n     Service region, or national forest products sales programs.\n       Appropriated funds can be used to offset the costs of \n     forest health management activities prescribed in a forest \n     products sale contract (typically when the total cost of such \n     activities would otherwise exceed the value of the offered \n     forest products materials or likely dampen competitive \n     interest in the sale), but only if those funds are derived \n     from the resource function or functions which would directly \n     benefit from the performance of the activities and are \n     appropriated in the fiscal year in which the sale is offered. \n     The amount of any appropriated funds to be paid for forest \n     health management activities under a sale contract also must \n     be announced in the sale's advertisement and prospectus.\n       All forest health credits earned by the purchaser are \n     redeemable. Earned forest health credits can be transferred \n     to any other sale of forest products held by the purchaser \n     which is located in the same region of the Forest Service or \n     same jurisdiction of the BLM State office, as the case may \n     be. The credits are considered ``earned'' when the \n     purchaser satisfactorily performs the forest health \n     management activity to which the credits are assigned in \n     the sale advertisement. If the purchaser normally would be \n     required to pay for all the forest products materials \n     prior to completion of a forest health management activity \n     or activities assigned forest health credits, the \n     purchaser could elect to defer a portion of the final \n     payment for the harvested materials equal to the forest \n     health credits assigned to the activity.\n       This section sunsets in 5 years, but previously awarded \n     contracts for sale of forest products with forest health \n     credits provisions remain in effect under the terms of this \n     section after that time. To assist the Congress in \n     determining whether this section should be reenacted, the \n     Forest Service and BLM are required to monitor the \n     performance of sales contracts with forest health credits and \n     submit a joint report to Congress assessing the contracts' \n     effectiveness and whether continued use of such contracts is \n     advised.\n       Sec. 413. Special Funds.--This section gives permanent \n     status to the funds for salvage sales of forest products of \n     the Forest Service and BLM and expands their purposes to \n     allow use of the fund monies for a full array of forest \n     health enhancement projects.\n       Sec. 414. Private Contractors.--To ensure that processing \n     of sales of forest products is accomplished in a timely \n     manner in an era of severe budget and personnel constraints, \n     this section encourages that the agencies, to the maximum \n     extent possible, use private contractors to prepare the \n     sales. To ensure the integrity of sale decisionmaking, this \n     section also requires the agencies to review the contractors' \n     work before making any decisions on the sales and bars the \n     contractors from commenting on or participating in the sales' \n     decisions.\n       Sec. 415. Special Forest Products.--This section is modeled \n     on legislation prepared by the Forest Service for the \n     Administration's FY 2000 budget request. It directs the \n     Forest Service to collect fees for the fair market value \n     (established by appraisal methods or bidding procedures) of \n     special forest products harvested from national forest lands \n     and the costs for authorizing and monitoring the harvesting. \n     Special forest products are defined as any vegetation or \n     other life form not excluded from fees by regulation. The \n     Forest Service is to use the fair market value fees collected \n     under this section for conducting inventories of special \n     forest products and assessing and addressing any impacts from \n     harvesting activities, and the recovered costs for \n     administration of the program.\n\n                         TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n       Sec. 501. Regulations.--This section requires the Forest \n     Service and BLM to promulgate rules to implement this \n     legislation within a year and a half of its enactment.\n       Sec. 502. Authorization of Appropriations.--This section \n     authorizes appropriations to implement this legislation for \n     10 fiscal years after enactment. It also sunsets at the same \n     time all other statutory authorizations for appropriations to \n     the Forest Service and BLM for management of the federal \n     lands.\n       Sec. 503. Effective Date.--This section provides that this \n     legislation will take effect upon its enactment, and \n     admonishes that no decision or action authorized by this \n     legislation is to be delayed pending rulemaking.\n       Sec. 504. Savings Clauses.--This section ensures that \n     nothing in this legislation conflicts with the law pertaining \n     to the revested Oregon and California Railroad and Coos Bay \n     Wagon Road grant lands in Oregon. Further, this section bars \n     construing any provision of this legislation as terminating \n     any valid lease, permit, right-of-way, or other right or \n     authorization of use of the federal land existing upon \n     enactment and as altering in any way any Native American \n     treaty right. Finally, this section provides that all actions \n     under this legislation are subject to valid existing rights.\n       Sec. 505. Severability.--This final section contains the \n     standard severability clause.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1321. A bill to amend title III of the Family Violence Prevention \nand Services Act and title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct of 1965 to limit the effects of domestic violence on the lives of \nchildren, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n     children who witness domestic violence protection act of 1999\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Children \nWho Witness Domestic Violence Protection Act. My legislation, which I \nam joined by Senator Murray in offering today, is a comprehensive first \nstep towards confronting the impact that witnessing domestic violence \nhas on children. This bill addresses the issue from multiple \nperspectives, including mental health, education, child protection \nservices, supervised visitation centers, law enforcement, and crisis \nnurseries.\n  There are many facets to the serious problem we have with violence in \nour country. The evening news brings violent images from around the \nworld into our homes every day. We also witness through various media \nthe violent images or hear stories of violence that has occurred in our \nown communities and in our schools like Columbine High.\n  Images of violence bombard our children from the movies, video games, \nor from television programs. But there is a type of violence in the \nlives of America's children that is not in the spotlight. Increasingly, \nchildren are witnessing real-life violence in their homes. In fact, it \nis in their own homes that many children witness violence for the first \ntime.\n  Over 3 million children are witnessing violence in their homes each \nyear, and it is having a profound impact on their development.\n  Frequently, these children are physically injured by the violence. \nBut always, they carry with them lasting emotional sears from having \nbeen exposed to the threat and trauma of injury, assault or killing. \nThis exposure to domestic violence changes the way children view the \nworld. It may change the value they place on life itself. It affects \ntheir ability to learn, to establish relationships, and to cope with \nstress.\n  Witnessing domestic violence has such a profound impact on children, \nplacing them at high risk for anxiety, depression, and, potentially, \nsuicide. Further, these child victims may exhibit more aggressive, \nantisocial, and fearful behaviors. They are also at greater risk of \nbecoming future offenders.\n  Studies indicate that children who witness their fathers beating \ntheir mothers suffer emotional problems, including slowed development, \nsleep disturbances, and feelings of helplessness, depression and \nanxiety. Many of these children exhibit more aggressive, anti-social, \nfearful and inhibited behaviors. They also show lower social competence \nthan other children.\n  Children from homes where their mothers were abused have also shown \nless skill in understanding how others feel and in examining situations \nfrom the other's perspective when compared to children from non-violent \nhouseholds. Even one episode of violence can produce post-traumatic \nstress disorder in children.\n  Exposure to family violence, many studies suggest, is the strongest \npredictor of violent delinquent behavior among adolescents. It is \nestimated that between 20 and 40 percent of chronically violent \nadolescents have witnessed extreme parental conflict.\n  Recent studies have demonstrated that up to 50% of children who come \nbefore the juvenile dependency court on allegations of abuse and \nneglect have been exposed to domestic violence in their homes.\n  In a Justice Department funded study of children in Rochester, NY, \nchildren who had grown up in families where domestic violence occurred \nwere 21 percent more likely to report violent delinquency than those \nnot so exposed. Children exposed to multiple forms of family violence \nreported twice the rate of youth violence as those from nonviolent \nfamilies.\n\n  A 1994 survey of 115 mothers in the waiting room of Boston City \nHospital's Primary Care Clinic found that by age 6, one in ten children \nhad witnessed a knifing or shooting. An additional 18 percent of the \nchildren under six had witnesses pushing, hitting or shoving. Half of \nthe reported violence occurred in the child's home.\n  Many children actually see their father, stepfather, or mother's \nboyfriend\n\n[[Page S8103]]\n\nnot only beat their mothers but rape them as well. Although some \nparents believe that they succeed in shielding their children from the \nbatterer's aggression, children often provide detailed accounts of the \nvery events which adults report they did not witness. Reports by \nchildren and by adults of their memories of childhood experience \nindicate that parents severely underestimate the extent to which their \nchildren are exposed to violence.\n  Children who witness domestic violence are traumatized and need \nsupport. Who is a child going to turn to when their mother is the \nvictim of their father? Who is a child going to talk to when their \nsibling has emotionally shut down and no longer speaks? Who is a child \ngoing to go to for help when they need assistance?\n  Children have the right to know that what is happening in their home \nis wrong. Children have the right to feel that we are about their \nsafety.'\n  This bill addresses the issue from multiple perspective including \nmental health, education, children protection services, supervised \nvisitation centers, law enforcement, and crisis nurseries.\n  There are some creative programs in this country that are forging \npartnerships in their communities to meet the needs of traumatized \nchildren. I have visited such programs in Boston, San Francisco and \nMinnesota.\n  More must be done.\n  To address the devastating impact that witnessing domestic violence \nhas on the mental health of children, my legislation provides nonprofit \nagencies with the funds needed to design and implement multi-system \ninterventions for child witnesses. This partnerships would involve the \ncourts, schools, health care providers, child protective services, \nbattered women's programs and others. Promoting collaboration and \ncoordination among all the professionals involved can broaden the \ncommunity's response to the child.\n  This response would include developing and providing: Guidenace to \nevaluate the need of child witnesses; safety and security procedures \nfor child witnesses and their families; counseling and advocacy for \nfamilies of child witnesses; mental health treatment services; and \noutreach and training to community professionals.\n  My legislation also encourages collaboration between domestic \nviolence community agencies and schools to provide educational \nprogramming and support services for students and staff. Domestic \nviolence agencies will work with schools to provide: Training for \nschool officials about domestic violence and its impact on children; \neducational programming and materials on domestic violence for \nstudents; and support services, such as counselors, for students and \nschool officials.\n  Among the many detrimental impacts of witnessing domestic violence, \nchildren exposed to domestic violence are at high risk for learning \ndifficulties and school failure. Research indicates that children \nresiding in shelters show significantly lower verbal and quantitive \nskills when compared to children nationally. These deficits, when \ncoupled with the impact on children's behavioral and emotional \nfunctioning, demand that schools be able to understand and address the \nneeds of children who have witnessed domestic violence. Further, \nservice providers continue to find that the occurrence of domestic \nviolence could be detected sooner if various points of contact with the \nfamily had been better trained to recognize the indicators of such \nfamily violence.\n\n  Children cannot always compartmentalize traumatic events--instead the \ndomestic violence comes to school with each and every child witness. It \nundermines their school performance, and their relationship with other \nchildren.\n  This legislation also addresses domestic violence and the people who \nwork to protect our children from abuse and neglect. There is a \nsignificant overlap between domestic violence and child abuse. In \nfamilies where one form of family violence exists, there is a \nlikelihood that the other does, too. In a national survey, researchers \nfound that 50 percent of the men who frequently assaulted their wives \nalso frequently abused their children.\n  The problem is that Child Protective Services and domestic violence \norganizations have separately set up programs to address one of these \nforms of violence, yet few address both when they occur together in \nfamilies. My bill creates incentives for local governments to \ncollaborate with domestic violence agencies in administering their \nchild welfare programs.\n  Under my legislation, funds will be awarded to States and local \ngovernments to work collaboratively with community-based domestic \nviolence programs to: Provide training to the staff, supervisors, and \nadministrators of child welfare service agencies and domestic violence \nprograms, including staff responsible for screening, intake, \nassessment, and investigation of reports of child abuse and neglect; \nassist agencies in recognizing that the overlap between child abuse and \ndomestic violence places both children and adult victims in danger; \ndevelop relevant protocols for screening, intake, assessment, \ninvestigation, and interventions; and increase the safety and well-\nbeing of child witnesses of domestic violence as well as the safety of \nthe non-abusing parent.\n  Another important part of my legislation is funding to increase the \navailability of supervised visitation centers. Since domestic violence \noften escalates during separation and divorce, and visitation is \nfrequently used as an opportunity for abuse, this provision is designed \nto shield children from further exposure to violence. It creates a \ngrants program which domestic violence service providers can apply for \non a competitive basis to create family visitation centers. Use of \nthese centers can minimize stressful and potentially dangerous \ninteractions among family members. In addition, the centers provide \njudges with a further tool to deal with problematic visitations when \nthere has been a history of violence.\n  On July 3, 1996 5 year old Brandon and 4 year old Alex were murdered \nby their father during an unsupervised visit. Their mother Angela was \nseparated from Kurt Frank, the children's father. During her marriage, \nAngela was physically and emotionally abused by Frank, and Frank had \nhit Brandon and split open his lip when he stepped in front of his \nmother during a domestic violence incident. Angela had an Order of \nProtection against Kurt Frank, but during custody hearings her request \nfor her husband to only receive supervised visits was rejected. Kurt \nFrank murdered his two sons during an unsupervised visit. We must do \nbetter for the 3 million children witnesses still living out there.\n  Law enforcement officers are those who find traumatized children \nhiding behind doors, beneath furniture, in closets. They are generally \nthe first to arrive and their ability to recognize and address the \nneeds of the children is critical.\n  This bill provides further training to law enforcement officers \nregarding the appropriate treatment of children who have witnessed \ndomestic violence. Police officers will be trained in child development \nand issues related to domestic violence so that they may: Recognize the \nneeds of children who have witnessed domestic violence; meet children's \nimmediate needs at the scene of the crime; and establish a \ncollaborative working relationship between police officers and local \ndomestic violence service agencies.\n\n  Families faced with domestic violence also need a safe place for \ntheir children during times of crisis.\n  This legislation provides funds to States to assist private and \npublic agencies and organizations to provide crisis nurseries for \nchildren who are abused, neglected, at risk of abuse or neglect, or who \nare in families receiving child protective services. Nurseries will be \navailable to provide a safe place for children and to alleviate the \nsocial and emotional stress among children and families impacted by \ndomestic violence.\n  In conclusion, we must pass this legislation for children who are \ntraumatized by what they have seen. We must pass this legislation for \nchildren like Brandon and Alex who deserve to have our protection from \nharm.\n  Please join me in the protection of children who witness domestic \nviolence.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the summary of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8104]]\n\n Children Who Witness Domestic Violence Protection Act of 1999--Summary\n\n  The Children Who witness Domestic Violence Protection Act is a \ncomprehensive first step toward confronting the impact that witnessing \ndomestic violence has on children. Over 3 million children in the \nUnited States witness domestic violence in their homes each year. These \nchildren are at a high risk for aggression, depression, learning \ndifficulties, school failure, delinquency, and even suicide. The \nattitudes a child develops concerning the use of violence and conflict \nresolution in their own relationship are also affected. Further, \nchildren living in homes where domestic violence occurs are at a \ngreater risk of being abused themselves. This bill addresses the needs \nof children witnesses domestic violence by providing for mental health \nservices, education programs, child protection services, supervised \nvisitation centers, the training and support of law enforcement \npersonnel, and crisis nurseries.\n\n\n                             mental health\n\n  Multi-System Interventions for Children Who Witness Domestic \nViolence.\n  This bill will provide nonprofit agencies with funding to bring \nvarious service providers together to design and implement intervention \nprograms for children who witness domestic violence. These working \npartnerships will involve counselors, courts, schools, health care \nproviders, battered women's programs and others. Intervention programs \nwill include counseling and advocacy for child witnesses and their \nfamilies, strategies to ensure the safety and security of the children \nand their families, and outreach and training to community \nprofessionals about the issue of children witnessing domestic violence. \nFunds can be use to develop new programs or to carry out programs that \nhave been successful in other communities. Authorization of \nappropriations for the multi-system interventions is $5,000,000 for 3 \nyears (totaling $15,000,000).\n\n\n                               Education\n\n  Combatting the Impact of Witnessing Domestic Violence on Elementary \nand Secondary School Children.\n  This bill will create opportunities for domestic violence community \nagencies and elementary and secondary schools to work together to \naddress the needs of children who witness domestic violence. Domestic \nviolence agencies will work with schools to provide domestic violence \ntraining to school officials so they can understand how witnessing \ndomestic violence affects the children in their schools. Educational \nprogramming and materials will be provided to students to they can \nlearn about the problem. Also, support services such as counselors will \nbe provided for students and school officials to help address the \nproblems of children witnessing domestic violence. Authorization of \nappropriations for combating the impact of witnessing domestic violence \non school children is $5,000,000 for 3 years (totaling $15,000,000).\n\n\n                       child protection services\n\n  Child Welfare Worker Training on Domestic Violence.\n  This bill will provide training to both child welfare and domestic \nviolence workers to assist them in recognizing the treating domestic \nviolence as a serious problem threatening the safety and well being of \nboth children and adults. Funds will be awarded to States and local \ngovernments to work with one or more community-based programs to \nprovide training and assistance to workers in the area of domestic \nviolence as it relates to cases of child welfare.\n  Training will include teaching staff to recognize the overlap between \nchild abuse and domestic violence which places both children and adult \nvictims in danger, and developing methods for identifying the presence \nof domestic violence in child welfare cases. Staff will also be taught \nhow to increase the safety and well-being of child witnesses of \ndomestic violence as well as the safety of the non-abusing parent. \nProtocols will be developed with law enforcement, probation and other \njustice agencies in order to ensure that justice system interventions \nand protections are readily available for victims of domestic violence \nserved by the social service agency.\n  Authorization of appropriations for child welfare worker training is \n$5,000,000 for 3 years (totaling $15,000,000).\n\n\n                     supervised visitation centers\n\n  This bill increases the availability of visitation centers for visits \nand visitation exchange of child witnesses and their parents. It \nprovides money which domestic violence service providers can use to \nestablish an operate supervised visitation centers.

Police officers \nwill be trained in child development and issues related to domestic \nviolence so that they may recognize the needs of children who have \nwitnessed domestic violence. Police officers will be taught how to meet \nchildren's immediate needs at the scene of violence. Authorization of \nappropriations for law enforcement officer training from the Violent \nCrime Reduction Trust Fund is $3,000,000 for 3 years (totaling \n$9,000,000).\n\n\n                            crisis nurseries\n\n  This bill provides funds to States to assist private and public \nagencies and organizations to provide crisis nurseries for children. \nFamilies faced with domestic violence need a safe place for their \nchildren during times of crisis. Authorization of appropriations for \ncrisis nurseries of $15,000,000 for 3 years (totaling $45,000,000).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. \n        Kenendy):\n  S. 1322. A bill to prohibit health insurance and employment \ndiscrimination against individuals and their family members on the \nbasis of predictive genetic information or genetic services; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\nTHE GENETIC NONDISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH INSURANCE AND EMPLOYMENT ACT OF \n                                  1999\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today, with my colleagues Senators \nKennedy, Harkin, and Dodd, I announce the introduction of the Genetic \nNondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act of 1999, a \npiece of legislation designed to stop genetic discrimination. The \nadvent of testing for genes that indicate a predisposition to disease \nhas presented us with a new series of opportunities and challenges. \nWhile prior awareness of susceptibility to disease offers millions the \nchance to take preventive measures that will help them live healthier \nand longer lives, there also exists the possibility that genetic \ninformation will be misused. It is for that reason that we Democrats \nfeel strongly that measures must be taken to ensure that health \ninsurers may not discriminate against patients on the basis of \npredictive genetic information, and that employers may not discriminate \nagainst employees in the provision of health insurance or by \nwithholding job benefits as a result of the improper use of genetic \ninformation.\n  When the Patients' Bill of Rights reaches the floor after the July \nrecess, we hope to offer this bill as an amendment to the bill under \nconsideration. This issue, like many others, exposes a fault line \nbetween the Republican and Democratic approach to health insurance \nreform.\n  Scientific advances now make it possible to identify genes that \nindicate a predisposition to disease. For example, tests for genes \nassociated with hereditary breast cancer are commercially available. \nGenetic information may prove highly beneficial in areas related to \nprevention, treatment, diet, or lifestyle. While this is profoundly \ngood news for patients, it also raises fears regarding how genetic \ninformation will be used in the workplace. Advances in genetic and \nscreening, accelerated by the Human Genome Project at the National \nInstitutes of Health, increase physicians' ability to detect genetic \nmutations. These technologies and their resulting genomic data will \nenhance medical science, but may also lead to discrimination.\n  Regrettably, many employers may not hire individuals whom they \nbelieve will require time off or medical treatment at some point in the \nfuture due to a genetically transmitted disease. Equally disturbing, \nemployers may simply deny insurance coverage to employees who they \nbelieve are predisposed to genetic disease. This discrimination could \nresult despite the\n\n[[Page S8105]]\n\nfact that genetic testing only indicates that an individual may be \npredisposed to a disease--not necessarily whether that disease will \ndevelop.\n  This issue is already touching the lives of many Americans. For \nexample, a survey last year by the American Management Association of \nover 1,000 companies indicated that 5% of responding employers \ncurrently do genetic testing of their employees. While that number may \nsound small, its more than the number of companies who test for HIV \nstatus. And of those companies who do genetic testing on their \nemployees, 19% have chosen not to hire an individual and 10% have \ndismissed an employee based on the genetic test results.\n  Anecdotal evidence suggests that fear of discrimination already has \ninhibited people who may be susceptible to disease from getting genetic \ntesting. In some cases, this means that gene carriers will miss out on \nearly diagnosis, treatment or even prevention. If consumers avoid \ntaking advantage of available diagnostic tests out of fear of \ndiscrimination, they may suffer much more serious--and more expensive--\nhealth problems in the long run.\n  That is why our proposal to ban employment discrimination is clearly \nsupported by the American people. A recent national poll by the \nNational Center for Genome Resources demonstrates that an overwhelming \nmajority of those surveyed--85%--think that employers should be \nprohibited from obtaining information about an individual's genetic \nconditions, risks, and predispositions.\n  We will pay the price in more than increased health care costs if we \nallow genetic information to be used in a discriminatory manner. \nDiscrimination based on genetic factors can be as unjust as that based \non race, national origin, religion, sex or disability. In each case, \npeople are treated inequitably, not because of their inherent \nabilities, but solely because of irrelevant characteristics. Genetic \ndiscrimination that excludes qualified individuals from employment robs \nthe marketplace of skills, energy, and imagination. Finally, genetic \ndiscrimination undercuts the Human Genome Project's fundamental purpose \nof promoting public health. Investing resources in the Human Genome \nProject is justified by the benefits of identifying, preventing and \ndeveloping effective treatments for disease. But if fear of \ndiscrimination deters people from genetic diagnosis or from confiding \nin physicians and genetic counselors, and makes them more concerned \nwith job loss than with care and treatment, our understanding of the \nhumane genome will be for naught.\n  Because genetic information could be used unfairly, Congress must \nexpand the scope of its anti-discrimination laws to include a ban on \ngenetic discrimination. Our bill has three major components: (1) it \nforbids employers from discriminating in hiring or in the terms and \nconditions of employment on the basis of genetic information, (2) it \nforbids health insurers from discriminating against individuals on the \nbasis of genetic information, and (3) it prevents the disclosure of \ngenetic information to people who have no legitimate need for the \ninformation: health insurers, health insurance data banks, or to \nemployers.\n  Now, before the use of genetic information becomes widespread, we \nmust make sure that dramatic scientific advances do not have negative \nconsequences for the public. We have an historic opportunity to preempt \nthis problem. I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, over the past decade the science of \nidentifying genetic markers for diseases has evolved at an astonishing \npace. For an increasing number of Americans science fiction has become \nreality--their doctors can now scan their unique genetic blueprints and \npredict the likelihood of their developing diseases like cancer, \nAlzheimer's or Parkinson's.\n  Armed with this knowledge, individuals and families can make informed \ndecisions about their health care including, in some cases, even taking \nsteps to prevent the disease or to detect and treat it early.\n  Unfortunately, phenomenal advances in our knowledge about genetics \nhave outpaced the protections currently provided in law. Thus, the \npotential also exists for this remarkable new information--which is \nmaking such a difference in people's lives in terms of their health--\nthis information could always be used by health insurers, employers, or \nothers to deny health coverage or job opportunities to people.\n  We know the Federal and State laws currently offer only a patchwork \nof protections against the misuse of genetic information. While the \nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 took \nimportant first steps toward prohibiting genetic discrimination in \nhealth insurance, it left large gaps. For example, it does not prohibit \ninsurers from requiring genetic testing or from disclosing genetic \ninformation and offers no protection at all for people who must buy \ntheir insurance in the individual market.\n  While several States--including my own--have enacted legislation \nprohibiting health insurance discrimination, these laws cannot protect \nmore than 51 million American individuals in employer-sponsored, \n``self-funded'' health plans. Additionally, few States have chosen to \naddress the issue of employment discrimination or the separate issue of \nthe privacy of genetic records.\n  I have personal experience that this issue is not a partisan issue. \nTwo years ago, my distinguished friend and colleague from New Mexico, \nSenator Domenici, and I introduced one of the first bills on this \ncritical topic addressing both insurance and employment discrimination.\n  Last year, along with many of my Democratic colleagues, I joined \nSenator Snowe of Maine in supporting strong legislation protecting \npatients from genetic discrimination in insurance.\n  Today I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator Daschle, Senator \nHarkin, and Senator Kennedy, in introducing comprehensive legislation \nto safeguard the privacy of genetic information and to prohibit health \ninsurance or employment discrimination based on genetic information.\n  Specifically, this legislation, which we call the Genetic \nNondiscrimination Health Insurance and Employment Act, would prohibit \nhealth insurers from discriminating based on genetic predisposition to \nan illness or condition and would prevent insurers from requiring \napplicants for health insurance to submit to genetic testing.\n  This bill would also address the concerns about employment \ndiscrimination by preventing employers from firing or refusing to hire \nindividuals who may be susceptible to a genetic condition.\n  Finally, this legislation would hold employers and insurers \naccountable by imposing strong penalties on those who violate these \nprevious just stated provisions.\n  In a few short years researchers will have the ability to translate \nthe entire genetic code, revealing each individual's unique genetic \nblueprint. It is an astonishing prospect. Last year, in a visit I made \nto Yale University's Genetic Testing Center, I had the opportunity to \nsee into the future and glimpse cutting-edge uses of this technology. I \nalso had the opportunity to hear of the fears expressed by patients at \nthis center.\n  As an aside, we are talking about predisposition. We are now reaching \na point on breast cancer in women, through tests being done over the \nyears on twins, where we are able to determine almost at birth the \nlikelihood or the probability of a woman contracting breast cancer at \nthe time of that child's birth--looking into the future based on the \ngenetic markers.\n  That is profound information. It could make a huge difference to be \nable to know early on about a predisposition based upon your genetic \nmakeup, knowing you have a probability or a likelihood later in life of \ncontracting certain diseases. That allows that individual and that \nfamily early on to take the steps through diet and/or mediation, \nprescriptions, and so forth, to avoid the possibility of contracting \nthese dreaded diseases. That is the great news. It is phenomenal. It is \nhappening at such a pace, it is hard to believe.\n  As we gather this information that a person may be, based upon their \ngenetic makeup, susceptible to breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's \ndisease, or other forms of cancer, that information ought to be \nprotected. I believe it should. It is one thing if you\n\n[[Page S8106]]\n\nhave a condition and you keep that from an employer and they hire you \nand they want to know whether or not you have a condition. I don't \nthink anyone ought to be allowed to deny revealing information that an \nemployer ought to have. But a predisposition--that information ought \nnot to deprive you of a job or health insurance just because that \ngenetic information indicates that may be the case.\n  This is what happens. While I visited this wonderful Genetic Testing \nCenter at Yale University, I met with some patients and the researchers \nwho do this work. They asked me to pay attention and listen to a couple \nof patients with whom they work.\n  Keith Hall has been a patient at Yale for several years, since he was \nfirst diagnosed with something called tuberous sclerosis. Let me \nexplain what that is. It is a genetic disease that causes tumors of the \nbrain, kidney, and other organs, and sometimes mental retardation. \nKeith, obviously, worries about what will happen to his insurance if he \never has to switch jobs with that condition.\n  I also met with Ashley Przybylski, an 11-year-old girl from Oxford, \nCT. Ashley suffers from a genetic nutritional disorder that can cause \nseizures and brain damage. Currently, the family insurance covers the \nexorbitant cost of medication that keeps her healty--about $33,000 a \nyear. Ashley faces the prospect of being denied coverage when she gets \nolder.\n  While we as a nation welcome these scientific achievements--we will \nbe able to determine in the case of both Keith and Ashley that they \nhave a predisposition for tuberous sclerosis or genetic nutritional \ndisorders--if both this child and this individual were to be denied \nemployment or insurance because of a genetic predisposition because \nthat information becomes available, that is wrong and should be \ncorrected.\n  This legislation is designed to try to provide this kind of \nprotection to people as we move forward with the wonderful information \ngathering of genetic information.\n  The issue is too important to ignore for another year. Each day that \npasses, more individuals suffer discrimination. Each day we fail to \nact, more families are forced to make decisions about genetic testing \nbased not on health care but on fear.\n  I pledge my commitment to ensuring that progress on the Human Genome \nProject is matched against the potential discrimination in establishing \nsome fundamental rights of privacy.\n  I welcome comments from my colleagues and others who may be \ninterested in being a part of this effort to try to get ahead of the \ncurve as we deal with the wonderful news of genetic marking that can \nmake such a difference in people's lives.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, genetic discrimination is a terribly \nimportant issue and one that I have been following for quite some time \nnow. I am pleased to be here today with Senator Daschle, Senator Dodd, \nand Senator Kenendy to introduce the ``Genetic Non-discrimination in \nHealth Insurance and Employment Act of 1999.''\n  The advances we have made recently in the study of the human gene are \nmind-boggling. The identification of a number of disease-related genes \nis providing scientists with important new tools for understanding the \nunderlying mechanisms for many illnesses. Genomic technologies have the \npotential to lead to better diagnosis and treatment, and ultimately to \nthe prevention and cure of many diseases and disabilities.\n  Yet discrimination in health insurance and employment, and the fear \nof potential discrimination, threaten our ability to conduct the very \nresearch we need to understand, treat, and prevent genetic disease. \nMoreover, discrimination--and the fear of discrimination--threaten our \nability to use new genetic technologies to improve human health.\n  Let me give you just a few examples:\n  In the early 1970's some insurance companies denied coverage and some \nemployers denied jobs to African-Americans who were identified as \ncarriers for sicklecell anemia, even though they were healthy and would \nnever develop the disease.\n  More recently, in a survey of people in families with genetic \ndisorders, 22% indicated that they, or a member of their family, had \nbeen refused health insurance on the basis of their genetic \ninformation.\n  And a number of researchers have been unable to get individuals to \nparticipate in cancer genetics research. Fear of discrimination is \ncited as the reason why.\n  But this is more than just about numbers and anonymous individuals, \nit's about real people--including my own family. As many of you know, \nboth my sisters died from breast cancer. And other members of my family \nmight be at risk. Should I counsel them to get tested for the BRCA1 and \nBRCA2 mutations? Should I counsel them to disclose our family history \nto their health care providers?\n  Right now, I'm torn. I know that if my family is to have access to \nthe best available interventions and preventive care, they should get \ntested, and they should disclose our family's medical history to their \nphysicians. But, conversely, if they are to get any health care at all, \nthey must have access to health insurance. Without strong protections \nagainst discrimination, access to health insurance is currently in \nquestion.\n  In 1995, I introduced an amendment during the markup of the Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act. My amendment clarified \nthat group health plans could not establish eligibility, continuation, \nenrollment, or contribution requirements based on genetic information. \nMy amendment became part of the manager's package that went to the \nfloor, and it ultimately became law.\n\n  HIPAA is a good first step. We should be proud of that legislation. \nYet if our goal is to ensure that individuals have access to health \ninsurance coverage and to employment opportunities--regardless of their \ngenetic makeup--we must pass comprehensive anti-discrimination \nprotections.\n  Our proposed legislation offers such protections. Let me describe \nthem in brief:\n  First, this legislation prohibits insurers and employers from \ndiscriminating on the basis of genetic information. It is essential to \nprohibit discrimination both at work and in health insurance coverage. \nIf we only prohibit discrimination in the insurance context, employers \nwho are worried about future increased medical costs will simply not \nhire individuals who have a genetic predisposition to a particular \ndisease.\n  Second, under our proposal, health insurance companies are prohibited \nfrom disclosing genetic information to other insurance companies, \nindustry-wide data banks, and employers. If we really want to prevent \ndiscrimination, we should not let genetic information get into the \nwrong hands.\n  Finally, if protections against genetic discrimination are to have \nteeth, we must include strong penalties and remedies to deter employers \nand insurers from discriminating in the first place.\n  In closing, let me say that this legislation will ensure that every \nAmerican will enjoy the latest advances in scientific research and \nhealth care delivery, without fear of retribution on the basis of their \nsensitive genetic information. All of us should be concerned about this \nissue, because all of us have genetic information that could be used \nagainst us. As we move into the new millennium, everyone should enjoy \nthe benefits of 21st century technologies--and not be harmed by 21st \ncentury discrimination.\n  I applaud the committment of my fellow co-sponsors on this important \nissue and look forward to working with the rest of my colleagues to \npass federal legislation that will prohibit genetic discrimination in \nthe workplace and in health insurance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Nation is making extraordinary \nprogress in biomedical research. The National Institutes of Health will \nhave developed a working draft of the entire human genome by next \nspring. Comprehensive knowledge of the genetic sequence will enable \nresearchers to identify large numbers of mutations associated with \ndisease. Understanding the molecular basis of hereditary diseases will \nexpedite the search for more effective treatments and cures. The \nbenefits for patients are likely to be unparalleled in the history of \nmedicine.\n  But this new scientific knowledge also raises a number of ethical, \nlegal, and social questions. The National Institutes of Health is \ndealing with many of these challenges through programs funded by the \nNational Human Genome Research Institute.\n\n[[Page S8107]]\n\n  Congress also has a key role to play in this process, especially in \ndealing with genetic discrimination, which is an increasingly serious \nproblem in health insurance and the workplace. A 1996 study in \n``Science and Engineering Ethics'' documented more than 200 cases of \ndiscrimination against individuals with genetic predispositions to \ncertain diseases, even though the individuals have no symptoms of the \ndisease as yet. For example, some employers have used genetic screening \nto identify African Americans with the gene mutation for sickle cell \nanemia. Those with the sickle cell gene mutation were denied jobs, even \nthough many were only carriers of the mutation and would never become \nill themselves.\n  In other cases, persons at risk for Huntington's disease have been \ndenied health insurance and have lost their jobs. Similar concerns are \narising in the wake of research showing a genetic basis for breast \ncancer. Ethnic groups who were participants in research to identify \ndisease-related genes are increasingly concerned about the adverse \neffects on their insurance coverage and their jobs. Even at the \nNational Institutes of Health, 32% of women offered a test for a \ngenetic mutation related to breast cancer refused to take the test, \nciting concerns about possible discrimination and the loss of privacy.\n  To deal with this issue, Senator Daschle, Senator Harkin, Senator \nDodd, and I are introducing legislation to ban genetic discrimination \nby both health insurers and employers. Our proposal is the culmination \nof years of work and debate over genetic discrimination. The proposal \nthat we are introducing today is based on our belief that neither your \nhealth insurer nor your employer should be able to discriminate against \nyou based upon your genetic information. In this era, when many people \nobtain their health insurance through their employer, it is especially \ncritical that both health insurers and employers are prohibited from \ndisclosing genetic information to each other. Proposals that do not \naddress both the insurance and the employment aspects of the issue will \nnot truly prevent genetic discrimination.\n  Our legislation prohibits health insurers from setting premiums and \ndefining eligibility on the basis of genetic information. Because we \nbelieve that genetic testing is a decision that patients should make \nwith their physicians, our bill prohibits insurers from suggesting or \nrequiring patients to undergo genetic testing. Because insurers do not \nneed to know genetic information for most situations, our bill \nprohibits them from requesting, collecting, or purchasing genetic \ninformation. In addition, the bill does not allow health insurers to \nshare genetic information with each other, to disclose genetic \ninformation to industry-wide data banks, or to disclose genetic \ninformation to employers.\n  We know that employers are beginning to collect genetic information \nand discriminate against applicants and employees. Many examples \nillustrate the problem on a personal level, such as the story of \nChristine, in Milwaukee, WI. One of Christine's parents developed \nHuntington's disease, which meant that Christine had a 50% chance that \nshe had inherited the mutant gene that would cause her to develop the \ndisease. Christine decided to undergo a genetic test to determine \nwhether she had inherited the mutation. She traveled to the University \nof Michigan in Ann Arbor for the test, and paid for the test herself. A \nco-worker in the small firm where Christine worked overheard Christine \nmaking the arrangements for the test and told Christine's supervisor. \nHer supervisor was initially sympathetic and offered to help. Christine \nthen underwent the genetic test and learned that she had indeed \ninherited the mutation and would therefore eventually develop the \ndisease. When Chistine shared this information with her supervisor, she \nwas fired, despite a series of outstanding job evaluations. Now, \nbecause of Christine's experience, none of her siblings are willing to \nhave the genetic test.\n\n  This type of blatant discrimination must be stopped. Our legislation \nprohibits employers from collecting genetic information from any \nsource, including health insurers, and from making any type of \nemployment decision based on genetic information.\n  We should all be concerned about genetic discrimination, because we \nall have mutations in our genes, and medical researchers are \ndiscovering new relationships between genes and diseases. Without \nlegislative action, genetic discrimination will intensify as more genes \nassociated with specific diseases are discovered, and as genetic \ntesting becomes more common. Earlier this week, Vice President Gore \nproposed a challenge to the biomedical research community--to identify \nall genes associated with cancer by the year 2002.\n  Our legislation is supported by the Alliance to Genetic Support \nGroups, the National Partnership for Women and Families, the American \nCivil Liberties Union, and Hadassah.\n  Congress should act quickly to pass legislation to ban genetic \ndiscrimination in health insurance and the workplace, so that we can \nbenefit from those research advances without the threat that people \nwill lose their jobs or their health insurance.\n  I ask uninamous consent that their letters of support be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             National Breast Cancer Coalition,\n\n                                                     July 1, 1999.\n     Hon. Ted Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the National Breast \n     Cancer Coalition (NBCC), I am writing to thank you for your \n     leadership in offering the Genetic Nondiscrimination in \n     Health Insurance and Employment Act of 1999. As you know, \n     NBCC is a grassroots advocacy organization made up of over \n     500 organizations and tens of thousands of individuals, their \n     families and friends. We are dedicated to the eradication of \n     the breast cancer epidemic through action and advocacy. \n     Addressing the complex privacy, insurance and employment \n     discrimination questions raised by evolving genetic \n     discoveries is one of our top priorities.\n       Discrimination in health insurance and employment is a \n     serious problem. In addition to the risks of losing one's \n     insurance or job, the fear of potential discrimination \n     threatens both a woman's decision to use new genetic \n     technologies and seek the best medical care from her \n     physician. It also limits the ability to conduct the research \n     necessary to understand the cause and find a cure for breast \n     cancer.\n       The Kassebaum-Kennedy Health Insurance Reform Act (1996) \n     took some significant steps toward extending protection in \n     the area of genetic discrimination in health insurance. But \n     it did not go far enough. Moreover, since the enactment of \n     Kassebaum-Kennedy, there have been incredible discoveries at \n     a very rapid rate that offer fascinating insights in the \n     biology of breast cancer, but that may also expose \n     individuals to an increased risk of discrimination based on \n     their genetic information. For instance, because of the \n     discovery of BRCA1 and BRCA2, breast cancer susceptibility \n     genes, we now face the reality of a test that can detect the \n     increased risk associated with heritable breast cancer. \n     Genetic testing may well lead to the promise of improved \n     health. But if women are too fearful to get tested, they \n     won't be able to gain from the future benefits genetic \n     testing might offer.\n       We commend your efforts to go beyond Kassebaum-Kennedy \n     toward ensuring that all individuals--not just those in group \n     health plans--are guaranteed protection against \n     discrimination in the health insurance arena and the \n     employment venue based on their genetic information. The \n     Genetic Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment \n     Act of 1999 would also guarantee individuals important \n     protections against rate hikes based on genetic information, \n     would prohibit insurers from demanding access to genetic \n     information contained in medical records or family histories, \n     and would restrict insurers' release of genetic information.\n       Passage of this legislation, and the protections it offers, \n     are essential not only for women with a genetic \n     predisposition to breast cancer, but also for women living \n     with breast cancer, their families, and the millions of women \n     who will be diagnosed with breast cancer. We look forward to \n     working with you towards getting the Genetic \n     Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act of \n     1999 enacted this year.\n       Thank you again for your outstanding leadership, and please \n     do not hesitate to call me or NBCC's Government Relations \n     Manager, Jennifer Katz if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Fran Visco, President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Hadassah, The Women's Zionist\n\n\n                                 Organization of America, Inc.\n\n                                                     July 1, 1999.\n     Hon.

The very information that may save someone's health\n\n[[Page S8108]]\n\n     or life should under no circumstances be used to deny them \n     the insurance coverage needed to pay for this care.\n       The issue of genetics-based discrimination by both \n     insurance companies and employers has come to be of \n     particular concern to the Jewish community. Over the past few \n     years, studies have shown that certain populations experience \n     heightened hereditary susceptibility to certain genetic \n     mutations and their corresponding diseases. In particular, \n     women of Ashkenazi or Eastern European Jewish descent have \n     been found to demonstrate a distinct genetic predisposition \n     to both breast and ovarian cancers. Most recently, there have \n     been scientific findings linking colon cancer to Ashkenazi \n     Jews.\n       Unfortunately, as Jews and other at-risk populations have \n     sought to learn more about their genetic backgrounds, they \n     have been confronted by genetics-based discrimination. As a \n     result of this discrimination, many individuals choose not to \n     receive genetic testing, or to even participate in research \n     studies. As scientists continue to identify the genetic \n     ``markers'' for more and more diseases, the issue of genetic \n     discrimination stands to confront each and every one of us--\n     men and women alike--regardless of ethnic heritage.\n       Hadassah has been active in support of similar legislation, \n     such as H.R. 306, sponsored by Representative Louise \n     Slaughter (D-NY), regarding health insurance discrimination. \n     We are optimistic that similar endeavors from your office, \n     and from those of your colleagues, will continue to expand \n     the scope and prominence of this issue. Hopefully, our \n     combined efforts will insure the passage of this legislation, \n     and ultimately result in the elimination of genetics-based \n     discrimination in both health insurance and employment. \n     Please sign Hadassah on as supporters of this bill.\n       I look forward to working with you on this important piece \n     of legislation. If you have any additional questions, or \n     would like our assistance, please contact Ms. Tana Senn, \n     Director of American Affairs/Domestic Policy. Again, we \n     applaud your efforts in addressing this crucial issue.\n           With admiration and appreciation.\n                                                  Marlene E.

The ACLU applauds the efforts of Senators \n     Daschle, Dodd, Harkin and Kennedy in their continued efforts \n     to promote awareness of the current and future problems of \n     genetic discrimination. We are in full support of the Genetic \n     Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act of \n     1999 and ask that the issue of genetic discrimination be \n     given complete and immediate attention.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                Jeremy Gruber, Legal Director,\n\n                                        ACLU National Taskforce on\n     Civil Liberties in the Workplace.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          National Partnership for\n\n\n                                             Women & Families,\n\n                                                     July 1, 1999.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I want to thank you for, once again, \n     taking the lead on an issue of great importance to women. The \n     National Partnership for Women & Families is proud to endorse \n     your bill, ``The Genetic Nondiscrimination In Health \n     Insurance and Employment Act of 1999.''\n       We believe that genetic discrimination is the next big \n     civil rights issue. The job of deciphering every gene found \n     in the human body--more than 80,000 in all--is proceeding at \n     record speed. Just a decade ago, genetic testing was largely \n     restricted to prenatal tests to look for birth defects. \n     Today, more than 550 genetic tests are being used for the \n     diagnosis of disease, and millions of women and their \n     families stand to benefit from improved prevention, \n     detection, and treatment of diseases like breast and ovarian \n     cancer.\n       Unfortunately, without adequate protection against misuse, \n     the potential for real medical benefit from genetic advances \n     may be outweighed by the fear of discrimination by insurers \n     and employers. Your bill will alleviate that fear and allow \n     women and men to benefit from medical and scientific \n     progress. Thank you once again for all your hard work on this \n     issue.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                               Judith L.

A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to ensure that certain \nFederal power customers are provided protection by the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                    THE TVA CUSTOMER PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor today \nto introduce a bill known as the TVA Customer Protection Act. This \nlegislation will implement a number of consumer protections that will \nmake TVA accountable to ratepayers and better prepare TVA to compete in \na restructured electricity market. I am pleased to have Senator Bunning \nas an original cosponsor on this bill.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing, which is virtually identical to the \nlegislation I introduced in the 105th Congress, provides Valley \nratepayers protections against unchecked and unjustified increases in \ntheir power rates. Included in this bill are checks against future \nincreases in TVA's massive debt. This bill will put an end to TVA's \nability to compete unfairly with its regional distributors and will \nprohibit TVA from sticking ratepayers with the bill for its \ninternational forays that have no relevance to its responsibility to \nprovide low-cost power to the Valley. Finally, this bill also codifies \nan agreement between TVA and several industry associations to limit \nTVA's authority as a government entity to compete with small businesses \nin non-electric services.\n  Mr. President, TVA is a federal corporation that was first \nestablished in 1933, to tame the Tennessee River, our nation's fifth \nlargest river, and to bring economic development to this once poverty \nstricken region. Today, TVA provides power to nearly all of Tennessee \nand to parts of six other states covering over 80,000 square miles and \nserving eight million consumers. The bulk of TVA's power sales are made \nthrough municipal and cooperative distributors, which in turn are \nresponsible for delivering that power to every home, office and farm in \nthe Valley. TVA has exclusive power contracts with its distributors and \nthe three-member TVA board sets the retail rates offered by \ndistributors.\n  Mr. President, while TVA has achieved significant success, it has not \ncome without a price. Today, TVA customers are paying a premium for \nTVA's excesses and mismanagement. For example, TVA has accumulated an \nenormous debt of nearly $26 billion, despite its monopoly status and \nthe Board's unilateral rate making authority. As a result, in 1998, TVA \ncustomers paid an astronomical 30 cents of every $1 to interest \nexpenses. When you match TVA's interest charge of 30 cents to the 11 \ncents paid by the Federal Government, it makes Uncle Sam look like a \nconservative financial planner. When compared to the average regulated \npublic utility, which pays a mere 7 percent in finance cost, it is \nobvious that this isn't a good deal for TVA ratepayers.\n  In a 1994 study, the General Accounting Office determined that TVA's \nfinancial condition ``threatens its long-term viability and places the \nfederal government at risk.'' Only through years of unaccountability \nand fiscal irresponsibility could a power company have ever reached \nthis level of debt, despite the fact that TVA is a monopoly provider of \nelectricity.\n  As a result of TVA's fiscal mismanagement and bloated budgets, TVA \nrates are higher than those of FERC-regulated utilities in Kentucky. \nSince 1988, wholesale power rates of regulated utilities in Kentucky \nhave steadily fallen, while TVA has maintained the same level, albeit \nhigher than Kentucky utilities. Then, in 1997, TVA was forced to raise \nrates by 7 percent in an effort to get its fiscal house back in order. \nIt is apparent that due to TVA's past financial mismanagement, \nthousands of Kentucky residents are paying more for power than Kentucky \nresidents who are outside the TVA fence.\n  Mr. President, another way to quantify the impact of TVA's fiscal \nirresponsibility is to compare the electric rates paid by Kentuckians. \nMr. President I have a chart here that displays the rate premiums paid \nby the 211,427 TVA customers living in Kentucky. I have used the rates \nfiled by Kentucky Utilities and TVA's publicly disclosed rates between \n1999 and 2003. Based on these rates, Kentuckians will pay an average of \n$50 million more annually for the privilege of being served by TVA. \nOver the next five years this amounts to a $250 million ``TVA \nmembership fee.'' It is painfully clear the Kentuckians who are served \nby TVA are getting a raw deal from this New Deal program.\n\n[[Page S8109]]\n\n  Mr. President, I have come to the conclusion that TVA needs to be \nmade more accountable for its actions. Not more accountable to Congress \nor the President, but the people TVA is charged to serve--Valley \ncustomers.\n  Mr. President, it is my desire to provide TVA customers with a clear \npicture of TVA's financial situation including its rates, charges and \ncosts. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is authorized \nunder the Federal Power Act with regulating electric utilities. FERC \ncurrently provides regulatory oversight to over 200 utilities for \nwholesale and transmission power rates to ensure that their electric \nrates and charges are ``just and reasonable and not unduly \ndiscriminatory or preferential.'' At present, TVA is entirely exempt \nfrom these necessary regulations allowing it to operate as a self-\nregulating monopoly, with no such mandate for openness, fairness or \noversight.\n  Mr. President, I am not alone in this belief. The distributors \nserving Memphis, Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Paducah, \nKentucky, share my views that TVA should fully comply with the FERC \nauthority. Recently, before the House Commerce Committee, Mr. Herman \nMorris, Jr., President and CEO of the Memphis Light, Gas and Water \nDivision testified on behalf of MLGWD and the Knoxville Utilities Board \nthat FERC would ``provide a neutral forum for resolving disputes \nregarding TVA transmission, wholesale sales pricing, terms and \nconditions.'' Mr. Morris went on to say that FERC jurisdiction is \n``necessary to provide Tennessee Valley distributors the same level of \nprotection that the rest of the country enjoys.''\n  Requiring TVA to comply with FERC regulations will serve two \npurposes. First, it will allow customers to accurately evaluate TVA's \nwholesale and transmission pricing to ensure the rates charged are \n``just and reasonable'' and will provide customers with a forum for \nchallenging future rate increases just as every other regulated utility \ndoes.\n  Second, this information will provide FERC with a better \nunderstanding of the costs TVA has accumulated. Understanding the full \nscope of these costs will be critical in an open transmission and \nwholesale market. It will also have a significant impact in determining \nhow competitive TVA will be in the future.\n  Another measure which I have added this year builds on the full \ndisclosure provisions by requiring FERC to conduct an investigation to \ndetermine TVA's total stranded cost liability. I have heard from a \nnumber of distributors who are very concerned about the potential \nstranded cost liability they might be assessed. They adamantly oppose \npaying for any costs or services they haven't paid for. For example, \nresidents of Paducah, Kentucky don't want to pay for the costs TVA \nincurred in providing service to Nashville. Unfortunately, nobody has \nany idea of the total stranded cost liability TVA has incurred or can \nbe recovered. This investigation will uncover those costs that were \nprudently incurred and are eligible for recovery as stranded costs.\n  In order to ensure that TVA keeps its promise of lowering its debt, I \nhave proposed that TVA be required to meet four need-based criteria \nbefore it is able to add costly generating capacity. For my colleagues \nwho are not familiar with TVA, it is important to note that TVA's \ntremendous level of debt is a result of TVA's aggressive and unchecked \nplan to add new generating capacity in the Valley. In 1966, TVA \nannounced a plan to build 17 nuclear facilities throughout the Valley. \nToday less than half of these facilities are in commercial service.\n  As a result, TVA is $26 billion in debt and has invested $14 billion \nin non-performing nuclear assets which have driven rates up in the \nValley. To prevent history from repeating itself, I believe it is \nnecessary to apply safeguards against overbuilding. TVA must \ndemonstrate a legitimate need before committing such significant \nresources again.\n  This legislation will also prohibit TVA from using Valley ratepayers \nto subsidize power sales outside the Valley in the future. All new \ngeneration will be required to meet the needs of Valley ratepayers.\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to go through the other important \ncustomer reforms included in the bill. Section Four of the bill \nprohibits TVA from continuing to subsidize their foreign endeavors at \nratepayer's expense. Quarter million dollar conferences in China and \nother points on the globe are not consistent with either TVA's deficit \nreduction goals or its mission to be a low-cost power provider to the \nValley.\n  Another provision that I have included is a measure proposed by the \nTVA distributors. Section Five in the bill protects distributors from \nunfair competition by ending TVA's ability to directly serve large \nindustrial customers. In the past, TVA has been able to directly serve \nsome of the valley's largest industrial customers. Through this \nloophole, TVA is able to use its considerable market power to unfairly \ncompete with distributors.\n  Section Seven of this bill will increase TVA's level of \naccountability by applying all federal antitrust laws and penalties. I \nhave included this provision in response to heavy-handed tactics used \nby TVA to punish the City of Bristol, Virginia, for signing a contract \nwith another energy provider.\n  TVA applied heavy-handed tactics by predicting unreliable electricity \nservices as a disincentive to leaving, and TVA attempted to syphon-off \nBristol's industrial customers by offering direct-serve power contracts \nat 2 percent below any rate offered by Bristol. I find these predatory \npractices to be entirely unacceptable, especially applied to one of its \nown customers. It is my belief that since TVA's activities were \nperformed in a commercial endeavor, they should be held to the same \nstandards as any other corporation under the antitrust laws.\n  I understand that TVA is willing to subject themselves to federal \nantitrust laws, so long as they aren't subject to any penalties. Mr. \nPresident, I have some advice for TVA.\n  If you can't pay the fine, don't do the crime.\n  Finally, this legislation limits TVA's ability to branch out into \nother businesses beyond power generation and transmission. TVA has \nattempted to diversify into equipment leasing as well as engineering \nand other contracting services in direct competition with other Valley \nbusinesses. I don't believe that TVA should be permitted to use its \nconsiderable advantages, like its tax-exempt status, to compete against \nValley businesses. TVA has signed a Memorandum of Agreement with Valley \nbusinesses not to compete against them.\n  My legislation codifies that agreement. Mr. President, I hope these \nreforms will offer TVA customers--both distributors and individuals \nalike--the means to make TVA more accountable and put an end, once and \nfor all, to TVA's unaccountability and unchecked fiscal \nirresponsibility. I want to put an end to TVA membership premium and \nlet all Kentuckians benefit from some of the lowest power rates in the \nnation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1323\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

TVA Chairman Craven Crowell alone took 92 trips, \n     including 12 to foreign countries, The Knoxville News-\n     Sentinel reported.\n       Crowell's charges totaled $49,541. Crowell, who is \n     currently in England with other Tennessee business leaders, \n     declined to discuss the issue with the newspaper last week.\n       Among Crowell's duties while traveling are promoting TVA \n     bonds, meeting with utility officials and attending \n     conferences, according to TVA officials.\n       ``These are not pleasure trips,'' said TVA spokesman Steve \n     Bender. ``The chairman is working on these trips.''\n       The U.S. General Accounting Office, the investigative arm \n     of Congress, is probing how TVA Inspector General George \n     Prosser spent TVA expense money, after a written request from \n     Crowell. In question are more than $10,000 in travel and \n     entertainment charges.\n       Prosser maintains the expenses are legitimate and he is the \n     victim of retaliation by TVA officials because he \n     investigated TVA executive Joe Dickey for fraud.\n       Prosser's expenses include a $500 hotel bill from a \n     Mississippi casino, $4,500 at attractions with golf courses \n     and more than $200 in liquor.\n       Crowell currently is the only member of the three-member \n     TVA board.

A bill to eliminate certain benefits for Members of \nCongress, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n                          Citizen Congress Act\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Citizen \nCongress Act, a bill which will end the five greatest perks and \nprivileges which separate the Members of Congress from the American \npeople, and which will eliminate taxpayer-funded financial incentives \nwhich encourage Members to become life-long legislators. In the past \ntwo Congresses, I have introduced a more broad version of this \nlegislation. However, in the next two years, I want to focus on \nremoving the top five taxpayer-funded financial incentives which \nencourage Senators and Representatives to remain in office as career \npoliticians. I believe that the elimination of these five special \nprivileges will return Congress to the institution our fore-fathers \nestablished.\n  As we approach the two-hundred and twenty-third anniversary of the \nfounding of our great country, we should remember that our Founding \nFathers envisioned a Congress of citizen legislators who would leave \ntheir families and communities for a short time to write legislation \nand pass laws, and then return home to live under those laws they \nhelped to pass. Unfortunately, we have stayed from that vision. With \nthe passage of the Congressional Accountability Act four years ago, we \nmade the first step towards ensuring that Members of Congress abide by \nthe same laws as everyone else. In spite of this measure, Members of \nCongress continue to receive special perks and privileges unavailable \nto most American citizens. While I support term limits for Members of \nCongress, and I remain committed to passing a term limits amendment to \nthe Constitution, there are other more immediate actions we can take to \nrestore faith in Congress.\n  The legislation I introduce today represents an achievable step \ntoward making Congress more accountable and responsible to the American \npeople. The Citizen Congress Act will eliminate the five greatest \nfinancial incentives for Members to become life-long legislators, and \nwill put them on equal footing with the majority of Americans. The \nprovisions of this legislation include: Eliminate the taxpayer subsidy \nelement of Congressional pensions; require public disclosure of \nCongressional pensions; eliminate automatic COLA's for Congressional \npensions; eliminate automatic COLA's for Congressional pay; and require \na roll call vote on all Congressional pay increases.\n  Eliminating the taxpayer subsidy of Congressional pensions and \nreforming the overall Congressional pension system represents a \nremarkable improvement. With the Citizen Congress Act, Senators and \nRepresentatives will no longer be eligible for pensions that far exceed \nwhat is available in the private sector and are padded with matching \ntaxpayer dollars. Instead, Members will have access to the same plans \nas other federal employees and private citizens,\n\n[[Page S8112]]\n\nwith no taxpayer subsidy. This will ensure that Members who serve in \nCongress for many years do not accumulate multi-million dollar pensions \nat the public's expense. Automatic cost of living adjustments for \nCongressional pensions are also eliminated in this bill. Additionally, \nrequiring a public roll call vote on pay increases ensures that Members \nof Congress do not vote themselves a pay increase in the dead of night, \nas has been the case many, many times in the past.\n  At a time when everyone is tightening their belts to maintain fiscal \nresponsibility and restore confidence in our government, it is only \nfitting that Members of Congress eliminate the perks and privileges \nwhich separate them from the American people. This is what Tennesseans \ntell me when I travel across our state, and that is what I am doing \nwith the Citizen Congress Act. I encourage my colleagues to join me in \npassing this important legislation and bringing Congress another step \ncloser to the American people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1326\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part E of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to provide States with more funding and greater flexibility in \ncarrying out programs designed to help children make the transition \nfrom foster care to self-sufficiency, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                  foster care independence act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it is a rare opportunity when we can \nprovide assistance to one of our nation's most vulnerable groups: \nchildren in the foster care program. Currently, Independent Living \nPrograms for older foster children end at their 18th birthday, \nabandoning these teens in the middle of a critical transition period \nfrom adolescence to adulthood. Sadly, these young people are left to \nnegotiate the rough waters of adulthood without vital health and mental \nhealth resources and critical life-skills. That is why I am pleased to \njoin my colleagues Senators Rockefeller, Bond, Moynihan, and others in \nintroducing the Foster Care Independence Act.\n  Many of the 20,000 adolescents who leave the foster care rolls each \nyear to become adults come from particularly troubled backgrounds. \nTypically, these young people have experienced on average four \nplacements in the past seven years of their lives. As a result, they \nlack a sense of permanency and the skills essential to becoming self-\nreliant and productive adults. Our bill will cushion the transition to \nadulthood by funding Independent Living Programs and ensuring access to \nthe critical health care and mental health services provided by \nMedicaid through a foster child's 21st birthday.\n  Most importantly, it doubles the money available to state-\nadministered\n\n[[Page S8113]]\n\nIndependent Living Programs, allowing them to provide the day-to-day \nliving needs for 18 to 21-year-olds while they learn valuable life \nskills. This more comprehensive program with a long transition period \nwill promote the safety, health, and permanency in the lives of these \nchildren. It also removes a significant barrier to these children's \nadoption by ensuring that the families who adopt them have access to \nthe appropriate resources through age 21.\n  In addition, this bill provides them access to the health and mental \nhealth services offered through Medicaid. Numerous studies of \nadolescents who leave foster care have found that this population has a \nsignificantly higher-than-normal rate of school drop outs, out-of-\nwedlock pregnancies, homelessness, health and mental health problems, \npoverty, and unemployment. They are also more likely to be victims of \ncrime and physical assaults. My more comprehensive program addresses \nthese grave health and safety concerns by allowing adolescents who age \nout of or are adopted out of foster care to continue to receive crucial \nhealth, and mental health care benefits through the age of 21.\n  I am heartened by the broad, bipartisan support that the Independent \nLiving Act of 1999, introduced by my colleague, Representative Nancy \nJohnson, received last week in the House. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting this important measure and ask unanimous consent that \nthe full text and summary of the bill printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1327\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

IMPROVED INDEPENDENT LIVING PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 establishes \n     that safety, health, and permanency are paramount when \n     planning for children in foster care. States are required to \n     make reasonable efforts to locate permanent families for all \n     children, including older children and teens, for whom \n     reunification with their biological families is not in the \n     best interests of the children.\n       (2) Older children who continue to be in foster care as \n     adolescents may become eligible for Independent Living \n     programs. These Independent Living programs are not an \n     alternative to permanency planning for these children. \n     Enrollment in Independent Living programs can occur \n     concurrent with continued efforts to locate, and achieve \n     placement in, permanent families for older children in foster \n     care.\n       (3) About 20,000 adolescents leave the Nation's foster care \n     system each year because they have reached 18 years of age \n     and are expected to support themselves. In addition, \n     approximately 5,000 adolescents (foster children over the age \n     of 12) are adopted out of the foster care system each year, \n     of whom approximately 620 are over the age of 16 at the time \n     of their adoption. A large percentage of these children have \n     not yet completed their high school education.\n       (4) Congress has received extensive information that \n     adolescents leaving foster care are in trouble. A careful \n     study of all the children aging out of foster care in \n     Wisconsin during 1994 showed high rates of school drop out, \n     out-of-wedlock childbearing, homelessness, poverty, and being \n     the target of crime and physical assaults.\n       (5) The Nation's State and local governments, with \n     financial support from the Federal Government, should offer \n     an extensive program of education, health and mental health \n     care, training, employment, financial support, and post \n     adoption support services for adolescents leaving foster care \n     (including those who exit foster care to adoption), with \n     participation in such program beginning several years before \n     high school graduation and continuing, as needed, until the \n     young adults exiting foster care establish independence or \n     reach 21 years of age.\n       (b) Improved Independent Living Program.--Section 477 of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 677) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 477. INDEPENDENT LIVING PROGRAM.\n\n       ``(a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to provide \n     States with flexible funding that will enable the States to \n     design and conduct programs--\n       ``(1) to identify children who are likely to remain in \n     foster care during their teenage years and that help these \n     children make the transition to self-sufficiency by providing \n     services such as assistance in obtaining a high school \n     diploma, career exploration, vocational training, job \n     placement and retention, training in daily living skills, \n     training in budgeting and financial management skills, \n     substance abuse prevention, and how to maintain their own \n     physical and mental health, including how to access health \n     care, mental health, and community-based peer-support \n     services;\n       ``(2) to help children leaving foster care, including those \n     adopted after age 16, obtain the education, training, and \n     services necessary to obtain and maintain employment;\n       ``(3) to help children leaving foster care, including those \n     adopted after age 16, prepare for and enter postsecondary \n     training and education institutions;\n       ``(4) to provide personal and emotional support to children \n     aging out of foster care, through mentors, the promotion of \n     interactions with dedicated adults, and continued efforts at \n     locating permanent family resources, including adoption, for \n     these children; and\n       ``(5) to provide financial assistance, access to health and \n     mental health care, supervised housing, counseling, \n     employment, education, permanency planning, and other \n     appropriate support and services that promote active and \n     responsible citizenship, healthy development, and community \n     membership to former foster care recipients between 18 and 21 \n     years of age to complement their own efforts to achieve long-\n

Under current law, teens are ``out of the system'' \n     and completely on their own immediately when they turn 18. \n     Many teens need help to make a successful transition to self-\n     sufficiency, especially teens who have spent years in foster \n     care. Programs must be designed to be consistent with the \n     Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, namely that safety \n     and health of the child are paramount. Studies of adolescents \n     who leave foster care have found that these children have a \n     significantly higher than normal rate of school drop out, \n     out-of-wedlock childbearing, homelessness, health and mental \n     health problems, and poverty.\n       The Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 is designed to \n     help teens aging out of foster care make a more successful \n     transition to adulthood. It addresses safety by allowing for \n     ILP funds to be used to ensure that the basic needs of \n     housing and food can be provided to these youth. It addresses \n     health by ensuring that teens who are aging out of or adopted \n     out of foster care to continue to receive crucial health, and \n     mental health, care benefits to the age of 21. Key provisions \n     of the Act include:\n       Strong Medicaid coverage: Requires states that receiving \n     new ILP monies continue to provide health care, including \n     coverage for mental health needs to foster, or adopted (whose \n     adoptive placements began on or after their 16th birthdays), \n     children up to their 21st birthday.\n       Funding for Independent Living services: Doubles the \n     funding--up to $140 million--for Independent Living services \n     to enable states to cover teens from 18 to 21, with support \n     services and housing assistance, with language to promote \n     continuing education and/or job training. The bill also \n     insures that ILP are supervised and includes a broad array of \n     services based on young people's developmental and self-\n     sufficiency needs.\n       Avoids disincentives for adoption of teens: Consistent with \n     the priorities established in the Adoption and Safe Families \n     Act, this bill promotes permanence by allowing teens adopted \n     after 16 to retain eligibility for Independent Living \n     programs, including vital access to health coverage from ages \n     18-21. This clarifies that Independent Living programs are \n     not a substitute for permanency for foster care teens, rather \n     support services to ease the transition for teens who have \n     faced challenges. This provision allows Independent Living \n     Program services to be concurrent with continued reasonable \n     efforts to locate and achieve placement in adoptive families \n     or other planned permanent settings as required under ASFA.\n       Quality data, evaluation and outcome measures: Insures that \n     quality data is collected and evaluated, to enhance programs \n     are effective, and seeks to coordinate with the data \n     collection efforts required under the Adoption and Safe \n     Families Act.\n       Updated funding formula: Funding formula provides that \n     every state can quality for new\n\n[[Page S8124]]\n\n     Independent Living incentives to serve teens aging out of \n     foster care from 18 to 21.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Chafee \nand a bipartisan group in the introduction of the Foster Care \nIndependence Act of 1999. I would like to thank Senator Chafee for his \nleadership on behalf of vulnerable young people, including our \nbipartisan work on this legislation. I also wish to thank the other co-\nsponsors of this legislation--Senators Reed, Bond, Landrieu, Moynihan, \nBreaux, Kerrey, Mikulski, and Jeffords. Work on this legislation is \nbased on the foundation created by the bipartisan 1997 Adoption and \nSafe Families Act.\n  Our First Lady, Mrs. Clinton, has also been a special leader on \nbehalf of vulnerable children. In 1997, she helped focus the national \nspotlight on the need to promote adoption. This year, she has helped to \nfocus much needed attention on the challenges facing teenagers who age \nout of foster care, and has challenged us to improve the system for \nsuch teens by expanding the Independent Living program.\n  In 1997, a unique bipartisan Senate coalition formed to promote \nadoption and find ways to help our most vulnerable children, those \nsubjected to abuse and neglected. After months of hard work, we forged \nconsensus on the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (ASFA). This \nlaw, for the first time ever, establishes that a child's health and \nsafety are paramount when any decisions are made regarding children in \nthe abuse and neglect system. The law also stressed the importance of \npermanency to a child, and it imposed new time frames as goals for \npermanency. While this law was the most sweeping and comprehensive \npiece of child welfare legislation passed in over a decade, more work \nand resources will be crucial to truly achieve the goals of safety, \nstability and permanence for all abused and neglected children.\n  We have been pleased to learn that one of the desired outcomes of the \nAdoption Act, moving children more swiftly from foster care into \npermanent homes, has begun to become a reality. Adoptions throughout \nthe country are up dramatically, far exceeding expectations. Yet, at \nthe same time, we find that there continue to be approximately 20,000 \nyoung people each year who turn 18 and ``age out'' of the foster care \nsystem with no home, no family, no medical coverage and no system of \nsupport in place. In my own state of West Virginia, over 1000 of our \nfoster children are over the age of 16. 185 of these children, in the \nlast year, received services through the state's Independent Living \nprogram.\n  How do such teens in West Virginia and throughout the country fare? A \nWisconsin study shows us that 18 months after leaving foster care, over \none-third had not graduated from high school, half were unemployed, \nnearly half had no access to or coverage for health care, and many were \nhomeless or victims or perpetrators of crimes. These are not just \nnumbers, each of these statistics represents a real person, like Wendy \nor James:\n  Wendy had been in foster care since the age of 6. She had been moved \nagain and again, and at the age of 14 was placed in a Wilderness \nProgram for teens with challenging behaviors. At 16 she was moved to a \nlocked residential facility. Her 18th birthday, in December, was a cold \nday in more ways than one. Early in the morning, a knock came on her \ndoor and she was told to get dressed and gather her things, as she was \nmoving. This was not unusual for her, so she did as she was told. She \nwent, with her meager possessions, to the front desk and asked, ``Where \nam I going?'' The staff person jingled the large key ring, opened the \nfront door, looked out into the snowy day and said, ``Anywhere you \nwant--you are 18 and you are on your own.'' One year later, Wendy was \naddicted to drugs, homeless and pregnant. She had no access to health \ncare until she became pregnant--Her baby was now her ticket to care.\n  James had been in foster care since the age of 10. He had been moved \n``only'' five or six times and when he turned 18, all services stopped. \nThe foster family he had been living with could not afford to care for \nhim any longer, but they agreed to allow him to sleep in their garage. \nHe had to drop out of school in order to work full time at a pizza \nrestaurant and attempt to support himself. When he turned 19, he had an \nopportunity to be adopted with some of his younger siblings. He \nimmediately said, ``Yes!'' and when asked by the judge why he would \nwant to be adopted at his age, he replied, ``I will always need a \nfamily, and someday, I hope my children will be able to have \ngrandparents.'' James was able to re-enroll in school, graduate with a \ntrade and is now a self-supporting married man. Oh, and his 3 children \ndo have grandparents.\n  This legislation will provide resources and incentives to states so \nthat more of our young people will have stories that end like James, \nand fewer that end like Wendy's.\n  One of the most significant provisions of ASFA was the assurance of \nongoing health care coverage for all children with special needs who \nmove from foster care to adoption. The Foster Care Independence Act is \nan essential next step in this ongoing process. This important \nlegislation will ensure that health care coverage for our foster care \nyouths does not end when they turn 18. All states who wish to receive \nthe new Independent Living Program money must provide assurance that \nthey will provide health care coverage to these young people through to \nthe age of 21. Young people who have survived the many traumas that led \nto their placement in foster care, and their journey through the foster \ncare system often have special health care needs, especially in the \narea of mental health. Providing transitional health coverage at this \ncrucial juncture in their lives can make the difference between \nsuccessfully moving on to accomplish their goals, or becoming stuck in \nan unsatisfying and unhealthy way of life.\n  Another key focus of ASFA is on moving children from foster care to \npermanent homes, and when possible adoption. Older teens in foster care \nhave a great need for a permanent family. Although we propose to \nimprove the Independent Living program and increase eligibility for \nservices to the age of 21, it does end at that time. And yet a youth's \nneed for a family does not end at any particular age. Each of us can \nclearly recall times when we have had to turn to our own families for \nadvice, comfort or support long after our 18th or 21st birthdays. Many \nof us are still in the role of providing such support to our own \nchildren who are in their late teens or 20s. Therefore, an important \nprovision in this Senate version of the Foster Care Independence Act \nstates that Independent Living (IL) programs are not alternatives to \npermanency planning--young people of all ages need and deserve every \npossible effort made towards permanence, including adoption. It would \nbe counterproductive to create any disincentive for adoption of \nteenagers. Therefore, our legislation would allow any enhanced \nindependent living services, particularly health care, to continue \nuntil age 21 for those teens who are lucky enough to become adopted \nafter 16 years old.\n  Independent Living programs were designed to provide young people \nwith training, skill-development and support as they make the \ntransition from foster care to self-sufficiency. In some states, with \ncreativity and innovation, these programs have seen remarkable success \nin that effort. In other localities, the programs have provided minimal \nsupport, and young people have faced an array of challenging life \ndecisions and choices without the skills or supports to make them \nsuccessfully. This bill requires that states improve their Independent \nLiving programs, by requiring youth involvement at every level, \nrequiring youths to participate in on-going education and career \ndevelopment activities, and requiring that those youths for whom room \nand board services are provided also have adult supervision and \nsupport.\n  In short, this bill assists a very vulnerable group of young \nAmericans by ensuring that they have access to: Health Care up to the \nage of 21; continued efforts to locate a permanent family; a quality \nIndependent Living program providing a broad array of skills, resources \nand services; and a program that focuses on critical outcomes, \nespecially in the areas of education, career development, and positive \nlifestyle choices.\n  These will be valuable steps in our efforts to be more able to \neffectively address the needs of our Nation's most vulnerable young \npeople, on the brink of adulthood. I urge my colleagues to\n\n[[Page S8125]]\n\njoin us in co-sponsoring and passing this bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators \nChafee, Rockefeller, Reed, Moynihan, Breaux, Conrad, Jeffords, \nMikulski, and Landrieu to introduce the Foster Care Independence Living \nAct of 1999. This important piece of legislation will provide \ntransitional assistance for the estimated 20,000 youths in the United \nStates who ``age out'' of the foster care system at the age of 18 \nwithout a permanent family.\n  This legislation builds on the Promotion of Adoption, Safety, and \nSupport for Abused and Neglected Children (PASS) Act that I co-\nsponsored in 1997. The Foster Care Independence Living Act of 1999 \nincreases the funding for the independent living program in order to \nprovide basic living needs, such as housing and food. Additionally, the \nincreased funding provides states the option to grant Medicaid for \nhealth care, including mental health needs, to former foster children \nup to their 21st birthdays as a condition of receiving the increased \nfunding.\n  This legislation also guarantees that state programs are well \nsupervised and provides a wide range of support which focuses on \nhealth, safety, and permanency goals. In addition, the bill allows \nchildren who receive aid under the independent living program to have \nassets or resources totaling $10,000, in contrast to the old \nrequirement of $1,000, which deterred foster children from saving money \nfor a sound future.\n  Mr. President, at age 18 foster care children are suddenly expected \nto be adults, able to take care of themselves. That is not a reasonable \nexpectation, especially for kids deprived of a nurturing parent or \nother caring adult. As these youths age out of foster care without a \npermanent family or a structure of continued support, many lack a high \nschool education, have difficulty maintaining employment, and often \nexperience high levels of depression and discouragement. Research has \nproven that a significant number of homeless shelters users had \nrecently been discharged from foster care. Other studies found that \nformer foster care youth 2\\1/2\\ to 4 years after they ``aged out'' of \nfoster care found that 46% of the youths had not completed high school, \napproximately 40% were dependent on public assistance or Medicaid and \n42% had given birth or fathered a child.\n  Mr. President, I know first hand how this legislation can impact our \nnation's foster care children. In my home state of Missouri, Epworth \nChildren and Family Services, in St. Louis, provides resources needed \nto help people who fall through the cracks of a system that is not \nstrong enough to help build a future for foster care children ``aging \nout'' of foster care. Robin, an 18-year-old foster care youth, was all \nalone in the world when she entered Epworth's Independent Living \nProgram. Her father was never a part of her life and her mother was \nserving time in jail. Motivated by the desire to regain custody of her \ntwo-year-old baby boy, Robin started the program with high hopes. \nHowever Robin struggled as she worked with the caring staff at Epworth. \nDespite attempts by the professional at Epworth to stretch limited \nresources to address Robin's ongoing needs, their system failed Robin. \nShe was removed from Epworth by the Missouri Division of Family \nServices. Robin needed more support, more staff interaction and more \nresources than the Epworth program could provide.\n  Mr. President, the Foster Care Independence Living Act of 1999 \nprovides significant assistance to assure that these foster care youth \nwho ``age out'' of the system are provided with the assistance needed \nto transition out of foster care into independence. The provisions in \nthis bill will assist these youth to begin a supervised and nurtured \nlife outside of the foster care system. They will be given the time and \nresources they need to enter adulthood prepared. This independent \nliving initiative would give many ``Robins'' the change to be self-\nsufficient and to contribute to her community. This means a better life \nfor all of our children.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today, I am proud to co-sponsor the \nFoster Care Independence Act of 1999, introduced by my good friend and \ncolleague Senator Chafee. We are joined by a group of our colleagues, \nincluding Senator Rockefeller, Bond, Reed.\n  This legislation will help a group of our children in dire \ncircumstances--foster children who reach age 18 still in the custody of \nthe state. They were victims of abuse and neglect and their families \nproved to be beyond repair. About 20,000 children a year ``age out'' of \nthe foster care system. They reach 18 and we, in large part, abandon \nthem to the world. Many make their way successfully. But far too many, \nalas, do not, and these children are more likely to become homeless or \nend up on public assistance.\n  More than a decade ago, we recognized that these children needed \nadditional help in preparing for life on their own. I am proud to have \nhelped create the Independent Living program, which provided Federal \nsupport for efforts that prepare teenager for the transition from \nfoster care to independence.\n  Today we are working on a bipartisan basis to build on this program. \nThe bill we are introducing will double funding for the Independent \nLiving program and increase the use of the funds to assist former \nfoster care children until they reach 21, including, for the first \ntime, help with room and board. As any parent knows, many 19 and 20-\nyear olds remain in need of family support from time to time. For \nchildren who have ``aged out'' of foster care by turning 18, the \ngovernment is, in effect, their parent and we should do more to help \nthem become independent and self-sufficient, just as other parents do. \nThe legislation also contains important provisions encouraging states \nto continue Medicaid coverage for these children so that health care \nremains available to them.\n  Mr. President, this legislation has widespread support, including \nfrom the Administration and key members of both parties. I would like \nto particularly thank the First Lady for her leadership in working on \nbehalf of these children. I thank Senator Chafee for offering it and \nlook forward to working with him and many others to see that it becomes \nlaw.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Cleland and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 1328. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permit \nthe disclosure of certain tax information by the Secretary of the \nTreasury to facilitate combined Federal and State employment tax \nreporting, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  Single Point Tax Filing Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there is no shortage of ideological ferment \nover the issue of taxes--from IRS Reform to discussion after discussion \nof tax cuts, we have gone back and forth over these questions and we've \nworked, as much as possible, to find a bipartisan consensus. Today I am \njoined by my colleagues Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus to \nintroduce legislation about which I would think every member of this \nbody would be able to agree--legislation that makes tax filing simpler \nand easier for the small businesses that constitute 98 percent of all \nbusinesses in America, employ nearly 60 percent of the workforce, and \nwhich, having created close to two-thirds of America's net new jobs \nsince the 1970s, continue to serve as the wellspring for our Nation's \ntechnological innovation and productivity growth.\n  Mr. President, America's small businesses are today drowning in tax \npaperwork. The nation's 6.7 million employers are responsible for \nfiling federal and state employment taxes and wage reports, as well as \nunemployment insurance reports. Under current law, employers file tax \nand unemployment insurance reports with federal and state agencies \nthroughout the year, reports which obligate employers to understand and \ncomply with diverse and often conflicting state and federal laws. Just \nto keep up with these requirements, employers must maintain separate \nwage records for federal income tax withholding, state income tax \nwithholding, FICA, FUTA, and SUI. In many cases, employers must report \nthis information to government agencies at different times and in \ndifferent forms. The reporting burden is only compounded when employers \ndo business in more than one state, many of which do not have the same \nlegal or procedural requirements. Just consider the financial burden--\nessentially a tax\n\n[[Page S8126]]\n\non taxes--associated with employer tax, wage, and unemployment \ninsurance reporting is estimated at $16.2 billion for Fiscal Year 1999. \nThe federal portion of this employer burden is $9.8 billion, the state \nportion relatively little less at $6.4 billion.\n  Given what we know about the role small businesses play as the engine \nof our economy, and given all the expectations we share in terms of the \npotential for these businesses to push the boundaries of economic \ngrowth out even further in the new economy, I think we would all agree \nthat we ought to do something to relieve some of the tax filing burdens \non these employers, to give them more time and, I think it follows, \nmore capital to focus on job creation in our workforce, not, \nrespectfully, job creation over at the IRS and in the accounting \nindustry.\n  Let me just read to you what David A. Lifson, speaking on behalf of \nthe American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, said in his \ntestimony before the Ways and Means Committee, Oversight Subcommittee \non ``The Impact of Complexity of the Tax Code on Individual Taxpayers \nand Small Businesses'' May 25, 1999:\n  ``Significant problems arise from the increasing complexity of the \ntax law. For example: a growing number of taxpayers perceive the tax \nlaw to be unfair; it becomes increasingly more difficult for the \nInternal Revenue Service to administer the tax law; the cost of \ncompliance for all taxpayers is increasing (of particular concern are \nthe many taxpayers with unsophisticated financial affairs who are \nforced to seek professional tax return preparation assistance); and, \ncomplexity interferes with economic decision making. The end result is \nerosion of voluntary compliance. By and large, our citizens obey the \nlaw, but it is only human to disobey a law if you do not or can not \nunderstand the rules. In a recent Associated Press (AP) poll, 66 \npercent of the respondents said that the federal tax system is too \ncomplicated. Three years ago, just under one-half of respondents in a \nsimilar AP poll said that the tax system was too complicated. The poll \nalso showed that more than half of those surveyed, 56 percent, now pay \nsomeone else to prepare their tax returns. This is a serious indictment \nof our tax system. When over half our individual taxpayers have so \nlittle comprehension of (or faith in) their tax system that they have \nto hire another party to prepare their returns, something is not \nright.''\n  Now, Mr. President, I applaud David Lifson's candor in speaking out \nfor tax simplification. The truth is, when the one industry--\naccounting--which depends financially on the very complexity and \nunwieldiness of our tax filing process and the tax code itself, is \nsaying--honestly--that the system is too complex, we know--\nunequivocally--that we need to do something to make the tax filing \nprocess work for taxpayers. The burden of tax code complexity is taking \na heavy toll. At an April hearing before the Senate Small Business \nCommittee, the General Accounting Office identified more than 200 \ndifferent federal tax code requirements that potentially apply to small \nbusinesses. Today, when a business hires an employee, the business \nbecomes responsible for collecting and paying three federal taxes \n(income tax withholding, FICA, and FUTA). It also becomes liable for \nstate and local employment taxes: in most states, these include a state \nincome tax and a state unemployment tax. For businesses, each tax \npresents its own set of rules and regulations. For the small business \nowner just starting up, these employment tax rules make compliance \ndifficult and confusing--and in too many instances the cumbersome \nnature of the tax filing process is a disincentive in itself for small \nbusinesses to grow.\n  We need to reverse that course, and, Mr. President, we can do just \nthat today--we can simplify the tax filing process for employers by \nallowing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and State agencies to \ncombine, on one form, both State and Federal employment tax returns.\n  As we all know, traditionally, federal tax forms are filed with the \nfederal government and state tax forms are filed with individual \nstates. This necessitates duplication of items common to both returns. \nSeveral States have been working creatively with the IRS to implement \ncombined State and Federal reporting of employment taxes, on one form, \nas a way of reducing the administrative burden on taxpayers. The \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997 authorized a demonstration project to \nassess the feasibility and desirability of expanding combined \nreporting. The pilot project was: (1) limited to the State of Montana, \n(2) limited to employment tax reporting, (3) limited to disclosure of \nthe name, address, taxpayer identification number, and signature of the \ntaxpayer, and (4) limited to a period of five years. On March 29, 1999, \nthe IRS announced the successful testing of the Single-Point Filing \nInitiative. Several States are currently considering agreements with \nthe IRS to initiate joint-filing of employment taxes. Those States \ninclude Maine, Oklahoma, Iowa, South Carolina, Ohio, and Massachusetts. \nMy colleague Senator Baucus knows just how popular this experiment has \nbeen in Montana. He'll tell you that by permitting the IRS to share a \nlimited amount of basic taxpayer identity information--information \nwhich States already collect separately at an added expense to \nthemselves and the taxpayer, the Single-Point Tax Filing Act we are \nintroducing today will allow the IRS to expand joint-filing beyond its \ncurrent pilot project.\n  Implementation of combined State-Federal employment tax reporting--a \ngood idea, a common-sense idea long in the making--has been hindered \nbecause the tax code applies restrictions on disclosure of information \ncommon to both the State and Federal portions of the combined form. Our \nbill will waive those restrictions, and allow us to take a common-sense \nstep forward for small businesses in the United States, a step forward \nfor single-point tax filing.\n  Mr. President, this is one of the obligations the American people--\nregardless of party or politics, expect us to take seriously--to \nprotect them as taxpayers. And I believe that this is one tax \nprovision, one measure of simplification, on which we can all agree--\nand we can make it law at no additional cost to taxpayers. I am pleased \nto introduce the Single Point Tax Filing legislation today, I thank the \ndistinguished members of the Finance Committee Charles Grassley and Max \nBaucus who join me today in offering this legislation, and I ask for \nyour support of this important measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Single-Point Tax Filing Act of 1999\n\n\n                                Purpose\n\n       To simplify the tax filing process for employers by \n     allowing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and State \n     agencies to combine, on one form, both State and Federal \n     employment tax returns.\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       Traditionally, Federal tax forms are filed with the Federal \n     government and State tax forms are filed with individual \n     States. This necessitates duplication of items common to both \n     returns. Several States have been working with the IRS to \n     implement combined State and Federal reporting of employment \n     taxes, on one form, as a way of reducing the administrative \n     burden on taxpayers. By permitting the IRS to share a limited \n     amount of basic taxpayer identity information--information \n     which States already collect separately at an added expense \n     to themselves and the taxpayer, the Single-Point Tax Filing \n     Act will allow the IRS to expand joint-filing beyond its \n     current pilot project.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       The tax code prohibits disclosure of tax returns and return \n     information, except to the extent specifically authorized by \n     law. Unauthorized disclosure is a felony punishable by a fine \n     not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment of not more than five \n     years, or both. An action for civil damages also may be \n     brought for unauthorized disclosure. No tax information may \n     be furnished by the IRS to another agency unless the other \n     agency establishes procedures satisfactory to the IRS for \n     safeguarding the tax information it receives.\n       Implementation of combined State-Federal employment tax \n     reporting has been hindered because the tax code applies \n     restrictions on disclosure of information common to both the \n     State and Federal portions of the combined form.\n       The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 authorized a demonstration \n     project to assess the feasibility and desirability of \n     expanding combined reporting.

On March 29, 1999, the IRS announced the successful \n     testing of the Single-Point Filing Initiative.\n       Several States are currently considering agreements with \n     the IRS to initiate joint-filing of employment taxes.

By providing the necessary \n     statutory waiver, the Single-Point Tax Filing Act will permit \n     the IRS to extend joint-filing beyond its current pilot \n     project. The waiver would only pertain to employment tax \n     reporting and would only permit the disclosure of the \n     taxpayer's name, mailing address, taxpayer identification \n     number, and signature (i.e., taxpayer identity information).\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to add my strong support to the \nSingle-Point Tax Filing Act of 1999 introduced by my colleagues \nSenators Kerry and Grassley. As a result of language I had included in \nthe 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act, Montana is the only state in the nation \ncurrently testing a Single-Point Tax Filing system, also known as the \nSimplified Tax and Wage Reporting System, or STAWRS.\n  The STAWRS pilot project in Montana has been a tremendous success. \nEarlier this year, the State of Montana and its Department of Revenue \nreceived a Regulatory Innovation Award from the Small Business \nAdministration, the Commissioner's Award from the Internal Revenue \nService, and the ``Hammer'' Award by the National Performance Review. \nThese awards were all given in recognition of the pilot project's \nachievement in dramatically reducing paperwork and cutting red tape for \nsmall businesses. I was also honored to receive SBA's Special Advocacy \nAward for my efforts to have legislation enacted that allowed the pilot \nproject to go forward.\n  The STAWRS program is designed to help businesses file their \npaperwork with one office, instead of wading through a blizzard of \npaper. It's one-stop shopping and will go a long way toward \nstreamlining payroll information, making filing faster and easier. \nRight now, businesses find themselves reporting the same exact \ninformation, on wide variety of forms, to a range of state and federal \nagencies. This takes time and effort, both of which small business \nowners could put to much better use running their businesses. The \nSTAWRS project is intended to eventually make it possible for employers \nto file a single, one-page report that is then shared by the \nappropriate revenue agencies. The governments will do the work and \nextract the information they need rather than the employer.\n  Small businesses are the engine for economic growth in this country. \nThey have created close to two-thirds of America's net new jobs since \nthe 1970's, helping drive our unprecedented economic growth and \nprosperity. All of this growth has been achieved despite the crushing \npaperwork requirements that small business owners face. The Single-\nPoint Tax Filing Act gives us an opportunity to reduce this paperwork \nburden at no cost to the government. I am proud that Montana has taken \nthe lead in reducing paperwork for small business, and strongly believe \nit should be made available to small businesses in every state, and on \na permanent basis.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 1329. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain land to Nye County, Nevada, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                conveyance of land to nye county, nevada\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nauthorize Nye County, Nevada to acquire approximately 800 acres of \npublic land. This conveyance will facilitate the development of both \nthe Nevada Science and Technology Center and the Amargosa Valley \nScience and Technology Park, part of a larger proposed Nevada Science \nand Technology Corridor.\n  The Nevada Science and Technology Center is a proposed interactive \nscience center and museum, highlighting the environment, industries, \nand technological developments associated with the region. This state \nof the art facility will have the potential to draw visitors from the \nLas Vegas Valley, 80 miles to the southeast, and the 1.3 million \ntourists who visit nearby Death Valley on an annual basis. The Center \nwill appeal to people of all ages and backgrounds because it will \nprovide a unique, fun, hands-on experience. Planning for this project \nis ongoing under the direction of a Nevada registered non-profit \norganization.\n  The Amargosa Valley Science and Technology Park is a proposed \nresearch and development business park designed to support Department \nof Energy contractors and suppliers associated with the Nevada Test \nSite, located immediately to the north of this site. Nye County \ncurrently has a $1.5 million grant from the Economic Development \nAdministration in the final stages of review at that agency's regional \noffice. Once finalized, this grant will provide the funding for water \nand infrastructure development in support of both the science center \nand the research and development park.\n  The lands proposed for conveyance have been identified for disposal \nunder the Bureau of Land Management's October 1998 Las Vegas Resource \nManagement Plan. Due to the non-profit nature of the Science Center, \nthis portion of land, approximately 450 acres, would be conveyed at no \ncost. Because the research and industrial park will house commercial \noperations, the County would be required to pay fair market value for \nthese lands, approximately 350 acres. The legislation contains \nprovisions for the no-cost land to revert to the federal government \nshould it be used for purposes other than the science center and \nrelated facilities.\n  This legislation will provide the impetus for future development in \nthis area, providing the opportunity for economic growth in Nye County. \nI urge my colleagues to vote for passage of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1329\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to give the city of Mesquite, Nevada, the right to \npurchase at fair market value certain parcels of public land in the \ncity; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n           conveyance of land to the city of mesquite, nevada\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nauthorize the city of Mesquite, Nevada, to acquire approximately 7,690 \nacres of public land necessary to provide for urban and economic growth \nand development of a new commercial airport. This legislation will \namend existing public law and allow for the continued expansion of this \ngrowing community.\n  Mesquite is the one of the fastest growing cities in the fastest \ngrowing State in the Nation According to figures released by the U.S. \nCensus Bureau, Mesquite grew by 441% between 1990 and 1998, increasing \nin population from 1,871 to over 10,000. This phenomenal growth rate is \nbeing fueled by a variety of factors, including the development of new \ndestination resorts and the ``discovery'' of other recreational \nopportunities in the tri-state region of Nevada, Arizona, and Utah. As \nthe tourism industry in the area continues to grow and prosper, a \ngreater capacity for air carrier service will be required to meet the \nneeds of the region. In addition, the city of Mesquite is land locked \nby public lands. While some relief has been provided via the existing \npublic law, this growth is exceeding demand and the city expects to be \nout of room within a couple of years. This bill is designed to help \nwith both growth related and air service issues.\n  Although the existing Mesquite Airport is adequate for general \naviation service, terrain precludes the expansion necessary for \ncommercial and cargo service. A new commercial airport is needed to \nmeet the future regional demands. The proposed airport site identified \nin this bill is a result of an approved Site Selection Study conducted \nfor the Clark County Department of Aviation. This study was funded \nthrough, and approved by, the Federal Aviation Administration. Of \ncourse, no airport construction activities will begin without \ncompletion of a comprehensive Airport Master Plan and environmental \nreview. Once these steps are completed, airport construction will be \nfinanced by the City of Mesquite and its business community.\n  Existing state law requires that the airport site be contiguous with \nthe city limits in order to be annexed. The legislation I introduce \ntoday will authorize the city to purchase 5,400 acres of public land to \nmeet this connectivity requirement. As some of this land has \ndevelopment potential, the city will be required to pay fair market \nvalue for this acreage. The actual airport site of 2,560 acres would be \nacquired by the city pursuant to existing land acquisition statues \nrelated to transportation and airport development.\n  Mr. President, I request that this legislation be given prompt \nconsideration.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1330\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to give Lincoln County, Nevada, the right to purchase \nat fair market value certain public land in the county; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    lincoln county lands act of 1999\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprovide Lincoln County, Nevada with the exclusive right to purchase \napproximately 4,800 acres of public land near Mesquite, Nevada. This \nlegislation, to be known as the Lincoln County Lands Act of 1999, will \nfacilitate economic growth and development in one of the most \neconomically distressed counties in the Silver State.\n  Lincoln County encompasses an area of 10,132 square miles, which is \nlarger than several of the New England states combined. Approximately \n98% of the County is owned by the federal government and property tax \nrevenues amount to only $1,106,558 annually. As a result, Lincoln \nCounty is hard pressed to provide basic services to its citizens and \nthe County school district in facing a critical situation as its \nschools are literally crumbling because of a lack of funds to maintain \nthem.\n\n[[Page S8129]]\n\nThe Lincoln County Lands Act will allow the County to address these \neconomic problems in a positive way.\n  By allowing Lincoln County to purchase 4,800 acres of public land \n(less than 1/10th of 1% of the land in the County) at fair market \nvalue, this legislation will result in the County's property tax \nrevenues increasing by over $12.9 million annually--an increase of more \nthan 1000%. While this may seem extraordinary, it is a result of land \nbeing situated immediately adjacent to the rapidly growing City of \nMesquite which is located just over the County line in Clark County, \nNevada. Mesquite's growth has created a huge demand for more housing \nand commercial development that can be best met by allowing Lincoln \nCounty to purchase this public land and develop it in a prudent manner. \nUnder this scenario everyone involved is a winner. Lincoln County will \ngain badly needed property tax revenue, Mesquite gains room for \nexpansion and growth, and the federal government will be fairly \ncompensated for the sale of public lands.\n  Another important aspect of this legislation is that it allows for \nthe proceeds of any sale of land pursuant to the Act to be utilized by \nthe Bureau of Land Management to acquire or otherwise protect \nenvironmentally sensitive lands in Nevada, to defray the administrative \ncosts that BLM will incur in processing this land sale, and to develop \na multi-species habitat plan for all of Lincoln County. These \nprovisions, similar to those contained in the Southern Nevada Public \nLand Management Act enacted in 1998, will help ensure that a mechanism \nexists to fund the conservation and protection of Nevada's natural \nresources.\n  Mr. President, the Lincoln County Lands Act is modeled after other \nlegislation that I have successfully sponsored, such as the Mesquite \nLands Act of 1986 and the previously mentioned Southern Nevada Public \nLand Management Act. These laws have provided a framework for creating \neconomic growth while protecting the environment and the taxpayer. I am \nvery pleased to be able to build upon these achievements by assisting \nLincoln County in a similar manner. I look forward to prompt \nconsideration of this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1331\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the President to award a gold medal on \nbehalf of Congress to Father Theodore M. Hesburg, in recognition of his \noutstanding and enduring contributions to civil rights, higher \neducation, the Catholic Church, the Nation, and the global community; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n    congressional gold medal in honor of reverend theodore hesburgh\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend and \ncolleague from Indiana, Senator Richard Lugar, to introduce legislation \nawarding the Congressional Gold Medal to the Reverend Theodore \nHesburgh, president emeritus of the University of Notre Dame.\n  This bipartisan effort recognizes Father Hesburgh for his outstanding \ncontributions to the civil rights movement and to improving higher \neducation. His efforts have provided benefits not only to the people of \nthe United States but to the global community as well.\n  Over the years, Father Hesburgh has held 15 presidential appointments \nand remains a national leader in the fields of education, civil rights \nand development of the world's poorest nations. Most notable among \nFather Hesburgh's many previous awards is the Medal of Freedom, the \nnation's highest civilian honor, bestowed on him by President Johnson \nin 1964.\n  Mr. President, Father Hesburgh has been a champion of the civil \nrights movement for more than forty years. He was a charter member of \nthe U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in 1957, and served as Chairman of \nthe commission from 1969-72. His relentless pursuit of justice, peace \nand equality continue to inspire people around the world.\n  Despite Father Hesburgh's commitment and obligations to Notre Dame \nand the various commissions he served, he still managed to give a \nsufficient amount of time and attention to global problems. Father \nHesburgh served four Popes in many capacities, including as the \npermanent Vatican City representative to the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency in Vienna from 1956-1970. In 1971, he joined the board of \nOverseas Developing Council, a private organization supporting \ninterests of the underdeveloped world, and chaired it until\n\n[[Page S8130]]\n\n1982. During this time, he led fund-raising efforts that averted mass \nstarvation in Cambodia in the immediate aftermath of the Khmer Rouge.\n  Notre Dame is perhaps most celebrated for its athletic prowess, but \nthese on-the-field achievements should not overshadow Notre Dame's \nplace as a world class institution of learning and scholarship. When \nFather Hesburgh stepped down as head of Notre Dame in 1987, he ended \nthe longest tenure among active presidents of American institutions of \nhigher learning. The accomplishments made during Father Hesburgh's \ntenure are perhaps best reflected in the significant gains made from \nthe time he took over as the 15th president of Notre Dame in 1952, up \nuntil his departure. By the time Father Hesburgh left Notre Dame, \nenrollment had doubled, the number of faculty had tripled, and the \nnumber of degrees offered by the school had grown to over 2,500.\n  Most strikingly, Father Hesburgh was responsible for making dramatic \nchanges to the University's composition by admitting women to Notre \nDame. He also established several of Notre Dame's prestigious \ninstitutions, both the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies \nand the Kellogg Institute for International Studies.\n  Today, even in retirement, Father Hesburgh continues to be a leading \neducator and humanitarian, inspiring generations of students and \ncitizens, while generously sharing his wisdom in the struggle for the \nrights of man.\n  That is why we rise today to introduce legislation in the Senate \nhonoring this man with a Congressional Gold Medal for his outstanding \ncontributions to the University of Notre Dame, our country and the \nglobal community.\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Bayh in \nintroducing legislation to bestow a Congressional Gold Medal on \nReverend Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., president emeritus of the \nUniversity of Notre Dame.\n  In 1952, at the age of 35, Father Hesburgh became the fifteenth \npresident of the University of Notre Dame. He served in that position \nfor a remarkable 35 years. At the time of his retirement in 1987, he \nhad the longest tenure among active American university presidents. \nFather Hesburgh's leadership and vision, together with the hard work of \nfaculty, staff, alumni, and students, built Notre Dame into one of the \npremier universities in the United States.\n  In you ask any Golden-domer, they will tell you that Father \nHesburgh's contributions to the University of Notre Dame are as big as \nthe 13-floor library that bears his name. Notre Dame grew exponentially \nin research funding and in endowment during Father Hesburgh's \npresidency. When he assumed the office in 1952, Notre Dame served fewer \nthan 5,000 students. Today it is an internationally recognized \nuniversity of nearly 10,000 students engaged in every imaginable \nacademic discipline.\n  More importantly, through his example and direction, Father Hesburgh \ninspired the university community to pursue not only academic \nexcellence and international prominence, but also justice and spiritual \nmeaning. Few universities have succeeded at creating an environment so \ncommitted to public service and so rich in its dialogue between the \nintellectual and the spiritual.\n  As Father Hesburgh worked to build the University of Notre Dame into \nwhat it is today, he simultaneously answered the call to serve his \nnation and the world. His career has embodied the principle of public \nservice that he espoused at Notre Dame.\n  Father Hesburgh has held a remarkable 15 Presidential appointments \nover the years, covering such diverse topics as the peaceful uses of \natomic energy and campus unrest. He was a charter member of the U.S. \nCommission on Civil Rights, created in 1957, and he chaired the \ncommission from 1969-1972.\n  All the while he remained a national leader in education, serving on \nmany commissions and study groups. He chaired the International \nFederation of Catholic Universities from 1963 to 1970. In this position \nand through his writings, he was instrumental in redefining the \nimportance of international studies in higher education and the nature \nand mission of a contemporary Catholic university. Father Hesburgh also \nserved four Popes as a Vatican representative to the International \nAtomic Energy Agency and other international assemblies.\n  The problems of underdeveloped nations have been a special interest \nof Father Hesburgh. He joined the board of the Overseas Development \nCouncil in 1971. His fund-raising work as Chairman helped avert mass \nstarvation in Cambodia in 1979 and 1980. He also chaired the Select \nCommission on Immigration and Refugee Policy between 1979 and 1981. The \nrecommendations of the Commission became the basis of legislation five \nyears later.\n  Father Hesburgh's lengthy list of awards include the Medal of \nFreedom, bestowed by President Johnson in 1964. He is also the \nrecipient of 135 honorary degrees, the most ever awarded to an \nAmerican.\n  In retirement, Father Hesburgh has become a best-selling author. He \nstill plays a major role in the development of higher education through \nthe institutes he was instrumental in founding at Notre Dame, including \nthe Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies and the Kellogg \nInstitute for International Studies. Father Hesburgh chairs the \nadvisory committee for both institutes.\n  Despite his innumerable accomplishments, Father Hesburgh has always \nremained grounded in the campus life of Notre Dame University. He \ncontinues to frequently lecture and preside at mass. He talks with \neveryone who approaches him and still loves having lunch with students \ndaily to discuss their views on the courses and programs he has been so \ninstrumental in advancing.\n  Mr. President, Father Hesburgh's life stands as an example of the \ntype of service, dedication, and faith that the Congressional Gold \nMedal was meant to commemorate. I encourage my colleagues to join \nSenator Bayh and myself in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 1333. A bill to expand homeownership in the United States; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n    promoting housing affordability for working families act of 1999\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, many Americans are benefiting from \ntoday's robust economy--unemployment is down, the stock market is up \nand homeownership is at record levels.\n  Sounds good. But while homeownership levels are up for some, for \nothers, the idea of owning a home is about as realistic as winning the \nlottery.\n  For millions of working families, paying for the house of their \ndreams too often turns into a financial nightmare. Homeownership should \nnot be reserved for the wealthiest in our society, but should be within \nthe grasp of every working man and woman.\n  Families with incomes below $25,000 generally cannot afford rent--\nmuch less monthly mortgage payments on most homes. Some of these are \nthe people who keep our streets safe, fight fires and teach our \nchildren, people who play vital roles in our community. They deserve to \nown their own homes in the communities they know so well and work so \nhard to improve.\n  Working families should be able to invest in themselves and in their \nfamilies rather than put their hard-earned income every month into rent \npaid to someone else. Houses do more than provide shelter. Houses \nbecome homes. They allow adults a chance to become established. They \ngive children a sense of security. They allow small towns to function \nand big cities to endure.\n  It is no wonder then that we value homeownership in this country. \nOwning a home is a part of our culture, it's what we call ``the \nAmerican dream.'' Still, this dream is out of the reach of many \nAmericans. In Oregon, where more than 75 percent of jobs do not pay a \nliving wage for a single parent, housing costs have skyrocketed, \nforcing nearly half of Oregon renters to spend more than 30 percent of \ntheir income on housing and utilities. According to the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development's guidelines, if someone is spending more \nthan 30 percent of his or her income on housing, they start cutting \ninto other basic needs such as putting food on the table, taking \nelderly parents to the doctor or clothing kids for school.\n\n[[Page S8131]]\n\n  People should not have to choose between feeding their kids or \nkeeping a roof over their heads. The bill that I am introducing, ``The \nPromoting Housing Affordability for Working Families Act of 1999,'' \nwill help communities remove the barriers to affordable housing, so \nworking families will not have to make this choice. Many factors, such \nas excessive rules and regulations, add to the price of a house. Cities \nand states must work together to remove these barriers. By working \ntogether, they can free up rental housing for those who cannot afford \nto buy a home while making the purchase of a first home easier for \nfolks who have been previously denied the opportunity.\n  This bill addresses the problem on three fronts. First, it brings \ncommunities together to form ``barrier removal councils'' so they can \nidentify problems to housing affordability and begin implementing \nsolutions.\n  Second, the bill requires Federal agencies to examine the impact of \ntheir regulations on the cost of housing. Determining this information \nthrough a ``housing impact analysis'' at the outset will save states, \ncommunities and, ultimately, families a lot of hassle down the road.\n  Third, it makes homeownership possible for people who help our \ncommunities thrive--teachers, police officers, fire fighters and other \npublic employees. Through incentives such as downpayment assistance and \nclosing cost flexibility this bill helps people live in the communities \nthey serve.\n  Many working families are ready for their first home. They are \nstarting to raise families, move up the ladder at work and are prepared \nto take on the responsibilities of homeownership. But when they get to \nthe front door, they cannot step over the threshold because they are \ntied up in unnecessary regulation that drives up home prices. The \n``Promoting Housing Affordability for Working Families Act of 1999'' \nwill help these families untangle this regulatory knot and unlock the \ndoor to their first home.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Frist, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Stevens, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1334. A bill to amend chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, \nto increase the amount of leave time available to a Federal employee in \nany year in connection with serving as an organ donor, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                         organ donor leave act\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Organ \nDonor Leave Act. This bill would extend the amount of leave in each \ncalendar year available to federal workers who serve as living organ \ndonors from 7 days to 30 days. It is a straight forward way to ensure \nthat federal employees who serve as an organ donor have sufficient time \nto recover from an organ transplant operation.\n  I am delighted to be joined by Senator Frist, one of the nation's \nleading transplant surgeons and the only active surgeon in Congress, as \nwell as Senators Edwards, Stevens, Levin, Sarbanes, and Durbin. The \nbill we offer is a companion bill to H.R. 457, introduced by \nRepresentative Elijah Cummings and marked out of the House Government \nReform Committee. Last year, an identical bill passed the House, but \nnot the Senate. It is my hope that, with such a distinguished list of \ncosponsors from both sides of the aisle, the Senate will quickly enact \nthis important legislation.\n  In most instances, an organ transplant operation and post-operative \nrecovery time for a living donor is generally six to eight weeks. In \norder to address the disparity between the available leave a federal \nemployee may take for an organ donation and the average recovery time, \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Department of Health \nand Human Services (HHS) assisted in the drafting of this legislation \nto increase the amount of time that may be used for organ donation to \n30 days. The amount of leave for a bone marrow donation would remain at \nseven days because experience shows that a week is considered adequate \nrecovery time form bone marrow donations.\n  Since 1954, when the first kidney transplant was performed, there \nhave been hundreds of patients who have received successful transplants \nfrom living donors. Unfortunately, there are not enough organs \navailable and over 55,000 Americans currently wait for a life-saving \norgan. There are certain organs, such as a single kidney, a lobe of a \nlung, a segment of the liver, or a portion of the pancreas, which may \nbe transplanted from a living donor. These operations can reduce the \nmortality of small children needing liver transplants, help another \nperson breathe, or free a dialysis patient from daily treatment.\n  According to the University of Southern California Liver Transplant \nProgram, ``With living donors, liver transplants can be performed \nelectively and before patients get extremely ill, thus leading to \nbetter outcomes. Another advantage to this approach is the emotional \nsatisfaction donors share with recipients when a life is saved.''\n  Our bill has the strong support of the American Transplantation \nSociety, the nation's largest professional transplant organization, \nrepresenting over 1,400 physicians, surgeons, and scientists. In a \nletter expressing support of the Organ Donor Leave Act, the AST noted: \n``. . . a lack of leave time has served as a significant impediment and \ndisincentive for individuals willing to share the gift-of-life. This \nimportant initiative addresses the disparities between leave time and \nrecovery time.'' According to AST, the bill would give ``. . . donors \nthe added assurance that they will be granted an adequate amount of \ntime to recuperate from the life-saving process that they undertake \nvoluntarily.''\n  Mr. President, this bill has already been passed by the House once, \nand appears to be on the same course in the 106th Congress. I hope the \nSenate will agree with the other chamber, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport moving this life-saving legislation as soon as possible. I ask \nunanimous consent that a letter from the American Society of \nTransplantation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  American Society\n\n\n                                           of Transplantation,\n\n                                     Thorofare, NJ, June 29, 1999.\n     Hon. Daniel Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The American Society of Transplantation \n     (AST) commends you for your continuing efforts to improve our \n     nation's system for organ donation and transplantation. The \n     AST is the largest professional transplant organization in \n     the United States and represents over 1,400 physicians, \n     surgeons and scientists. During the last few years, the \n     Society has greatly appreciated the opportunity to work with \n     Congressional Members and staff in addressing many important \n     organ transplantation issues.\n       The AST applauds you most recent efforts to improve organ \n     donation by introducing the Senate companion legislation to \n     H.R. 457 which seeks to amend the United States Code, to \n     increase the amount of leave time available to a Federal \n     employee in any year in connection with serving as an organ \n     donor. Through this legislation, the Federal Government will \n     become a leader in encouraging individuals to perform the \n     valuable public service of donating organs.\n       In the past, a lack of leave time has served as a \n     significant impediment and disincentive for individuals \n     willing to share the gift-of-life. This important initiative \n     address disparities between leave time and recovery time. \n     This legislation gives donors the added assurance that they \n     will be granted an adequate amount of time to recuperate from \n     the life saving process that they undertake voluntarily.\n       As we have discussed in the past, the problems that our \n     nation faces in the allocation of organs and tissues for \n     transplantation, a precious and scarce resource, are complex, \n     and continue to evolve from both a medical and policy \n     perspective. However, the real answer to dealing with the \n     dilemma of allocating and distributing an inadequate supply \n     of organs is through efforts such as yours to increase \n     donation.\n       On behalf of the thousands of U.S. patients currently \n     awaiting organ transplants, we commend you for your \n     leadership in this area. In addition, we look forward to \n     continuing to work with you in the future to improve the \n     field of transplantation medicine.\n           Sincerely,\n     John R. Lake,\n       President.\n     John F. Neylan,\n       Chair, Public Policy Committee.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Edwards):\n  S. 1336. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na credit to promote home ownership among\n\n[[Page S8132]]\n\nlow-income individuals; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 home ownership tax credit act of 1999\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the state of home \nownership in the U.S., in addition to legislation I am introducing with \nSenator Schumer  and Senator Edwards to enable more families to achieve \nthe American dream of home ownership.\n  Today, we have many reasons to celebrate. Indeed, the national home \nownership rate has soared to an all-time high of almost 67 percent, \nwhich is up from 64 percent in 1993. Of further significance, this \nincrease has, in large measure, been fueled by the growth in home \nownership among minority households. In fact, minorities were \nresponsible for 42 percent of the increase in home ownership between \n1994 and 1997, although they only account for 17 percent of the home \nowner population.\n  Despite these positive developments, a number of distressing trends \nshould give us cause for concern. For example, minority home ownership \nrates still lag significantly behind those of non-minority households: \n45 percent for minorities versus 72 percent for white households. In \naddition, only 45 percent of low-income households live in owner-\noccupied homes, as compared to 86 percent of high-income households.\n  These alarming disparities have broad societal implications because \nof the tremendous benefits associated with home ownership. \nHistorically, home ownership has been the key to wealth creation in \nthis country, and wealth in the form of home equity has enabled \nfamilies to start businesses, finance their children's education, and \ncover unexpected expenses. Consequently, unequal home ownership rates \nlead to wealth disparities. In fact, the median wealth of non-elderly \nlow income home owners is 12 times greater than the median wealth of \nnon-elderly renters of the same income.\n  In addition to wealth-building, home ownership has a positive effect \non families and on our communities. Indeed, research has found that \nchildren of homeowners are less likely to become involved in the \njustice system, drop out of school, or have children out of wedlock. \nMoreover, home ownership is correlated with membership in community \norganizations and voting, as well as participation in neighborhood \nenhancing activities.\n  In view of the substantial benefits associated with home ownership, \nthe Federal Government has actively worked to increase the home \nownership rate. The primary tools in this effort have been the mortgage \ninterest and the real estate tax deductions. Although these tax \ndeductions have reduced the costs of home ownership for many, they are \nof little use to low-income households because their itemized tax \ndeductions generally do not exceed the standard deduction. As such, \nover 90 percent of the total benefits of the mortgage interest \ndeduction accrue to home buyers with incomes greater than $40,000, and \nbecause of the progressive nature of federal income tax rates, even if \nlower-income households do itemize their deductions, they receive a \nsmaller deduction as a percentage of income than more affluent buyers.\n  To attack the home ownership disparity between low- and upper-income \nhouseholds, the Federal Government has relied on the Mortgage Revenue \nBond (MRB) program, the Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) program, and, \nto a limited extent, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. \nUnder these programs, the Federal Government subsidizes interest rates \nto reduce monthly mortgage costs for low-income home owners.\n  While these programs have been successful, their effects have been \nlimited. Indeed, the size of these programs, as measured by their \nannual cost--$2.2 billion--pales in comparison to the annual cost of \nthe mortgage and real estate tax deductions--$58 billion.\n  Also, while attacking the income constraints that prevent many low-\nincome families from being able to afford monthly mortgage costs, these \nprograms do not address wealth constraints such as a lack of savings \nfor a down payment and closing costs, that keep many low-income \nfamilies from becoming home owners.\n  During these times of economic prosperity, we have a rare opportunity \nto close the home ownership gap that exists between low-income and \nupper-income families. To this end, I am introducing legislation to \nestablish a Home Ownership Tax Credit targeted to low-income families. \nThis legislation, which has been developed in conjunction with \nHarvard's Joint Center on Housing Studies, the Brookings Institution, \nand Self-Help Community Development Corporation, would attack the \nwealth and income constraints that prevent many low-income families \nfrom becoming home owners.\n  Under this legislation, the Federal Government would issue tax \ncredits to participating lenders who would then be obligated to extend \neither low-interest or zero-interest second mortgages to low-income \nfamilies. These second mortgages would effectively be used to cover the \ndownpayment and closing costs, although a prospective home buyer would \nstill be required to make a small contribution toward the purchase. \nFamilies could defer repayment on the second mortgage for 25 years, at \nwhich point a balloon payment would come due, or they could repay the \nsecond mortgage over 30-years, concurrent with the repayment of their \nfirst mortgage. In either event, the interest rate on the second \nmortgage would be subsidized, which would lower families' monthly \nmortgage costs. Also, these second mortgages would eliminate the need \nfor private mortgage insurance, providing additional savings of roughly \n$60 per month. Under this proposal, families earning as little as \n$14,500 would, for the first time, have the opportunity of realizing \nthe American dream of home ownership.\n  Mr. President, I believe this legislation represents a common-sense \napproach to addressing the home ownership disparity which exists and I \nwould hope my colleagues can be supportive.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1336\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Home \n     Ownership Tax Credit Act of 1999''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Home ownership is of primary importance in building \n     wealth in low-income families.\n       (2) 67 percent of the wealth that is owned by non-elderly \n     low-income households consists of the equity in their \n     residences and the median wealth of such non-elderly low-\n     income households is 12 times greater than the median wealth \n     for non-elderly renters with the same level of income.\n       (3) Only 45 percent of low-income households live in owner-\n     occupied homes, as compared to 66 percent of all households, \n     and 86 percent of high-income households.\n       (4) According to the Bureau of the Census, in 1993, 88 \n     percent of all renters and 93 percent of renters earning less \n     than $20,000 could not afford a house selling for half of the \n     regional median house price.\n       (5) There is a 23 percentage point difference in home \n     ownership rates between central cities and suburban cities \n     which is largely the result of the concentration of low-\n     income households in central cities.\n       (6) The cost of the largest Federal tax incentives for home \n     ownership, the mortgage interest deduction and the real \n     estate tax deduction, is equal to approximately twice the \n     amount of Federal expenditures for direct Federal housing \n     assistance which benefits low-income households.\n       (7) The mortgage interest deduction and the real estate tax \n     deduction have little value to low-income households because \n     the itemized tax deductions of low-income households \n     generally do not exceed the standard deduction.\n       (8) Over 90 percent of the total benefits of the mortgage \n     interest deduction accrue to home buyers with incomes greater \n     than $40,000.\n       (9) Current provisions in the Federal tax code to promote \n     home ownership among low-income households, such as the \n     mortgage revenue bond program, the mortgage credit \n     certificate program, and the low-income housing credit, fail \n     to simultaneously attack the twin constraints of lack of \n     wealth and low income that prevent many low-income households \n     from becoming homeowners.\n       (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish a decentralized, market-driven approach to \n     increasing home ownership among low-income households,\n       (2) to enable low-income households to overcome the wealth \n     and income constraints that frequently prevent such \n     households from becoming homeowners, and\n       (3) to reduce the disparities in home ownership between \n     low-income households and higher-income households and \n     between central cities and suburban cities.\n\n[[Page S8133]]\n\n     SEC. 2.

State HFAs would then \n     auction these credits off to lenders such as banks, thrifts, \n     community development financial institutions, and community \n     development corporations. Lenders purchasing the tax credits \n     would commit to extending either: 1) zero-interest balloon \n     second mortgages that are due in 25 years or upon the sale of \n     the home, or 2) very low-interest rate second mortgages that \n     amortize in 30 years. These second mortgages would reduce the \n     size of the first mortgage and ultimately reduce monthly \n     mortgage costs. The aggregate principal amount of second \n     mortgages made by each lender would be equal to the price the \n     lender paid for the tax credits. Also, the lender would \n     commit to making at least 100 home ownership tax credit \n     loans.\n       The lender would receive the tax credit annually for 10 \n     years or until the loan was paid off, whichever occurred \n     earlier. If a home ownership tax credit mortgage was prepaid \n     during the 10-year tax credit period, the lender would have \n     priority in the issuance of tax credits in the subsequent \n     year.\n       The lender would get its principal back when the second \n     mortgage amortized, balloon payment came due, or the house \n     was\n\n[[Page S8135]]\n\n     sold. Lenders also would be able to sell the tax credit \n     mortgages on the secondary market with the tax credits being \n     transferred to secondary market investors.\n       Only borrowers earning up to 80 percent of the area median \n     income would qualify to take advantage of the home ownership \n     tax credit program. These second mortgages could be between \n     18 and 22 percent of the purchase price of the home, up to \n     $25,000. The second mortgage could be up to $40,000 if used \n     in areas formally targeted for neighborhood revitalization.\n       Under this proposal, families earning at little at $14,500 \n     would be able to become home owners.\n       Example: The following example indicates how this proposal \n     would work:\n       A low-income family identifies a $100,000 home that it \n     wants to purchase. The potential home buyers would visit a \n     lender participating in the tax credit program. Let's assume \n     that the lender would agree to extend a $81,000 first \n     mortgage to the home buyer. Under the tax credit program, the \n     home buyer would only be required to make a $1,000 down \n     payment. Assuming that the home buyer met the eligibility \n     requirements of the home ownership tax credit program, the \n     lender would also agree to extend an $18,000 second mortgage \n     (In the alternative, the home buyer could get the first and \n     second mortgages from different lenders). Closing costs of up \n     to $4,000 could be financed into the second mortgage, \n     increasing the second mortgage amount to $22,000.\n       If the second mortgage was a zero-interest 25-year balloon, \n     the home buyer would only pay principal, interest, taxes, and \n     insurance on the $81,000 first mortgage for 25 years, or \n     until sale of the home (approximately $540/month at 7 percent \n     interest, plus taxes and insurance). Assuming that the home \n     buyer stayed in the home, at the end of 25 years, he/she \n     could refinance using his/her accumulated equity to repay \n     most or all of the $22,000 they owed on the balloon mortgage.\n       In sum, this proposal will allow a low-income family to \n     purchase a $100,000 home with a $1000 down payment and a \n     monthly mortgage payment of $540 (plus taxes and insurance) \n     throughout most of the life of the first mortgage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 1337. A bill to provide for the placement of anti-drug messages on \nappropriate Internet sites controlled by NASA; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n          anti-drug messages on nasa internet controlled sites\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation \nalong with Senator Sessions and Senator Kyl to help in sending our \nyoung people a no-use message on drugs. This parallels efforts in the \nHouse by Congressman Matt Salmon and it is supported by NASA.\n  The average age of our young people who first use illegal drugs is 16 \nand the age of first use is dropping. We need to reverse this trend and \nprevent drug use among young people. An easy way of contacting them is \nat our finger tips. NASA's web sites are among the most visited \ngovernment sites. Thousands of schools have programs that include \nNASA's web sites in their curriculum. I believe it is important to \nreach out to those young people. Here is a chance to reach millions of \nyoung people at no added expense to the taxpayer.\n  In this bill the NASA administration must work with the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy to add anti-drug messages on NASA's web \nsites. With our young people being bombarded by images of violence and \ndrugs from films and TV, this is a way to get the anti-drug message to \nour children at a young age through a location that we know a large \nnumber will see. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort and \nsupport this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1337\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ANTI-DRUG MESSAGES ON INTERNET SITES.\n\n       Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration, in consultation with the Director of the \n     Office of National Drug Control Policy, shall place anti-drug \n     messages on appropriate Internet sites controlled by the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (by request):\n  S. 1338. A bill entitled the ``Military Lands Withdrawal Act of \n1999''; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 military lands withdrawal act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send to the desk the Military Lands \nWithdrawal Act of 1999. I am introducing this legislation on behalf of \nthe Administration. At this point I am neither prepared to support nor \nobject to any of the specific provisions contained within this \nlegislative proposal. It is my intention however, to hold hearings on \nthis important legislation and the withdrawal renewals contained within \nit. After those hearings have been held and we have had the benefit of \ninput from the parties most effected by the withdrawals, I am prepared \nto offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute which makes such \nneeded changes as are identified during the hearing process.\n  This legislation renews the withdrawals contained within P.L. 99-606, \nenacted by Congress in 1986. This Congressional action withdrew 7.2 \nmillion acres of public land for use by the Department of Defense at \nsix installations. The affected bases are the Barry M. Goldwater Air \nForce Range in Arizona, Nellis Air Force Base and Naval Air Station \nFallon in Nevada, the McGregor Army Range in New Mexico, and Fort \nWainwright and Fort Greely in my home state of Alaska. These \nwithdrawals were for a period of 15 years and expire in 2001.\n  I have a deep abiding recognition of the unique and critical role all \nof these military bases play in our national defense strategy and on \nthe economies of the states within which they are located. However, I \nalso understand that the issues surrounding the renewal of these \nwithdrawals are complex and varied. Congress's ability to resolve these \nissues will ultimately define success or failure for this entire round \nof withdrawals. What we do here will have a lasting impact on these \nbases military mission, their local economies, and the environmental \nprotection of the public lands. It is my firm belief that only through \nthe Congressional hearing process can the concerns of all affected \nparties be recorded and factored into the renewal of these base \nwithdrawals.\n  I am committed to the prompt consideration of this legislation. \nHowever, taking into consideration the fact that these withdrawals do \nnot expire until 2001, I believe it is prudent that we move this \nlegislation at a pace which allows both the public and our colleagues \nthe opportunity to participate in a meaningful way and in the proper \nforum.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 1339. A bill to provide for the debarment or suspension from \nFederal procurement and nonprocurement activities of persons that \nviolate certain labor and safety laws; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n            federal procurement and assistance integrity act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce \nlegislation to improve the efficiency and protect the integrity of \nFederal procurement and assistance programs, by ensuring that the \nFederal Government does business with responsible contractors and \nparticipants\n  The United States General Accounting Office [GAO] has found that \nbillions of dollars in Federal procurement contracts and assistance are \ngoing to individuals and corporations which are violating our nation's \nlabor and employment laws. In 1995, the GAO reported that more than $23 \nbillion in Federal contracts were awarded in fiscal year 1993 to \ncontractors who violated labor laws. That is 13 percent of the $182 \nbillion in Federal contracts awarded that year. Part of the reason for \nthis, the GAO found, is that the National Labor Relations Board, which \nenforces our nation's labor laws, does not know whether violators of \nthe law are receiving Federal contracts. And the General Services \nAdministration, which oversees Federal procurement, does not know the \nlabor relations records of Federal contractors.\n  In 1996, the GAO reported that $38 billion in Federal contracts in \nfiscal year 1994 were awarded to contractors who had violated workplace \nhealth and safety laws. That is 22 percent of the $176 billion in \nFederal contracts of $25,000 or more which were awarded that year. The \nGAO found that 35 people died and 55 more people were hospitalized in \nfiscal year 1994 as a result of injuries at the workplaces of federal \ncontractors who violated health and\n\n[[Page S8136]]\n\nsafety laws. These contractors were assessed a total of $10.9 million \nin penalties in fiscal year 1994--while being awarded $38 billion in \nFederal contracts.\n  The GAO concluded that, although federal agencies have the authority \nto deny contracts and federal assistance to companies that violate \nFederal laws, this authority is rarely used in the case of safety and \nhealth violations. The GAO found that federal agencies do not normally \ncollect or receive information about which contractors are violating \nhealth and safety laws--even when contractors have been assessed large \npenalties for egregious or repeat violations.\n  The Federal Government should not ignore the health and safety \nrecords of companies that apply for federal contracts and assistance. A \nreport published this week in the Archives of Internal Medicine \nconcludes that job-related injuries and illnesses in the United States \nare more common than previously thought, costing the nation more than \nAIDS, Alzheimer's, cancer or heart disease. The report, which analyzed \nnational estimates of job-related illnesses and injuries in 1992, \nstates that more than 13 million Americans were injured from job-\nrelated causes in just one year--more than four times the number of \npeople who live in the City of Chicago. The report concluded that the \ncost to our country from workplace injuries and illnesses was $171 \nbillion in 1992.\n  The Federal Government has a responsibility to taxpayers, working \nAmericans and law-abiding businesses, to ensure that federal tax \ndollars do not go to individuals and corporations that violate safety \nand health, labor and veterans' employment preference laws. About 26 \nmillion Americans are employed by federal contractors and \nsubcontractors. They deserve to know that their Government is not \nrewarding employers who violate the laws that protect American workers \nand veterans. The legislation I am introducing today will improve the \nenforcement of our nation's health and safety, labor and veterans' \nemployment laws, and provide an incentive to contractors to comply with \nthe law. This legislation will allow the Secretary of Labor to debar or \nsuspend a person from receiving Federal contracts or assistance for \nviolating the National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards \nAct, the Occupational Safety and Health Act or the disabled and \nVietnam-era veterans hiring preference law. It will require the \nSecretary of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board to develop \nprocedures to determine whether a violation of law is serious enough to \nwarrant debarment or suspension. And, as recommended by the GAO, this \nlegislation will require ongoing exchanges of information among Federal \nagencies to improve their ability to enforce our nation's laws. This \nlegislation is identical to a bill introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Lane Evans of Illinois, and it is \nsimilar to legislation introduced in previous years by former Senator \nPaul Simon.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note that the vast majority of \nFederal contractors obey the law. This legislation is only directed at \nthose who are violating the law. It will deny Federal contracts and \nassistance to individuals and companies that violate the law and ensure \nthat Federal contracts are awarded to companies that respect the law.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, and I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 1339\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to redesignate the ``Stuttgart National Aquaculture \nResearch Center'' as the ``Harry K. Dupree Stuttgart National \nAquaculture Research Center''; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n     harry k. dupree stuttgart national aquaculture research center\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I offer for the Senate's consideration, \na bill to rename the Stuttgart National Aquaculture Research Center \nafter a man that has been essential to the success of the aquaculture \nindustry in Arkansas: Dr. Harry K. Dupree.\n\n  Dr. Dupree has devoted his entire career to the progress of the \nwarmwater fish industry. In Arkansas, aquaculture production has taken \ngreat strides in recent years. The catfish industry in the state has \ngrown rapidly and Arkansas currently ranks second nationally in acreage \nand production of catfish. The baitfish industry is not far behind, \nselling more than 15 million pounds of fish annually. Much of this \nsuccess is due to the ongoing efforts of Dr. Harry Dupree.\n  The early years of Dr. Dupree's career were spent in Alabama. Harry \nreceived his master's in fisheries management from Auburn University in \n1956 and his Ph.D. in Zoology in 1960. From 1960 to 1974, Harry served \nas both a Research Biologist and Laboratory Director at the \nSoutheastern Fish Cultural Laboratory in Marion, Alabama. There, Dr. \nDupree focused his efforts on catfish research and established the \nmajor elements required for a manufactured feed for channel catfish. \nHis research activities led to the formulation of pelleted feed for \ncatfish production and made it possible for catfish production to move \nfrom a small, labor intensive industry of local interest to a \nstreamlined industry with potential for expansion on the national and \ninternational level.\n\n[[Page S8137]]\n\n  Arkansas was fortunate enough to lure Dr. Dupree to the Fish Farming \nExperimental Laboratory in Stuttgart, Arkansas, during 1974 where he \nserved as Scientific Director for the next 18 years. His efforts, \ndating back to before 1985, resulted in funding for design and \nconstruction of the new laboratories and offices for the facilities on \nthe campus of the Stuttgart National Aquaculture Research Center. These \nfacilities were constructed in 1992 and Dr. Dupree has served as the \nLaboratory Director for the center ever since.\n  I first met Harry during my tenure as Representative of the First \nCongressional District of Arkansas. I'll never forget the enthusiasm \nand genuine interest Harry displayed as he showed me around the \nresearch center that he had worked so hard to establish. I, and many \nothers, share many fond memories and great gratitude for the wonderful \nfriendship and great work of Dr. Harry Dupree. The pride that he has \nexhibited and has instilled in all Arkansans for the science industry \nof Aquaculture has been tremendous.\n  Dr. Dupree is a great man with a huge heart. I urge my colleagues to \nact promptly on this legislation so that Dr. Harry K. Dupree will \nreceive the recognition that he truly deserves.\n  Mr. President, at this point I ask unanimous consent that letters of \nsupport for this bill be included in the Record from constituents and \naquaculture associations across Arkansas.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                       The Senate,\n\n\n                                            State of Arkansas,\n\n                                                    June 22, 1999.\n     Hon. Blanche Lambert Lincoln,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: I am writing to submit my letter of \n     support for proposed legislation naming the USDA Fish Farming \n     Laboratory in Stuttgart after Dr. Harry Dupree.\n       As you know, you and I have served together with Dr. Dupree \n     on the Arkansas Delta Council and Foundation. Dr. Dupree has \n     served Delta Council since its formation in 1990, and more \n     recently as Treasurer. More importantly, Dr. Dupree has been \n     the central figure in the development of the Fish Farming \n     Laboratory since the beginning. When I was an aide to Senator \n     Bumpers, I recall meeting Dr. Dupree for the first time at \n     the annual U.S. Senate Catfish Fry in the Russell Senate \n     Office Building. He was busy telling everyone he could find \n     about the importance of the mission for the fish lab, and why \n     it needed more funding. Years later, Harry and I became close \n     friends when I moved to Stuttgart, and I witnessed his many \n     efforts as the chief champion of a new lab and mission at \n     USDA. Everything that is associated with the fish lab is due \n     at one level or another to the efforts of Dr. Harry Dupree.\n       Therefore, I can speak with complete authority when I say \n     that our constituents here in Arkansas County, and in the \n     aquaculture field, fully support the naming of this facility \n     after Dr. Dupree. I can think of no more fitting name for \n     this lab. Indeed, it is every bit as much an honor for USDA, \n     this center and for Arkansas County to have this named after \n     Dr. Dupree as it is an honor for Dr. Dupree.\n       Finally, I would ask that these comments, along with the \n     other comments you are receiving about Dr. Dupree, be listed \n     in the Congressional Record. I believe it would be a fitting \n     tribute for him, his wife Ruth, and for his hard work and \n     dedicated public service.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this request, and I \n     trust that all is well with you in Washington.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kevin A. Smith.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         ADFA,\n\n                                                    June 23, 1999.\n     Hon. Blanche Lincoln,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: I want to express my full support for \n     legislation that would change the name of the Stuttgart \n     National Aquaculture Research Center to the Harry K. Dupree \n     Stuttgart National Aquaculture Research Center.\n       Dr. Harry K. Dupree has devoted his professional career to \n     the advancement of warmwater fish culture; first as a \n     research scientist in fish nutrition and later in \n     administration of research while continuing with research. \n     Early in his career his research established the major \n     elements required for a manufactured feed for channel \n     catfish. This work included the establishment of amino acid \n     requirements of channel catfish, highlighting those that are \n     considered ``essential'', and testing many types of proteins \n     for their usefulness as primary amino acid sources. Dr. \n     Dupree contributed to the establishment of the vitamin \n     requirements of channel catfish, working specifically with \n     vitamin E, vitamin A, and beta carotene. Research on sources \n     of oil for formulating channel catfish diets led to the \n     understanding of the lipid requirements for commercial \n     production.\n       Dr. Dupree's research helped establish the form and \n     formulation of manufactured feed most readily accepted by \n     channel catfish. With his studies of the feeding habits of \n     cultured catfish, helped determine the quality of feed needed \n     at different stages of development, the digestibility of \n     feeds of different compositions, and the quantity and timing \n     of feeding for maximum pond production. His research \n     activities led to the formulation of pelleted feed for \n     catfish production and made it possible for catfish \n     production to move from a small, labor intensive industry of \n     local interest to a streamlined industry with potential for \n     expansion on the national and international level. Dr. Dupree \n     has written extensively on the subject of fish nutrition and \n     is a recognized authority on warmwater fish nutrition.\n       Dr. Dupree's research in other areas of fish biology \n     illustrates the breadth of his interest and abilities. His \n     work on immunity and with the immune response of paddlefish, \n     gar, and channel catfish lead to a better understanding of \n     basic systems of immunity. His research on hormone induction \n     of ovulation of goldfish led to modern day standard \n     procedures now employed in spawning these and other species \n     of fish. Other research has included pesticide analysis of \n     Channel catfish and work with karyology of grass carp that \n     led to modern methods for determining the difference between \n     diploids and triploids.\n       In 1984, Dr. Dupree was responsible for editing ``The Third \n     Report to the Fish Farmer'' and for revising or writing a \n     large part of the publication. ``The Third Report'' is a \n     comprehensive review of most aspects of warmwater aquaculture \n     and is one of the most popular publications released by the \n     U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; 17,500 copies have been \n     printed and most have been distributed to satisfy or through \n     GPO sales.\n       Dr. Dupree is largely responsible for the laboratories, \n     offices and research buildings that are now at the Stuttgart \n     National Aquaculture Research Center. His efforts, dating \n     back to before 1985, resulted in funding for design and \n     construction of the new laboratories and offices and it is \n     because of his efforts that the laboratory exists today. His \n     efforts are continuing as he expands the facilities available \n     for the growing research staff that he has fought to gain \n     funding for.\n       I have been involved with aquaculture for 30 years, first \n     as a fish farmer and for the last 8 years as the State \n     Aquaculture Coordinator. I don't know of anyone who has \n     contributed as much to the aquaculture industry as Dr. Harry \n     Dupree.\n       I have talked to people in many states that are very \n     supportive of this name change and feel that Dr. Dupree is \n     very worthy of the honor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ted McNulty,\n     State Aquaculture Coordinator, ADFA.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           University of Arkansas,\n\n\n                                      Division of Agriculture,\n\n                                                    June 30, 1999.\n     Hon. Blanche Lincoln,\n     United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: It is an honor and a pleasure to \n     support renaming of the Stuttgart National Aquaculture \n     Research Center in Stuttgart, Arkansas the Harry K. Dupree--\n     Stuttgart National Aquaculture Research Center. It is a \n     fitting tribute to a man who had a vision for what the Center \n     could be and then devoted his professional career to making \n     it a reality for the benefit of fish farmers and the fish \n     industry throughout the country.\n       If ever a person personifies dedication, it is Dr. Dupree. \n     He takes tremendous pride in the people, facilities, and \n     programs that make up the Stuttgart Center. For nearly forty \n     years, the Stuttgart Center has guided and championed the \n     warmwater aquaculture industry. For twenty-five of those \n     years, Dr. Dupree has been at the helm. Today thriving, \n     vibrant industry is a legacy of both the Center and the \n     leadership and devotion provided by Dr. Dupree.\n       I am proud to call Harry Dupree a friend and express my \n     deep gratitude for being given this opportunity to honor our \n     friendship and his career.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Milo J.

Blanch Lincoln,\n     United States Senate, Washington, D.C. 20510\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: As I discussed earlier with you, Keo \n     Fish Farm, Inc. would consider it most appropriate for the \n     Stuttgart Fish Farming Experiment Station to be re-named \n     after its long-time Director, Dr. Harry K. Dupree. I believe \n     you will find widespread support among Arkansas' fish farmers \n     for such action.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Mike Freeze.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Nickles, \n        Mr. Reid, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Graham, \n        Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Cochran, Mr. Craig, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Edwards, \n        Mr. Campbell, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Mack, Mr. \n        Domenici, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Santorum, and Mr. Leahy):\n\n[[Page S8138]]\n\n  S. 1341. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe applicability of section 179 which permits the expensing of certain \ndepreciable assets; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               main street business incentive act of 1999\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I'm joined by Senators Lott, \nDaschle, Nickles, Reid, Murkowski, and twenty-one other distinguished \ncolleagues in introducing the ``Main Street Business Incentive Act of \n1999,'' which addresses a gap in the current law that is impeding the \nimprovement of many of our small town Main Street businesses. \nSpecifically, the bill would raise the income tax expensing provision \nfor small businesses in current law from $19,000 to $25,000 this year. \nThe bill also would expand the provision to cover investments in \ncommercial buildings and structural improvements.\n  Mr. President, small businesses are the economic anchors of Main \nStreets in small and large communities throughout our country. They \nprovide jobs, sponsor local charities and little league teams, and \nenable people to purchase their daily necessities without driving long \ndistances. Without small businesses, we wouldn't have communities, \nwhich is why Congress has adjusted the tax laws in numerous ways over \nthe years to encourage investments that enable them to grow and thrive.\n  For example, many businesses have to depreciate the cost of new \nequipment purchases--which is to say, they deduct these costs over a \nlong period of years. Small businesses, by contrast, can ``expense'' up \nto $19,000 in purchases of such assets. They deduct the cost entirely \nin the first year. That maximum amount will increase to $25,000 in year \n2003. This tax provision is helpful to many small businesses because it \nenables them to write off the investment immediately and so bolsters \ntheir cash flow.\n  However, this expensing provision is not as helpful as it could be \nand needs to be. Specifically, it does not include investments that \nsmall businesses make in improving the store front or the building in \nwhich they conduct their business. In many small towns, the local drug \nstore, shoe store or grocery store doesn't have much need of new \nequipment. But it does need to improve the store front or the interior, \nand generally spruce things up.\n  Such investments are good for our Main Streets. They improve the \nappearance of both the business and the town. Yet under today's tax \nlaw, if a small business owner improves his storefront, he has to \nspread the cost of the investments for tax purposes over 39 years, \nwhich is the depreciation schedule for commercial real estate. The \nresult is a large economic hurdle for many of these small businesses.\n  There are Main Streets all across our country that were built or \nrefurbished thirty, forty or fifty years ago and now need investment \nand improvement. The Tax Code should encourage this. A simple way to \naccomplish it is to allow the expensing of up to $25,000, not only for \nequipment and machinery, but also for small business investments in \nstore fronts and business locations.

That's what my legislation \nprovides.\n  This would be a significant benefit to America's small business and I \nthink would result in a significant improvement in America's \ncommunities and main streets. This legislation is supported by a number \nof small business-oriented trade groups including the National \nFederation of Independent Business (NFIB), NFIB-North Dakota, the Small \nBusiness Legislative Council, the North Dakota Association of Realtors \nand National Association of Realtors.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this much-needed \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 1342. A bill to repeal the Federal estate and gift taxes and the \ntax on generation-skipping transfers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              legislation to repeal the federal death tax\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto repeal the federal death tax, otherwise known as the estate and gift \ntax. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record. I also ask unanimous consent that Colorado Senate Joint \nMemorial 99-004, approved by the Colorado Legislature be printed in the \nRecord. This memorial resolution urges the immediate repeal of the \nFederal estate and gift tax. Finally, I ask that an article I recently \nwrote on this topic be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                S. 1342\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF FEDERAL TRANSFER TAXES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 is repealed.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The repeal made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to the estates of decedents dying, and gifts and \n     generation-skipping transfers made, after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Technical and Conforming Changes.--The Secretary of the \n     Treasury or the Secretary's delegate shall, as soon as \n     practicable but in any event not later than 90 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, submit to the Committee on \n     Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on Finance of the Senate a draft of any technical \n     and conforming changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     which are necessary to reflect throughout such Code the \n     changes in the substantive provisions of law made by this \n     Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       Time to End the Estate tax\n\n                       (By Senator Wayne Allard)\n\n       As we approach the new millennium a consensus has emerged \n     in favor of significant tax reform. While some prefer the \n     flat tax, others advocate the sales tax. A third camp argues \n     that Congress should avoid a complete overhaul and instead \n     work to improve the existing system. Whatever path is chosen, \n     it should include elimination of the federal estate and gift \n     tax. Repeal of the estate tax is the first step toward a \n     fairer and flatter tax system.\n       Congress has levied estate taxes at various times \n     throughout U.S. history, particularly during war. The current \n     estate tax dates back to 1916, a time when many in Congress \n     were looking for ways to redistribute some of the wealth held \n     by a small number of super-rich families. This first \n     permanent estate tax had a top rate of only 10 percent, and \n     the threshold was high enough to ensure that the tax effected \n     only a tiny fraction of the population.\n       Like the rest of our tax code, it did not take long for \n     this limited tax to evolve into a more substantial burden. In \n     only the second year of the tax, the top rate was increased \n     to 25 percent. By 1935 the top rate was 70 percent and in \n     1941 it reached an all time high of 77 percent.\n       While income tax rates have declined in recent decades, \n     estate taxes have remained high. Today, the top estate tax \n     rate is 55 percent (a top marginal rate of 60 percent is paid \n     by some estates), and the tax is imposed on amounts above the \n     1999 exemption level of $650,000 (value above $650,000 is \n     taxed at an initial rate of 37%).\n       Generally, the value of all assets held at death is \n     included in the estate for purposes of assessing the tax--\n     this includes residences, business assets, stocks, bonds, \n     savings, personal property, etc. Estate tax returns are due \n     within nine months of the decedent's death (a six-month \n     extension is available) and with the exception of certain \n     closely held businesses, the tax is due when the return is \n     filed. The tax is paid by the estate rather than by the \n     beneficiary (in contrast to an inheritance tax).\n       The 1997 tax bill increased the unified estate and gift tax \n     exemption from $600,000 to $1 million. However, this is done \n     very gradually and does not reach the $1 million level until \n     2006. The bill also increased the exemption amount for a \n     qualified family owned business to $1.3 million. While both \n     actions are a good first step, they barely compensate for the \n     effects of inflation. The $600,000 exemption level was last \n     set in 1987, just to keep pace with inflation the exemption \n     should have risen to $850,000 by 1997. Incremental \n     improvements help, but we need more substantial reform.\n       The United States retains among the highest estate taxes in \n     the world. Among industrial nations, only Japan has a higher \n     top rate than the U.S. But Japan's 70 percent applies to \n     an inheritance of $16 million or more. The U.S. top rate \n     of 55% kicks in on estates of $3 million or more. France, \n     the United Kingdom, and Ireland all have top rates of 40%, \n     and the average top rate of OECD countries is only 29%. \n     Australia, Canada, and Mexico presently have no estate \n     taxes.\n       The strongest argument that supporters of the estate tax \n     make is that most American families will never have to pay an \n     estate tax. While this is true, it does not justify retention \n     of a tax that causes great harm to family businesses and \n     farms, often constitutes double taxation, limits economic \n     growth, consumes significant resources in unproductive tax \n     compliance activities, and raises only a tiny portion of \n     federal tax revenues. In other words, the estate tax is not \n     worth all the trouble.\n       The estate tax can destroy a family business. This is the \n     most disturbing aspect of the tax. No American family should \n     lose its business or farm because of the estate tax. Current \n     estimates are that more than 70 percent of family businesses \n     do not survive the\n\n[[Page S8139]]\n\n     second generation, and 87 percent do not survive the third \n     generation. While there are many reasons for these high \n     numbers, the estate tax is certainly one of them. The estate \n     tax fails to distinguish between cash and non-liquid assets, \n     and since family businesses are often asset-rich and cash \n     poor, they can be forced to sell assets in order to pay the \n     tax. This practice can destroy the business outright, or \n     leave it so strapped for capital that long-term survival is \n     jeopardized. Similarly, more and more large ranches and farms \n     are facing the prospect of break-up and sale to developers in \n     order to pay the estate tax. In addition to destroying a \n     family business, this harms the environment.\n       Recently, the accounting firm Price Waterhouse calculated \n     the taxable components of 1995 estates. While 21 percent of \n     assets were corporate stock and bonds, and another 21 percent \n     were mutual fund assets, fully 32 percent of gross estates \n     consisted of ``business assets'' such as stock in closely \n     held businesses, interests in non-corporate businesses and \n     farms, and interests in limited partnerships. In larger \n     estates this portion rose to 55 percent. Clearly, a \n     substantial portion of taxable estates consist of family \n     businesses.\n       The National Center for Policy Analysis reports that a 1995 \n     survey by Travis Research Associates found that 51 percent of \n     family businesses would have significant difficulty surviving \n     the estate tax, and 30 percent of respondents said they would \n     have to sell part or all of their business. This is supported \n     by a 1995 Family Business Survey conducted by Matthew \n     Greenwald and Associates which found that 33 percent of \n     family businesses anticipate having to liquidate or sell part \n     of their business to pay the estate tax.\n       While some businesses are destroyed by the estate tax, many \n     more expend substantial resources in tax planning and \n     compliance. Those that survive the estate tax often do so by \n     purchasing expensive insurance. A 1995 Gallup survey of \n     family firms found that 23 percent of the owners of companies \n     valued at over $10 million pay $50,000 or more per year in \n     insurance premiums on policies designed to help them pay the \n     eventual tax bill. The same survey found that family firms \n     estimated they had spent on average over $33,000 on \n     lawyers, accountants and financial planners over a period \n     of 6.5 years in order to prepare for the estate tax.\n       In fact, one of the great ironies of the estate tax is that \n     an extensive amount of tax planning can very nearly eliminate \n     the tax. This results in a situation where the very wealthy \n     can end up paying less estate tax than those of more modest \n     means. As noted above, life insurance can play a big role in \n     estate planning, but there are also mechanisms such as \n     qualified personal residence trusts, charitable remainder \n     trusts, charitable lead trusts, generation-skipping trusts, \n     and the effective use of annual gifts. While these mechanisms \n     may reduce the tax, they waste resources that could be put to \n     much better use growing businesses and creating jobs.\n       One of the tenets of a fair tax system is that income is \n     taxed only once. Income should be taxed when it is first \n     earned or realized, it should not be repeatedly re-taxed by \n     government. The estate tax violates this tenet. At the time \n     of a person's death, much of their savings, business assets, \n     or farm assets have already been subjected to federal, state, \n     and local tax. These same assets are then taxed again under \n     the estate tax. Price Waterhouse has calculated that those \n     families that will be liable for the estate tax face the \n     prospect of nearly 73 percent of every dollar being taxed \n     away.\n       Repeal of the estate tax would benefit the economy. Without \n     the estate tax, greater business resources could be put \n     toward productive economic activities. Recently, the Center \n     for the Study of Taxation commissioned George Mason \n     University Professor Richard Wagner to estimate the economic \n     impact of a phase-out of the estate tax. He estimated that if \n     the tax is phased out over 5 years beginning in 1999, that \n     the economy would create 189,895 more jobs and would grow by \n     an additional $509 billion over a ten year period. Similarly, \n     a recent Heritage Foundation study simulated the results of \n     an estate tax repeal under two respected economic models, the \n     Washington University Macro Model, and the Wharton \n     Econometric Model. Under the models, a repeal of the tax is \n     forecast to increase jobs and GDP, as well as reduce the cost \n     of capital.\n       One might expect that with all the economic dislocation \n     associated with the estate tax that it raises a significant \n     amount of revenue or accomplishes a redistributionist social \n     policy. In fact, the revenue take is quite modest--\n     approximately 1 percent of federal revenue, or $14.7 billion \n     in 1995. And as for social policy, the ability of the federal \n     government to equalize wealth through the estate tax may be \n     quite limited. A 1995 study published by the Rand Corporation \n     found that for the very wealthiest Americans, only 7.5 \n     percent of their wealth is attributable to inheritance--the \n     other 92.5 percent is from earnings.\n       America is a nation of tremendous economic opportunity. \n     Success is determined principally through hard work and \n     individual initiative. Our tax policy should focus on \n     encouraging greater initiative rather than on attempts to \n     limit inherited wealth. The estate tax is a relic. It damages \n     family businesses, harms the economy, and constitutes double \n     taxation. It is time for the estate tax to go.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Senate Joint Memorial 99-004\n\n       Whereas, The Federal Unified Gift and Estate Tax, or \n     ``Death Tax'', generates a minimal amount of federal revenue, \n     especially considering the high cost of collection and \n     compliance and in fact has been shown to decrease federal \n     revenues from what they might otherwise have been; and\n       Whereas, This federal Death Tax has been identified as \n     destructive to job opportunity and expansion, especially to \n     minority entrepreneurs and family farmers; and\n       Whereas, This federal Death Tax causes severe hardship to \n     growing family businesses and family farming operations, \n     often to the point of partial or complete forced liquidation; \n     and\n       Whereas, Critical state and local leadership assets are \n     unnecessarily destroyed and forever lost to the future \n     detriment of their communities through relocation or \n     liquidation; and\n       Whereas, Local and state schools, churches, and numerous \n     charitable organizations would greatly benefit from the \n     increased employment and continued family business leadership \n     that would result from the repeal of the federal Death Tax; \n     now, therefore,\n       Be It Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-second General \n     Assembly of the State of Colorado, the House of \n     Representatives concurring herein: That the Congress of the \n     United States is hereby memoralized to immediately repeal the \n     Federal Unified Gift and Estate Tax.\n       Be It Further Resolved, That copies of this Joint Memorial \n     be sent to the President of the United States, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the President of \n     the United States Senate, and each member of the Colorado \n     congressional delegation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 1343. A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to convey \ncertain National Forest land to Elko County, Nevada, for continued use \nas a cemetery, to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       conveyance of national forest land to elko county, nevada\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nauthorize the Secretary of Agriculture to convey, without \nconsideration, two acres of land to Elko County, NV, for use as a \ncemetery. This proposal should not be controversial, and I urge my \ncolleagues to act upon this quickly.\n  Jarbidge, NV, is a small town located in the remote wilderness of \nElko County in northern Nevada. Surrounded by the Humboldt-Toiyabe \nNational Forest, this community is representative of many of the small, \nrural communities of Nevada. Its residents have worked hard to earn a \nliving off the land and many of its families have deep roots in Nevada \nestablished decades ago by early pioneers to the Silver State. Since \nthe 1900's, the people there have buried their dead in a small parcel \nof national forest land.\n  The people of Jarbidge now have an opportunity to establish a \npermanent trust for the maintenance of this historic cemetery. The \nestablishment of the trust is dependent on county ownership of the \nland, however. The Forest Service has stated that they cannot and will \nnot give the land to the County, and insist that the land be paid for--\neither in cash or via a land exchange. While I agree that in the vast \nmajority of instances this is the correct stance, in this case the \nForest Service is just plain wrong.\n  We should do the right thing and give this land to the county to \nhonor the families whose loved ones rest in that small cemetery. The \nbill I introduce today is companion legislation to a House bill \nintroduced by my fellow Nevada legislator Jim Gibbons--a bill which is \nmaking its way through the House. I hope my colleagues in the Senate \nwill act quickly so that the residents of Jarbidge will know the entire \nU.S. Congress supports their efforts to honor the memory of deceased \nresidents whose graves occupy this tiny plot of land.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1343\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONVEYANCE OF NATIONAL FOREST LAND TO ELKO COUNTY, \n                   NEVADA, FOR USE AS CEMETERY.\n\n       (a) Requirement To Convey.--The Secretary of Agriculture \n     shall convey, without consideration, to Elko County, Nevada, \n     all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to \n     the parcel of real property described in subsection (b), for \n     use as a cemetery.\n       (b) Description of Property.--\n       (1) In general.--The property referred to in subsection (a) \n     is a parcel of National Forest land (including any \n     improvements on

Section 9 T 46 N, R 58 E, MDB\n       (2) Survey.--\n       (A) In general.--The exact acreage and legal description of \n     the property to be conveyed under subsection (a) shall be \n     determined by a survey satisfactory to the Secretary.\n       (B) Cost.--As a condition of any conveyance under this \n     section, the County shall pay the cost of the survey.\n       (c) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions with respect to \n     the conveyance under subsection (a) as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a \nresolution to commemorate the Zinfandel grape.\n  The Zinfandel grape has a long and unique history that mirrors the \ndiversity and agricultural development of our nation. Unlike other \ngrapes that today have international recognition--such as Cabernet, \nChardonnay, or Pinot Noir--the Zinfandel grape is uniquely and \ndistinctly American. One writer has referred to it as ``the Horatio \nAlger of varietals, the True American.''\n  While Zinfandel's exact origins are unclear, we know that it was \nconsumed as a table grape in New England in the 1830's, and that \nZinfandel cuttings from a nursery in Long Island were taken by the \nsettlers as they headed west. During the California Gold Rush of 1849, \nZinfandel vines were planted and their products consumed as table \ngrapes and as wine. By the 1880's, Zinfandel was the most commonly \nplanted red grape in the West, and the wine made from Zinfandel grapes \nbegan winning awards as early as 1859.\n  Today the Zinfandel grape is our most versatile of viticultural \nproducts. It is used in jams, jellies, pasta sauces, mustards, and \nother food products. It is produced as a wine in 14 states, including \nArizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts, \nNevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas.\n  Zinfandel products now touch every region of the United States, yet \nknowledge of its uniquely American heritage is poor. I hope that \npassage of this resolution will bring greater awareness to the public \nof the notable and uniquely American attributes of this important \nagricultural product.\n  In my state, there are grape vines in the foothills of the Sierra \nNevada mountains that have been alive since the late 1800's. These \nancient vines still produce grapes, and the genetic qualities of these \ngrapes so interest scientists that the University of California at \nDavis has established a ``Heritage Vineyard'' project specifically to \nstudy these plants.\n  On a more prosaic level, these old vines are a living link to our \npast--to a time when many Americans living in the East uprooted \nthemselves and moved to West to cultivate and settle the entire expanse \nof our country. We should recognize and treasure these historical \nconnections to the development of our nation.\n  Mr. President, let me clarify that this resolution does not seek to \ncommemorate an alcoholic product, or any particular commercial product. \nIt does not seek to commemorate a ``western'' issue, since Zinfandel \nfood products are consumed nationwide and Zinfandel grapes are made \ninto wine in every major portion of the country.

Res. 134\n\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT ``SHOELESS JOE'' JACKSON \n                   SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED FOR HIS BASEBALL \n                   ACCOMPLISHMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) In 1919, the infamous ``Black Sox'' scandal erupted \n     when an employee of a New York gambler allegedly bribed 8 \n     players of the Chicago White Sox, including Joseph Jefferson \n     ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson, to throw the first and second games \n     of the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds.\n       (2) In September 1920, a criminal court acquitted \n     ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson of the charge that he conspired to \n     throw the 1919 World Series.\n       (3) Despite the acquittal, Commissioner Landis banned \n     ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson from playing Major League Baseball \n     for life without conducting any investigation of Jackson's \n     alleged activities, issuing a summary punishment that fell \n     far short of due process standards.\n       (4) The evidence shows that Jackson did not deliberately \n     misplay during the 1919 World Series in an attempt to make \n     his team lose the World Series.\n       (5) During the 1919 World Series, Jackson's play was \n     outstanding--his batting average was .375, the highest of any \n     player from either team; he had 12 hits, setting a World \n     Series record; he did not commit any errors; and he hit the \n     only home run of the Series.\n       (6) Not only was Jackson's performance during the 1919 \n     World Series unmatched, but his accomplishments throughout \n     his 13-year career in professional baseball were outstanding \n     as well--he was 1 of only 7 Major League Baseball players to \n     ever top the coveted mark of a .400 batting average for a \n     season, and he earned a lifetime batting average of .356, the \n     third highest of all time.\n       (7) ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson's career record clearly makes \n     him one of our Nation's top baseball players of all time.\n       (8) Because of his lifetime ban from Major League Baseball, \n     ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson has been excluded from consideration \n     for admission to the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame.\n       (9) ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson passed away in 1951, and 80 \n     years have elapsed since the 1919 World Series scandal \n     erupted.\n       (10) Recently, Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig \n     took an important first step toward restoring the reputation \n     of ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson by agreeing to investigate \n     whether he was involved in a conspiracy to alter the outcome \n     of the 1919 World Series and whether he should be eligible \n     for inclusion in the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame.\n       (11) Courts have exonerated ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson, the \n     evidence shows that Jackson did not deliberately misplay \n     during the 1919 World Series, and 80 years have passed since \n     the scandal erupted; therefore, Major League Baseball should \n     remove the taint upon the memory of ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson \n     and honor his outstanding baseball accomplishments.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Joseph Jefferson ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson should be \n     appropriately honored for his outstanding baseball \n     accomplishments.\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators \nThurmond and Hollings, I am submitting today a sense of the Senate \nresolution to right a wrong perpetrated against one of the greatest \nAmerican baseball players of all time--Joseph Jefferson ``Shoeless \nJoe'' Jackson.\n  In 1920 ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson was banned from the game of \nbaseball, the game he loved. He was banned from Major League baseball \nfor allegedly taking part in a conspiracy to throw the 1919 World \nSeries, in what has become known as the ``Black Sox'' scandal. While \n``Shoeless Joe'' did admit that he received $5,000 from his roommate, \nLefty Williams, to participate in the fix, evidence suggests that \nJackson did everything in his power to stop the fix from going through. \nHe twice tried to give the money back. He offered to sit out the World \nSeries in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety. And, he tried \nto inform White Sox owner Charles Comisky of the fix. All of these \nefforts fell on deaf ears.\n  Perhaps the most convincing evidence of Jackson's withdrawal from the \nconspiracy was his performance on the field during the series. During \nthe 1919 World Series--which he was accused of conspiring to fix--\n``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson's batting average was .375, the highest of any \nplayer from either team. He had 12 hits, a World Series record. He led \nhis team in runs scored and runs batted in. And, he hit the only home \nrun of the series. On defense, Jackson committed no errors and had no \nquestionable plays in 30 chances.\n  When criminal charges were brought against Jackson in trial, the jury \nfound him ``not guilty.'' White Sox owner Charles Comiskey and several \nsportswriters testified that they saw no indication that Jackson did \nanything to indicate he was trying to throw the series. But, when the \nissue came before the newly-formed Major League Baseball Commissioner's \noffice, Commissioner Judge Kenesaw ``Mountain'' Landis found Jackson \nguilty of taking part in the fix, and he was banned for life from \nplaying baseball. The Commissioner's office never conducted an \ninvestigation and never heard a hearing, thus denying ``Shoeless Joe'' \nJackson due process.\n  Major League Baseball now has an opportunity to correct a great \ninjustice. I wrote recently to Commissioner Bud Selig urging him to \ntake a new look at this case. I was very pleased when the Commissioner \nresponded to my inquiry by saying he is giving the case a fair and \nobjective review. Restoring ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson's eligibility for \nthe Hall of Fame would benefit Major League Baseball, baseball fans, \nand all Americans who appreciate a sense of fair play.\n  ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson is an inspiration to people of all \ngenerations. Babe Ruth was said to have copied Jackson's swing. I was \ntouched by Jackson's story through the movie ``Field of Dreams,'' which \nrecounted his story. The movie was filmed in Dyersville, Iowa. \nThousands of Iowans, young and old alike, have come to embrace \n``Shoeless Joe.'' In fact, there is an annual Shoeless Joe Jackson \ncelebration and celebrity baseball game in Dyersville. This year it \nwill be attended by a cast of baseball greats, including Tommy Lasorda \nand Bob Feller.\n  Jackson's career statistics and accomplishments throughout his \nthirteen years in professional baseball clearly earn him a place as one \nof baseball's\n\n[[Page S8144]]\n\nall-time greats. His career batting average of .356 is the third \nhighest of all time. In addition, Jackson was one of only seven Major \nLeague Baseball players to top the coveted mark of a .400 batting \naverage for a season.\n  The resolution we submit today states that Major League Baseball \nshould honor Jackson's accomplishments appropriately. I believe Jackson \nshould be inducted into the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame. If that \nis to happen, Jackson must first be cleared for consideration by the \nHall of Fame Veterans Committee, which will stand as the jury which \ndecides whether Jackson's accomplishments during his playing career are \nworthy of recognition in the Hall of Fame.\n  Mr. President, we are involved in many important issues. Clearly, \nthis matter will not and should not take up the same amount of time \nthis body devotes to critical issues like health care, education, or \nnational defense. But, restoring the good name and reputation of a \nsingle American is important. This resolution gives us an opportunity \nto right an old wrong. It gives us an opportunity to honor one of the \nall-time great players of America's pastime, ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8144-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION--CALLING FOR THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF THE THREE \n                   HUMANITARIAN WORKERS IN YUGOSLAVIA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Leahy) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today I am joining with Senator Leahy to \nintroduce a resolution calling for the immediate release of three CARE \nInternational workers in Yugoslavia. The three humanitarian workers \ncommitted no crime and are being held prisoner unjustly. Coercion was \nused in extracting a televised ``confession'' from one of the workers \nand the judicial proceedings held against them were a sham, preventing \nthem from mounting a serious defense.\n  The men, Branko Jelen, Steve Pratt, and Peter Wallace, are three \nhumanitarian workers employed in Yugoslavia by CARE International, \nwhich has been providing food, medicines and fuel to more than 50,000 \nSerbian refugees in Serbia and to displaced ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\n  On March 31, 1999, Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace, two Australian \nnationals, were arrested and later accused of operating a spy ring. \nBranko Jelen, a Yugoslav, was arrested a week later on the same \ncharges. Yugoslav officials forced Steve Pratt to appear on Serbian \ntelevision on April 11, when he was coerced into saying that he had \nperformed covert intelligence activities. The three were held without \naccess to outsiders for 20 days.\n  On May 29 a military court dismissed the original indictment, but \nthen convicted the three CARE International workers on an entirely new \ncharge of passing on information to a foreign organization, their \nemployer, CARE International! This charge was introduced at the reading \nof the verdict, denying lawyers for the three any opportunity to mount \nan appropriate defense. Pratt was sentenced to 12 years, Jelen to 6 \nyears, and Wallace to 4 years in prison.\n  These humanitarian workers apparently were convicted of providing \n``situation reports'' to their head office and other CARE International \noffices around the world, based on legitimately gathered information. \nSuch reports are necessary to enable CARE International management to \nplan their humanitarian assistance and to inform CARE International \nmanagement of the rapidly changing security situation faced by their \nstaff.\n  The convictions of these three humanitarian workers raise serious \nquestions regarding the ability of humanitarian aid organizations to \noperate in Yugoslavia, with implications for their operations in other \nareas of conflict around the world. Humanitarian workers must feel \nsecure enough to do their work and must not be at risk of going to \nprison on false charges. Since that is not now the case in Serbia, CARE \nInternational regretfully was forced to stop its operations there.\n  The resolution we introduce today urges the United States and the \nUnited Nations to try to secure the release of the three humanitarian \nworkers and calls on the Yugoslavia government to release them. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8144-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8144-S8145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION--CONDEMNING THE ACTS OF ARSON AT THE THREE \n SACRAMENTO, CA, AREA SYNAGOGUES ON JUNE 18, 1999, AND CALLING ON ALL \n    AMERICANS TO CATEGORICALLY REJECT CRIMES OF HATE AND INTOLERANCE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. \nAbraham) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of my amendment \ncreating the Federal Employees Equity Act of 1999.\n  My legislation expands a provision included in the Omnibus \nAppropriations Bill for fiscal year 1997 (P.L. 104-208) to allow \nFederal agencies to contribute to the costs of professional liability \ninsurance for their senior executives, managers and law enforcement \nofficials. While this important benefit contained in the Omnibus \nAppropriation bill was indeed enacted, it has not been made available \non as wide a basis to Federal employees as we had hoped.\n  The Federal Employees Equity Act would ensure that Federal agencies \nreimburse one-half the premiums for Professional Liability Insurance \nfor employees covered by this bill. Federal managers, supervisors and \nlaw enforcement officials should not have to fear the excessive costs \nof legal representation when unwarranted allegations are made against \nthem and investigations of these allegations are conducted.\n  I was a strong supporter of the provision in 1996 because Federal \nofficials often found themselves to be the target of unfounded \nallegations of wrongdoing. Sometimes allegations were made by citizens, \nagainst whom Federal officials were enforcing the law and by employees \nwho had performance or conduct problems. Although many allegations have \nproven to be specious, these Federal officials were often subject to \nlengthy investigations and had to pay for their own legal \nrepresentation when their agencies could not provide it.\n  The affected Federal managers, supervisors and law enforcement \nofficials are generally prohibited from being represented by unions. \nFor employees who are in bargaining units represented by unions, \nCongress allows Federal agencies to subsidize the time and expenses of \nunion representatives when they are needed by such employees, whether \nor not they are dues paying members of the union.\n  Because these Federal officials are denied union representation, they \nhave found it necessary to purchase Professional Liability Insurance in \norder to protect themselves when allegations are made against them to \nthe Inspector General of their agency, to the Office of Special \nCounsel, or to the EEO office. The insurance provides coverage for \nlegal representation for the employees when they are accused, and will \npay judgments against the employee up to a maximum dollar amount if the \nemployee is found to have made a mistake while carrying out his \nofficial duties. Currently, these managers must hire their own lawyers \nin order to defend their reputation and careers when they are the \nsubject of a grievance, regardless of whether the complaint has merit.\n  The current law has had some success and has been implemented by \nseveral Federal departments including: Departments of Agriculture, \nEducation, Interior, Labor, and such agencies as the Social Security \nAdministration, Small Business Administration, General Services \nAdministration, Securities and Exchange Commission, National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, the Office of the Inspector \nGeneral at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the \nNational Science Foundation, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the \nOffice of the Inspector General at the Office of Public Health and \nScience, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration at Department of Health and Human Services.\n  Regrettably, other departments such as Treasury, Justice, Defense, \nCommerce, Transportation, Veterans Affairs, and agencies such as the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Office of Personnel \nManagement have not seen fit to do so.\n  The professional associations of these officials (the Senior \nExecutives Association, the Professional Managers Association, the FBI \nAgents Association, the Federal Criminal Investigators Association, the \nFederal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the National Association \nof Assistant U.S. Attorneys, and the Nation Treasury Employees Union) \nhave endorsed the concept for legislation to require Federal agencies \nto reimburse half the cost of premiums for Professional Liability \nInsurance.\n  The intent of this measure is simply to ``level the playing field'' \nso that supervisors and managers are treated equally by various Federal \nagencies and have access to protections similar to those which are \nalready provided for rank and file Federal employees.\n  I request your support for these Federal officials and for this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  KYL (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1195\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL (for Mr. Kyl (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Graham, Mr.\n\n[[Page S8146]]\n\nGramm, and Mr. Bingaman)) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1282, \nsupra; as follows:\n\n       On page 13, line 24, strike ``$1,670,747,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,720,747,000''.\n       On page 15, line 6, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That $50,000,000 shall be \n     available until expended to hire, train, provide equipment \n     for, and deploy 500 new Customs inspectors''.\n       On page 49, line 13, strike ``$38,175,000'' and insert \n     ``$36,500,000''.\n       On page 50, line 1, strike ``$23,681,000'' and insert \n     ``$22,586,000''.\n       On page 53, line 3, strike ``$624,896,000'' and insert \n     ``$590,110,000''.\n       On page 58, line 8, strike ``$120,198,000'' and insert \n     ``$109,344,000''.\n       On page 62, line 26, strike ``$27,422,000'' and insert \n     ``$25,805,000''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  KYL (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1196\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL (for Mr. Kyl (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Abraham)) proposed an amendment to the \nbill, S. 1282, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FUNDING FOR CUSTOMS SERVICE \n                   PERSONNEL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Government is responsible for securing our \n     Nation's borders and stopping the flow of illegal drugs into \n     the United States. The Federal Government is also responsible \n     for affecting the flow of legitimate trade and commerce \n     across the southern and northern borders of the United \n     States.\n       (2) The United States Customs Service needs additional \n     personnel to carry out its increasingly difficult mission, to \n     seize illegal drugs and contraband and facilitate legitimate \n     trade and commerce. Canada and Mexico are the United States \n     first and second largest trading partners, respectively.\n       (3) The number of commercial trucks crossing United States-\n     Mexico and United States-Canada ports-of-entry increased from \n     7,500,000 in 1994 to 10,100,000 in 1998, a 40-percent \n     increase. More than 372,000,000 people crossed either the \n     United States-Mexico or United States-Canada border in fiscal \n     year 1998 and an additional 87,000,000 international \n     passengers were processed at United States airports and \n     seaports during fiscal year 1998. Between 1994 and 1998, \n     however, the total number of United States Customs Service \n     inspectors and canine enforcement officers increased by only \n     540, from 5,668 inspectors to 6,208 inspectors. As a result, \n     significant delays in cross-border traffic now occur at \n     various ports-of-entry throughout the United States.\n       (4) Even with limited numbers of inspectors and agents, the \n     United States Customs Service continues to seize an alarming \n     amount of drugs. Of the 3,484 pounds of heroin seized in the \n     United States in 1998, the United States Customs Service \n     seized 2,705 pounds. Of the 264,630 pounds of cocaine seized \n     in the United States in 1998, the Customs Service seized \n     148,103 pounds. Of the 1,760,000 pounds of marijuana seized \n     last year in the United States, the Customs Service seized \n     995,988 pounds.\n       (5) The United States Customs Service must have the \n     necessary staffing and technology to detect, deter, disrupt, \n     and seize illegal drugs and to expedite the processing of \n     traffic and cargo at United States ports. Approximately 1,360 \n     additional full-time Customs inspectors are needed to reduce \n     traffic congestion to 20 minutes per vehicle at land ports of \n     entry and to better interdict illegal drugs.\n       (6) The Customs Service requested 617 additional inspectors \n     for fiscal year 2000 to work towards this goal. In the fiscal \n     year 2000 budget request to Congress, however, the President \n     set aside no additional money to hire additional inspectors.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that additional funding should be provided to the United \n     States Customs Service to hire necessary staff for drug \n     interdiction and traffic facilitation at United States land \n     border crossings, including 617 full-time, active duty \n     Customs inspectors for United States ports of entry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               JEFFORDS (AND LANDRIEU) AMENDMENT NO. 1197\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL (for Mr. Jeffords (for himself, Mrs. Landrieu, and Mr. \nRobb)) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1282, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n          TITLE ____--CHILD CARE CENTERS IN FEDERAL FACILITIES\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Military and \n     Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Civilian employees of the Department of Defense, and \n     civilian employees of Department of Defense contractors, \n     provide critical support to the Armed Forces of the United \n     States that are deployed during a contingency operation.\n       (2) Misconduct by such persons undermines good order and \n     discipline in the Armed Forces, and jeopardizes the mission \n     of the contingency operation.\n       (3) Military commanders need the legal tools to address \n     adequately misconduct by civilians serving with Armed Forces \n     during a contingency operation.\n       (4) In its present state, military law does not permit \n     military commanders to address adequately misconduct by \n     civilians serving with Armed Forces, except in time of a \n     congressionally declared war.\n       (5) To address this need, the Uniform Code of Military \n     Justice should be amended to provide for court-martial \n     jurisdiction over civilians serving with Armed Forces in \n     places designated by the Secretary of Defense during a \n     ``contingency operation'' expressly designated as such by the \n     Secretary of Defense.\n       (6) This limited extension of court-martial jurisdiction \n     over civilians is dictated by military necessity, is within \n     the constitutional powers of Congress to make rules for the \n     government of the Armed Forces, and, therefore, is consistent \n     with the Constitution of the United States and United States \n     public policy.\n       (7) Many thousand civilian employees of the Department of \n     Defense, civilian employees of Department of Defense \n     contractors, and civilian dependents accompany the Armed \n     Forces to installations in foreign countries.\n       (8) Misconduct among such civilians has been a longstanding \n     problem for military commanders and other United States \n     officials in foreign countries, and threatens United States \n     citizens, United States property, and United States relations \n     with host countries.\n       (9) Federal criminal law does not apply to many offenses \n     committed outside of the United States by such civilians and, \n     because host countries often do not prosecute such offenses, \n     serious crimes often go unpunished and,to address this \n     jurisdictional gap, Federal law should be amended to punish \n     serious offenses committed by such civilians outside the \n     United States, to the same extent as if those offenses were \n     committed within the special maritime and territorial \n     jurisdiction of the United States.\n       (10) Federal law does not apply to many crimes committed \n     outside the United States by members of the Armed Forces who \n     separate from the Armed Forces before they can be identified, \n     thus escaping court-martial jurisdiction and, to address this \n     jurisdictional gap, Federal law should be amended to punish \n     serious offenses committed by such persons outside the United \n     States, to the same extent as if those offenses were \n     committed within the special maritime and territorial \n     jurisdiction of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. COURT-MARTIAL JURISDICTION.\n\n       (a) Jurisdiction During Contingency Operations.--Section \n     802(a) of title 10, United States Code (article 2(a) of the \n     Uniform Code of Military Justice), is amended by inserting \n     after paragraph (12) the following:\n       ``(13) To the extent not covered by paragraphs (10) and \n     (11), persons not members of the armed forces who, in support \n     of a contingency operation described in section 101(a)(13)(B) \n     of this title, are serving with and accompanying an armed \n     force in a place or places outside the United States \n     specified by the Secretary of Defense, as follows:\n       ``(A) Employees of the Department of Defense.\n       ``(B) Employees of any Department of Defense contractor who \n     are so serving in connection with the performance of a \n     Department of Defense contract.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act \n     and apply with respect to acts or omissions occurring on or \n     after that date.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A Justice Department crime \n     victimization survey found that while the city saw a decline \n     in the homicide rate between 1996 and 1997, the rate was the \n     highest among a dozen cities and more than double the second \n     highest city.\n       (2) The District of Columbia has not made adequate funding \n     available to fight drug abuse in recent years, and the city \n     has not deployed its resources as effectively as possible. In \n     fiscal year 1998, $20,900,000 was spent on publicly funded \n     drug treatment in the District compared to $29,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 1993. The District's Addiction and Prevention and \n     Recovery Agency currently has only 2,200 treatment slots, a \n     50 percent drop from 1994, with more than 1,100 people on \n     waiting lists.\n       (3) The District of Columbia has seen a rash of inmate \n     escapes from halfway houses. According to Department of \n     Corrections records, between October 21, 1998 and January 19, \n     1999, 376 of the 1,125 inmates assigned to halfway houses \n     walked away. Nearly 280 of the 376 escapees were awaiting \n     trial including 2 charged with murder.\n       (4) The District of Columbia public schools system faces \n     serious challenges in correcting chronic problems, \n     particularly long-standing deficiencies in providing special \n     education services to the 1 in 10 District students needing \n     program benefits, including backlogged assessments, and \n     repeated failure to meet a compliance agreement on special \n     education reached with the Department of Education.\n       (5) Deficiencies in the delivery of basic public services \n     from cleaning streets to waiting time at Department of Motor \n     Vehicles to a rat population estimated earlier this year to \n     exceed the human population have generated considerable \n     public frustration.\n       (6) Last year, the District of Columbia forfeited millions \n     of dollars in Federal grants after Federal auditors \n     determined that several agencies exceeded grant restrictions \n     and in other instances, failed to spend funds before the \n     grants expired.\n       (7) Findings of a 1999 report by the Annie E. Casey \n     Foundation that measured the well-being of children reflected \n     that, with 1 exception, the District ranked worst in the \n     United States in every category from infant mortality to the \n     rate of teenage births to statistics chronicling child \n     poverty.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that in considering the District of Columbia's fiscal year \n     2001 budget, the Senate will take into consideration progress \n     or lack of progress in addressing the following issues:\n       (1) Crime, including the homicide rate, implementation of \n     community policing, the number of police officers on local \n     beats, and the closing down of open-air drug markets.\n       (2) Access to drug abuse treatment, including the number of \n     treatment slots, the number of people served, the number of \n     people on waiting lists, and the effectiveness of treatment \n     programs.\n       (3) Management of parolees and pretrial violent offenders, \n     including the number of halfway house escapes and steps taken \n     to improve monitoring and supervision of halfway house \n     residents to reduce the number of escapes.\n       (4) Education, including access to special education \n     services and student achievement.\n       (5) Improvement in basic city services, including rat \n     control and abatement.\n       (6) Application for and management of Federal grants.\n       (7) Indicators of child well-being.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      HUTCHISON AMENDMENT NO. 1228\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1283, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, in 1972, Congress established the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), an independent regulatory \nagency designed to ``protect the public from unreasonable risks of \ninjuries and deaths associated with consumer products.'' Since 1972, \nCPSC has worked to accomplish that goal by developing uniform safety \nstandards, obtaining the recall of dangerous products, and researching, \ninforming and educating consumers about product related hazards. CPSC \nhas jurisdiction over thousands categories of products, from furniture \nto sporting equipment, appliances, clothing and toys.\n  Although almost all categories of consumer products are reviewed for \nsafety, there are millions of dangerous products in the United States \nthat go untested. These products, which are among the leading cause of \ndeath in the United States, are exempted from oversight by the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission. They are not subject to any quality and \nsafety standards, nor are their manufacturers required to provide \nwarnings to consumers about their hazards. These products are firearms, \nand despite the fact that they kill some 35,000 people each year, they \nare exempt from oversight by the federal agency that provides Americans \nwith lifesaving information.\n  The fact that guns are one of the only categories of products not \nsubject to regulation is another example of a loophole in our federal \nfirearms law. In the 1968 Gun Control Act, Congress set quality and \nsafety standards for imported guns, yet failed to impose such criteria \non domestically manufactured weapons. As a result, many of the guns \nmanufactured today lack even the most basic kind of safety devices.\n  Gun manufacturers have the ability to include basic safety mechanisms \nin their firearms that would substantially reduce firearm related \ndeaths. Yet most gun manufacturers have refused to implement even the \nmost basic technology in their products. It would surprise most \nAmericans to know that firearms manufactured in the United States are \nnot required to pass a ``drop test,'' a series of tests and \nmeasurements to ensure that guns will not accidentally fire if dropped. \nNor are they required to include simple features on firearms, such as \nload indicators which tell the user the gun is loaded. Many firearms \nalso lack a magazine disconnect safety, a small safety improvement that \ncosts approximately 50 cents, and could save the lives of hundreds of \nchildren who die from unintentional shootings. In addition, there are \nno requirements that firearms are manufactured with internal locking \ndevices or combination locks. These are simple solutions for safety, \nbut until guns are regulated as a consumer product, they are unlikely \nto be implemented by domestic manufacturers.\n  Manufacturers should also pursue technology to develop ``smart'' or \n``personalized'' guns. Although there is no such working weapon that \nuses this technology now, there are plans by some manufacturers to \nexplore the development of smart guns that recognize their owners \nthrough fingerprints, radio emissions or skin conductivity. The NRA and \nother gun manufacturers, such as Berretta U.S.A. Corp, are opposed to \nthe development of smart gun technology, because they believe it would \nlead to mandatory safety standards. Yet, personalization concepts that \nallow only the authorized user access to his firearm, are sure to \ndecrease the number of fatal unintentional injuries, homicides and \nsuicides.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission is capable of monitoring \nfirearms, just as they review baby cribs, hair dryers, basketballs, \neven toy guns, and the thousands of other products manufactured in the \nUnited States. But until Congress amends the Consumer Product Safety \nAct and revokes this special privilege given to firearms manufacturers, \nguns manufactured in the United States are unlikely to include even \nbasic safety mechanisms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8159-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8159-S8160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SUPPORTING S. 1010--THE MEDICAL INNOVATION TAX CREDIT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I would like to give my \nsupport to the Medical Innovation Tax Credit Act,\n\n[[Page S8160]]\n\nsponsored by my good friend, Senator Jeffords.\n  Our medical schools and teaching hospitals are the backbone for \ninnovation in American medicine. As sites for vital human clinical \ntrials, these medical institutions provide a superior training ground \nfor our nation's health care professionals, functioning as centers for \nthe development of innovative medical technologies, treatments and \nmedicines.\n  Yet, Mr. President, there has been an alarming decline in the \nutilization of these superior medical facilities for clinical trials. \nDue to changes within the health care marketplace, our medical \nfacilities have come under increasing cost pressures, driving up the \ncosts associated with conducting clinical trials at these facilities. \nCurrently, it is more expensive for companies to perform clinical \ntrials at teaching hospitals than at commercial research organizations.\n  Mr. President, the Medical Innovation Tax Credit Act is integral to \nthe continued success of our nation's status as a world leader in the \ndevelopment of medical advances. This legislation would enhance the \nflow of private-sector funds into our non-profit medical institutions \nby providing incentives for companies to perform more clinical trials \nat these institutions. The 20 percent medical innovation tax credit \nwould help level the current cost differential and the resulting influx \nof funds would ease some of the financial pressures our medical \ninstitutions are experiencing.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to send a strong message to our nation's \nmedical institutions and health care professionals, that we will \ncontinue working to find ways to enhance and strengthen our valuable \nresearch program. To this end, it is essential that the Senate support \nthe Medical Innovation Tax Credit Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8160-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PIONEER MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

It is an \noutstanding example of continued excellence in the delivery of health \ncare services to rural South Dakota.\n  In an era when the high cost of medical care has driven a wedge \nbetween the patient and the provider, small, rural hospitals like \nPioneer Memorial Hospital remind us of the true ethic of medical care; \ncompassion, commitment and dedication to those in need. There is no \nreward great enough for the hard work and long hours that the staff at \nPioneer Memorial Hospital have sacrificed on the behalf of others. They \nhave brought into the world the newborn babies of friends and neighbors \nand cared for those who have lived long and noble lives. Perhaps most \nimportantly, they should be recognized for the hand that they extended \nto those whom they did not know but reached out to in times of need.\n  Therefore, it is with great honor that I recognize Pioneer Memorial \nHospital for its dedication to service and excellence in providing \nquality medical care to Viborg and the surrounding area. I applaud the \nefforts of every individual involved with the hospital throughout the \nyears and offer my best wishes for another 40 years of service and \nexcellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8160-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PHIL PETRIK\n\n Mr. BURNS.

Apparently, the \npilot was above the clouds and could not find a hole to make it through \nto land.\n  The pilot stated that he would fly on to the Watford City airport and \nsee if he could land there. Later in the day, Petrik once again heard \nthe pilot calling the Eilliston airport, requesting information about \nlanding.\n  Unfortunately, the conditions had not changed. Phil then contacted \nthe Williston airport to inquire if there was someone there who could \nguide the pilot down. He was informed that there was not. Phil got into \nhis own plane and flew to approximately where the plane in distress \nshould be and he finally found him. The other pilot told Phil he had \nabout 30 minutes of fuel left. Phil had the FAA clear the airspace and \nthey started down through the clouds. The two planes were in the clouds \nfor about 90 seconds. Petrik guided the other plane to the airport and \nreturned home.\n  Upon his arrival in Sidney, Phil found out that the pilot had \nactually only one minute and 20 seconds of fuel left when he made it to \nthe ground. Phil has already been recognized by the Federal Aviation \nAssociation for his valiant act of selflessness. His peers in Montana \nhave all told me that this is an example of the type of man Mr. Petrik \nis. It is a great honor for me to share this story of valor and \ncompassion. One man willing to risk his life for another. Please join \nme in offering congratulations and thanks to Phil Petrik.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8160-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8160-S8162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE NATIONWIDE COMPANIES\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \nexceptional company based in Atlanta, Georgia. The Nationwide Companies \nproudly established its national headquarters in Atlanta just seven \nyears ago, and through the progressive leadership of its founder and \npresident, Bill Case, it has succeeded in the American marketplace.\n  As you well know, success earns recognition, and Money Maker's \nMonthly recently awarded this growing company the distinction of ``The \nCompany of the Month'' in the United States. The front-page feature, \nappropriately titled, ``The Nationwide Miracle,'' describes the \nprogress of Nationwide, and applauds Mr. Case for his leadership and \nintegrity. Perhaps the most telling description of Nationwide as a \nuniquely American business is the conclusion in the feature that Bill \nCase and his company are ``revolutionizing the way the American public \nearns and saves money.''\n  The Money Maker's Monthly feature is a tribute to a man's vision and \nthe ability to transfer dreams into reality. In order that others may \ncelebrate this wonderful award and perhaps be inspired by its \ndescription of Mr. Case's realization of the ``American dream,'' Mr. \nPresident, I ask you to join me in saluting the many successes of Bill \nCase and the Nationwide Companies, and ask that the Money Maker's \nMonthly article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n                [From Money Maker's Monthly, Mar. 1999]\n\n                         The Nationwide Miracle\n\n       Bill Case dreamed for many years of a business where people \n     could enjoy financial freedom. He already knew that network \n     marketing was the wave of the future, but concluded that the \n     industry had complications that disillusioned many able and \n     talented people. He wanted to find the simplest way that a \n     home-based entrepreneur could earn impressively through \n     network marketing without spending hard-earned money on \n     things like inventory and also avoid obstacles like \n     unproductive downlines. In other words, could you build a \n     business where financial freedom was obtainable through good, \n     honest work?\n       After carefully researching other network marketing \n     companies and interviewing a cross-section of successful \n     networking entrepreneurs throughout the country, Case found \n     the answer. The result became The Nationwide Companies, his \n     seven-year-old business that is viewed by many observers as a \n     miracle in the network marketplace.\n       ``Instead of selling marked-up merchandise, we sell a \n     benefits package which gives the owner the right to purchase \n     popular items like cars, boats, furniture and health \n     insurance with the same group buying power and low prices \n     enjoyed by Fortune 500 Companies.'' Case emphasizes that the \n     Nationwide Benefits Package is ``a hot item because of value \n     in savings.'' Case says his network marketing business, which \n     is headquartered in Atlanta, is revolutionizing the way the \n     American public earns and saves money. Skeptics are few and \n     far between as Case and his company gladly showcase a growing \n     number of success stories from California to Florida who are \n     earning six-figure incomes. Nationwide networkers, called \n     Independent Marketing Directors (IMDs), publicly and rather \n     proudly state that they are enjoying genuine financial \n     freedom as associates of Case's ``Team Nationwide.''\n       With evangelical drive, Case welcomes everyone to visit \n     under the umbrella of The Nationwide Companies. ``We are \n     truly one of a kind among network marketing companies,'' \n     observes Case. ``We have a quality product that stands on its \n     own in the marketplace because it allows purchasers to obtain \n     items of genuine values.'' He emphasizes that the Nationwide \n     Benefits Package can be\n\n[[Page S8161]]\n\n     purchased by anyone. It is a retail item in the truest sense \n     of the word. The Benefits Package allows the owner, according \n     to Case, to buy or lease cars, trucks, RVs, boats, along \n     with furniture, eye care, health insurance, and even \n     exotic vacations. ``Our Benefits Package saves consumers \n     substantial amounts of good, hard dollars. The benefits \n     are from recognizable Fortune 500 companies like ``the big \n     three'' automakers, General Electric, United Parcel \n     Service, Hertz and LensCrafters, just to name a few,'' \n     says Case, adding that the Package is ``one of the best \n     bargains in the country!''\n\n\n                            without burdens\n\n       Like other network marketing businesses, Nationwide \n     operates through its IMDs from Hawaii to New York. From the \n     company's Atlanta headquarters, Case's fast-growing \n     enterprise provides marketing and sales information, computer \n     support and state-of-the-art, easily accessible training for \n     its IMDs. When asked what makes Nationwide different from \n     other network marketers, Case, breaking into a wide grin, \n     responds, ``Our IMDs don't have to buy or keep any inventory. \n     There's no quota of any kind, no penalties, no competition \n     and no levels of unpaid production.'' Case adds that \n     Nationwide's system ``pays to infinity.'' ``You get paid what \n     you are worth with Nationwide, and you only have to make two \n     sales each year. We believe that our IMDs should earn good \n     money without unnecessary difficulty,'' he says.\n       Case describes Nationwide's management as ``hands-on.'' \n     ``We have a totally supportive attitude regarding our people. \n     They expect value and great service, and that's what we \n     deliver. It's critical that our IMDs are able to explain the \n     Nationwide miracle and the wonderful savings and earnings \n     opportunities which they can do if we give them the effective \n     tools.'' Support from Case means closeness and intimacy. From \n     company headquarters, every significant development regarding \n     all aspects of Nationwide's operation are updated daily. The \n     information is as available as a telephone call, fax machine \n     or computer will permit. More importantly, Case still \n     believes in the value of the human voice. ``Support training \n     and customer service is at the top of the list. People want \n     to hear answers from a warm human voice when they have a \n     question. It's my job to see that they get this.''\n\n\n                          the nationwide team\n\n       Case sees Nationwide's remarkable success much like an \n     accomplished football coach who is closing in on his lifetime \n     goal of winning the Superbowl. He built his winning team \n     around Jack Hendryx, Nationwide's vice president. ``I \n     recruited Jack because he is one of the country's networking \n     geniuses,'' says Case. Hendryx personable, well dressed and \n     self-confident, reflects Case's trust, ``I came on board \n     because Nationwide eliminated all of the shenanigans that \n     plague the direct marketing business. Hendryx says he and \n     Case implemented a training program that helps the home-based \n     entrepreneur succeed. ``This country needs an honest company \n     where the chance to earn substantial money is real, and \n     Nationwide is that company!''\n       Hendryx, with unconditional backing from Case, formulated a \n     new millennium training program for IMDs which combines \n     proven sales assistance with intensive and continuing \n     marketing education. He supervises customized and very \n     effective grass-roots seminars throughout the country and is \n     an almost constant presence at regular regional meetings. \n     Importantly, Hendryx has stayed abreast of 21st century \n     training strategies, and the result is high morale and \n     enthusiasm among the rank and file IMD's. ``We want our men \n     and women to earn money now, not later. Our training program \n     is designed to get them into substantial income production \n     immediately.''\n       Interviews with a sampling of Nationwide's IMDs confirmed \n     positive results from the training program. Many IMDs have \n     worked for five or even more network marketing companies \n     prior to Nationwide only to see them go out of business for \n     myriad reasons, mostly bad ones. They blamed the failures on \n     poor products and Neanderthal to non-existent training. \n     ``Visit any of our workshops,'' says Hendryx, ``and you'll \n     know that we are as different from the failed companies as \n     day is from night. Nationwide works because it's designed and \n     managed by people like Lynda Davis.'' Davis, according to \n     Hendryx, is the National Sales Training Coordinator for \n     Nationwide who has created the lion's share of the \n     effective marketing tools used in the company's training \n     program. ``Lynda is a crown jewel,'' says Hendryx. ``Her \n     training expertise gives our IMDs the head start they need \n     in earning good, solid money as quickly as possible.''\n       One of the key players on Nationwide's team is Dick Loehr, \n     president of Loehr's Auto Consultants in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. \n     who operates the benefits company for Nationwide. Loehr, who \n     once owned nine automobile franchises, ranging from Porsche \n     to Chrysler, has vast experience in the national automobile \n     marketplace. A protege of Lee Iococca (Loehr was an advisor \n     to Iococca at Chrysler and still wears the lapel pin award \n     given for his service to Iococca and Chrysler), Loehr is a \n     virtual encyclopedia of knowledge of the automobile industry, \n     including the complicated areas of financing and leasing. \n     Nationwide recently produced a video interview with Loehr, \n     which is a reservoir of vital information that any consumer \n     would need to know before buying or leasing an automobile.\n       Loehr's joining Nationwide meant coming out of retirement. \n     ``When I heard about Nationwide, I did my own investigation \n     and knew this company was a winner,'' says Loehr. With \n     Loehr's auto industry skills, Nationwide continues to be able \n     to make popular items like automobiles available to its \n     associates through the same group buying power enjoyed by \n     Fortune 500 companies. Also, Loehr's heralded experience in \n     the car market is invaluable to Nationwide.``I understand \n     pricing of automobiles and trucks, and financing and leasing \n     is almost secondhand to me,'' says Loehr, who is not \n     bragging, but stating fact.\n       One of the most recent benefits available to Nationwide \n     associates is the availability of Program cars, which became \n     possible through Loehr's esoteric knowledge of the automobile \n     industry. Loehr says this makes the Benefits Package even \n     more valuable. ``A Program car is a recent model, low mileage \n     auto in top shape from a fleet program which we obtain for \n     sale or lease. These are incredible bargains available to \n     anyone owning the Nationwide Benefits Package.''\n\n\n                       tribute from the trenches\n\n       Case describes his national network of IMD's as ``my field \n     generals.'' ``I'm proud of the quality and high character of \n     every one,'' he says. Robert and Donna Fason of Mount Vernon, \n     Ark. are Nationwide's National Sales Directors who earned \n     their lofty title through impressive success. ``Every day is \n     a vacation to us,'' says Robert, adding, ``We are making more \n     money than ever and our IMD's are truly excited about even \n     greater earnings as we work together for financial freedom.''\n       Two key Team Nationwide Associates, says Case are Ruby and \n     Ray Riedel of Yakima, Wash. Both are successful veteran \n     network marketers who left one of the big names in the \n     industry for Nationwide. Their story is a fascinating, \n     personal endorsement of Case's network business dream. \n     ``Unlike our previous company, we now have absolutely no \n     inventory, monthly quotas or penalties,'' stated Ruby Riedel. \n     ``How refreshing to be part of a genuine network company and \n     to be free of all overhead, competition and no levels of \n     unpaid production!'' In place of these obstacles, Ruby says \n     that IMD's now have ``value with rewards.'' ``We and all \n     others are paid what we're worth without limitations, under \n     an amazing income system that pays to infinity.'' She hastens \n     to add that Nationwide's regular trading program deserves \n     accolades. ``The intensive and effective support given to \n     every IMD by people like Jack Hendryx and Lynda Davis keeps \n     all of us going upward with our earnings. This training may \n     be the very best in the network marketing industry.''\n\n\n                     noted author lauds nationwide\n\n       Perhaps no higher praise for Nationwide has been given than \n     the observation of internationally respected and widely read \n     author Alfred Huang. A Maui, Hawaii resident and Nationwide \n     IMD, Huang says he became an associate of Case's team not \n     solely because of its proven earnings and savings, but \n     particularly because the system ``helps people to live a \n     better life.'' ``The true spirit and value of Nationwide is \n     caring of people.'' Huang is a best-selling author whose next \n     book, ``The Century of the Dragan--Creating Your Success and \n     Prosperity In The Next Century,'' is due for publication \n     later this year. He is convinced that network marketing will \n     soon be the mainstream solution for financial wellness.\n       ``Nationwide,'' Huang says, ``is the best network marketing \n     [company] I have ever known.'' A native of China, who was \n     imprisoned for 13 years after being wrongly convicted and \n     sentenced as an American spy (his conviction was overturned), \n     plans to write a book about Nationwide. ``I want to tell \n     people how to change their attitude and build their self-\n     confidence by sharing the beauty of Nationwide, its \n     philosophy, its system, its opportunity and its loving and \n     caring of people.''\n\n\n                          income testimonials\n\n       Nationwide, according to Case, is a 100 percent debt-free \n     company that parallels the American Dream of entrepreneurial \n     success. ``Just look at Jack Hendryx,'' says Case. ``No man \n     in America could, I believe, exceed his professional \n     marketing ability and wonderful reputation for honesty.'' As \n     a matter of fact, one of Hendryx's presentations, which he \n     gives live in regional meetings, and is recorded on one of \n     Nationwide's video programs, concludes with Hendryx's advice \n     to everyone, ``The Benefits Package will sell itself. All you \n     have to do is tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing \n     but the truth. The rest is easy.''\n       Case's expectations for 1999 and into the next millennium \n     are high. ``We turned the corner sometime back and this year \n     and the next will see us explode with new sales. My \n     projection is to have tens of thousands more IMD's on board, \n     spread evenly throughout the geographical areas of America \n     with resulting growth in sales of the Benefits Package.'' \n     Case revealed that new benefits are schedule to be added to \n     the package soon, and as they are added, they will be placed \n     retroactively into Benefits Packages already owned. \n     ``Remember, we are family and we share,'' says Case, with his \n     engaging smile and twinkling eyes.\n       Every great American business pioneer has said, in one way \n     or another, that a company is measured by the accomplishments \n     of its people. Perhaps no better measure of\n\n[[Page S8162]]\n\n     Nationwide's enviable position in America's network \n     marketplace can be found than in the successes of its IMDs. \n     Many companies, for whatever reason, are reluctant to \n     disclose individuals with verifiable earnings, but not \n     Nationwide. ``We want people who are looking for the best \n     earnings opportunity in America today to contact our folks \n     and ask them questions,'' Case says. ``They are going to hear \n     revelations from our people whose lives have been transformed \n     because of the Nationwide miracle. And, I might add, I am \n     talking about genuinely impressive earnings.''\n       Joyce Ross, along with her husband Marvin, is a Nationwide \n     Regional Director in Malden, Mo. She revealed an upward \n     transformation in income during her first year with \n     Nationwide. ``For 26 years, we owned a combination barber and \n     beauty shop in a lovely small town, but worked ourselves \n     nearly to death with an accumulation of bills and not enough \n     money for the work we were doing. Then came Nationwide,'' \n     says Joyce. ``It would have taken me ten years to earn as a \n     hairdresser what I have earned with Nationwide in less than \n     two years.''\n       Similarly, Don Garrison of Lampe, Mo. discloses that he \n     earned over $300,000 in the first year. ``This is the only \n     way I want to live and work, as a free American citizen!'' \n     David Hervey mirrors Garrison's success by revealing that he, \n     too, earned beyond $300,000 during the past year as an \n     associate of Team Nationwide. Hervey, it should be added, is \n     a Nationwide Regional Director in Jackson, Miss. Lamar Adams, \n     a Regional Director in Madison, Miss., earned over $100,000, \n     he says ``. . . in just my first six months as a Nationwide \n     IMD!''\n       Jack Hendryx, speaking from Nationwide's Atlanta \n     headquarters, confirms that there are ``large numbers of \n     similar testimonials that we are delighted to share with \n     anyone, anytime, who has a genuine interest in bettering \n     their lives and the lives of their families.'' Hendryx has an \n     abundance of examples. ``All of our Regional Directors have \n     their own earnings success stories. Jack and Becky Hearrell, \n     Fred and Betty Swindel, and Shelby Langston deserve special \n     recognition, as does Bob and Judi Montgomery. The team is \n     built upon Regional Directors' shoulders.\n\n\n                       the team nationwide family\n\n       Case is inseparable from his wife, Carol. It is more than \n     symbolic that he includes Carol in as many Nationwide \n     activities as her time and schedule will permit. ``Carol was \n     instrumental in providing me with some of the central ideas \n     that made Nationwide possible,'' Case says. ``She, in an \n     admirable way, has marketing and public relations talents \n     that go well beyond what you might expect to find on Madison \n     Avenue or even here on Peachtree Street in Atlanta. Plus, we \n     believe in husbands and wives, along with their families, \n     being the core of Team Nationwide.''\n       The IMD Honor Roll of Nationwide bears out Case's \n     ``family'' vision. The Regional Directors are almost \n     invariably in husband and wife pairs. IMD's everywhere, \n     pictured on his large conference room walls, are there with \n     their respective husbands and wives and occasionally, other \n     family members. Dick Loehr and his wife, Mary Lou are \n     mainstays in the Nationwide miracle; likewise, Jack and Heide \n     Hendryx. ``What a wonderful country this will continue to be \n     if we have more businesses like Nationwide,'' says Case, \n     ``where the preservation and betterment of the family unit is \n     not only encouraged, but made possible through the miracle of \n     financial freedom!''\n       Nationwide's story is the embodiment of the American dream. \n     Case believes that Nationwide is just beginning its \n     revolution in the network marketplace. During 1999 and well \n     beyond, he is committed to making Nationwide the national \n     exemplar of true financial freedom. He and his key team \n     players like Hendryx, Loehr and Davis are driven toward their \n     goal of financial freedom for everyone who is willing to work \n     for it. Every bit of evidence, out in the national field and \n     within their own business data in Atlanta indicates that they \n     must be taken seriously.\n       Nationwide is on solid ground in the precarious minefield \n     we call the marketplace. Leadership, from Bill Case on down \n     through the chain of command, is top-notch. The determination \n     to grow and expand, based upon time-honored business methods, \n     is evidenced dramatically by its affiliation with Superior \n     Bank. The respected financial institution provides consumer \n     loans and mortgages as one of Nationwide's benefits. Standing \n     on its own, this banking relationship is a network industry \n     original that merits applause.\n       Case lives his dream everyday, only now it's real for \n     others as well. His IMDs are earning handsomely through the \n     Nationwide miracle because Case has blended the magic \n     business ingredients of planning, managing, and training with \n     honesty and integrity, and combined it with a valuable, \n     unprecedented Benefits Package.\n       Case and his team are telling America that a dream becomes \n     a reality through hard work. The road to financial freedom \n     took some effort to locate, but they found it and have it \n     available today. It's a very rewarding journey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8162-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8162-S8163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NOEL WIEN--ALASKA AVIATION PIONEER\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on July 6, 1924, the first non-\nstop flight between Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska occurred. The \nflight was made in an old water-cooled Hissopowered Standard J-1 open-\ncock-pit biplane and was flown by Noel Wien and Bill Yunker.\n  The Wein name is synonymous with Alaska aviation. It is said that \nNoel Wien's flight between Anchorage and Fairbanks was the start of \nWein Air Alaska. I will quote for the Record an account of the early \ndays as told by Noel Wein.\n\n       The change has been great both in aviation and the city of \n     Fairbanks since that memorable day, July 6, 1924, when, \n     sitting behind an old water-cooled Hisso powered Standard J-1 \n     open-cockpit biplane, Bill Yunker and I landed here after \n     flying non-stop from Anchorage.\n       We had flown up at night, thus taking advantage of the \n     smoother air. The smoke was very thick for the last 80 miles \n     and kept us guessing all the time. It was even difficult to \n     follow the railroad tracks from Nenana on in.\n       There was intrigue about the stillness of the air and the \n     frontier atmosphere of Fairbanks, which made me like the \n     north from that first day.\n       For two weeks we couldn't find our way cross-country due to \n     the forest fire smoke, but when it cleared up we were busy. \n     People her took to the air quickly. They were of the hardy \n     type, willing to take a gamble. Ben Eielson had made a number \n     of flights that spring, before I arrived. He had also started \n     a company the year before, in the summer of 1923, and had \n     brought in an old reliable OX-5 Curtis Jenny JN-4D open \n     cockpit World War I training plane.\n       Due to the interest created by Eielson's earlier \n     pioneering, we had little trouble getting flying business to \n     the outlying mining camps. Livengood, located 60 miles \n     northwest of here, was one of the best of the gold producing \n     camps. The first season in 1924, we made 34 flights to \n     Livengood, and in the summer of 1925, 43 flights.\n       All went smoothly until mid-summer of 1925. We had \n     purchased a supposedly major overhauled plane from Lincoln, \n     Nebraska, one of the Hisso Standard build-up headquarters. \n     The engine worked fine on the flight over to Livengood, but \n     on the return trip something happened. All of a sudden the \n     water from the cooling system of the engine gave us a shower \n     bath. I knew that because of the loss of water the engine \n     would get so hot it would stop running. We were about half-\n     way back to Fairbanks, near Wickersham Dome. I spotted a \n     shelf to one side of the dome which seemed like the only \n     possible chance to get down without breaking up or going \n     over on our back. We were cruising lower than the 2,500 \n     foot shelf, so we had to use power to get up to it. The \n     old engine was steaming plenty when we got to a landing \n     approach. It turned out to be a fair landing place and we \n     stayed right side up and landed without breaking anything. \n     It turned out that the water pump had broken in flight, \n     which in turn had thrown the water out.\n       The two passengers and myself walked in to Olnes, on the \n     Chatanika River, over the tussuk covered trail. One \n     passenger, an old Sourdough, had no trouble walking out. The \n     other passenger, an insurance adjuster, had flown over on \n     both business and pleasure. This passenger, I would say, was \n     my first tourist, and possibly the first flying tourist \n     passenger in Alaska. He had on oxford shoes and was about to \n     give up before we arrived at the Chatanika River.\n       It is not my intent in these articles to be writing of my \n     experiences, but instead to give some idea of the progress \n     made in aviation and the change of times in the north.\n       Having had to discontinue flying in the fall of 1924 \n     because of the open cockpit of the old Hisso Standard, a \n     decision was made to try to get a cabin plane with an air \n     cooled motor for use in wintertime. Because I was going \n     ``outside'' for the winter to visit my folks in Minnesota, it \n     worked out well for me to make a tour of the states to see \n     what was being built. I found that about all that was being \n     built was a very small number of open cockpit planes with old \n     XO-5 and Hisso motors. One exception was the Huff Deland \n     company which was building planes with an open front seat for \n     two passengers and a pilot seat in the rear. This plane had \n     an early model Wright air cooled engine of about 200 \n     horsepower, but we had decided not to settle for anything but \n     a cabin plane.\n       Both the Wright company and the Curtiss company did their \n     best to locate the type of plane we wanted, but their efforts \n     were unsuccessful. We finally had to settle on a Dutch built \n     Fokker F-111 or F-3, a six-place monoplane which K.L.M. and \n     early German airlines had already been using on some kind of \n     schedule service in Europe. This plane had been built in 1921 \n     and it was already the spring of 1925. There still were no \n     cabin planes being built in the United States.\n       The Atlantic Aircraft Company, a dealer for Fokker, had \n     three ships available. We bought one of them that had been \n     used some, for $9,500. We shipped it all the way to Fairbanks \n     via the Panama Canal. It had a German 6 cylinder engine of \n     235 horsepower. The cabin was very plush with curtains and \n     all the trimmings. This ship proved conclusively that a cabin \n     airplane was the type to use in Alaska even though we could \n     not use it through the winter of 1925-26 because it had no \n     brakes except for a tail skid which helped to stop it. It \n     had a rather streamlined monoplane wing and took a minimum \n     of 1,000 feet\n\n[[Page S8163]]\n\n     to stop after the three points were firmly on the ground. \n     We had some close shaves on sand bars and fields 1,000 or \n     under, during the summers of 1925-26. Our flying out of \n     Fairbanks was the only cross-country flying in the \n     Territory at that time. There was one other airline at \n     Ketchikan where Roy Jones was doing some flying with an \n     old two-place navy training flying boat. We were \n     successful with the flying of the Fokker F-111 and made \n     the first commercial flight to Nome, carrying 4 passengers \n     and 500 pounds of baggage, a 1,200 pound load. We flew \n     non-stop back here in 6 hours and 55 minutes. That's all \n     for now. Noel.--Originally published in the ``Wien Alaska \n     Arctic Liner'' August 1956.\n\n  On July 6, 1999, the 75th anniversary of the first non-stop flight, \nthe sons of Noel Wien, Richard and Merrill, will pay homage to their \nlate father's legacy. In commemoration, they will retrace the journey \nin a refurbished Boeing Stearman biplane, which was built in 1943. This \ntype of plane was used to train pilots in World War II. They will leave \nfrom the Delaney Park Strip in Anchorage, which is now a public park, \nand land at Fairbanks International Airport. The original landing site \nin Fairbanks, Weeks Field, has since been developed and houses the Noel \nWien Public Library.\n  After all his years of flying, Richard gained a whole new respect for \nhis father's flying ability when he and his son, Michael, flew the \nrefurbished biplane from Seattle. They made the trip in early May and \nencountered winter conditions during the flight. It did not take long \nto realize that they weren't within the confines of a closed, heated \ncabin.\n  Both Richard and Merrill continued in their father's footsteps. They \nare both commercially rated pilots with thousands of flying hours \nbetween them. They were both involved with Wien Air Alaska and then \nwhen the family sold it, the brothers opened up a helicopter business. \nAlthough Richard and Merrill are no longer involved in the commercial \nside of aviation, it's in the blood.\n  Organizing this event was a labor of love for Richard Wien. He also \ncredits his major sponsor the Alaska Airmen's Association for helping \nto make it happen in addition to other individuals and organizations. \nHe is embarking on this trip to honor his father and also the 75th \nanniversary of the first airmail run made by Ben Eielson.\n  My heartiest congratulations to Richard and Merrill Wien for \norganizing this wonderful tribute to their father and also for keeping \nthe pioneering aviation spirit alive through this commemorative \nflight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8163-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HAPPY BIRTHDAY CAPTAIN CURTIS J. ZANE\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on the occasion of his 80th \nbirthday this coming 4th of July, I would like to join my Alaskan \ncolleague in the other body in extending warm birthday wishes to \nCaptain Curtis J. Zane, United States Navy Retired. ``Casey'' Zane, as \nhe is affectionately known, is one of that generation of American \nheroes who rose to defend our nation and our freedom during the darkest \ndays of WWII. He saw action over a wide area of the South Pacific \nduring 1942, 1943 and 1944 including service with the fabled ``Black \nCat'' PBY squadron 101. To this day he remembers dear friends who died \nin that conflict. In mid 1944 through the war's end Casey instructed \nyoung pilots in B-24s at Hutchinson Kansas.\n  The balance of his 27 year career in Naval Aviation spanned the early \nyears of the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the transition to \nthe Nuclear Navy. During that time Casey Zane served in the Guam, \nTinian and Saipan areas of the post war Pacific. Later he was aboard \nships of the fleet including the carrier USS Leyte and then took \nCommand of anti-submarine warfare squadron VP 18. He served at the \nCommand Post CinCLantFleet and as Commanding Officer U.S. Naval \nCommunications Stations, Londonderry Northern Ireland and Thurso \nScotland. He did his last tour at the Pentagon in Navy's Bureau of \nPersonnel and retired as a Captain in November 1968.\n  Among the several types of special schooling and training he \nreceived, Casey is a graduate of the Army's Command & General Staff \nCollege and the Naval War College. He holds the American Defense \nService Medal; American Campaign Medal; Air Medal; Asiatic-Pacific \nCampaign Medal (3 Stars); World War II Victory Medal; National Defense \nService Medal (1 Star).\n  After the Navy, Casey and his wife Dorothy started their second \ncareers becoming successful real estate brokers and agents in the \nNorthern Virginia area. Despite his tender age of 80, Casey continues \nto be an active and productive member of our society. He is a model for \nthose who believe in being ``forever young,'' both in spirit and \nenthusiasm for living. I wish to extend a hearty ``many happy returns'' \nto a great American Veteran, Captain Curtis J. ``Casey'' Zane on his \nupcoming 80th birthday, July 4, 1999. Mr. President, as this Century \ncloses it is indeed fitting that the advent of a National World War II \nMemorial is close at hand. As our numbers fade slowly and inexorably \nfrom our midst, perhaps the best birthday present we can give WWII \nVeterans like Casey Zane is the knowledge that our nation will never \nforget their sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8163-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE MARRIAGE OF LISA MAXWELL AND GEORGE NEWALL\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN.

A wonderful institution, to be treated reverently.\n  My hope for Lisa and George is that their love for each other--so \nobvious to anyone who knows them--is, and will always remain, a seal \nupon their hearts,\n\n     For stern as death is love,\n     relentless as the nether world is devotion;\n     its flames are a blazing fire.\n     Deep waters cannot quench love,\n     nor floods sweep it away.\n     Were one to offer all he owns to purchase love,\n     he would be roundly mocked.--Song of Solomon, 8:6-7\n\n  I wish them all the best as they begin their life together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8163-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8163-S8164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN RECOGNITION OF DR. EUGENE OLIVERI\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \nphysician from my home state of Michigan, Dr. Eugene Oliveri, who will \nbe named the new President of the American Osteopathic Association \n(AOA) at the Association's annual meeting in July.\n  Dr. Oliveri practices at two outstanding medical facilities in \nMetropolitan Detroit. He is a senior member of the Department of \nInternal Medicine at Botsford Hospital in Farmington Hills, Michigan, \nwhere he also serves as Chairman of the Department of Gastroenterology \nand as Director of the Gastroenterology Fellowship Program. Dr. Oliveri \nis also affiliated with Huron Valley Hospital in Milford, Michigan.\n  Dr. Oliveri has established himself as a national leader in the \nosteopathic profession. He serves on a number of professional boards, \nis sought after as a visiting lecturer, and is committed to training \nand inspiring the next generation of osteopathic physicians. In fact, \nthere are two osteopaths in the Oliveri family, and I know it is a \npoint of pride for Dr. Eugene Oliveri that his daughter, Lisa, chose to \npursue the profession to which he has dedicated so much of his life.\n  The state of Michigan is a leader in the practice of osteopathy. One \nhundred and two years ago, Michigan was the fourth state in the nation \nto legalize the practice of osteopathy. Today's osteopathic physicians \nand surgeons integrate standard medical practices with the body's \nnatural systems for regulating and healing itself, especially with the \nlargest of these systems, the musculoskeletal system. Dr. Oliveri \nfollows in the tradition of the thousands of skilled and dedicated \nosteopathic doctors who have practiced medicine in Michigan for more \nthan a century.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Eugene Oliveri has distinguished himself as a \nphysician, as a teacher and as a leader of his profession. It is \nfitting that Dr. Oliveri, who\n\n[[Page S8164]]\n\npractices medicine in a state which has such a longstanding commitment \nto osteopathic medicine, will be elected President of the American \nOsteopathic Association. I know my colleagues join me in congratulating \nDr. Oliveri on his achievements and in wishing him well during his \ntenure as President of the AOA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8164-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO HIS HOLINESS KAREKIN I, CATHOLICOS OF ALL ARMENIANS\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to an \nextraordinary man and religious leader, His Holiness Karekin I, \nCatholicos of All Armenians, who passed away on June 29.\n  I was proud to call His Holiness my friend. He was an inspiration to \nall who knew him. He was loved and respected by the Armenian people the \nworld over, and his courage, intelligence, wisdom, and compassion were \nrenowned in international religious circles.\n  His Holiness dedicated his life to the Armenian people. He worked \nskillfully for Armenia's freedom, and had the noble distinction of \nbeing the first Catholicos of the Armenian people elected in the newly \nindependent Republic of Armenia. In this era, he has worked tirelessly \nand effectively for the spiritual revival of the Armenian Apostolic \nChurch in Armenia.\n  He was also a warm and humble man, gifted with wit and humor, who \nrelated easily with people from all backgrounds and from all walks of \nlife.\n  His extraordinary life began in the village of Kessab in Syria in \n1932. He studied at a seminary in Lebanon in the late 1940s, and \nentered the celibate order of the Church in 1952. A gifted student, he \nwent on to study theology at Oxford University. Recognized for his \nleadership qualities, he quickly rose through the clerical ranks, \nleading church dioceses in Iran and the United States. In 1977 he was \nelected Catholicos of the Catholicosate of Cilicia, based in Antelias, \nLebanon. In 1995, he was elected Supreme Catholicos of the Armenian \npeople, based in Holy Etchmiadzin, Armenia.\n  From July 6 to July 8, Armenia will be holding a period of national \nmourning in honor of this great man of faith. The Armenian people \nthroughout the world are mourning his death and paying tribute to his \nextraordinary life. His remarkable legacy will endure for generations \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url":

(a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) The United States is the world leader in the \n     development of environmental technologies, particularly clean \n     coal technology.\n       (2) Severe pollution problems affecting people in \n     developing countries, and the serious health problems that \n     result from such pollution, can be effectively addressed \n     through the application of United States technology.\n       (3) During the next century, developing countries, \n     particularly countries in Asia such as China and India, will \n     dramatically increase their consumption of electricity, and \n     low quality coal will be a major source of fuel for power \n     generation.\n       (4) Without the use of modern clean coal technology, the \n     resultant pollution will cause enormous health and \n     environmental problems leading to diminished economic growth \n     in developing countries and, thus, diminished United States \n     exports to those growing markets.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United \n     States to promote the export of United States clean coal \n     technology. In furtherance of that policy, the Secretary of \n     State, the Secretary of the Treasury (acting through the \n     United States executive directors to international financial \n     institutions), the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator \n     of the United States Agency for International Development \n     (USAID) should, as appropriate, vigorously promote the use of \n     United States clean coal technology in environmental and \n     energy infrastructure programs, projects and activities. \n     Programs, projects and activities for which the use of such \n     technology should be considered include reconstruction \n     assistance for the Balkans, activities carried out by the \n     Global Environmental Facility, and activities funded from \n     USAID's Development Credit Authority.\n\n\n sense of congress on management of united states interests in ukraine\n\n       Sec. 580. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Ukraine is a major European nation as it has the second \n     largest territory and sixth largest population of all the \n     States of Europe.\n       (2) Ukraine has important geopolitical and economic roles \n     to play within Central and Eastern Europe.\n       (3) A strong, stable, and secure Ukraine serves the \n     interests of peace and stability in all of Europe, which are \n     important national security interests of the United States.\n       (4) Ukraine is a member State of the Council of Europe, the \n     Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the \n     Central European Initiative, and the Euro-Atlantic \n     Partnership Conference, is a participant in the Partnership \n     for Peace program of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, \n     and has entered into a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement \n     with the European Union.\n       (5) The Government of Ukraine has clearly articulated its \n     country's aspirations to become fully integrated into \n     European and transatlantic institutions, and, in pursuit of \n     the attainment of that aspiration, the government of Ukraine \n     has requested associate membership in the European Union with \n     the intent of eventually becoming a full member of the \n     European Union.\n       (6) It is the policy of the United States to support the \n     aspiration of Ukraine to assume its rightful place among the \n     European and transatlantic community of democratic States and \n     in European and transatlantic institutions.\n       (7) In the United States Government, the responsibility for \n     management of United States interests in Ukraine would be \n     most effectively performed by the officials who perform the \n     responsibility for management of United States interests in \n     Europe, and a designation of those officials to do so would \n     strongly underscore and most effectively support attainment \n     of the United States objective to build a Europe whole and \n     free.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Secretary of State should designate the Assistant \n     Secretary of State for European Affairs to perform, through \n     the Bureau of European Affairs of the Department of State, \n     the responsibilities of the Department of State for the \n     management of United States interests in Ukraine.\n\n\n    congressional notification with respect to acquisition of usaid \n                               facilities\n\n       Sec. 581.

(a) The President, the Secretary of State, the \n     Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (acting through United States executive directors to \n     international financial institutions) should immediately \n     intensify their efforts to prevail upon the Indonesian \n     Government and military to--\n       (1) disarm and disband anti-independence militias in East \n     Timor;\n       (2) grant full access to East Timor by international human \n     rights monitors, humanitarian organizations, and the press;\n       (3) allow Timorese who have been living in exile to return \n     to East Timor to campaign for and participate in the ballot; \n     and\n       (4) release all political prisoners.\n       (b) The President shall submit a report to Congress not \n     later than 15 days after passage of this Act, containing a \n     description of the Administration's efforts and his \n     assessment of efforts made by the Indonesian Government and \n     military to fulfill the steps described in paragraph (a).\n       (c) The Secretary of the Treasury shall direct the United \n     States executive directors to international financial \n     institutions to take into account the extent of efforts made \n     by the Indonesian Government and military to fulfill the \n     steps described in paragraph (a), in determining their vote \n     on any loan or financial assistance to Indonesia.\n\n\n          sense of the senate on the citizens democracy corps\n\n       Sec. 585. It is the sense of the Senate that with regard to \n     promoting economic development and open, democratic countries \n     in the former Soviet Union and Central Eastern Europe, the \n     Committee commends the work of the Citizens Democracy Corps \n     (CDC), which utilizes senior-level United States business \n     volunteers to assist enterprises, institutions, and local \n     governments abroad. Their work demonstrates the significant \n     impact that United States Agency for International \n     Development (USAID) support of a United States \n     nongovernmental organization (NGO) program can have on the \n     key United States foreign policy priorities of promoting \n     broad-based, stable economic growth and open, market-oriented \n     economies in transitioning economies. By drawing upon the \n     skills and voluntary spirit of United States businessmen and \n     women to introduce companies, CDC furthers the goals of the \n     Freedom of Support Act (NIS) and Support for Eastern European \n     Democracy (SEED), forging positive, lasting connections \n     between the United States and these countries. The Committee \n     endorses CDC's very cost-effective programs and believes they \n     should be supported and expanded not only in the former \n     Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, but in transitioning and \n     developing economies throughout the world.\n\n\n    assistance to promote democracy and civil society in yugoslavia\n\n       Sec. 586.

(a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1) Since the development of antibiotics in the 1950's, \n     tuberculosis has been largely controlled in the United States \n     and the Western World.\n       (2) Due to societal factors, including growing urban decay, \n     inadequate health care systems, persistent poverty, \n     overcrowding, and malnutrition, as well as medical factors, \n     including the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the emergence of multi-\n     drug resistant strains of tuberculosis, tuberculosis has \n     again become a leading and growing cause of adult deaths in \n     the developing world.\n       (3) According to the World Health Organization--\n       (A) in 1998, about 1,860,000 people worldwide died of \n     tuberculosis-related illnesses;\n       (B) one-third of the world's total population is infected \n     with tuberculosis; and\n       (C) tuberculosis is the world's leading killer of women \n     between 15 and 44 years old and\n\n[[Page S8181]]\n\n     is a leading cause of children becoming orphans.\n       (4) Because of the ease of transmission of tuberculosis, \n     its international persistence and growth pose a direct public \n     health threat to those nations that had previously largely \n     controlled the disease. This is complicated in the United \n     States by the growth of the homeless population, the rate of \n     incarceration, international travel, immigration, and HIV/\n     AIDS.\n       (5) With nearly 40 percent of the tuberculosis cases in the \n     United States attributable to foreign-born persons, \n     tuberculosis will never be eliminated in the United States \n     until it is controlled abroad.\n       (6) The means exist to control tuberculosis through \n     screening, diagnosis, treatment, patient compliance, \n     monitoring, and ongoing review of outcomes.\n       (7) Efforts to control tuberculosis are complicated by \n     several barriers, including--\n       (A) the labor intensive and lengthy process involved in \n     screening, detecting, and treating the disease;\n       (B) a lack of funding, trained personnel, and medicine in \n     virtually every nation with a high rate of the disease; and\n       (C) the unique circumstances in each country, which \n     requires the development and implementation of country-\n     specific programs.\n       (8) Eliminating the barriers to the international control \n     of tuberculosis through a well-structured, comprehensive, and \n     coordinated worldwide effort would be a significant step in \n     dealing with the increasing public health problem posed by \n     the disease.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that if the total allocation for this Act is higher than the \n     level passed by the Senate, a top priority for the additional \n     funds should be to increase the funding to combat infectious \n     diseases, especially tuberculosis.\n\n\n           to promote an international arms transfers regime\n\n       Sec. 589. (a) Efforts.--The President shall continue and \n     expand efforts through the United Nations and other \n     international fora, including the Wassenaar Arrangement, to \n     limit arms transfers worldwide. The President shall take the \n     necessary steps to begin multilateral negotiations within 180 \n     days after the date of the enactment of this Act, for the \n     purpose of establishing a permanent multilateral regime to \n     govern the transfer of conventional arms, particularly \n     transfers to countries--\n       (1) that engage in persistent violations of human rights, \n     engage in acts of armed aggression in violation of \n     international law, and do not fully participate in the United \n     Nations Register of Conventional Arms; and\n       (2) in regions in which arms transfers would exacerbate \n     regional arms races or international tensions that present a \n     danger to international peace and stability.\n       (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than 6 months after the \n     commencement of the negotiations under subsection (a), and \n     not later than the end of every 6-month period thereafter \n     until an agreement described in subsection (a) is concluded, \n     the President shall report to the appropriate committees of \n     the Congress on the progress made during these negotiations.\n\n\n                  expanded threat reduction initiative\n\n       Sec. 590. It is the sense of the Senate that the programs \n     contained in the Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative are \n     vital to the national security of the United States and that \n     funding for those programs should be restored in conference \n     to the levels requested in the President's budget.\n\n\n   sense of the senate regarding United States commitments under the \n              united states-North korean agreed framework\n\n       Sec. 591. It is the sense of the Senate that, as long as \n     North Korea meets its obligations under the United States-\n     North Korean Nuclear Agreed Framework of 1994, the United \n     States should meet its commitments under the Agreed \n     Framework, including required deliveries of heavy fuel oil to \n     North Korea and support of the Korean Peninsula Energy \n     Development Organization (KEDO).\n\n\n                  expanded threat reduction initiative\n\n       Sec. 592. The Senate finds that:\n       (1) The proposed programs under the Expanded Threat \n     Reduction Initiative (ETRI) are critical and essential to \n     preserving United States national security.\n       (2) The Department of State programs under the ETRI be \n     funded at or near the full request of $250,000,000 in the \n     Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2000 \n     prior to final passage.\n\n\n   SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE \n                                BALKANS.\n\n       Sec. 593. (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The United States and its allies in the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO) conducted large-scale military \n     operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (2) At the conclusion of 78 days of these hostilities, the \n     United States and its NATO allies suspended military \n     operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia based \n     upon credible assurances by the latter that it would fulfill \n     the following conditions as laid down by the so called Group \n     of Eight (G-8):\n       (A) An immediate and verifiable end of violence and \n     repression in Kosova.\n       (B) Staged withdrawal of all Yugoslav military, police, and \n     paramilitary forces from Kosova.\n       (C) Deployment in Kosova of effective international and \n     security presences, endorsed and adopted by the United \n     Nations Security Council, and capable of guaranteeing the \n     achievement of the agreed objectives.\n       (D) Establishment of an interim administration for Kosova, \n     to be decided by the United Nations Security Council which \n     will seek to ensure conditions for a peaceful and normal life \n     for all inhabitants in Kosova.\n       (E) Provision for the safe and free return of all refugees \n     and displaced persons from Kosova and an unimpeded access to \n     Kosova by humanitarian aid organizations.\n       (3) These objectives appear to have been fulfilled, or to \n     be in the process of being fulfilled, which has led the \n     United States and its NATO allies to terminate military \n     operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (4) The G-8 also called for a comprehensive approach to the \n     economic development and stabilization of the crisis region, \n     and the European Union has announced plans for $1,500,000,000 \n     over the next 3 years for the reconstruction of Kosova, for \n     the convening in July of an international donors' conference \n     for Kosova aid, and for subsequent provision of \n     reconstruction aid to the other countries in the region \n     affected by the recent hostilities followed by reconstruction \n     aid directed at the Balkans region as a whole.\n       (5) The United States and some of its NATO allies oppose \n     the provision of any aid, other than limited humanitarian \n     assistance, to Serbia until Yugoslav President Slobodan \n     Milosevic is out of office.\n       (6) The policy of providing reconstruction aid to Kosova \n     and other countries in the region affected by the recent \n     hostilities while withholding such aid for Serbia presents a \n     number of practical problems, including the absence in Kosova \n     of financial and other institutions independent of \n     Yugoslavia, the difficulty in drawing clear and enforceable \n     distinctions between humanitarian and reconstruction \n     assistance, and the difficulty in reconstructing Montenegro \n     in the absence of similar efforts in Serbia.\n       (7) In any case, the achievement of effective and durable \n     economic reconstruction and revitalization in the countries \n     of the Balkans is unlikely until a political settlement is \n     reached as to the final status of Kosova and Yugoslavia.\n       (8) The G-8 proposed a political process towards the \n     establishment of an interim political framework agreement for \n     a substantial self-government for Kosova, taking into full \n     account the final Interim Agreement for Peace and Self-\n     Government in Kosova, also known as the Rambouillet Accords, \n     and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity \n     of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other countries \n     of the region, and the demilitarization of the UCK (Kosova \n     Liberation Army).\n       (9) The G-8 proposal contains no guidance as to a final \n     political settlement for Kosova and Yugoslavia, while the \n     original position of the United States and the other \n     participants in the so-called Contact Group on this matter, \n     as reflected in the Rambouillet Accords, called for the \n     convening of an international conference, after 3 years, to \n     determine a mechanism for a final settlement of Kosova status \n     based on the will of the people, opinions of relevant \n     authorities, each Party's efforts regarding the \n     implementation of the agreement and the provisions of the \n     Helsinki Final Act.\n       (10) The current position of the United States and its NATO \n     allies as to the final status of Kosova and Yugoslavia calls \n     for an autonomous, multiethnic, democratic Kosova which would \n     remain as part of Serbia, and such an outcome is not \n     supported by any of the Parties directly involved, including \n     the governments of Yugoslavia and Serbia, representatives of \n     the Kosovar Albanians, and the people of Yugoslavia, Serbia \n     and Kosova.\n       (11) There has been no final political settlement in \n     Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the Armed Forces of the United \n     States, its NATO allies, and other non-Balkan nations have \n     been enforcing an uneasy peace since 1996, at a cost to the \n     United States alone of over $10,000,000,000, with no clear \n     end in sight to such enforcement.\n       (12) The trend throughout the Balkans since 1990 has been \n     in the direction of ethnically based particularism, as \n     exemplified by the 1991 declarations of independence from \n     Yugoslavia by Slovenia and Croatia, and the country in the \n     Balkans which currently comes the closest to the goal of a \n     democratic government which respects the human rights of its \n     citizens is the nation of Slovenia, which was the first \n     portion of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to \n     secede and is also the nation in the region with the greatest \n     ethnic homogeneity, with a population which is 91 percent \n     Slovene.\n       (13) The boundaries of the various national and sub-\n     national divisions in the Balkans have been altered \n     repeatedly throughout history, and international conferences \n     have frequently played the decisive role in fixing such \n     boundaries in the modern era, including the Berlin Congress \n     of 1878, the London Conference of 1913, and the Paris Peace \n     Conference of 1919.\n       (14) The development of an effective exit strategy for the \n     withdrawal from the Balkans of foreign military forces, \n     including the armed forces of the United States, its NATO \n     allies, Russia, and any other nation from outside the Balkans \n     which has such forces in\n\n[[Page S8182]]\n\n     the Balkans is in the best interests of all such nations.\n       (15) The ultimate withdrawal of foreign military forces, \n     accompanied by the establishment of durable and peaceful \n     relations among all of the nations and peoples of the Balkans \n     is in the best interests of those nations and peoples.\n       (16) An effective exit strategy for the withdrawal from the \n     Balkans of foreign military forces is contingent upon the \n     achievement of a lasting political settlement for the region, \n     and that only such a settlement, acceptable to all parties \n     involved, can ensure the fundamental goals of the United \n     States of peace, stability, and human rights in the Balkans;\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States should call immediately for the \n     convening of an international conference on the Balkans, \n     under the auspices of the United Nations, and based upon the \n     principles of the Rambouillet Accords for a final settlement \n     of Kosova status, namely that such a settlement should be \n     based on the will of the people, opinions of relevant \n     authorities, each Party's efforts regarding the \n     implementation of the agreement and the provisions of the \n     Helsinki Final Act;\n       (2) the international conference on the Balkans should also \n     be empowered to seek a final settlement for Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina based on the same principles as specified for \n     Kosova in the Rambouillet Accords; and\n       (3) in order to produce a lasting political settlement in \n     the Balkans acceptable to all parties, which can lead to the \n     departure from the Balkans in timely fashion of all foreign \n     military forces, including those of the United States, the \n     international conference should have the authority to \n     consider any and all of the following: political boundaries; \n     humanitarian and reconstruction assistance for all nations in \n     the Balkans; stationing of United Nations peacekeeping forces \n     along international boundaries; security arrangements and \n     guarantees for all of the nations of the Balkans; and \n     tangible, enforceable and verifiable human rights guarantees \n     for the individuals and peoples of the Balkans.\n\n\n international disaster assistance for opposition-controlled areas of \n                                 sudan\n\n       Sec. 594. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, of \n     the funds made available under chapter 9 of part I of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (relating to international \n     disaster assistance) for fiscal year 2000, up to $4,000,000 \n     should be made available for rehabilitation and economic \n     recovery in opposition-controlled areas of Sudan. Such funds \n     are to be used to improve economic governance, primary \n     education, agriculture, and other locally-determined \n     priorities. Such funds are to be programmed and implemented \n     jointly by the United States Agency for International \n     Development and the Department of Agriculture, and may be \n     utilized for activities which can be implemented for a period \n     of up to two years.\n\n\n         humanitarian assistance for sudanese indigenous groups\n\n       Sec. 595. The President, acting through the appropriate \n     Federal agencies, is authorized to provide humanitarian \n     assistance, including food, directly to the National \n     Democratic Alliance participants and the Sudanese People's \n     Liberation Movement operating outside of the Operation \n     Lifeline Sudan structure.\n\n\n    development assistance for opposition-controlled areas of sudan\n\n       Sec. 596. (a) Increase in Development Assistance.--The \n     President, acting through the United States Agency for \n     International Development, is authorized to increase \n     substantially the amount of development assistance for \n     capacity building, democracy promotion, civil administration, \n     judiciary, and infrastructure support in opposition-\n     controlled areas of Sudan.\n       (b) Quarterly Report.--The President shall submit a report \n     on a quarterly basis to the Congress on progress made in \n     carrying out subsection (a).\n\n\n                 sense of the senate regarding colombia\n\n       Sec. 597. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Colombia is a democratic country fighting multiple \n     wars--\n       (A) a war against the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces \n     (FARC);\n       (B) a war against the National Liberation Army (ELN);\n       (C) a war against paramilitary organizations; and\n       (D) a war against drug lords who traffic in deadly cocaine \n     and heroin.\n       (2) Colombia is the world's third most dangerous country in \n     terms of political violence with 34 percent of world \n     terrorist acts committed there.\n       (3) Colombia is the world's kidnaping capital of the world \n     with 2,609 kidnapings reported in 1998 and 513 reported in \n     the first three months of 1999.\n       (4) In 1998 alone, 308,000 Colombians were internally \n     displaced in Colombia. Over the last decade, 35,000 \n     Colombians have been killed.\n       (5) The FARC and ELN are the two main guerrilla groups \n     which have waged the longest-running antigovernment \n     insurgency in Latin America.\n       (6) The Colombian rebels have a combined strength of 10,000 \n     to 20,000 full-time guerrillas; they have initiated armed \n     action in nearly 700 of the country's 1073 municipalities, \n     and control or influence roughly 60 percent of rural Colombia \n     including a demilitarized zone using their armed stranglehold \n     to abuse Colombian citizens.\n       (7) Although the Colombian Army has 122,000 soldiers, there \n     are roughly only 20,000 soldiers available for offensive \n     combat operations.\n       (8) Colombia faces the threat of the armed paramilitaries, \n     5,000 strong, who are constantly driving a wedge in the peace \n     process by their insistence in participating in the peace \n     talks.\n       (9) More than 75 percent of the world's cocaine HCL and 75 \n     percent of the heroin seized in the northeast United States \n     is of Colombian origin.\n       (10) The conflicts in Colombia are creating spillovers to \n     the border countries of Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador: \n     Venezuela has sent 30,000 troops to its border and Ecuador is \n     sending 10,000 troops to its border.\n       (11) Venezuela is our number one supplier of oil.\n       (12) By the end of 1999, all United States military troops \n     will have departed from Panama, leaving the Panama Canal \n     unprotected.\n       (13) In 1998, two-way trade between the United States and \n     Colombia was more than $11,000,000,000, making the United \n     States Colombia's number one trading partner and Colombia the \n     fifth largest market for United States exports in the region.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States should recognize the crisis in \n     Colombia and play a more proactive role in its resolution;\n       (2) the United States should mobilize the international \n     community to proactively engage in resolving Colombian wars; \n     and\n       (3) the United States should pledge our political support \n     to help Colombia with the peace process.\n\n\n                    accountability of saddam hussein\n\n       Sec. 598. It is the sense of the Senate that the President \n     and the Secretary of State should--\n       (1) raise the need for accountability of Saddam Hussein and \n     several key members of his regime at the International \n     Criminal Court Preparatory Commission, which will meet in New \n     York on July 26, 1999, through August 13, 1999;\n       (2) continue to push for the creation of a commission under \n     the auspices of the United Nations to establish an \n     international record of the criminal culpability of Saddam \n     Hussein and other Iraqi officials;\n       (3) continue to push for the United Nations to form an \n     international criminal tribunal for the purpose of indicting, \n     prosecuting, and imprisoning Saddam Hussein and any other \n     Iraqi officials who may be found responsible for crimes \n     against humanity, genocide, and other violations of \n     international humanitarian law; and\n       (4) upon the creation of a commission and international \n     criminal tribunal, take steps necessary, including the \n     reprogramming of funds, to ensure United States support for \n     efforts to bring Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials to \n     justice.\n\n\nsense of the senate regarding assistance provided to lithuania, latvia, \n                              and estonia\n\n       Sec. 599.

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Egypt and Israel together negotiated the Camp David \n     Accords, an historic breakthrough in beginning the process of \n     bringing peace to the Middle East.\n       (2) As part of the Camp David Accords, a concept was \n     reached regarding the ratio of United States foreign \n     assistance between Egypt and Israel, a formula which has been \n     followed since the signing of the Accords.\n       (3) The United States is reducing economic assistance to \n     Egypt and Israel, with the agreement of those nations.\n       (4) The United States is committed to maintaining \n     proportionality between Egypt and Israel in United States \n     foreign assistance programs.\n       (5) Egypt has consistently fulfilled an historic role of \n     peacemaker in the context of the Arab-Israeli disputes.\n       (6) The recent elections in Israel offer fresh hope of \n     resolving the remaining issues of dispute in the region.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the United States should provide Egypt access to an \n     interest bearing account as part of the United States foreign \n     assistance program pursuant to the principles of \n     proportionality which underlie the Camp David Accords.\n\n\n                             authorizations\n\n       Sec. 599C.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 193, S. 1257.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1257) to amend statutory damages provisions of \n     title 17, United States Code.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering four very \nimportant intellectual property related ``high-tech'' bills that \nSenator Leahy and I have introduced to promote the continued growth of \nvital sectors of the American economy and to protect the interests and \ninvestment of the entrepreneurs, authors, and innovators who fuel their \ngrowth. These bills were reported by unanimous consent earlier today by \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  Technology is the driving force in the American economy today, and \nAmerican technology is setting new standards for the global economy, \nfrom semiconductor chip technology, to computer software, Internet and \ntelecommunications technology, to leading pharmaceutical and genetic \nresearch. In my own state of Utah, these information technology \nindustries contribute in excess of $7 billion each year to the State's \neconomy and pay wages that average 66 percent higher than the state \naverage. Their performance has placed Utah among the world's top ten \ntechnology centers according to Newsweek Magazine. Similar success is \nseen in areas across the country, with the U.S. being home to seven of \nthe world's top ten technology centers and with American creative \nindustries now surpassing all other export sectors in foreign sales and \nexports.\n  Underlying all of these technologies are the intellectual property \nrights that serve to promote creativity and innovation by safeguarding \nthe investment, effort, and goodwill of those who venture into these \nfast-placed and volatile fields. Strong intellectual property \nprotections are particularly critical in the global high-tech \nenvironment where electronic piracy is so easy, so cheap, and yet so \npotentially devastating to intellectual property owners--many of which \nare small entrepreneurial enterprises. In Utah, 65 percent of these \ncompanies have fewer than 25 employees, and a majority have annual \nrevenues of less than $1 million. Intellectual property is the \nlifeblood of\n\n[[Page S8191]]\n\nthese companies, and even a single instance of piracy could drive them \nout of business. What's more, without adequate international \nprotection, these companies would simply be unable to compete in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  That is why we enacted a number of measures last year to provide \nenhanced protection for intellectual property in the new global, high-\ntech environment. For example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act \n(DMCA) implemented two new World Intellectual Property Organization \nTreaties setting new global standards for copyright protection in the \ndigital environment. We also paved the way for new growth in online \ncommerce by providing a copyright framework in which the Internet and \nother new technologies can flourish.\n  This year, Senator Leahy and I are continuing to focus our attention \non important high-tech and intellectual property legislation. The bills \nwe are considering today will build upon existing protections, \nincluding last year's measures to deter digital piracy, by raising the \nCopyright Act's limit on statutory damages to make it more costly to \nengage in cyber-piracy and copyright theft. They will also make \ntechnical ``clean-up'' amendments to the DMCA and other Copyright Act \nprovisions to make them clearer and more user-friendly. On the \ntrademark side, these bills will make the protection of famous marks \neasier and more efficient and provide recourse for trademark owners \nagainst the federal government for trademark infringement. Finally, \nthese bills will allow the Patent and Trademark Office to better serve \nits customers--America's innovators and trademark owners--through the \ncollection and retention of fees.\n  Each of these bills is noncontroversial and enjoys widespread \nsupport. I want to thank Senator Leahy for his assistance, cooperation, \nand leadership in this process, and I look forward to the Senate \nswiftly passing these bills today.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read \na third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1257) was considered read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1257\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to S. \n606, a bill for the Relief of Global Exploration and Development \nCorporation, Kerr-McGee and Kerr-McGee Chemical, offered by my \ncolleague from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl. In 1954, Congress enacted \n``termination'' legislation eliminating the Menominee Indian Tribe of \nWisconsin's federal trust status. At that time, the Menominee Tribe was \nill-prepared to function outside of the federal trust system. The \nTribe's lack of readiness became quickly apparent when, upon \ntermination, the Tribe was plunged into years of severe impoverishment \nand community turmoil. Today, with this amendment, we seek to provide \nredress for some of that severe turmoil, and the mismanagement of \ntribal resources in the period following the enactment of termination \nlegislation.\n  I am pleased that this issue is finally being resolved, in part. This \nMenominee Settlement claim has been an active issue throughout my \ntenure in the Senate. In the five years since the original legislative \nreference was referred by the Senate to the Court of Claims, the tribe \nand the federal government have engaged in extensive litigation and \nnegotiation. Following documentation and negotiations by both sides, \nthe United States, represented by the Department of Justice, and the \nMenominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin agreed upon a settlement of the \nclaims of the Tribe for a sum of $32,052,547, subject to passage of the \nnecessary legislation by Congress. This amendment will legislatively \ncomplete that settlement.\n  This settlement cannot undo the suffering of the Menominee people. \nThe reservation, the boundaries of which are entirely co-terminous with \nthe boundaries of Menominee County, is acknowledged to be still \nexperiencing some of the most significant levels of poverty and \neconomic dislocation in my entire state. The compensation for the lack \nof management of forestry and other reservation resources provided in \nthis settlement, though it cannot undo the past, can help the Menominee \nNation to seek a bright future. I know the Menominee Nation looks \nforward to assisting its people and the surrounding communities through \nthe use of these funds.\n  In conclusion, I also want to acknowledge the leadership of my \ncolleague from Wisconsin on this issue. He has taken on significant \nresponsibility in seeking to right this wrong and I commend him for it. \nThank you.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \nsubstitute be agreed to, the bill be considered read the third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 606), as amended, was considered read the third time, \nand passed.\n\n                                 S. 606\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 768) to establish court-martial jurisdiction \n     over civilians serving in the Armed Forces during contingency \n     operations, and to establish Federal jurisdiction over crimes \n     committed outside of the United\n\n[[Page S8195]]\n\n     States by former members of the Armed Forces and civilians \n     accompanying the Armed Forces outside the United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on the Judiciary, with an \namendment to strike all after the enacting clause and inserting in lieu \nthereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Military and \n     Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Civilian employees of the Department of Defense, and \n     civilian employees of Department of Defense contractors, \n     provide critical support to the Armed Forces of the United \n     States that are deployed during a contingency operation.\n       (2) Misconduct by such persons undermines good order and \n     discipline in the Armed Forces, and jeopardizes the mission \n     of the contingency operation.\n       (3) Military commanders need the legal tools to address \n     adequately misconduct by civilians serving with Armed Forces \n     during a contingency operation.\n       (4) In its present state, military law does not permit \n     military commanders to address adequately misconduct by \n     civilians serving with Armed Forces, except in time of a \n     congressionally declared war.\n       (5) To address this need, the Uniform Code of Military \n     Justice should be amended to provide for court-martial \n     jurisdiction over civilians serving with Armed Forces in \n     places designated by the Secretary of Defense during a \n     ``contingency operation'' expressly designated as such by the \n     Secretary of Defense.\n       (6) This limited extension of court-martial jurisdiction \n     over civilians is dictated by military necessity, is within \n     the constitutional powers of Congress to make rules for the \n     government of the Armed Forces, and, therefore, is consistent \n     with the Constitution of the United States and United States \n     public policy.\n       (7) Many thousand civilian employees of the Department of \n     Defense, civilian employees of Department of Defense \n     contractors, and civilian dependents accompany the Armed \n     Forces to installations in foreign countries.\n       (8) Misconduct among such civilians has been a longstanding \n     problem for military commanders and other United States \n     officials in foreign countries, and threatens United States \n     citizens, United States property, and United States relations \n     with host countries.\n       (9) Federal criminal law does not apply to many offenses \n     committed outside of the United States by such civilians and, \n     because host countries often do not prosecute such offenses, \n     serious crimes often go unpunished and, to address this \n     jurisdictional gap, Federal law should be amended to punish \n     serious offenses committed by such civilians outside the \n     United States, to the same extent as if those offenses were \n     committed within the special maritime and territorial \n     jurisdiction of the United States.\n       (10) Federal law does not apply to many crimes committed \n     outside the United States by members of the Armed Forces who \n     separate from the Armed Forces before they can be identified, \n     thus escaping court-martial jurisdiction and, to address this \n     jurisdictional gap, Federal law should be amended to punish \n     serious offenses committed by such persons outside the United \n     States, to the same extent as if those offenses were \n     committed within the special maritime and territorial \n     jurisdiction of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. COURT-MARTIAL JURISDICTION.\n\n       (a) Jurisdiction During Contingency Operations.--Section \n     802(a) of title 10, United States Code (article 2(a) of the \n     Uniform Code of Military Justice), is amended by inserting \n     after paragraph (12) the following:\n       ``(13) To the extent not covered by paragraphs (10) and \n     (11), persons not members of the armed forces who, in support \n     of a contingency operation described in section 101(a)(13)(B) \n     of this title, are serving with and accompanying an armed \n     force in a place or places outside the United States \n     specified by the Secretary of Defense, as follows:\n       ``(A) Employees of the Department of Defense.\n       ``(B) Employees of any Department of Defense contractor who \n     are so serving in connection with the performance of a \n     Department of Defense contract.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act \n     and apply with respect to acts or omissions occurring on or \n     after that date.\n\n     SEC. 4. FEDERAL JURISDICTION.\n\n       (a) Criminal Offenses Committed Outside the United \n     States.--Title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     inserting after chapter 211 the following:\n\n  ``CHAPTER 212--CRIMINAL OFFENSES COMMITTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES\n\n``Sec.\n``3261.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Civilian employees of the Department of Defense, and \n     civilian employees of Department of Defense contractors, \n     provide critical support to the Armed Forces of the United \n     States that are deployed during a contingency operation.\n       (2) Misconduct by such persons undermines good order and \n     discipline in the Armed Forces, and jeopardizes the mission \n     of the contingency operation.\n       (3) Military commanders need the legal tools to address \n     adequately misconduct by civilians serving with Armed Forces \n     during a contingency operation.\n       (4) In its present state, military law does not permit \n     military commanders to address adequately misconduct by \n     civilians serving with Armed Forces, except in time of a \n     congressionally declared war.\n       (5) To address this need, the Uniform Code of Military \n     Justice should be amended to provide for court-martial \n     jurisdiction over civilians serving with Armed Forces in \n     places designated by the Secretary of Defense during a \n     ``contingency operation'' expressly designated as such by the \n     Secretary of Defense.\n       (6) This limited extension of court-martial jurisdiction \n     over civilians is dictated by military necessity, is within \n     the constitutional powers of Congress to make rules for the \n     government of the Armed Forces, and, therefore, is consistent \n     with the Constitution of the United States and United States \n     public policy.\n       (7) Many thousand civilian employees of the Department of \n     Defense, civilian employees of Department of Defense \n     contractors, and civilian dependents accompany the Armed \n     Forces to installations in foreign countries.\n       (8) Misconduct among such civilians has been a longstanding \n     problem for military commanders and other United States \n     officials in foreign countries, and threatens United States \n     citizens, United States property, and United States relations \n     with host countries.\n       (9) Federal criminal law does not apply to many offenses \n     committed outside of the United States by such civilians and, \n     because host countries often do not prosecute such offenses, \n     serious crimes often go unpunished and,to address this \n     jurisdictional gap, Federal law should be amended to punish \n     serious offenses committed by such civilians outside the \n     United States, to the same extent as if those offenses were \n     committed within the special maritime and territorial \n     jurisdiction of the United States.\n       (10) Federal law does not apply to many crimes committed \n     outside the United States by members of the Armed Forces who \n     separate from the Armed Forces before they can be identified, \n     thus escaping court-martial jurisdiction and, to address this \n     jurisdictional gap, Federal law should be amended to punish \n     serious offenses committed by such persons outside the United \n     States, to the same extent as if those offenses were \n     committed within the special maritime and territorial \n     jurisdiction of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Criminal Offenses Committed Outside the United States3621''.....\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support S. 768, which was significantly \nimproved during the Judiciary Committee mark up with a substitute \namendment that I cosponsored with Senators Sessions and DeWine. This \nimportant legislation will close a gap in Federal law that has existed \nfor many years. S. 768 establishes authority for Federal jurisdiction \nover crimes committed by individuals accompanying our military overseas \nand court-marital jurisdiction over Department of Defense employees and \ncontractors accompanying the Armed Forces on contingency missions \noutside the United States during times of war or national emergency \ndeclared by the President or the Congress.\n  Civilians accompanying the Armed Forces have been subject to court-\nmartial jurisdiction when ``accompanying or serving with the armies of \nthe United States in the field'' since the Revolutionary War. See \nMcCune v. Kilpatrick, 53 F. Supp. 80, 84 (E.D. Va. 1943) It is only \nsince the start of the cold war that American troops, accompanied by \ncivilian dependents and employees, have been stationed overseas in \npeace time. Provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice provide \nfor the court-martial of civilians accused of crimes while accompanying \nthe armed forces in times of peace or war. The provisions allowing for \npeace time court-martial of civilians were found unconstitutional by a \nseries of Supreme Court cases beginning with Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1 \n(1957). With foreign nations often not interested in prosecuting crimes \nagainst Americans, particularly when committed by an American, the \nresult is a jurisdictional ``gap'' that allows some civilians to \nliterally get away with murder.\n  A report by the Overseas Jurisdiction Advisory Committee submitted to \nCongress in 1997, cited cases in which host countries declined to \nprosecute serious crimes committed by civilians accompanying our Armed \nForces. These cases involved the sexual molestation of dependent girls, \nthe stabbing of a serviceman and drug trafficking to soldiers. The \nindividuals who committed these crimes against service men and women or \ntheir dependents were not prosecuted in the host country and were free \nto return to the United States and continue their lives as if the \nincidents had never occurred. The victims of these awful crimes are \nleft with no redress for the suffering they endured.\n  This inability to exercise Federal jurisdiction over individuals \naccompanying our armed forces overseas has caused problems. During the \nVietnam War, Federal jurisdiction over civilians was not permissible \nsince war was never declared by the Congress. Maj. Gen. George S. Prugh \nsaid, in his text on legal issues arising during the Vietnam war, that \nthe inability to discipline civilians ``became a cause for major \nconcern to the U.S. command.''\n  More recently, Operation Desert Storm involved the deployment of \n4,500 Department of Defense civilians and at least 3,000 contractor \nemployees. Similarly large deployments of civilians have been repeated \nin contingency operations in Somalia, Haiti, Kuwait, and Rwanda. \nAlthough crime by civilians accompanying our armed forces in Operation \nDesert Storm was rare, the Department of Defense did report that four \nof its civilian employees were involved insignificant criminal \nmisconduct ranging from transportation of illegal firearms to larceny \nand receiving stolen property. One of these civilians was suspended \nwithout pay for 30 days while no action was taken on the remaining \nthree.\n\n  Due to the lack of Federal jurisdiction over civilians in a foreign \ncountry, administrative remedies such as dismissal from the job, \nbanishment from the base, suspension without pay, or returning the \nperson to the United States are often the only remedies available to \nmilitary authorities to deal with civilian offenders. The inadequacy of \nthese remedies to address the criminal activity of civilians \naccompanying our Armed Forces overseas results in a lack of deterrence \nand an inequity due to the harsher sanctions imposed upon military \npersonnel who committed the same crimes as civilians.\n  I expect the deployment of civilians in Kosovo and elsewhere will be \nrelatively crime free, but regardless of the frequency of its use, the \ngap that allows individuals accompanying our military personnel \noverseas to go unpunished for heinous crimes must be closed. Our \nservice men and women and those accompanying them deserve justice when \nthey are victims of crime. That is why I introduced this provision as \npart of the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act with \nother Democratic Members, both last year as S. 2484 and again on \nJanuary 19 of this year, as S. 9.\n  I had some concerns with certain aspects of S. 768 that were not \nincluded in my version of this legislation, and I am pleased that we \nwere able to address those concerns in the Sessions-Leahy-DeWine \nsubstitute. For example, the original bill would have extended court-\nmartial jurisdiction over DOD employees and contractors accompanying \nour Armed Forces overseas. The Supreme Court in Reid v. Covert, 354 \nU.S. 1 (1957), Kinsella v. Singleton, 361 U.S. 234 (1960) and Toth v. \nQuarles, 350 U.S. 11 (1955), has made clear that court-martial \njurisdiction may not be constitutionally applied to crimes committed in \npeacetime by persons accompanying the armed forces overseas, or to \ncrimes committed by a former member of the armed services.\n  The substitute makes clear that this extension of court-martial \njurisdiction applies only in times when the armed forces are engaged in \na ``contingency operation'' involving a war or national emergency \ndeclared by the Congress or the President. I believe this comports with \nthe Supreme Court rulings on this issue and cures any constitutional \ninfirmity with the original language.\n  In addition, the original bill would have deemed any delay in \nbringing a person before a magistrate due to transporting the person \nback to the United States from overseas as ``justifiable.'' I was \nconcerned that this provision could end up excusing lengthy and \nunreasonable delays in getting a civilian, who was arrested overseas, \nbefore a U.S. Magistrate, and thereby raise yet other constitutional \nconcerns.\n  The Sessions-Leahy-DeWine substitute cures that potential problem by \nremoving the problematic provision and relying instead on rule 5 of the \nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure. This rule requires that an \narrested person be brought before a magistrate to answer charges \nwithout unnecessary delays, and will apply to the removal of a civilian \nfrom overseas to answer charges in the United States.\n  Finally, S. 768 as introduced authorized the Department of Defense to \ndetermine which foreign officials constitute the appropriate \nauthorities to whom an arrested civilian should be delivered. In my \nproposal for this legislation I required that DOD make this \ndetermination in consultation with the Department of State. I felt this \nwould help avoid international faux pax. I am pleased that the \nSessions-Leahy substitute adopted my approach to this issue and \nrequires consultation with the Department of State.\n  I am glad the legislation which I and other Democratic Members of the \nJudiciary Committee originally introduced both last year and again on \nJanuary 19 of this year, is finally being considered, and I urge its \nprompt passage.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to, the committee amendment be agreed to, as amended, the \nbill be read the third time, and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill \nappear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 136, introduced \nearlier today by Senators Boxer and Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 136) condemning the acts of arson at \n     three Sacramento, CA, synagogues on June 18, 1999, and \n     calling on all Americans to categorically reject crimes of \n     hate and intolerance.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Barbara Boxer, to introduce a Sense of the Senate \nResolution condemning the acts of arson at three Sacramento, California \nsynagogues on June 18, 1999. The resolution also calls on all Americans \nto categorically reject crimes of hate and intolerance.\n  I believe this measure is important not only to the Sacramento \ncommunity but also to all Americans who abhor intolerance.\n  I was shocked and saddened when I first heard the news that three \nsynagogues in Sacramento had been targeted by arsonists. Committed just \na few hours before dawn, this heinous attack was carried out over a 45 \nminute time span signaling to us that this was deliberate and \npremeditated act.\n  In that time, $1.2 million in damage was done to the Congregation \nB'nai Israel, Congregation Beth Shalom and the Kenessett Israel Torah \nCenter. While the damage to the property was severe, no dollar amount \ncan reflect the true damage done when hateful crimes such as these \nstrike at the heart of a community.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is tragic that even though we have made \nsignificant progress to increase tolerance in this nation that such \nvicious hate crimes continue to be committed.\n  This resolution expresses our resolve to ensure that such acts of \nignorance and bigotry will not be tolerated in this nation and those \nwho commit them will face swift justice. While the resolution condemns \nthese specific acts of arson in the Sacramento area, it also declares \nour collective abhorrence to all crimes of intolerance.\n  The resolution also says that the Senate is committed to using \nFederal law enforcement personnel and resources to identify the persons \nwho committed these heinous acts and brings them to justice in a swift \nand deliberate manner. It also recognizes and applauds the residents of \nSacramento area who have so quickly joined together to lend support and \nassistance to the victims of these despicable crimes, and remains \ncommitted to preserving the freedom of religion of all members of the \ncommunity.\n  I believe that one of the most sacred rights we have as Americans is \nthe freedom of religion. This country came to be because people wanted \nto be able to choose how they worshiped. I hope that in the wake of \nthis sorrowful event, we are all reminded of the importance of this \nfreedom.\n  Whatever the motive in these arsons, all people of faith in the \nSacramento community and this nation must stand together to fight such \nhatred. The bottom line is that hatred, bigotry and racism all come \nfrom the same place--ignorance.\n  California's modern heritage is one in which diversity is to be \nrespected, not scorned. As long as hate crimes continue to counter that \nheritage, we must work together to denounce intolerance and the protect \nthe rights of all.\n  Mr. President, while we have made progress to increase tolerance in \nthis nation, tragic events like these in Sacramento prove that we still \nneed to do more. Together, we must send the strongest possible message \nthat hate crimes will not be tolerated.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I join today with my colleagues, Senators \nBoxer and Feinstein to introduce a resolution condemning the acts of \narson against the three Jewish synagogues in Sacramento, California.\n  Our history is blessed with courageous acts of men and women who have \nrefused to accept, and united against, ignorance, oppression and \ndiscrimination. It was their selflessness which, in large part, secured \nand protected the same freedoms and liberties so many Americans take \nfor granted today.\n  On June 18th, 1999, in Sacramento, California, the Congregation B'nai \nIsrael, Congregation Beth Shalom and Knesset Israel Torah Center were \nvictims of malicious and cowardly acts of arson. Mr. President, these \nacts of intolerance and malice are a direct attack against all \nAmericans and the ideals which are integral to a free and democratic \nsociety. The very liberties that allow America to prosper are directly \nundermined by such acts of blatant hatred and intolerance.\n  Mr. President, the United States owes much of its strength and \ngreatness to the special uniqueness and diversity of its people. It is \nimperative that we unite, upholding our responsibility to honor and \nprotect the basic, inalienable right to live without fear and violence. \nWe must send a message to those individuals who would undermine our \nfree and democratic society, that their acts, and any similar actions, \nwill not be tolerated.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to take this time to commend the \nresidents of Sacramento, and the larger California community, who have \njoined in solidarity with the Jewish congregations, demonstrating their \ncontinued commitment to preserving the freedom of all members of the \ncommunity.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to, en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table and any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 136) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of \na fellow Virginian, Timothy Fields, Jr., to be the Assistant \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). When I look \nback over Mr. Fields' dedication to public service including 28 years \nat the EPA as well as the strong educational background he received at \none of our nation's most selective colleges and a great source of pride \nfor my home state of Virginia, Virginia Tech University, I say to \nmyself, the President and the EPA Administrator selected wisely.\n  We are fortunate that a man of this caliber and distinction is \nwilling to devote himself to public service. Rarely have we had a \nnominee come before the Environment and Public Works Committee, on \nwhich I am privileged to serve, with so much direct experience to \nqualify himself for the job. Mr. Fields comes before us not from a \npolitical background but from the field of engineering.\n  Here are some highlights: upon graduating from Virginia Tech, Mr. \nFields received a masters degree from George Washington University and \nhas studied\n\n[[Page S8201]]\n\nat Ohio State University. His lifetime of service at EPA began in 1971. \nMost recently, on February 17, 1997, Mr. Fields was appointed Acting \nAssistant Administrator for the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency \nResponse (OSWER). Prior to this, Mr. Fields served for three years as \nPrincipal Deputy Administrator for OSWER where he was responsible for \nSuperfund and solid waste under RCRA, Director of EPA's Superfund \noffice for over two years and serving in that office for five years, \nand Director of EPA's Emergency Response Division for four and a half \nyears and Deputy Director of the Hazardous Site Control Division for a \nyear and a half.\n  Even more remarkable is his list of achievements. He received the \nhighest award for civil servants, the Presidential Rank Award for \nDistinguished Executive Service--not once but four times. He was \nrecommended twice under President George Bush and twice under President \nBill Clinton. He is the only EPA employee to be so honored.\n  According to a report issued by the General Accounting Office, by the \nend of this fiscal year, all cleanup remedies will have been selected \nfor over 1,100 sites. About 31,000 sites have been removed from the \nSuperfund inventory of potential waste sites to help promote the \neconomic redevelopment of these priorities. I think it is fair to say \nthat Mr. Fields deserves part of the credit.\n  Mr. Fields' career at EPA is one of great distinction and is a model \nfor Virginians interested in a life in public service. I am very proud \nto offer my support for Mr. Fields.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8201-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THANKS TO THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, I rise to urge a speedy resolution to the \nconference the House- and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 1554, the \nSatellite Home Viewer Improvement Act. I hope that the conferees will \nmeet soon, and that the Congress can take final action on this matter.\n  This is a much needed measure to enhance the satellite television \nindustry's ability to compete with cable television. Currently, cable \nhas a commanding 85 percent share of the multichannel video programming \ndistribution market. Satellite serves only 12.1 percent of the market. \nThe 1988 Satellite Home Viewer Act enacted in 1988 put in place certain \nimpediments to satellite carriers being truly competitive with cable. \nThis measure alleviates those roadblocks and will promote real \ncompetition. This is good news for consumers. Prices should come down, \nand the diversity of programming offered should increase.\n  The Senate version of H.R. 1554 would remove the 90-day waiting \nperiod for receipt of broadcast network signals that consumers \ncurrently face when switching from cable to satellite television \nreception. It would authorize satellite carriers to offer local \ntelevision station broadcasts to their customers. This provision would \ngo a long way toward leveling the playing field between cable and \nsatellite television. One of the major deterrents to purchasing \nsatellite television has been the inability to watch local broadcast \nprogramming. The bill also contains a ``must carry'' provision, meaning \nthat all local stations must be carried by the satellite carriers by \nJanuary 1, 2002.\n  But, Mr. President, the aspect of this legislation that my \nconstituents are most immediately concerned about is their current \naccess to distant network signals through their satellite television \nsystems. As I drive through the mountains of West Virginia, I am awed \nby their beauty and majesty. West Virginia truly is an amazing state in \nwhich to live, sometimes described as ``all ups and downs.'' Flattened \nout as you would a crumpled piece of paper, a topographic map of West \nVirginia would move up the ranks from one of the smaller states in the \nUnion to one of the largest. This awe-inspiring geography presents \nunique challenges to my constituents. One of those challenges is the \nability to receive over-the-air broadcast signals. Many of my \nconstituents, through no fault of their own, are having those signals \nterminated. While they may live in an area that is supposed to get a \nsignal from the local broadcast station, many times geography and other \nfactors result in a picture that is not acceptable. Under current law, \nif a household should be able to receive broadcast network signals with \nan antenna, that household is ineligible to receive distant network \nsignals from their satellite provider. This leaves many West Virginians \nwith little recourse. Their street address or zip code indicates that \nthey should be able to receive local stations with a rooftop antenna, \nbut the steep hillsides that form their backyards make that impossible.\n  In an effort to address this issue, under the Senate-passed version \nof H.R. 1554, customers who were receiving a distant network signal \nbefore July 11, 1998, would receive those signals until December 31, \n1999. After that date, the affiliate network signals of customers \nresiding within the Grade A contours, the areas closest to the \nbroadcast station, would be cut off. This bill will allow satellite \nsubscribers outside of the grade A contour, but within the grade B \ncontour, to continue to receive their distant network signals after \nDecember 31, 1999, subject to an FCC rulemaking. I believe this is a \nfair way to deal with subscribers who, through no fault of their own, \nwould otherwise have distant network signals terminated.\n  I am a strong supporter of local broadcasters, and I believe that \nthey perform an important function for local communities. The local \nnews and emergency services broadcasters provide are invaluable and \nshould be protected. While I understand the concerns expressed by local \nbroadcasters, I am not convinced that the grandfathering provision \nincluded in the Senate bill will constitute significant harm to their \nlivelihoods.\n  I urge the conferees to complete action so that Congress can quickly \nenact this legislation to provide relief to the many people throughout \nWest Virginia and the Nation.\n  I apologize to all officers, Senators's aides and Members of the \nstaff for the late hour, but I think that is perhaps better than being \nin session tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/01/senate-section/article/S8201-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8201-S8203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I take this time to call the attention of \nour colleagues and our viewing audience to the forthcoming Independence \nDay, July 4.\n  What is July 4 all about? The Declaration of Independence in U.S. \nhistory was a document that proclaimed the freedom of the Thirteen \nColonies from British rule. It was the first formal pronouncement by an \norganized body of people of the right to govern by choice.\n  On July 2, 1776, the Second Continental Congress, meeting in \nPhiladelphia, approved Richard Henry Lee's motion for independence, and \non July 4--which later came to be celebrated as Independence Day--it \napproved the declaration. Signing of the declaration took place over \nthe course of several months, beginning August 2. Ultimately, the \nsignatories numbered 56.\n  The Declaration of Independence, written primarily by Thomas \nJefferson, and modeled largely on the theories of John Locke, have \naffirmed the national rights of man and the doctrine of government by \ncontract, which Congress insisted had been repeatedly violated by King \nGeorge III.\n\n[[Page S8202]]\n\n  Specific grievances were listed in support of the contention that the \nColonies had the right and the duty to revoke. The declaration was paid \nlittle attention to at the time, but it proved influential in the 19th \ncentury, and in the United States has enjoyed an esteem second only to \nthe Federal Constitution.\n  Mr. President, all across the United States and in U.S. embassies \naround the world, lawns are being mowed and outdoor furniture is being \nhosed off as Americans prepare to celebrate our biggest open air \nholiday, Independence Day. The fireworks stands have been doing brisk \nbusiness selling everything from smoky uncoiling snakes to dazzling \nsparklers to rockets and fountains that shriek and pop as they dispense \nmulticolored bursts of flame and sparks.\n  The one great constant in our national lexicon, it seems, is the \nFourth of July. With some variations in the side dishes, the core menu \nreliably consists of juicy hamburgers and crisp-skinned hotdogs \nslathered in ketchup and mustard, served with creamy potato and \nmacaroni salads, potato chips, onions, sweet corn on the cob dripping \nwith butter, and icy, icy, icy, icy watermelon wedges that provide the \nammunition for seed spitting contests. How great it is.\n  Whether eating with friends or family at a picnic site, in one's \nbackyard, or tailgate style, the feasts are followed by games to fill \nthe endless wait until the skies darken and become a fitting backdrop \nfor the big show of the day--the fireworks displays.\n  The sight of fireworks, those great blossoming stars of sparks that \nburst and then fall like rain from the sky, never fails to remind me of \nthe words of the Star Spangled Banner, written by Francis Scott Key \nafter witnessing the artillery bombardment of Fort McHenry during the \nWar of 1812: ``. . . and the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in \nair, gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. . . \n.'' Francis Scott Key was being held by the British, having sailed out \nto their fleet, staged off Baltimore, in an attempt to free a local \ndoctor taken hostage earlier. The British officers did finally agree to \nfree the doctor, but decided that Key and his companions had seen too \nmuch to be released before the attack began.\n  The beauty and excitement of the fireworks that many of us will see \nthis weekend, therefore, evoke for me the great battles that were \nfought to make our Nation free and to defend her from harm in those \ndangerous early years of the republic. It is when I see fireworks that \nI most fully appreciate the great risks hazarded by our forefathers \nwhen they declared independence from the Crown. They risked \neverything--their lives, their fortunes, their lands, their families, \ntheir sacred honor.\n  I recall Nathan Hale, who responded to the call of George Washington, \nthe commander of the armies at Valley Forge. George Washington wanted \nsomeone to volunteer to go behind the British lines and draw pictures \nof the breastworks and bring them back to him, George Washington. It \nwas a dangerous undertaking. It meant risking one's life. And so Nathan \nHale, who was a schoolteacher, volunteered. He went behind the British \nlines. He succeeded in what he had gone there to do, but the night \nbefore he planned to return to the American lines he was discovered and \nthe papers were discovered on him, and the next morning he was brought \nbefore the scaffold. The British officer, whose name was Cunningham, \nand who denied Nathan Hale's last wish, his wish for a Bible, said to \nhim: Have you anything to say?\n  Well, there at the foot of the scaffold, Nathan Hale could see the \nrough-hewn wooden coffin in which his body would soon lie. He said, ``I \nonly regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.'' Think of \nthat. ``I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my \ncountry.''\n  That is the kind of patriot who gave this country its independence, \nand many of us can't even give our country one vote on election day. \nWhat a pitiful example we sometimes set as a people on election day \nwhen we don't bother to go to the polls. Whether we are Democrats or \nRepublicans or Independents, we should owe that much, that much to our \ncountry and to the memory of Nathan Hale.\n  I talk to our young pages here and sometimes I borrow a history book \nfrom those who are here when they are attending school. I want to see \nwhat kind of history books they are reading in this day and time. When \nI was talking with these young pages a few days ago, I said, Who was \nNathan Hale? Who here knows, who can tell me about Nathan Hale?\n  Well, sorrowfully, many of the history books today don't even mention \nNathan Hale's name. Those are not history books. They are social \nscience textbooks. Nathan Hale; and so he said, ``I only regret that I \nhave but one life to lose for my country.''\n  Those men and women risked everything, as I say--their lives, their \nfortunes, their lands, their families, their sacred honor, even the \npopulations in the States they represented--when they boldly inked \ntheir names on the Declaration of Independence.\n  In the percussive thuds and whistling screams of today's fireworks I \ncan hear--Can you hear?--the distant thunder of cannons and the crack \nof flintlocks as the first major land battle of the Revolutionary War \nwas pitched at Point Pleasant, West Virginia. When I see the great \nfireworks displays put on here in the Nation's capital, I see the \nshadows of the Capitol dome consumed in flames, as it was in August \n1814. If I look out on the wide Potomac dotted with pleasure craft \nbobbing gently at anchor as still more people enjoy the fireworks, I \ncan easily imagine General George Washington and his ragged Army \nstruggling to cross the Delaware River for their daring Christmas day \nraid in the bitter cold of December 1776. And when I catch the scent of \nblack powder drifting by as the night sky grows cloudy with the smoke \nfrom the explosions, I get the tingling sensation of fear and nerves \nthat must have accompanied every soldier awaiting advancing Redcoats at \nLexington and Concord.\n\n  What courage and what bravery were displayed by the people of this \nfledgling Nation, when first they undertook to break away from Great \nBritain. What great good fortune I, and everyone else who is listening, \nhave, to be able to enjoy the fruits of their boldness, their courage, \ntheir willingness to give their lives. From coast to coast this \nweekend, we are able to freely gather, to celebrate, to rejoice, and, \nyes, to watch fireworks in a peaceful imitation of those perilous days \nover twenty decades ago. In this great land and its marvelously \nbalanced Constitution, we have inherited a treasure beyond price. It is \na treasure that we honor with our service and which we defend with our \nblood if need be.\n  So, while I enjoy the parades and picnics and fireworks of this happy \nholiday, I will also be offering my thanks to all those through the \nyears who are responsible for struggling and winning the battles to \nsecure our more perfect union, that we might be free to pursue health, \nhappiness, and the blessings of liberty. My thanks also go to those men \nand women who today guard our freedom and who offer hope to others who \nfear the loss of their liberty, their lives, and their families.\n  I thank Nathan Hale who died on September 22, 1776, and who willingly \nwould have died many times for his country.\n  We are a great and prosperous nation. We ought to thank God for his \nwatchfulness over us, for the blessings he has showered upon our great \ncountry from its beginning, even before the Republic was instituted.\n  Just this week we have learned anew how prosperous we are, as the \nadministration heralded new long-term estimates that paint a very \nbright economic picture of rising surpluses and falling debt. I must \nconfess I am pretty wary of economic estimates. That is a science even \nfar less exact than weather forecasting or even, it seems, astrology. \nIt does seem clear that for the near term, at least, we may expect a \nsmall on-budget surplus that was not previously anticipated. I urge \nthat we Senators support an effort to designate a substantial portion \nof these newly found resources to the Department of Veterans Affairs in \norder to support veterans health care. I have talked to my good friend \nand colleague, Mr. Stevens, the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, and we are in agreement. But the fact that we are in \nagreement does not mean that the matter is settled. We have a tough \nuphill battle before us.\n\n[[Page S8203]]\n\n  Veterans health care, a promise of lifetime care made to everyone who \nserves faithfully and well in the defense of our Nation, faces a \nfunding crisis that threatens the quality and continuity of the health \ncare that these men and women have come to depend upon. Veterans \nservice organizations and others knowledgeable about the needs of \nAmerica's veterans have pointed out that the fiscal year 2000 budget \nrequest for veterans health care is far below what is needed to meet \ndemand and to allow the Veterans Administration to respond to new \nrequirements levied by Congress. The budget resolution conference \nreport adopted by the Congress earlier this year made a commitment to \nprovide additional funds for veterans health care, but a budget \nresolution is a nonbinding document. Platitudes, good intentions, and \nfireworks do not pay doctor's bills. The funding caps passed by \nCongress have left the Appropriations Committee hamstrung, unable to \nprovide more funding for this and other worthy causes. But now, if \nadditional surpluses not associated with Social Security become \navailable, I believe that we should try hard to honor our commitment \nmade in the budget resolution, and honor our debt to the veterans who, \nin the spirit of those patriots of the Revolution, dared much, risked \nmuch, and sacrificed much that we might enjoy the blessings of freedom. \nThey treasure our country and honor it with their service and their \nblood. I feel certain that my colleagues share with me a commitment to \nour Nation's veterans that is stronger and deeper than any allegiance \nto an arbitrary budget figure or cap that is based on a very different \nset of economic assumptions.\n  Mr. President, I have been fortunate to have traveled across the \nglobe. I have seen many other lovely and ancient places, from Rome to \nCairo to London to Tokyo to Moscow to that great crossroads of east and \nwest that is Istanbul. I met warm and charming people in all these \nplaces and more. But, like Americans who will gather in far flung \noutposts around the globe next Monday to toast their homeland, and on \nSunday to fly that flag in front of our homes, I am always glad to come \nhome. No spot on earth calls to me like the mountains of my home, West \nVirginia, where the ground rises to meet my feet and the trees spread \ndappled umbrellas to shade me from the Sun; where glittering rivulets \nof clear, cold water flash like gems set in a verdant tapestry of \nferns; and where birdsongs chime the hours away. In a gentle eternal \nsymphony, raindrops hitting leaves provide the timpani and wind through \nthe tossing branches serves as strings. The woodwind notes of mourning \ndoves gently welcome the Sun each morning and whippoorwills pipe its \nsetting in the evening. It is music for the heart as well as for the \nears.\n  Nowhere are the people more dear to me than in West Virginia, where \nchurch doors are always ready to welcome the traveler and where in \ngrocery stores there are clerks who still greet me by name and ask \nabout my family. West Virginians are a proud people, proud of their \nheritage, proud of their home State. Wherever you may find them around \nthe world--and I have found them in Afghanistan, in India, all across \nthe globe--they are always proud to proclaim themselves Mountaineers.\n  I close with a favorite poem of mine by Henry van Dyke, ``America for \nMe'':\n     'Tis fine to see the Old World, and travel up and down\n     Among the famous palaces and cities of renown,\n     To admire the crumbly castles and the statues of the kings,--\n     But now I think I've had enough of antiquated things.\n\n     So it's home again, and home again, America for me!\n     My heart is turning home again, and there I long to be,\n     In the land of youth and freedom beyond the ocean bars,\n     Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of \n           stars.\n\n     Oh, London is a man's town, there's power in the air;\n     And Paris is a woman's town, with flowers in her hair;\n     And it's sweet to dream in Venice, and it's great to study in \n           Rome\n     But when it comes to living there is just no place like home.\n\n     I like the German fir-woods, in green battalions drilled;\n     I like the gardens of Versailles with flashing fountains \n           filled;\n     But, oh, to take your hand, my dear, and ramble for a day\n     In the friendly western woodland where Nature has her way!\n\n     I know that Europe's wonderful, yet something seems to lack:\n     The Past is too much with her, and the people looking back.\n     But the glory of the Present is to make the Future free,--\n     We love our land for what she is and what she is to be.\n\n     Oh, it's home again, and home again, America for me!\n     I want a ship that's westward bound to plough the rolling \n           sea,\n     To the blessed Land of Room Enough beyond the ocean bars,\n     Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of \n           stars.\n\n \n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}]
