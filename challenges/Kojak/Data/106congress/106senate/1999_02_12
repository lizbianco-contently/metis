Each of them is here by Your divine appointment. \nTogether they claim Your promise, ``Call upon Me in the day of trouble: \nI will deliver you.''--Ps.50:15. We call upon You on this day of \ntrouble in America as this impeachment trial comes to a close. You have \nenabled an honest, open debate of alternative solutions. Soon a vote \nwill be taken. You have established a spirit of unity in the midst of \ndifferences. Most important of all, we know that we can trust You with \nthe results. You can use what is decided and continue to accomplish \nYour plans for America. We entrust to Your care the President and his \nfamily. Use whatever is decided today to enable a deeper experience of \nYour grace in his life and healing in his family. We commit this day to \nYou and thank You for the hope that fills our hearts as we place our \ncomplete trust in You. You are our Lord and Saviour. Amen.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Sergeant at Arms will make the proclamation.\n  The Sergeant at Arms, James W. Ziglar, made proclamation as follows:\n\n       Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are commanded to \n     keep silent, on pain of imprisonment, while the Senate of the \n     United States is sitting for the trial of the articles of \n     impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives against \n     William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States.\n\n\n                              The Journal\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. If there is no objection, the Journal of \nproceedings of the trial are approved to date.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, later on today, the \nSecretary of the Senate will be putting at each Senator's desk \nsomething I think you will enjoy reading later. It is the prayers of \nthe Chaplain during the impeachment trial. Subsequently, we plan to put \nit in a small pamphlet, because they truly have been magnificent. We \nthought you each would like to have copies.\n  The Senate will resume final deliberations now in the closed session. \nThank goodness. At this point in the proceedings, there are \napproximately eight Members who still wish to speak or submit part of \ntheir speech into the Record.\n  Following those final speeches, the Senate will resume open session \nand proceed to the votes on the two articles of impeachment. I estimate \nthat those votes will begin at approximately 11, 11:30. However, the \nexact time will depend on the length of the remaining speeches, and \nalso we will have to have a few minutes to open the Chamber and the \ngalleries so that our constituents and our families can enter the \ngalleries if they would like to.\n  Following those votes, all Senators should remain at their desks as \nthe Senate proceeds to several housekeeping items relating to the \nadjournment of the Court of Impeachment. So again, I emphasize, please, \nafter the votes, don't rush out of the Chamber because we have some \nvery important proceedings to attend to, and I think you will enjoy \nthem if you will stay and participate.\n  Under the consent agreement reached last night, following those \nvotes, a motion relating to censure may be offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein. If offered, Senator Gramm will be \nrecognized to offer a motion relative to the Feinstein motion, with a \nvote to occur on the Gramm motion. Therefore, Senators may anticipate \nan additional vote or votes following the votes on the articles.\n  I thank the Senators. And I believe we are ready to proceed to the \nclosed session.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will there be intervening debate or no debate on any of \nthose votes?\n  Mr. LOTT. In the UC that was reached last night, I believe we have 2 \nhours, which will be equally divided, for Senators to submit statements \nat that point or to make speeches if they would like. So I presume--\nafter the votes, yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is the question. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I presume we will go on for a couple hours--2 or 3 o'clock \nin the afternoon, yes.\n\n\n Unanimous-Consent Agreement--Printing of Statements in the Record and \n         Printing of Senate Document of Impeachment Proceedings\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to clarify one other matter. Senators will \nrecall the motion approved February 9, 1999, which permitted each \nSenator to place in the Congressional Record his or her own statements \nmade during final deliberations in closed session.\n  I ask unanimous consent that public statements made by Senators \nsubsequent to the approval of that motion, with respect to his or her \nown statements made during the closed session, be deemed to be in \ncompliance with the Senate rules. This would permit a Senator to \nrelease to the public his or her\n\n[[Page S1458]]\n\nstatement made during final deliberations in closed session, except \nthat, in doing so, a Senator may not disclose any remarks of the other \nSenators made during deliberations, without the prior consent, of \ncourse, of that Senator.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that Senators have until Tuesday, \nFebruary 23, 1999--that would be the Tuesday after we come back--to \nhave printed statements and opinions in the Congressional Record, if \nthey choose, explaining their votes.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the Secretary be authorized to \ninclude these statements, along with the full record of the Senate's \nproceedings, the filings by the parties, and the supplemental materials \nadmitted into evidence by the Senate, in a Senate document printed \nunder the supervision of the Secretary of the Senate, that will \ncomplete the documentation of the Senate's handling of these \nimpeachment proceedings.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. Leader, point of clarification. I had a couple of \nMembers ask, does it take an affirmative act of a Senator to get their \nspeech placed in the Record or does it happen automatically?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe it does take an affirmative act. It is not \nautomatic.\n  Mr. REID. To whom should that be given?\n  Mr. LOTT. It should be given to the clerks at the desk, or to Marty \non your side, or your secretary of the minority, or the secretary of \nthe majority. They will get it into the Record at the right place.\n  So I believe, once again, we are ready to go to our closed session.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It does not require each person to ask unanimous \nconsent to insert their remarks, just giving it?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes. That has already been cleared.\n  I believe we have a unanimous consent request propounded.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate will now go into closed session to complete its \ndeliberations on the articles of impeachment. The Sergeant at Arms is \ndirected to clear the galleries and close the doors of the Senate \nChamber.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n\n                             Closed Session\n\n  (At 9:44 a.m., the doors of the Chamber were closed. The proceedings \nof the Senate were held in closed session until 12:04 p.m., at which \ntime the following occurred.)\n\n\n                              Open Session\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Will Senators return to their desks? Managers, thank you \nfor joining us. Would Senators stand, and the gallery, as the Chief \nJustice enters the Chamber, please.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, the Senate has \nmet almost exclusively as a Court of Impeachment since January 7, 1999, \nto consider the articles of impeachment against the President of the \nUnited States. The Senate meets today to conclude this trial by voting \non the articles of impeachment, thereby, fulfilling its obligation \nunder the Constitution. I believe we are ready to proceed to the votes \non the articles. And I yield the floor.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair would inform those in attendance in the \nSenate galleries, that under rule XIX of the Standing Rules of the \nSenate, demonstrations of approval or disapproval are prohibited, and \nit is the duty of the Chair to enforce order on its own initiative.\n\n\n                               Article I\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will now read the first Article of \nimpeachment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                               Article I\n\n       In his conduct while President of the United States, \n     William Jefferson Clinton, in violation of his constitutional \n     oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the \n     United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, \n     protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, \n     and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that \n     the laws be faithfully executed, has willfully corrupted and \n     manipulated the judicial process of the United States for his \n     personal gain and exoneration, impeding the administration of \n     justice, in that:\n       On August 17, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton swore to tell \n     the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth before \n     a Federal grand jury of the United States. Contrary to that \n     oath, William Jefferson Clinton willfully provided \n     perjurious, false and misleading testimony to the grand jury \n     concerning one or more of the following: (1) the nature and \n     details of his relationship with a subordinate Government \n     employee; (2) prior perjurious, false and misleading \n     testimony he gave in a Federal civil rights action brought \n     against him; (3) prior false and misleading statements he \n     allowed his attorney to make to a Federal judge in that civil \n     rights action; and (4) his corrupt efforts to influence the \n     testimony of witnesses and to impede the discovery of \n     evidence in that civil rights action.\n       In doing this, William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the \n     integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the \n     Presidency, has betrayed his trust as President, and has \n     acted in a manner subversive of the rule of law and justice, \n     to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\n       Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, \n     warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office and \n     disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, \n     trust, or profit under the United States.\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair reminds the Senate that each Senator, \nwhen his or her name is called, will stand in his or her place and vote \n``guilty'' or ``not guilty'' as required by rule XXIII of the Senate \nrules on impeachment.\n  The Chair also refers to article I, section 3, clause 6, of the \nConstitution regarding the vote required for conviction on impeachment. \nQuote: ``[N]o Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two-\nthirds of the Members present.''\n\n\n                           Vote On Article I\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is on the first article of \nimpeachment. Senators, how say you? Is the respondent, William \nJefferson Clinton, guilty or not guilty? A rollcall vote is required.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n                                \n\n                         [Rollcall Vote No. 17]\n\n[Subject: Article I--Articles of Impeachment Against President William \n                           Jefferson Clinton]\n\n                               GUILTY--45\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n\n                             NOT GUILTY--55\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. On this article of impeachment, 45 Senators having \npronounced William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, \nguilty as charged, 55 Senators having pronounced him not guilty, two-\nthirds of the Senators present not having pronounced him guilty, the \nSenate adjudges that the respondent, William Jefferson Clinton, \nPresident of the United States, is not guilty as charged in the first \narticle of impeachment.\n\n\n                               Article II\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will read the second article of \nimpeachment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                               Article II\n\n       In his conduct while President of the United States, \n     William Jefferson Clinton, in violation of his constitutional \n     oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the \n     United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, \n     protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, \n     and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that \n     the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented,\n\n[[Page S1459]]\n\n     obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice, and \n     has to that end engaged personally, and through his \n     subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or scheme \n     designed to delay, impede, cover up, and conceal the \n     existence of evidence and testimony related to a Federal \n     civil rights action brought against him in a duly instituted \n     judicial proceeding.\n       The means used to implement this course of conduct or \n     scheme included one or more of the following acts:\n       (1) On or about December 17, 1997, William Jefferson \n     Clinton corruptly encouraged a witness in a Federal civil \n     rights action brought against him to execute a sworn \n     affidavit in that proceeding that he knew to be perjurious, \n     false and misleading.\n       (2) On or about December 17, 1997, William Jefferson \n     Clinton corruptly encouraged a witness in a Federal civil \n     rights action brought against him to give perjurious, false \n     and misleading testimony if and when called to testify \n     personally in that proceeding.\n       (3) On or about December 28, 1997, William Jefferson \n     Clinton corruptly engaged in, encouraged, or supported a \n     scheme to conceal evidence that had been subpoenaed in a \n     Federal civil rights action brought against him.\n       (4) Beginning on or about December 7, 1997, and continuing \n     through and including January 14, 1998, William Jefferson \n     Clinton intensified and succeeded in an effort to secure job \n     assistance to a witness in a Federal civil rights action \n     brought against him in order to corruptly prevent the \n     truthful testimony of that witness in that proceeding at a \n     time when the truthful testimony of that witness would have \n     been harmful to him.\n       (5) On January 17, 1998, at his deposition in a Federal \n     civil rights action brought against him, William Jefferson \n     Clinton corruptly allowed his attorney to make false and \n     misleading statements to a Federal judge characterizing an \n     affidavit, in order to prevent questioning deemed relevant by \n     the judge. Such false and misleading statements were \n     subsequently acknowledged by his attorney in a communication \n     to that judge.\n       (6) On or about January 18 and January 20-21, 1998, William \n     Jefferson Clinton related a false and misleading account of \n     events relevant to a Federal civil rights action brought \n     against him to a potential witness in that proceeding, in \n     order to corruptly influence the testimony of that witness.\n       (7) On or about January 21, 23, and 26, 1998, William \n     Jefferson Clinton made false and misleading statements to \n     potential witnesses in a Federal grand jury proceeding in \n     order to corruptly influence the testimony of those \n     witnesses. The false and misleading statements made by \n     William Jefferson Clinton were repeated by the witnesses to \n     the grand jury, causing the grand jury to receive false and \n     misleading information.\n       In all of this, William Jefferson Clinton has undermined \n     the integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the \n     Presidency, has betrayed his trust as President, and has \n     acted in a manner subversive of the rule of law and justice, \n     to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\n       Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, \n     warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office and \n     disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, \n     trust, or profit under the United States.\n\n\n                           Vote on Article II\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE.

Without objection, the order will be entered.\n\n\nSTATEMENT BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES ON THE SENATE TRIAL\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair wishes to make a brief statement, \nwithout objection on such. (Laughter.)\n  More than a month ago, I first came here to preside over the Senate \nsitting as the Court of Impeachment. I was a stranger to the great \nmajority of you. I underwent the sort of culture shock that naturally \noccurs when one moves from the very structured environment of the \nSupreme Court to what I shall call, for want of a better phrase, the \nmore free-form environment of the Senate. (Laughter.)\n  I leave you now a wiser but not a sadder man. I have been impressed \nby the manner in which the majority leader and the minority leader have \nagreed on procedural rules in spite of the differences that separate \ntheir two parties on matters of substance.\n\n  I have been impressed by the quality of the debate in closed session \non the entire question of impeachment as provided for under the \nConstitution. Agreed-upon procedures for erring on substantive \ndivisions must be the hallmark of any great deliberative body.\n  Our work as a Court of Impeachment is now done. I leave you with the \nhope that our several paths may cross again under happier \ncircumstances.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, we thank you for your comments.\n\n\n   EXPRESSION OF GRATITUDE TO THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I send a resolution to the desk.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will read the resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 37) to express gratitude for the \n     service of the Chief Justice of the United States as \n     Presiding Officer during the impeachment trial.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 37 introduced earlier \ntoday by Senator Lott and Senator Daschle.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements that Senators wish to make on this resolution \nbe printed at this point in the Record.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 37) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 37\n\n       Whereas Article I, section 3, clause 6 of the Constitution \n     of the United States provides\n\n[[Page S1460]]\n\n     that, when the President of the United States is tried on \n     articles of impeachment, the Chief Justice of the United \n     States shall preside over the Senate;\n       Whereas, pursuant to Rule IV of the Rules of Procedure and \n     Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials, on \n     January 6, 1999, the Senate notified William H. Rehnquist, \n     Chief Justice of the United States, of the time and place \n     fixed for consideration of the articles of impeachment \n     against William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United \n     States, and requested him to attend;\n       Whereas, in the intervening days since January 7, 1999, \n     Chief Justice Rehnquist has presided over the Senate, when \n     sitting on the trial of the articles of impeachment, for long \n     hours over many days;\n       Whereas Chief Justice Rehnquist, in presiding over the \n     Senate, has exhibited extraordinary qualities of fairness, \n     patience, equanimity, and wisdom;\n       Whereas, by his manner of presiding over the Senate, Chief \n     Justice Rehnquist has contributed greatly to the Senate's \n     conduct of fair, impartial, and dignified proceedings in the \n     trial of the articles of impeachment;\n       Whereas the Senate and the Nation are indebted to Chief \n     Justice Rehnquist for his distinguished and valued service in \n     fulfilling his constitutional duty to preside over the Senate \n     in the trial of the articles of impeachment: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate expresses its profound gratitude \n     to William H. Rehnquist, Chief Justice of the United States, \n     for his distinguished service in presiding over the Senate, \n     while sitting on the trial of the articles of impeachment \n     against William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United \n     States.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary shall notify the Chief Justice of the \n     United States of this resolution.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of myself and the entire U.S. \nSenate, we want to offer you our thanks and the gratitude of the \nAmerican people for your service to the Nation and throughout this \nImpeachment Court and to this institution.\n  As our Presiding Officer during most of the last 5 weeks, you have \nbrought to our proceedings a gentle dignity and an unfailing sense of \npurpose, and sometimes sense of humor.\n  The majority leader realized when it was time to take a break and not \nto take a break when the Chief Justice said let's go forward.\n  By placing duty above personal convenience and many other \nconsiderations, you have taught a lesson in leadership. Your presence \nin the chair of the President of the Senate, following the directives \nof our Constitution, gave comity to this Chamber and assurance to the \nNation. I would like to close with our traditional Mississippi parting: \nY'all come back soon. But I hope that is not taken the wrong way, and \nnot for an occasion like this one.\n  So instead, as you return to your work on the Court in the great \nmarble temple of the law right across the lawn from this Capitol, we \nsalute you, sir, with renewed appreciation and esteem for a good friend \nand good neighbor.\n\n\n                 Presentation of the Golden Gavel Award\n\n  Now, Mr. Chief Justice, if the Democratic leader will join me, we \nhave a small token of our appreciation. We have a tradition in the \nSenate that after you have presided over the Senate for 100 hours, we \npresent you with the Golden Gavel Award. I am not sure it quite reached \n100 hours, but it is close enough.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. It seemed like it.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to add my thanks to the Chief \nJustice for his untiring efforts throughout the impeachment trial and \nto commend him for his dignity, fairness, and humor.\n  Mr. KYL. I add my expression of appreciation to the Chief Justice and \nthe officers of the court who had a role in this proceeding--the House \nmanagers, the counsel for the White House, and Independent Counsel \nKenneth Starr--for their honorable service.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the \nFebruary 5, 1999, affidavit of Mr. Christopher Hitchens; the February \n7, 1999, affidavit of Ms. Carol Blue; and the affidavit of Mr. R. Scott \nArmstrong be admitted into evidence in this proceeding and the full \nwritten transcripts of the depositions taken pursuant to S. Res. 30 be \nincluded in the public record of the trial. This matter has been \ncleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Adjournment Sine Die of the Court of Impeachment\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Now, Mr. Chief Justice, I move that the Senate, sitting as \na Court of Impeachment on the articles exhibited against William \nJefferson Clinton, adjourn sine die.\n  The motion was agreed to, and at 12:43 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a \nCourt of Impeachment, adjourned sine die.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1457-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n\n                     Escorting of the Chief Justice\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, the debate we will be having in the \nSenate is on whether to suspend the rules of the Senate to consider a \nresolution censuring the President's conduct.\n  A motion will be made to indefinitely postpone the motion to suspend \nthe rules. These votes will occur before Senators have the opportunity \nto amend the resolution censuring the President's conduct.\n  I take the floor of the Senate to make clear that I am opposed to a \ncensure resolution of President Clinton.\n  The Impeachment Trial of President William Jefferson Clinton is over. \nThe Senate has faithfully discharged its constitutional obligation by \nserving as impartial jurors of the Articles of Impeachment approved by \na bipartisan majority of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  The Senate has rendered its verdict, and has found the President not \nguilty as charged. The consequence of this action by the Senate is to \nkeep the President in office where he is to fully and faithfully \ndischarge the constitutional duties of his office.\n  The trial is over. It is time for the Senate to focus on the national \nlegislative agenda.\n  On this last point, I chose my words carefully. I did not say it is \ntime for the Senate to turn to the people's business.\n  Some have said we should not have had the trial or should have \nadjourned the trial much earlier so that we could turn to the people's \nbusiness.\n  I reject that notion. I firmly believe that conducting the trial was \ndoing the people's business.\n  But the truth is the trial is over. I do not see any place for the \npending resolution censuring the President. It is not the business of \nthe Senate to punish President Clinton.\n  As Senator Byrd has concluded censure, unlike impeachment, is \n``extra-constitutional.'' The Constitution empowers the Senate to try a \nPresident impeached by the House and remove him if 67 Senators agree.\n  The Constitution does not empower the Senate to punish a President, \nin the absence of 67 votes to remove. The impeachment trial is over.\n  The Senate should move on and leave President Clinton alone.\n  The Constitution recognizes that if a President cannot be removed \nthrough impeachment, he should not be weakened by censure. Although the \nSenate passes sense of the Senate resolutions on many subjects, censure \nis different because the Constitution requires a \\2/3\\ vote before the \nSenate can discipline the President and requires removal upon \nconviction for impeachable offenses. Censure is an effort to end-run \nthese constitutional requirements.\n  One final problem is that any censure resolution will have to be \nweak. Even proponents of censure concede that a censure resolution that \nactually punished the President would be an unconstitutional bill of \nattainder. Any censure that is consistent with the Bill of Attainder \nClause is too weak to be worth doing.\n  The highest form of censure the Constitution allows is impeachment by \nthe House. The failure to convict the President will not erase that \naction by the House. It is time for the Senate to move on.\n  If the effort to suspend the rules passes, and the text of the \ncensure resolution is before the Senate, and is amendable, I will seek \nrecognition to offer the following substitute, and I quote:\n  After the word ``Resolved'' strike everything and insert the \nfollowing:\n\n       ``That the United States Senate at the earliest opportunity \n     will consider and have final votes on legislation favorably \n     reported by its committees that--\n       (1) reduces taxes so that Americans no longer pay record \n     high levels of federal income taxes;\n       (2) prohibits the financial surplus in the Social Security \n     Trust Funds from financing additional deficit spending in the \n     operating budget of the United States Government;\n       (3) increases funds and flexibility for programs that local \n     school districts and their parents, teachers and principals \n     believe will enhance teaching and learning;\n       (4) offers comprehensive responses to juvenile justice \n     needs and criminal drug abuse, including increased penalties \n     for adults who use minors in the commission of crimes, \n     increased penalties for drug trafficking, and greater \n     resources for local law enforcement agencies to stop \n     methamphetamine trafficking.\n       (5) improves military pay to reduce sharp declines in \n     attracting new and keeping well-qualified solders in the all-\n     volunteer Armed Forces.''\n\n  This substitute resolution speaks for itself. This resolution sets \nthe Senate on the right course for the Senate to accomplish the \nlegislative priorities of this nation.\n  These priorities include:\n  Congress this year should direct the budget surplus to where it \nbelongs, and that is to the people whose hard work produced the \nsurplus.\n  That means Congress should cut taxes. Americans should no longer pay \nrecord high levels of federal income taxes.\n  The average household paid 25 percent of its income in taxes \n(federal, state, and local) and 30 percent of every additional dollar \nearned by a four-person median income household of $55,000 will go to \npay taxes.\n  The typical American family spends more money on taxes than on food, \nclothing, and shelter combined. Each year Americans work four months \nand 10 days just to pay their taxes. The tax burden is getting worse, \nnot better. For the past five years, tax payments have grown faster \nthan salaries. Total federal taxes in 1997 were the highest since World \nWar II.\n\n  Second, Congress should protect Social Security.\n  The best action we can take now to protect the economic security of \ntomorrow's retirees is to protect current surpluses from government \nraiding.\n  Using these surpluses to pay down our debt will put our country in \nthe best possible financial position to meet our future obligations.\n  Third, we should improve education by increasing funds and \nflexibility for programs that local school districts and their parents, \nteachers and principals believe will enhance teaching and learning.\n  The Department of Education requires over 48.6 million hours worth of \npaperwork to receive federal dollars. This bureaucratic maze takes up \nto 35% of every federal education dollar.\n  Local school districts could find far better uses of the $10-$12 \nbillion Washington spends. With direct funding, local schools could \ndeploy resources to areas they deem most crucial for their students, \nsuch as hiring new teachers, raising teacher salaries, buying new \ntextbooks or new computers\n  Fourth, Congress must fight crime and drug abuse.\n  While in the last few years the violent crime rate has declined, it \nremains at levels that are far too high. In 1960, 159 violent crimes \nper 100,000 inhabitants were reported; in 1997, 611 were reported. In \nshort, violent crime has quadrupled since 1960.\n  Drug abuse, especially use of methamphetamines, is also at dangerous \nlevels. Public health and law enforcement officials believe that meth \nis more dangerous and addictive than cocaine and heroin. Communities \nare being devastated and the problem is growing exponentially. In 1994, \nDEA agents in Missouri seized 14 clandestine meth labs. Last year, they \nseized 421 labs.\n  Meth use is dangerous, threatens our children and causes users to \ncommit other crimes. Among 12th graders, the use of ice, a smokeable \nform of meth, has risen 60 percent since 1992. Meth-related emergency \nroom incidents are up 63 percent over this same period.\n  Fifth, Congress should improve military pay to reduce sharp declines \nin attracting new and keeping well-qualified solders in the all-\nvolunteer Armed Forces.\n  1999 marks the 14th straight year of decline in real dollars spent on \nour national defense. The number of active duty personnel is down 30% \nsince 1991. Despite these reductions, the military is being asked to do \nmore than it did during the Cold War.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  In writing these principles, I strived for bipartisan agreement. I \nbelieve many, if not all of these, principles have been articulated as \npriorities on both sides of the aisle.\n  I did not include my own proposals for accomplishing these \nobjectives. The details of these principles can and should be worked \nout by the committees of the Senate, and then by the full Senate.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S1462]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the statement that I am placing in the \nrecord is the statement I would have given had I been permitted to \nspeak longer and in open session. During our closed deliberations, I \ngave a similar, but abridged statement.\n  For almost two years, the President of the United States was engaged \nin what he has come to describe as an ``inappropriate intimate'' \nrelationship with a young woman who came to his attention as a White \nHouse intern. He then lied about their relationship, publicly, \nprivately, formally, informally, to the press, to the country, and \nunder oath, for a period of about a year.\n  This course of conduct requires us to face four distinct questions.\n  First, we must determine if the material facts alleged in the \nArticles of Impeachment have been established to our satisfaction.\n  Second, do the established facts constitute either obstruction of \njustice or perjury, or both?\n  Third, are obstruction of justice and perjury high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors under the Constitution?\n  And, fourth, even if the acts of the president are high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors, are they of sufficient gravity to warrant his conviction \nif it allows of no alternative other than his removal from office?\n  The first article of impeachment alleges that the President committed \nperjury while testifying before the Starr grand jury. Although the \nHouse Managers assert that his testimony is replete with false \nstatements, it is clear, at the least, that his representations about \nthe nature and details of his relationship with Miss Lewinsky are \nliterally beyond belief.\n  From November 1995, until March 1997, the President engaged in \nrepeated sexual activities with Monica Lewinsky, who was first a \nvolunteer at and then an employee of the White House and eventually the \nPentagon. Though he denies directly few of her descriptions of those \nactivities, he testified under oath that he did not have ``sexual \nrelations'' with her. His accommodation of this paradox is based on the \nincredible claim that he did not touch Miss Lewinsky with any intent to \narouse or gratify anyone sexually, even though she performed oral sex \non him.\n  It seems to me strange that any rational person would conclude that \nthe President's description of his relationship with Miss Lewinsky did \nnot constitute perjury.\n  In addition, while we are not required to reach our decision on these \ncharges beyond a reasonable doubt, I have no reasonable doubt that the \nPresident committed perjury on a second such charge when he told the \ngrand jury that the purpose of the five statements he made to Mrs. \nCurrie after his Jones deposition was to refresh his own memory.\n  The President knew that each statement was a lie. His goal was to get \nMrs. Currie to concur in those lies.\n  The other allegations of perjury are either unproven--particularly \nthose requiring a strict incorporation of the president's Jones \ndeposition testimony into his grand jury testimony--or are more \nproperly considered solely--with those already discussed--as elements \nof the obstruction of justice charges in Article II.\n  To determine that the president perjured himself at least twice, \nhowever, is not to decide the ultimate question of guilt on Article I. \nThat I will discuss later.\n  All the material allegations of Article II seem to me to be well \nfounded. Four of them, however, those regarding the president's \nencouraging Miss Lewinsky to file a false affidavit and then to give \nfalse testimony, those regarding the president's failure to correct his \nattorney's false statements to the Jones court, and those bearing upon \nthe disposal of his gifts to her are not, in my mind, proven beyond a \nreasonable doubt. Again, I do not believe this standard to be required \nin impeachment trials, but because I believe that the other three \nfactual allegations of Article II do meet that standard, I adopt it for \nthe purposes of this discussion.\n  (1) From the time she was transferred to the Pentagon in April, 1996, \nMiss Lewinsky had pestered the president about returning to work at the \nWhite House, and, other than some vague referrals, until October 1, \n1997, the President had done nothing to make this\n\n[[Page S1463]]\n\nhappen and little to help her find another job.\n  On the first of October, 1997, the president was served with \ninterrogatories in the Jones case asking about his sexual relationships \nwith women other than his wife, and during the rest of October the \nPresident and his agents stepped up their efforts to find Miss Lewinsky \na job. Three weeks later, on October 21, the United States Ambassador \nto the United Nations, Bill Richardson, called Miss Lewinsky personally \nto schedule an interview in her apartment complex, though apparently he \ninterviewed no one else. Shortly after this unusual interview, the \nAmbassador created a new position in New York and offered it to Miss \nLewinsky.\n  What is perhaps most striking about the U.N. job is not even how \npromptly it materialized, nor that the United States Ambassador was so \npersonally involved in hiring a young woman with precious little job \nexperience, but that Ambassador Richardson held the specially crafted \nsinecure open for two months while the former intern kept him waiting \non her decision.\n  When Miss Lewinsky decided that she preferred the private sector, the \npresident enlisted the help one of his closest personal friends, one of \nthe most influential men in the United States, Vernon Jordan. Miss \nLewinsky met with Mr. Jordan in early November. Mr. Jordan, who was \nacting at the President's behest, apparently did not fully appreciate \nhow important it was for him to cater to Miss Lewinsky, and took no \naction for a month.\n  The President and Mr. Jordan realized, however, on December 5, 1997, \nthe importance of satisfying Miss Lewinsky 's fancy when her name \nappeared on the Jones witness list. Before that date, the President \nneeded Miss Lewinsky only to commit a lie of omission--simply to \nrefrain from making their relationship public. Her appearance on the \nwitness list now meant that she would have to lie under oath.\n  Fully appreciative of the higher stakes, the President redoubled his \nefforts and those of his agents to find Miss Lewinsky a job and keep \nher in his camp. In the weeks after Miss Lewinsky's name appeared on \nthe witness list, Mr. Jordan kept the President apprised of his efforts \nto find work for her in the private sector. He called his contacts at \nAmerican Express, Young & Rubicam, and MacAndrews & Forbes (Revlon's \nparent corporation). When Miss Lewinsky was subpoenaed on December 19, \n1997, to be deposed in the Jones case, Mr. Jordan oversaw the \npreparation of the affidavit that the President had suggested she file \nin lieu of testifying. On January 7, 1997, Miss Lewinsky signed the \naffidavit, which she later admitted was false, denying that she had a \n``sexual relationship'' with the President. On January 8, she \ninterviewed with MacAndrew & Forbes. When she told Mr. Jordan that she \nhad done poorly, he called the Chairman of the Board, Ronald Perelman, \nto recommend Miss Lewinsky, whom he commended as ``this bright young \ngirl, who I think is terrific.'' As a result of this conversation, Miss \nLewinsky was called back for another interview with MacAndrews the \nfollowing day and given an informal offer. On January 9, she reported \nthis to Mr. Jordan, who called Mrs. Currie with the message, ``mission \naccomplished'' and then called the President himself to share his \nsuccess.\n\n  The President's lawyers arranged for Miss Lewinsky's affidavit to be \nfiled on January 14, 1998. After this date, although Miss Lewinsky did \nnot end up with a job in the private sector, neither the President nor \nMr. Jordan, who so resolutely pursued their earlier mission, lifted a \nfinger to help the ``bright * * * terrific'' young woman. Why? Because \nshortly thereafter the fiction of the president's platonic relationship \nwith Lewinsky had exploded. Monica Lewinsky was the same Monica \nLewinsky, but she now could no longer protect the President.\n  It is impossible to reconcile the President's course of conduct with \nany purpose other than to preclude Miss Lewinsky's truthful testimony \nin the Jones case, or, indeed, to prevent her testifying at all. The \ncase for obstruction of justice is clear. Obstruction was the \nPresident's only motive.\n  (2) Next we have the Currie conversation--a set of statements by the \nPresident in the nominal form of questions, addressed by the President \nto Mrs. Currie on the Sunday evening following his Jones deposition \nwhen she was called to the White House at an extraordinary time and for \napparently a single purpose. We are all familiar now with the questions \nhe posed:\n  ``I was never really alone with Monica, right?''\n  ``You were always there when Monica was there, right?''\n  ``Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?''\n  ``You could see and hear everything, right?''\n  ``She wanted to have sex with me, and I cannot do that.''\n  Those five statements have a single common thread: the President knew \neach and every one of them to have been totally false.\n  Had Mrs. Currie been willing to confirm the President's suggestions, \nshe would have been a devastatingly effective witness for him.\n  There is no reasonable explanation of this incident other than it is \nthe President's clear attempt to obstruct justice, both in the Jones \ncase and in the subsequent grand jury investigation.\n  (3) The false self-serving statements by the President to senior \nmembers of his staff, to his cabinet, and to the American people just \nafter his affair became public present a somewhat different face. It is \nreasonably clear that, at the time at which they were made, the \nPresident's goal, at least in part, was to save face with his staff and \nput a less humiliating spin on the Lewinsky matter. At the same time, \ncoupled with his public statements, the President's assertions to his \nstaff were designed to influence their testimony at some future time \nand place and to enlist them in disguising his conduct. In fact, they \ndid obstruct the grand jury investigation. The President's manipulation \nof friendly witnesses to testify falsely, if unknowingly, extended for \nmonths until the DNA evidence shattered both his public and private \npositions.\n  The President's attempt to derail the Independent Counsel's inquiry--\nan inquiry the very purpose of which was to discover whether the \nPresident gave false testimony and tampered with witnesses--by lying to \nhis colleagues, his cabinet, his confidantes, the media, the American \npeople, and ultimately, the grand jury, is--beyond a reasonable doubt--\na wide-ranging and highly public obstruction of justice, deeply \ndamaging to the judicial fabric of the United States.\n  One final note: to the extent that there are unresolved questions of \nfact, almost every one of them could be resolved by truthful and \ncomplete testimony by the President himself. That is a course of action \nhe spectacularly avoided both in his Jones deposition and before the \nStarr grand jury. Now, he refuses to answer interrogatories from \nSenator Lott and refuses to appear at this trial to testify on his own \nbehalf.\n  Under the circumstances, is it not appropriate to infer that to tell \nthe truth would be to confirm all of the questionable charges against \nhim? I have not done so for the purposes of this argument, and have \nconsidered only those charges proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but the \npresident's silence allows the inference that every one of the factual \ncharges by the House managers is true.\n  With sufficient material facts alleged in the two Articles of \nImpeachment either essentially uncontested or established by \noverwhelming evidence, and with those facts clearly constituting both \nperjury and obstruction, we arrive at the third question before the \nSenate. Are perjury and obstruction of justice high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors under the impeachment clause of the Constitution?\n  This is the easiest of the four questions to answer. Perjury and \ncrimes less serious than obstruction of justice have always and \nproperly been considered high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n  In 1986 Judge Claiborne was convicted by the Senate and removed from \noffice for filing a false income tax return under penalties of perjury. \nBy a vote of 90 to 7, the Senate rejected his argument that he should \nnot be convicted because filing a false return was irrelevant to his \nperformance as a judge. In 1989, Judge Nixon was convicted by the \nSenate and removed from office for perjury: in fact, for lying under \noath to a grand jury. And in that same year, Judge Hastings was \nconvicted of lying under oath and removed\n\n[[Page S1464]]\n\nby the Senate even though he had already been acquitted in a criminal \ntrial. (It is generally recognized that an act need not be criminal in \norder to be impeachable.) As these examples illustrate, perjury is and \nhistorically has been a sufficient cause for conviction and removal. \nAlthough no person has been convicted and removed for obstruction of \njustice, the nature and gravity of this crime, punished more harshly \nunder our laws than bribery, clearly is also a sufficient cause for \nconviction and removal.\n  Most of the Senate's precedents, of course, are based on the \nimpeachment trials of judges. President Clinton argues that those \nprecedents should not apply; that presidents, who hold the highest \noffice in the land, should benefit from a lower standard for removal \nthan the judges they appoint and the military officers they command. \nThis President would have presidents remain in office for acts that \nhave resulted in the dismissal of military officers under his command, \nin the removal of judges, and for acts that would have resulted in the \nremoval of Senators like Bob Packwood, who, like the President, are \npopularly elected for a fixed term. As House Manager Canady has pointed \nout, the 1974 report by the staff of the Nixon impeachment inquiry \nconcluded that the constitutional provision stating that judges would \nhold office during ``good Behaviour,'' does not limit the relevance of \njudges' impeachments with respect to standards for presidential \nimpeachments. The President's argument that he should be held to a \nlower standard than judges, military officers and Senators has no basis \nin the Constitution, in precedent, in equity, or in common sense.\n  The fourth and ultimate question, nevertheless, is considerably more \ndifficult to answer. For me, the proof of material facts supporting \nsome of the allegations is overwhelming, the proposition that the \nestablished facts of the President's conduct constitute perjury and \nobstruction of justice almost impossible to deny, and the conclusion \nthat perjury and obstruction of justice are high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors a given.\n  But the inevitable result of a guilty verdict in this trial is the \nPresident's removal from office, and I believe that reasonable minds \ncan differ on whether or not that consequence is appropriate. So does \nat least one of the House Managers. In answering the question of \nwhether removal is too drastic a remedy for these alleged acts of \nperjury and obstruction of justice, Lindsey Graham, one of the most \nthoughtful Managers, stated that great minds may not necessarily agree \non the question of whether, for the good of the nation, one should or \nshould not remove this President for these high crimes. Removal, he \nsaid, is the equivalent of the political death penalty, and the death \npenalty is not imposed for every felony. Considerations such as \nrepentance and the impact of removal on society should also be \nconsidered. (Mr. Graham's view was not , incidentally, that reasonable \nminds could differ on any of the first three questions that I have \noutlined, but only on the ultimate question of removal.)\n\n  While removal upon conviction has not always been considered \ninevitable, I agree that Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution \nrequires a mandatory sentence of removal upon conviction of high Crimes \nand Misdemeanors. Nevertheless, a number of thoughtful commentators, \nand at least a few members of this Senate, have already decided that \nremoval is too drastic a sanction. These commentators and members--who \nare convinced, perhaps, that the President committed perjury and \nobstruction of justice, which, as classes of crime, are high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors--may nevertheless vote not to convict because they believe \nthat removal from office is unwarranted for this perjury and this \nobstruction of justice.\n  I share that conclusion with respect to Article I, but not Article \nII.\n  On Article I I have decided, with some regret, that the instances of \nperjury I believe were established beyond a reasonable doubt are \noffenses insufficient for removing the President from office--based on \nthe gravity of the offenses as against the drastic nature of removal. \nEqually important is the fact that these instances of perjury are also \nelements of the obstruction of justice charges in Article II. One \nconviction for the same acts of perjury is enough.\n  Nevertheless, I am convinced that one other reflection must precede a \ndecision based on the belief that removal is disproportionate to the \ngravity of the offenses established here, and that is: what are the \nconsequences of a not guilty finding by the Senate? The consequences \nare, of course, no sanction whatsoever.\n  It is precisely because the absence of any sanction is so \nobjectionable to those who choke over removal that there has been such \na spirited search for a third way. But, fellow Senators, there is no \nthird way. There is no third way.\n  Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution states: ``Judgment in Cases \nof Impeachment shall extend no further than to removal from Office, and \ndisqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or \nProfit under the United States * * *.''\n  The drafters did not intend to allow Congress to choose among a range \nof punishments analogous to those available to the judiciary, and for \nthis reason they specified that the impeached party was to remain \nsubject to judicial process and specifically limited to two--removal \nand disqualification--the sanctions that Congress could apply.\n  We must, I believe, by reason of this harsh choice consciously forced \non us at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, weigh seriously the \neffect on the Republic of either of our two possible courses of action. \nWill the Republic be strengthened, or will it be weakened, by \ndetermining that a president shall remain in its most exalted office \nafter perjuring himself and obstructing the pursuit of justice both of \na private citizen and of a federal grand jury, in a case occasioned by \nthe president's sexual activities? Will the Republic be strengthened or \nweakened by removing the President from office by an impeachment \nconviction for this perjury and this obstruction?\n  Early in our history an incident involving one of the authors of the \nConstitution, Alexander Hamilton, shows clearly the bright line \nbetween, on the one hand, a private sexual scandal, and on the other, a \npublic obligation--a line the president has intentionally crossed.\n  In No. 65 of the Federalist Papers, Mr. Hamilton described \nimpeachable offenses as ``those offences which proceed from the \nmisconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or \nviolation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with \npeculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to \ninjuries done immediately to the society itself.'' The president's \ndefenders place great reliance on this explanation.\n  Within four years of the composition of this essay, Mr. Hamilton had \nan opportunity to reflect on his own words. In the summer of 1791, \nHamilton, then the Secretary of the Treasury, had an adulterous affair \nwith a Maria Reynolds. Her husband discovered the affair and demanded a \njob in the Treasury Department. Though Secretary Hamilton turned him \ndown, he did pay blackmail from his personal funds.\n  A year later, three Congressmen, all politically opposed to Hamilton, \nlearned of the payments, suspected that they might involve Treasury \nfunds, and confronted Hamilton. Despite the tremendous political \nadvantage the story, which eventually leaked, offered them, he \nimmediately and without hesitation told them the truth and nothing but \nthe truth.\n  The author of Federalist No. 65 knew very well the distinction \nbetween a private scandal and the profound embarrassment arising out of \nits publication--and the violation of a public duty in an attempt to \navoid that embarrassment. He chose not to use his Treasury position in \na way that would justify an impeachment. The personal cost was immense \nand he assumed it without blinking.\n  President Clinton could hardly have chosen a more different course of \naction. He chose to violate both his oath of office and his oath as a \nwitness, using his office, his staff and his position to try to avoid \npersonal embarrassment. In any event even the personal consequences for \nhim have been far worse than those visited upon Alexander Hamilton. But \nit is our duty to determine whether he merits a drastic public \nsanction--or none at all.\n\n[[Page S1465]]\n\n  Some will say that the President can be charged with crimes related \nto this affair after his term of office is over.\n  First, such charges lie outside our jurisdiction or duty.\n  Second, such charges seem to me to be unlikely if we acquit the \nPresident, or in any event.\n  But third, and most important, let us assume that President Clinton \nis charged, convicted, and sentenced in 2001. What a devastating \njudgment on the Senate of the United States that would be! We ourselves \nwould be convicted, by history and forever, of having permitted a felon \nwho abused his office in committing his felonies to remain in office as \nPresident of the United States for two long years.\n  I simply cannot imagine any Senator willing to carry that burden of \nconscience.\n  No, we must choose between the sanction of removal and no sanction at \nall. We know how Alexander Hamilton would vote today on our question. \nWe know how James Madison, one of Hamilton's interrogators and the \ncareful author of the impeachment provision, would have voted. And \nmerely to call up the name of George Washington is to answer the \nquestion of how he would vote.\n  The Republic will not be weakened if we convict. The policies of the \npresidency will not change. The Administration will not change.\n  But if we acquit; if we say that some perjuries, some obstructions of \njustice, some clear and conscious violations of a formal oath are free \nfrom our sanction, the Republic and its institutions will be weakened. \nOne exception or excuse will lead to another, the right of the most \npowerful of our leaders to act outside the law--or in violation of the \nlaw--will be established. Our republican institutions will be seriously \nundermined. They have been undermined already, and the damage accrues \nto all equally--Republicans, Democrats, liberals, and conservatives.\n  If there is one thing this President can be relied on to do, it is to \nput his interests before those of his office and of the Republic. \nPresident Clinton has debased the presidency now and, if he is allowed \nto remain in office, the low level to which he has brought the \npresidency will continue, and that is not tolerable.\n  I cannot will to my children and grandchildren the proposition that a \npresident stands above the law and can systematically obstruct justice \nsimply because both his polls and the Dow Jones index are high.\n  Our duty in this case is as unpleasant as it was unsought. But our \nduty is clear. It was imposed on us, by history, without equivocation, \n212 years ago. It requires us to convict the President of Article II of \nthese Articles of Impeachment. And that is how I vote, with clear \nconscience and saddened heart.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. Chief Justice, my colleagues, like many others, the \nday the President wagged his finger at the American people and \nindicated he had not been involved with Ms. Lewinsky, I had the sense \nthat he wasn't telling the truth and I felt some genuine regret. The \nPresident and I began here in Washington in the same month, in 1993. I \nhad high hopes and actually felt very close to what he was trying to \naccomplish. So all along in this process, I have had to fight an urge \nto personalize that regret in a way that would affect my ability to do \nmy job in this impeachment trial. And I will tell you that taking that \nseparate oath helped me get into the mindset necessary to do that task.\n  But let me say that I do regret that the President's public conduct--\nnot his private conduct--has brought us to this day.\n  But we are here, and I want to take a minute to praise my colleagues \non the process. I think it would have been unfortunate had we not had \nany witness testimony--at least in the form of deposition testimony. I \nthink it would have been an unfortunate historical precedent. I found \nthe video testimony helpful. I didn't enjoy it, but I found it helpful \nin clarifying some of the things that I was thinking about. So I am \nglad, on balance, that we did not dismiss the case at the time it was \nfirst suggested.\n  But as we get to the final stage and get immersed in the law and \nfacts of this case, it is too easy to forget the most salient fact \nabout this entire matter, and that is one simple fact that many others \nhave mentioned: In November 1996, 47 million Americans voted to reelect \nPresident Clinton. The people hired him. They are the hiring authority. \nAn impeachment is a radical undoing of that authority. The people hire \nand somehow, under this process, the Congress can fire. So, I caution \nagainst, with all due respect to the excellent arguments made, the \nattempt to analogize this to an employee-employer relationship, or a \nmilitary situation, or even the situation of judges--those situations \nare all clearly different. Along with the choice of the Vice President, \nin no other case, do the American people choose one person, and in no \nother case can a completely different authority undo that choice.\n  Having said that, the Presidential conduct in this case, in my view, \ndoes come perilously close to justifying that extreme remedy. There \nreally have been three Presidential impeachments in our Nation's \nhistory. I see this one as being in the middle. The Andrew Johnson case \nis usually considered by historians to have been a relatively weak \ncase. President Johnson had a different interpretation of the \nconstitutionality of the statute that he believed allowed him to remove \nthe Secretary of War, Mr. Stanton. He was not convicted, and \nsubsequently the U.S. Supreme Court, I believe, ruled that in fact that \nwas constitutional. I see that as having been a relatively weak case.\n  The case of Richard Nixon, in my view, was a pretty strong case, \ninvolving a 1972 Presidential election and attempts to get involved \nwith the aspects of that election--frankly--an attempt to cover up what \nhappened during that 1972 election. I think that had more to do with \ncore meaning of ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''\n  This is a closer case; this is a close case. In that sense, it may be \nthe most important of the three Presidential impeachments, in terms of \nthe law of impeachment, as we go into the future. I agree neither with \nthe House managers who say their evidence is ``overwhelming,'' nor with \nthe President's counsel who says the evidence against the President is \n``nonexistent.'' The fact is, this is a hard case, and sometimes they \nsay that hard cases make bad law. But we cannot afford to have this be \nbad law for the Nation's sake.\n  So how do we decide? There have been a lot of helpful suggestions, \nbut one thing that has been important to me is the way the House \npresented their case. That doesn't bind us, but they did suggest that \ntwo Federal statutes had been violated. Mr. Manager McCollum said that, \n``You must first determine if a Federal crime has occurred.'' Many \nothers have said that. I will reiterate a point. If that is the \napproach you want to take, then it is clear, in my view as one Senator, \nthat you must prove that beyond a reasonable doubt. Otherwise, you are \nusing the power and the opprobrium of the Federal criminal law as a \nsword but refusing to let the President and the defense counsel have \nthe shield of the burden of proof that is required in the criminal law.\n  I do not have time to discuss the perjury count this afternoon, but \nwill do so in a longer presentation for the Record. Suffice it to say I \ndo not believe the managers have met their burden of proving perjury \nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n  As to obstruction of justice, the President did come perilously \nclose. Three quick observations make me conclude that, in fact, he did \nnot commit obstruction of justice beyond a reasonable doubt. First, I \nam very concerned about the conversations between the President and \nBetty Currie concerning the specifics of his relationship with Ms. \nLewinsky. But the critical question there is intent. Was his intent \nabout avoiding discovery by his family and the political problems \ninvolved? Or was the core issue trying to avoid the Jones proceeding \nand the consequences of that?\n  I don't think it has been shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the \nJones proceeding was the President's concern. Perhaps Ms. Currie could \nhave shed some light on this. That is why I was extremely puzzled when \nthe House managers didn't call Betty Currie. Let me be the first to say \nthat I don't think in this instance the House managers ``wanted to win \ntoo badly.'' I don't think they wanted to win badly enough to take the \nchance of calling Betty Currie, a crucial witness.\n\n[[Page S1466]]\n\n  I was very concerned about the false affidavit until I saw Ms. \nLewinsky's Senate deposition testimony. I am persuaded that you cannot \nsay beyond a reasonable doubt that she was urged by the President to \nmake a false statement in that affidavit.\n  Finally, I was very concerned about the hiding of the gifts. And \nmaybe every one will disagree with me on this. But when I watched her \ntestimony, I thought Ms. Lewinsky was the most indefinite about whether \nor not she had gotten that call from Ms. Currie than any other part of \nher testimony. I happen to believe that Ms. Lewinsky was the one who \nwas the most concerned about the gifts. And I believe a showing beyond \na reasonable doubt has not been made that the President masterminded \nthe hiding of the gifts.\n  So I cannot deny what Representative Graham said: If you call \nsomebody up at 2:30 in the morning you are probably up to no good. But \nif you call somebody up at 2:30 in the morning you have not necessarily \naccomplished the crime of obstruction of justice.\n  I realize there is a separate question of whether these same acts by \nthe President, apart from the Federal criminal law, constitute high \ncrimes and misdemeanors. I do not. I will discuss that in more detail \nin a future statement in the Record.\n  But I would like to conclude by just talking a little bit about this \nimpeachment issue in the modern context. When I say that the vote in \n1996 is the primary issue, I don't just mean that in terms of the \nrights of people. I mean it in terms of the goal of the Founding \nFathers, and our goal today; that is, political stability in this \ncountry. We don't want a parliamentary system. And we don't want an \noverly partisan system.\n  I see the 4-year term as a unifying force of our Nation. Yet, this is \nthe second time in my adult lifetime that we have had serious \nimpeachment proceedings, and I am only 45 years old. This only occurred \nonce in the entire 200 years prior to this time. Is this a fluke? Is it \nthat we just happened to have had two ``bad men'' as Presidents? I \ndoubt it. How will we feel if sometime in the next 10 years a third \nimpeachment proceeding occurs in this country so we will have had three \nwithin 40 years?\n  I see a danger in this in an increasingly diverse country. I see a \ndanger in this in an increasingly divided country. And I see a danger \nin this when the final argument of the House manager is that this is a \nchapter in an ongoing ``culture war'' in this Nation. That troubles me. \nI hope that is not where we are and hope that is not where we are \nheading.\n  It is best not to err at all in this case. But if we must err, let us \nerr on the side of avoiding these divisions, and let us err on the side \nof respecting the will of the people.\n  Let me conclude by quoting James W. Grimes, one of the seven \nRepublican Senators who voted not to acquit Andrew Johnson. I \ndiscovered this speech, and found out that the Chief Justice had \nalready discovered and quoted him, and said he was one of the three of \nthe ablest of the seven. Grimes said this in his opinion about why he \nwouldn't convict President Johnson:\n\n       I cannot agree to destroy the harmonious working of the \n     Constitution for the sake of getting rid of an unacceptable \n     President. Whatever may be my opinion of the incumbent, I \n     cannot consent to trifle with the high office he holds. I can \n     do nothing which, by implication, may be construed as an \n     approval of impeachment as a part of future political \n     machinery.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If a university president, a minister or priest, \ngeneral or admiral, or a corporate chief executive had engaged in a \nsexual relationship with an intern under his charge, he would lose his \nposition, with scant attention paid to whether or not such a \nrelationship were ``consensual.'' We place in certain individuals so \ngreat a measure of trust that they are seen as acting essentially in \nloco parentis.\n  The question before us today is: Should the President of the United \nStates be held to a lower standard?\n  The answer is: No. To the contrary; we can bestow no higher honor \nthan to select one individual to represent us all as President. In one \nperson we endow the character of our nation, as the head of state and \nthe head of government.\n  It's with great disappointment, but firm resolve, that I have \nconcluded the President has not lived up to this high standard and that \nhe should be removed from office. The House managers have demonstrated \nbeyond reasonable doubt that, in addition to indefensible behavior with \nan intern, which was not illegal, the President engaged in the \nobstruction of justice and, as an element of that obstruction, \ncommitted perjury before a federal grand jury, which is.\n  This case began as an alleged civil rights violation of a young woman \nwho came to the bar seeking justice. The Supreme Court unanimously \ndecided to permit her case against the President to go forward. It was \nthat case which led to the revelations regarding the President's \nrelationship with Monica Lewinsky, the White House intern.\n  Incredibly, an element of the President's defense is that we should \ntake the long view. We are told by the President's defenders that we \nshould not judge his actions toward one individual, in which he schemed \nto impede her ability to seek redress, because his overall actions on \ncivil rights are so positive. We are asked not to judge his treatment \nof one woman, or two women, but to evaluate his policies that affect \nall women.\n  Would the President's defenders forgive a school teacher who molests \na student, simply because the teacher's classes are popular and his \nstudents all go on to college? Should we ignore the police officer who \npersonally enriches himself by accepting graft, so long as his arrest \nrecord is high? Would we look away from the corporate executive who \nillegally profits from insider information, as long as his shareholders \nare happy with the return on their investment? We would not sustain \ncivil society for long with such moral relativism as our guide.\n  The President had it solely within his power to keep the country from \nthe course on which it has been for the past year. First, of course, he \ncould have chosen not to engage in the behavior in question. Having \nbehaved as he did, though, and having been discovered, the President \ncould have acknowledged his own actions and accepted the consequences. \nThis could have been an honorable resignation, or an admission, \ncontrition, and a firm resolve to take responsibility; with a request \nfor resolution in a manner short of impeachment and trial.\n  Instead, the President chose to deny the allegations, and fight them \nwith a coordinated scheme of manipulation and obstruction. He lied \noutright to the American people, to his close associates, and to his \ncabinet. An enduring image of this whole tale will be his finger-\npointing lie to the American people, even after admonishing us to \nlisten closely, because he didn't want to have to say it again.\n  Even in view of these actions, the President missed numerous \nopportunities to right this matter and get it behind him and the \ncountry. At virtually every opportunity, though, he chose an action \nthat further prolonged the matter and led directly to his impeachment.\n  The President chose to impede the pursuit of justice by the \nIndependent Counsel, who was given the authority to investigate this \nmatter by the President's own Attorney General.\n  The President chose to construct a cover story with Ms. Lewinsky, \nshould their relationship become public.\n  The President chose to direct his personal staff to retrieve items \nfrom Ms. Lewinsky that he knew were under subpoena in a federal \ninvestigation.\n  The President chose to seek the assistance of friends to find a job \nfor Ms. Lewinsky, and to intensify that job search when it became clear \nthat Ms. Lewinsky had become a target of the civil suit against him.\n  The President chose to lie to his staff about the nature of his \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky herself, with the expectation that these \nlies would become part of the public perception.\n  And, the President chose to lie before a federal grand jury about his \nactions with regard to some of the elements of obstruction of justice, \nincluding the concealment of the gifts that were likely to become \nevidence in the civil case against him.\n  As a result of these choices by the President of the United States, \nthe Senate was left with no choice other than to confront the charges \nand hear the case pursuant to the President's impeachment in the House \nof Representatives.\n\n[[Page S1467]]\n\n  In so doing, the Senate conducted a fair and expeditious trial. We \nrejected the idea of an early test vote that would have truncated the \nprocess. We rejected the motion for an early dismissal. The Senate is \nfulfilling its Constitutional responsibility to hold a trial with a \ncomplete evidentiary record and a final vote on each article of \nimpeachment sent to the Senate by the House of Representatives.\n  Through skillful use of the written record compiled by the \nIndependent Counsel, videotaped depositions, and hard evidence, the \nHouse managers presented a compelling case. The case for perjury was \ndifficult. The President's testimony before the Grand Jury was guarded. \nHe was fully aware of the evidence the prosecutors had with respect to \nthis case. He chose his words carefully. He admitted his relationship \nwith Ms. Lewinsky before the Grand Jury, but did so only after \nconfronted with clinical evidence of its existence.\n  But he lied to the Grand Jury to deny other key facts. He perjured \nhimself as an element of a broader attempt to obstruct justice. There \nare two false statements that are the most persuasive. First, when \nasked if he directed Betty Currie to retrieve gifts from Ms. Lewinsky, \nhe stated unequivocally, ``No sir, I did not do that.''\n  The facts are contrary to that allegation. Ms. Lewinsky testified \nthat Betty Currie called her to suggest that Ms. Lewinsky give her the \ngifts. We have cellular telephone records that indicate a call from Ms. \nCurrie to Ms. Lewinsky at about the time the gifts were picked up. It \nwas clear that Ms. Currie initiated a retrieval of the gifts at the \ndirection of the President, for this was the only source of information \nshe had that there were gifts. The evidence is overwhelming that the \nPresident directed Betty Currie to retrieve these gifts. Thus, his \nstatement is false. Not only is this perjury, it is obstruction of \njustice.\n  The President also lied before the Grand Jury about his conversations \nwith White House aides regarding Ms. Lewinsky. He testified that ``I \nsaid to them things that were true about this relationship.'' We know \nthis to be completely false from the testimony of Sidney Blumenthal, \nwho stated directly and unequivocally that the President had lied to \nhim about the nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.\n  The legal standard for perjury is high. Under Section 18 U.S.C. \n1623(a), a person is guilty of perjury if he or she knowingly makes a \nfalse, material statement under oath in a federal court or Grand Jury. \nI believe these statements were false, intentional and material in that \nthey attempt to put a false impression on key events in a series of \nattempts to obstruct justice. In effect, the President knew his \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky was shameful, but not necessarily \nillegal. But he knew his obstruction of justice was illegal--so he lied \nabout it to a Grand Jury.\n  In many ways, obstruction of justice is even more corrosive than \nperjury to the machinery of our legal system. As the target of a grand \njury and an independent prosecutor, the President has defended himself \nagainst charges of perjury by claiming he was caught off guard, was \nmisinterpreted, was attempting to mislead but not lie.\n  Obstruction of justice, though, is a quite different matter. It is an \naffirmative act that occurs at the person's own initiative; in this \ncase, the President. It involves actions taken that were not instigated \nby anyone else.\n  It has been said in his defense that the President did not initiate \nhis perjury in that he was led to it by the prosecutor. But there is no \nsimilar argument regarding Article II, the Obstruction of Justice. \nWithout the affirmative actions of the President, there would have been \nno Article II.\n  The President sought out Mr. Blumenthal to tell his misleading story \nabout the nature of his relationship and the character of Ms. Lewinsky.\n  Separately, the President enlisted his personal secretary to further \nhis obstruction of justice. He asked Ms. Currie to retrieve the gifts. \nHe summoned her to coach her testimony under the guise of ``trying to \nfigure out what the facts were.'' He did so within hours after coming \nback to the White House on January 17th from his deposition in the \ncivil sexual harassment lawsuit. He required a face-to-face meeting \nwith her the next day, a Sunday. It couldn't be done over the phone, \nand it couldn't wait until Monday. It was clear he needed her to \nreaffirm his false testimony. This is obstruction of justice.\n  The edifice of American jurisprudence rests on the foundation of the \ndue process of law. The mortar in that foundation is the oath. Those \nwho seek to obstruct justice weaken that foundation, and those who \nviolate the oath would tear the whole structure down.\n  Every day, thousands of citizens in thousands of courtrooms across \nAmerica are sworn in as jurors, as grand jurors, as witnesses, as \ndefendants. On those oaths rest the due process of law upon which all \nof our other rights are based.\n  The oath is how we defend ourselves against those who would subvert \nour system by breaking our laws. There are Americans in jail today \nbecause they violated that oath. Others have prevailed at the bar of \njustice because of that oath.\n  What would we be telling Americans--and those worldwide who see in \nAmerica what they can only hope for in their own countries--if the \nSenate of the United States were to conclude: The President lied under \noath as an element of a scheme to obstruct the due process of law, but \nwe chose to look the other way?\n  I cannot make that choice. I cannot look away. I vote ``Guilty'' on \nArticle I, Perjury. I vote ``Guilty'' on Article II, Obstruction of \nJustice.\n  I ask unanimous consent an analysis of the Articles of Impeachment be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Analysis of the Articles of Impeachment\n\n                   (By Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison)\n\n       ``Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to \n     the trial of the impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, \n     president of the United States, now pending, you will do \n     impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws: So \n     help you God?''\n       When the Chief Justice of the United States administered \n     this oath and I signed my name to it on January 7, 1999, as \n     one of one hundred triers of fact and law in the Court of \n     Impeachment of the President of the United States, I did so \n     with a heavy heart, but with a clear mind.\n       That solemn occasion in the well of this Senate, and the \n     weight of the burden imposed on us as ``jurors'' in only the \n     second such proceeding in the history of our Nation, reminded \n     me with vivid clarity that our Constitution belongs to all of \n     us.\n       I was reminded as well, however, that the laws of our \n     Country are applicable to us all, including the President, \n     and they must be obeyed. The concept of equal justice under \n     law and the importance of absolute truth in legal proceedings \n     is the foundation of our justice system in the courts.\n       In this proceeding, I have drawn conclusions about the \n     facts as I see them, and I have applied the law to those \n     facts as I understand that law to be.\n\n\n              underlying facts leading to this proceeding\n\n       The details of an intimate personal relationship that \n     occurred during the years 1995, 1996, and 1997 between the \n     President of the United States and a 22 year-old female White \n     House Intern who was directly under his command and control \n     have been chronicled throughout the world and are described \n     in thousands of pages of evidence and materials filed with \n     both the House and the Senate in this case and in bookstores \n     across America. They involved intimate sexual relations \n     within the White House, personal gifts, jobs within and \n     outside of government, and ``missions accomplished.'' The \n     underlying details will not be repeated by me here.\n       While some facts about that relationship and the timing of \n     some events were disputed at the trial in the Senate, their \n     essence has been publicly admitted by the President, by his \n     Counsel, and by the Intern in written or verbal form, \n     including sworn testimony in various forms.\n       However inappropriate the behavior of the President was, \n     the legal issues in the impeachment trial do not deal with \n     this relationship. All accusations against the President here \n     relate instead to alleged attempts to prevent the disclosure \n     of this relationship in a pending civil rights lawsuit \n     against the President in an Arkansas Federal court and to the \n     public. That is the critical factor that has brought us to \n     this extraordinary moment in our Nation's history when we are \n     considering whether or not to remove from office the \n     President of the United States.\n\n\n           core facts leading to the articles of impeachment\n\n       In May, 1994, a female citizen and employee of the State of \n     Arkansas filed a lawsuit in an Arkansas Federal District \n     Court, alleging, in summary, that, in 1991 while President \n     Clinton was Governor of Arkansas, the Governor committed the \n     civil offense of sexual harassment against her by insisting \n     that she perform sexual acts identical or similar to those \n     later performed by the Intern.\n\n[[Page S1468]]\n\n       In the course of preparing for the trial of the Arkansas \n     case, the plaintiff, with the consent of the presiding \n     Federal Judge, attempted to develop evidence that defendant \n     Clinton had, before and afterward, engaged in patterns of \n     conduct that were similar to the allegations of the plaintiff \n     in the case.\n       In December, 1997, the Arkansas Judge ordered defendant \n     Clinton to answer a written interrogatory naming every state \n     and federal employee with whom he had had sexual relations \n     since 1986. President Clinton answered: ``none.''\n       In an alleged attempt to avoid giving a personal deposition \n     in the case pursuant to a December, 1997, subpoena, the White \n     House Intern, who had since become employed at the Pentagon, \n     on January 7, 1998, signed an affidavit denying any sexual \n     relationship with President Clinton. Six days later, on \n     January 13, the Intern accepted a job offer at a major \n     corporation in New York City. A friend called the President \n     shortly thereafter with the message: ``Mission \n     accomplished.''\n       While the President was giving his own deposition in the \n     Arkansas case, his counsel tendered this affidavit to the \n     Arkansas Federal Court, referred to it, and vouched for its \n     accuracy in the presence of the President. The President, \n     knowing the affidavit to be false, sat by and said nothing. \n     The President's counsel subsequently advised the Court that \n     this affidavit was not reliable and should be ignored.\n       Defendant Clinton was subpoenaed to give the above-\n     mentioned deposition in the case and did so on January 17, \n     1998. In a rare event, the Arkansas Judge attended for the \n     purpose of supervising the deposition of the President in a \n     Washington lawyer's offices. While there, the Judge and \n     participating counsel for the parties, either knowingly or \n     unknowingly, formulated a definition of the meaning of the \n     words ``sexual relations'' to exclude certain forms of human \n     contact that in their commonly accepted meaning would be \n     included. But, allegedly upon the basis of this definition, \n     President Clinton denied, under oath, among other things, \n     that he had sexual relations with the Intern.\n       On January 21, 1998, the existence of an alleged \n     inappropriate relationship between the President and the \n     White House Intern blazed across the Nation from a story \n     first published in the Washington Post carrying the headline: \n     ``Clinton Accused of Urging Aid to Lie; Starr Probes Whether \n     President Told Woman to Deny Alleged Affair to (plaintiff's) \n     Lawyers.''\n       Evidence introduced and debated by the House Managers and \n     the President's Counsel in the Senate painted a picture of \n     frantic activities within and without the White House \n     throughout the month before and during the week following \n     this public disclosure, by the President, by his friends, by \n     White House staff and employees, and others. It was alleged, \n     among other things, that the President coached, manipulated, \n     and influenced false testimony of witnesses, including the \n     Intern, engineered the hiding of gifts and evidence that was \n     subject to subpoena, lied to his staff and friends about the \n     facts in order to assure that they would give false testimony \n     in public and legal proceedings, manipulated the Intern into \n     signing the false affidavit in the Arkansas Federal Court, \n     and, after failures to obtain employment for her elsewhere, \n     rewarded the Intern by obtaining for her an out-of-town job \n     in return for her cooperative falsehoods or silence. The \n     sequence and importance of such activities, much of which is \n     not disputed in the evidence, were debated aggressively by \n     the House Mangers and the President's Counsel in the Senate, \n     but the essence of those activities was not seriously denied.\n       After numerous public denials immediately after the public \n     disclosure, and after several days of alleged ``damage \n     control'' designed to synchronize false stories to be \n     provided by various parties in response to all inquiries, and \n     event of major, historic, and future national importance \n     occurred.\n       On January 26, 1998, the President addressed the Nation \n     about this issue at a press conference in Washington, since \n     replayed in television broadcasts thousands of times. On that \n     occasion, the President looked sternly into the camera and \n     pointed his finger directly at the American people and \n     stated:\n       ``I want to say one thing to the American people. I want \n     you to listen to me. I'm going to say this again: I did not \n     have sexual relations with that woman, (naming the Intern). I \n     never told anybody to lie, not a single time. Never. These \n     allegations are false.''\n       During the following months, the gist of this \n     representation filled the news media around the World and in \n     every conceivable form, provided by every conceivable \n     spokesman for the President, including government employees, \n     Cabinet officials, lawyers, public relations specialists, \n     political advisors, friends, Members of Congress, and others.\n       After an immunity agreement was reached between the \n     Independent Counsel (discussed below) and the Intern on July \n     28, 1998, the Intern delivered a dress to the Independent \n     Counsel that, according to her testimony, had been worn by \n     her on February 28, 1997, during a sexual encounter with the \n     President in the White House. The dress was tested for the \n     President's DNA. The test was positive.\n       The President of the United States had lied directly to the \n     American people.\n\n\n            The President's Appearance Before the Grand Jury\n\n       After months of negotiation for an appearance by the \n     President, on July 17, 1998, the President was subpoenaed to \n     appear before a Federal grand jury in Washington by the \n     Independent Counsel assigned to investigate multiple issues \n     concerning the President, including issues involving \n     potential perjury by both the President and the Intern in the \n     Arkansas sexual harassment case, issues relating to the \n     President's relationship with the Intern, and issues relating \n     to alleged actions taken to influence the testimony of \n     witnesses in the Arkansas case and before the grand jury, \n     attempts to discredit the Intern by describing her as a \n     ``stalker,'' as ``ignorant,'' and as ``stupid,'' all done in \n     an alleged effort to cover up and conceal the underlying \n     relationship between the President and the Intern, to \n     obstruct the right of the Arkansas plaintiff to pursue her \n     sexual harassment claims in the Arkansas Federal Court, and \n     to obstruct the proceedings of the grand jury itself.\n       After various losing motions and court proceedings \n     asserting various executive privileges against a Presidential \n     appearance before the grand jury, the President, on August \n     17, 1998, gave testimony voluntarily to the grand jury by \n     deposition given in the White House and piped live to the \n     grand jury. The prior subpoena was withdrawn by the \n     Independent Counsel.\n       During and since this appearance, the president has \n     repeatedly acknowledged publicly that he had an inappropriate \n     relationship with the White House Intern but has insisted \n     that he was misleading but truthful in his depositions in the \n     Arkansas case and before the Federal grand jury and did not \n     commit any act that would constitute an obstruction of any \n     legal proceeding or the rights of any party associated with \n     any portion of this historic tale.\n\n\n                      Impeachment of the President\n\n       The Ethics in Government Act, 28 U.S.C. Section \n     Sec. 595(c), directs any Independent Counsel appointed under \n     that law to advise the House of Representatives of any \n     substantial and credible information received during the \n     course of an investigation that may constitute grounds for \n     the impeachment of the President of the United States.\n       On September 9, 1998, the Office of Independent Counsel \n     submitted its referral to the House of Representatives \n     consisting of thousands of pages of sworn testimony from \n     many parties, recorded telephone conversations, video \n     tapes, interviews, reports, legal briefs, and arguments, \n     including the following partial introduction:\n       ``This Referral presents substantial and credible \n     information that President Clinton criminally obstructed the \n     judicial process, first in a sexual harassment lawsuit in \n     which he was a defendant and then in a grand jury \n     investigation.''\n       The Judiciary Committee of the House, in its report to the \n     full House of Representatives, recommended four Articles of \n     Impeachment of the President. On December 19, 1998, the House \n     of Representatives declined to approve two of the proposed \n     Articles, but did approve the following two Articles, and \n     delivered H. Res. 611 to the Senate for trial in accordance \n     with the provisions of Section 3 of Article I of the \n     Constitution of the United States:\n       Impeachment Article I, the ``perjury'' article, accuses the \n     President of violating his constitutional duty to take care \n     that the laws are faithfully executed, of willfully \n     corrupting and manipulating the judicial process, and of \n     impeding the administration of justice for personal gain and \n     exoneration, in that:\n       While under oath before the Federal grand jury, the \n     President gave perjurious testimony before the grand jury \n     concerning one or more of the following: (i) the nature and \n     details of his relationship with the Intern; (ii) prior \n     perjurious, false, and misleading testimony he gave in the \n     Arkansas case; (iii) prior false and misleading statements he \n     allowed his attorney to make about the Intern's affidavit in \n     the Arkansas case; and (iv) his corrupt efforts to influence \n     the testimony of witnesses and to impede the discovery of \n     evidence in the Arkansas case.\n       Impleachment Article II, the ``obstruction of justice'' and \n     ``witness tampering'' article, accuses the President of \n     violating his constitutional duty to take care that the laws \n     are faithfully executed, of preventing, obstructing, and \n     impeding the administration of justice, and, to that end, of \n     engaging personally and through his subordinates and agents \n     in a course of conduct or scheme designed to delay, impede, \n     cover up, and conceal the existence of evidence and testimony \n     related to the Arkansas Federal sexual harassment case.\n       In support of the accusation, Article II accuses the \n     President of seven specific acts of obstruction: (i) \n     corruptly encouraging the Intern to execute false affidavit \n     in the Arkansas case, (ii) corruptly encouraging the Intern \n     to give false testimony in the Arkansas case if and when she \n     was called to testify personally in that case, (iii) \n     corruptly engaging in, encouraging, or supporting a scheme to \n     conceal evidence that had been subpoenaed in the Arkansas \n     case, (iv) obtaining a job for the Intern in order to \n     corruptly prevent her truthful testimony in the Arkansas \n     case, (v) corruptly allowing his attorney in the Arkansas \n     case to make false statements to the Federal Judge \n     characterizing the Intern's affidavit in order to prevent \n     questioning deemed relevant by the Judge, (vi) corruptly \n     influencing his personal secretary to give false testimony in \n     the Arkansas case, and (vii) making false and misleading \n     statements to witnesses in the Federal grand jury \n     proceeding, confirmed by the witnesses, in order to \n     corruptly influence the testimony of those witnesses.\n\n[[Page S1469]]\n\n                        the trial in the senate\n\n       H. Res. 611 was received in the Senate on December 19, \n     1998. The trial commenced on January 7, 1999. During the \n     trial, we have listened to hours of arguments from the House \n     Managers and Counsel for the President, and have engaged in \n     hours of internal Senate debate, both public and private. We \n     have been provided with access to thousands of pages and \n     other forms of evidence relating to the accusations contained \n     in the two Articles of Impeachment.\n       Under the Constitution, the power to impeach (or \n     ``accuse'') a President of an impeachable offense is vested \n     solely in the House of Representatives. As Senators and \n     triers of both the facts and the law, we cannot ``accuse,'' \n     ``venture outside the record,'' or ``create and assert new \n     allegations.'' We are bound to cast our votes of ``guilty'' \n     or ``not guilty'' solely on the two Article of Impeachment as \n     presented by the House.\n       I do not hold to the view of our Constitution that there \n     must be an actual, indictable crime in order for an act of a \n     public officer to be impeachable. It is clear to this Senator \n     that there are, indeed, circumstances, short of a felony \n     criminal offense that would justify the removal of a public \n     officer from office, including the President of the United \n     States. Manifest injury to the Office of the President, to \n     our Nation, and to the American people, and gross abuses of \n     trust and of public office clearly can reach the level of \n     intensity that would justify the impeachment and removal of a \n     leader. One of the Articles of Impeachment presented by the \n     House Judiciary Committee to the full House of \n     Representatives in this case charged the President with \n     precisely such an offense. The House of Representatives did \n     not approve that Article, and such a charge is, therefore, \n     not before us in this proceeding.\n       The two Articles of Impeachment before the Senate in this \n     proceeding do in fact accuse the President of committing \n     three actual crimes, ``perjury before the grand jury,'' \n     `'obstruction of justice,'' and ``witness tampering,'' that \n     meet the requirements for conviction of an indicted defendant \n     in a criminal case brought under Federal law. The House \n     Managers and Counsel for the President reviewed those laws \n     extensively. Thus, in order to find the President ``guilty'' \n     under either Article, this Senator must conclude that all of \n     the statutory prerequisites to conviction are present that \n     would be required to convict the President of one or more of \n     those crimes, if this proceeding were, instead, the \n     prosecution of felony criminal indictments in a United States \n     District Court under Federal law.\n       The President's Counsel did not significantly challenge the \n     underlying facts in the case, but insisted throughout (i) \n     that no crimes have been committed, and (ii) that, even if \n     crimes have been committed, they ``do not rise to the level \n     of the high crimes and misdemeanors'' contemplated by the \n     Constitution that would permit a conviction in this \n     proceeding, since a finding of ``guilty'' by 67 Senators \n     under either Article would, under the Constitution, \n     automatically result in the removal of the President from \n     office and prohibit him forever from holding another \n     office of profit or trust under the United States.\n\n\n perjury, obstruction of justice, and witness tampering as impeachable \n                                offenses\n\n       Section 4 of Article II of our Constitution provides:\n       ``The President . . . shall be removed from Office on \n     Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or \n     other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.''\n       Because of the uniqueness of this Constitutional process in \n     which ``guilt'' and ``punishment'' are combined, each \n     Senator, as a trier of both fact and law, before voting as to \n     the guilt or innocence of the President under either of the \n     Articles must answer the basic question: Do the crimes of \n     perjury, witness tampering, and obstruction of justice as \n     alleged in this proceeding rise to the level of the ``high \n     crimes and misdemeanors'' included in our Constitution that \n     would justify the automatic removal from office of the \n     President of the United States?\n       The Supreme Court of the United States has observed that \n     there is an occasional misunderstanding to the effect that \n     the crime of ``perjury'' is somehow distinct from \n     ``obstruction of justice.'' United States v. Norris, 300 U.S. \n     564, 574 (1937). They are not. While different elements make \n     up each crime, each is calculated to prevent a court and the \n     public from discovering the truth and achieving justice in \n     our judicial system. Moreover, it is obvious that ``witness \n     tampering'' is simply another means employed to obstruct \n     justice.\n       This Senate on numerous occasions has convicted impeached \n     Federal Judges on allegations of perjury. Moreover, the \n     historical fact is that ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' as \n     used and applied in English law on which portions of our \n     Constitution were founded, included the crimes of \n     ``obstructing the execution of the lawful process'' and of \n     ``willful and corrupt perjury.'' Blackstone, Commentaries on \n     the Laws of England, a treatise described by James Madison as \n     ``a book which is in every man's hand.'' See article entitled \n     ``The True History of High Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' by Gary \n     L. McDowell, Director of the Institute of United States \n     Studies at the University of London, appearing in the Wall \n     Street Journal, January 25, 1999.\n       Some argue that the precedents of the Senate in cases \n     involving Federal Judges are not applicable because Federal \n     Judges are not elected by the people and the President is. \n     This is a shocking analysis to this Senator. That the \n     President is elected should call for a ``higher'' standard of \n     conduct, not a lower one. The fact is that the standards are \n     set by the Constitution for all officers of the Federal \n     government. They are precisely the same, and we are obligated \n     to apply them evenly.\n       It is argued by others that this test leaves Presidents at \n     risk of being impeached and convicted for trivial offenses. \n     The two-thirds vote requirement for conviction imposed by the \n     Constitution, itself, is designed to protect public officers \n     from precisely such a result.\n       The President's Counsel and a number of Senators advance a \n     ``felony-plus'' interpretation of the Constitutional terms \n     ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' They seem to agree that the \n     crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice are ``high \n     crimes'' under the Constitution, but they argue that, even if \n     guilt is admitted, nevertheless, a Senator should vote ``not \n     guilty,'' on any article of impeachment of a President, if \n     the ``economy is good,'' if the underlying facts in the case \n     are ``just about sex,'' or if the Senator simply feels for \n     whatever personal reason that the President ought to stay in \n     office despite having committed felonies while holding it.\n       To this Senator, this astounding application of the plain \n     language of our Constitution strikes at the very heart of the \n     rule of law in America. It replaces the stability guaranteed \n     by the Constitution with the chaos of uncertainty. Not only \n     does it obliterate the noble ideal that our highest public \n     officer should set high moral standards for our Nation, it \n     says that the officer is free to commit felonies while doing \n     it if the economy is good, if the crime is just about sex, or \n     if, except for the crime, ``things are going pretty well \n     right now,'' or simply that ``they can indict and try the \n     President for the crime after leaving office in a couple of \n     years.''\n       I will not demean our Constitution or the office of the \n     Presidency of the United States by endorsing the felony-plus \n     standard.\n\n\n              Elements Required for Conviction of Perjury\n\n       Lying is a moral wrong. Perjury is a lie told under oath \n     that is legally wrong. To be illegal, the lie must be \n     willfully told, must be believed to be untrue, and must \n     relate to a material matter. Title 18, Section 1621 and 1623, \n     U.S. Code.\n       If President Washington, as a child, had cut down a cherry \n     tree and lied about it, he would be guilty of ``lying,'' but \n     would not be guilty of ``perjury.''\n       If, on the other hand, President Washington, as an adult, \n     had been warned not to cut down a cherry tree, but he cut it \n     down anyway, with the tree falling on a man and severely \n     injuring or killing him, with President Washington stating \n     later under oath that it was not he who cut down the tree, \n     that would be ``perjury.'' Because it was a material fact in \n     determining the circumstances of the man's injury or death.\n       Some would argue that the President in the second example \n     should not be impeached because the whole thing is about a \n     cherry tree, and lies about cherry trees, even under oath, \n     though despicable, do not rise to the level of impeachable \n     offenses under the Constitution. I disagree.\n       The perjury committed in the second example was an attempt \n     to impede, frustrate, and obstruct the judicial system in \n     determining how the man was injured or killed, when, and by \n     whose hand, in order to escape personal responsibility under \n     the law, either civil or criminal. Such would be an \n     impeachable offense. To say otherwise would be to severely \n     lower the moral and legal standards of accountability that \n     are imposed on ordinary citizens every day. The same standard \n     should be imposed on our leaders.\n       Nearly every child in America believes that President \n     Washington, as a child himself, did in fact cut down the \n     cherry tree and admitted to his father that he did it, saying \n     simply: ``I cannot tell a lie.''\n       I will not compromise this simple but high moral principle \n     in order to avoid serious consequences to a successor \n     President who may choose to ignore it.\n\n\n elements required for conviction of witness tampering and obstruction \n                               of justice\n\n       Whoever knowingly uses intimidation or physical force, \n     threatens, or corruptly persuades another person, or attempts \n     to do so, or engaged in misleading conduct toward another \n     person, with intent to--\n       (i) influence, delay, or prevent the testimony of any \n     person in an official proceeding;\n       (ii) cause or induce any person to (A) withhold testimony \n     or evidence from an official proceeding, (B) alter or destroy \n     evidence in an official proceeding; (C) evade legal process \n     summoning that person as a witness or produce evidence in an \n     official proceeding to which the person has been summoned;\n       (iii) harass another person and thereby hinder, delay, \n     prevent, or dissuade any person from attending or testifying \n     in an official proceeding; or\n       (iv) corruptly influence, obstruct, or impede, or endeavor \n     to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of \n     justice;\n\n     is guilty of witness tampering and/or obstruction of justice. \n     Title 18, Sections 1512 and 1503, U.S. Code.\n       The elements of these crimes are evident from the laws \n     themselves and do not need amplification here.\n\n[[Page S1470]]\n\n                my votes on the articles of impeachment\n\n       Based upon my analysis of the facts of this case and my own \n     conclusions of law, I have concluded:\n       (i) The President of the United States willfully, and with \n     intent to deceive, gave false and misleading testimony under \n     oath with respect to material matters that were pending \n     before the Federal grand jury on August 17, 1998, as alleged \n     in Article I presented to the Senate. I, therefore, vote \n     ``Guilty'' on Article I of the Articles of Impeachment of the \n     President in this Proceeding.\n       (ii) The President of the United States engaged in a \n     pattern of conduct, performed acts of willful deception, and \n     told and disseminated massive falsehoods, including lies told \n     directly to the American people, that were designed and \n     corruptly calculated to impede, obstruct, and prevent the \n     plaintiff in the Arkansas Federal sexual harassment case from \n     seeking and obtaining justice in the Federal court system of \n     the United States, and to further prevent the Federal grand \n     jury from performing its functions and responsibilities under \n     law, I, therefore, vote ``Guilty'' on Article II of the \n     Articles of Impeachment of the President in this proceeding.\n\n\n                article I, Perjury--Explanation of Vote\n\n       This Article accuses the President, while giving sworn \n     testimony on August 17, 1998, before the Federal grand jury \n     in Washington, D.C., of willfully corrupting and impeding the \n     judicial process and the administration of justice by giving \n     false and perjurious testimony about his relationship with \n     the White House Intern, about his January 17, 1998, \n     deposition testimony in the Arkansas sexual harrassment case, \n     about his role in developing and tendering to the Federal \n     Judge in the Arkansas case an affidavit that was knowingly \n     false while giving his deposition in the Arkansas case, and \n     about his attempts to influence the testimony of White House \n     employees and other witnesses in the Arkanksas case who were \n     at the time also subject to the jurisdiction of the grand \n     jury.\n       In reaching my decision with respect to this Article, I \n     have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the President \n     gave false and misleading testimony in the Arkansas sexual \n     harrassment case and in his appearance before the Federal \n     grand jury.\n       At the trial in the Senate, the President's Counsel argued \n     that, even if it were to be admitted that the testimony in \n     both instances were false and misleading, the testimony \n     would, nevertheless, not amount to perjury because it does \n     not reach the level of ``materiality'' that is required for a \n     lie to rise to the level of a crime under Federal law.\n       They attempt to trivialize the issues raised by Article I \n     by reference to such questions as ``Who touched whom, and \n     where,'' and to answers to questions by the President such as \n     ``It depends on what the meaning of `is' is.''\n       The false testimony complained of in Article I of the \n     Articles of Impeachment relates to testimony before the grand \n     jury, and only indirectly to the testimony in the Arkansas \n     case. The Federal grand jury was investigating broad issues \n     and many persons at the time the President gave false and \n     misleading testimony before it.\n       Willful, corrupt, and false sworn testimony before a \n     Federal grand jury is a separate and distinct crime under \n     applicable law and is material and perjurious if it is \n     ``capable'' of influencing the grand jury in any matter \n     before it, including any collateral matters that it may \n     consider. See, Title 18, Section 1623, U.S. Code, and Federal \n     court cases interpreting that Section.\n       The President's testimony before the Federal grand jury was \n     fully capable of influencing the grand jury's investigation \n     and was clearly perjurious.\n\n\n        article ii, obstruction of justice--explanation of vote\n\n       When, on January 26, 1998, the President of the United \n     States pointed his finger at the American people and \n     represented to them that he was the victim of lies and not \n     their perpetrator, he lied to America. The evidence is \n     overwhelming that he did so because all of his ``ducks were \n     in a row.''\n       The White House Intern had executed a false affidavit; \n     subpoenaed gifts had been hidden; his own false deposition \n     had been given; other witnesses had testified falsely based \n     upon his own false representations to them; retribution \n     against the White House Intern had been programmed should she \n     abandon loyalty; and loyalty had been confirmed by the \n     Intern's acceptance of a special new job in New York, that \n     represented, according to a friend of the President, \n     ``Mission accomplished.''\n       Then came the dress, the tapes, and the Federal grand jury. \n     The attempt to obstruct and cover-up grew, expanded, and \n     developed a life of its own. It overpowered the underlying \n     offense itself. A new strategy was required, fast: The \n     President was advised: ``Admit the sex, but never the lies.'' \n     Shift the blame; change the subject. Blame it on the \n     plaintiff in the Arkansas case. Blame it on her lawyers. \n     Blame it on the Independent Counsel. Blame it on \n     partisanship. Blame it on the majority members of the House \n     Judiciary Committee. Blame it on the process.\n       The blame belongs to the President of the United States. \n     This juror has concluded that the President is guilty of \n     obstructing justice beyond a reasonable doubt, as alleged in \n     Article II of the Articles of Impeachment in this proceeding.\n\n\n                          concluding statement\n\n       This has been a case about civil rights. It has been about \n     the right of the weakest and the strongest among us to have \n     equal access to our system of justice in order to pursue \n     legal and Constitutional rights and to fix responsibility for \n     alleged legal wrongs.\n       During the last half of this passing century, we have \n     managed to maintain the proposition established over 200 \n     years ago that every American is entitled to equal justice \n     under the law.\n       In the middle of the century, our Country and our courts \n     began to recognize the inherent evil of discrimination based \n     on race and national origin. In the last two decades, we have \n     begun to address issues of gender. We have enacted sexual \n     harassment laws that have become the symbols of the high \n     moral standards of our Country. They permit half of our \n     citizens to work freely among us without fear of harm and \n     sexual abuse.\n       It has been said by many, in attempts to demean this \n     proceeding, that this case is, simply, ``all about sex.'' In \n     some ways, it is. It is about the right of an employed female \n     American living in the State of Arkansas to hold a job \n     without being forced to engage in it by the Governor of that \n     State. That is not the question before us, and I express no \n     opinion on that subject. But I do know that the President of \n     the United States willfully and unlawfully obstructed her \n     efforts in the Federal courts of our Land to pursue her \n     cause. We are forced to leave it to history to determine \n     whether her cause was factually just, and to define the \n     message that the conduct of our Country's highest public \n     officer sends into the next century.\n       If only the President had followed the simple, high moral \n     principle handed to us by our Nation's first leader as a \n     child and had said early in this episode ``I cannot tell a \n     lie,'' we would not be here today. We would not be sitting in \n     judgment of a President. We would not be invoking those \n     provisions of the Constitution that have only been applied \n     once before in our Nation's history.\n       But we should all be thankful that our Constitution is \n     there, and we should take pride in our right and duty to \n     enforce it. A hundred years from now, when history looks back \n     to this moment, we can hope for a conclusion that our \n     Constitution has been applied fairly and survives, that we \n     have come to principled judgments about matters of national \n     importance, and that the rule of law in American has been \n     sustained.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. Chief Justice, I have served twelve years in the \nUnited States Senate.\n  I respect this institution and all of you as colleagues. I especially \nrespect the job our leaders have done in this trial. They have \nperformed in the highest tradition of the United States Senate. Most of \nall, I respect our oath of office: to ``preserve, protect, and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States.'' I know all of us take that \noath seriously.\n  At the end of this proceeding, however, we may reach different \nconclusions about what the Constitution compels us to do. The simple \ntruth is that this case is not black and white. As Mr. Manager Graham \nsaid, reasonable people may come to different conclusions.\n  There is one thing on which we all agree: The President's conduct was \nwrong. In fact, it was very wrong. But the question before us is not \nwhether the President's conduct was wrong. The question is whether that \nconduct meets the Constitutional standard for removing a President from \noffice.\n  That requires us to make a profound judgment on whether we should \noverturn the results of a national election. 67 members in this chamber \ncan nullify the votes of the 47 million Americans who voted for \nPresident Clinton. That is an awesome power. It must be used with great \nrestraint.\n  There are three questions we must answer in the affirmative to remove \na President: First, did the President commit the crimes he is charged \nwith? Second, are these crimes properly addressed by impeachment, or \nwould they be better left to the criminal justice system? Third, do the \ncharges rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors and justify \nthe removal of the President of the United States?\n\n\n                    the sufficiency of the evidence\n\n  Let me start with the first question. The charges against the \nPresident are perjury and obstruction of justice.\n  Five experienced Federal prosecutors representing both Republican and \nDemocratic Administrations concluded that no responsible Federal \nprosecutor would bring perjury charges based on the facts in this case.\n  The President in his grand jury testimony acknowledged an intimate \nand inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The details of \nthat relationship are in conflict. But I do not believe relatively \nminor differences in the details of that relationship would result in a \nperjury conviction.\n  On the obstruction charges, again the federal prosecutors told us \nthey would not bring charges based on the facts in this case.\n\n[[Page S1471]]\n\n  Ms. Lewinsky has testified that no one ever asked her to lie or \npromised her a job for her silence. Ms. Lewinsky further testified she \nnever discussed the contents of her testimony with the President, ever. \nFinally, she also testified that she believed she could file a truthful \naffidavit.\n  But there are two elements of the obstruction of justice charges that \ndo trouble me.\n  One is the transfer of gifts from Ms. Lewinsky to Betty Currie. That \ncould constitute concealment of evidence. But Betty Currie has \ntestified five times that Ms. Lewinsky called her to arrange for the \ntransfer of gifts. And both the President and Betty Currie have denied \nthat the President initiated the transfer.\n  The second troubling charge is the questioning of Betty Currie by the \nPresident after his deposition in the Jones case. I find it hard to \nbelieve the President was just refreshing his memory when on two \noccasions he put the same set of questions to Ms. Currie. That could \nconstitute witness tampering.\n  But at the time of these conversations, Betty Currie was not a \nwitness in any judicial proceeding. And she has testified that she did \nnot feel pressured to agree with the President.\n  Although I am not certain that there was no wrongdoing, I do conclude \nthat the charges have not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n                           impeachable crimes\n\n  That leads me to the second question: even if these charges were \nproven, is this a matter for impeachment, or should it be left to the \nordinary course of judicial proceeding?\n  For me, it is a question best answered by the rule of law that \ngoverns us all: the Constitution of the United States.\n  James Madison kept a journal of the Constitutional Convention. In it, \nhe said many of the Founders opposed impeachment altogether. Others \nbelieved impeachment was needed to protect against treason, bribery, or \nother ``attempts to subvert the Constitution.'' So a carefully crafted, \nvery narrow compromise was adopted.\n  Article II, section 4 originally read: ``The President . . . shall be \nremoved from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, Treason, \nBribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors against the United \nStates.''\n  James Wilson, a nineteenth century constitutional scholar has written \nthat impeachment was designed for ``great and publick [sic] offences by \nwhich the Commonwealth was brought into danger.''\n  These charges against the President just do not measure up to that \nstandard. Hiding presents under a bed. Asking a secretary leading \nquestions. These can hardly be the great and public offenses that our \nFounding Fathers had in mind. These charges, and the facts behind them, \nsimply do not bring our commonwealth into danger.\n  So is the President above the law? Most emphatically, no.\n  William Rawles, a contemporary of the Founders and a distinguished \ncommentator on the Constitution wrote: ``In general, those offenses \nwhich may be committed equally by a private person as a public officer, \nare not the subject of impeachment . . . [A]ll offenses not immediately \nconnected with office, except the two expressly mentioned, are left to \nthe ordinary course of judicial proceeding.''\n  I do not argue that no private wrongs can rise to the level of \nimpeachable offense, but they must be heinous crimes.\n  Article I, section 3, of the Constitution says: ``Judgment in Cases \nof Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office . . \n. but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to \nIndictment, trial, judgment and punishment according to law.''\n  The President is not above the law. He can be prosecuted, indicted, \nconvicted, and sentenced for alleged wrongful acts, just like any other \nAmerican.\n  We have our Founding Fathers' own words, distinguishing between \npublic crimes and those that involve the President's conduct as a \nprivate individual. We have their deeds to guide us as well. When Vice \nPresident Aaron Burr killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel and was \nindicted for murder, impeachment was not even considered.\n  Almost two hundred years later, the House Judiciary Committee \ndismissed a tax evasion charge against President Nixon when an \noverwhelming majority of the Committee concluded, in the words of \nCongressman Ray Thornton, ``these charges may be reached in due course \nin the regular process of law.''\n  In the case before us today, the underlying offense is that the \nPresident had an extra-marital affair. He is alleged to have lied about \nthat under oath, and to have obstructed justice. These are serious \nallegations, and we have considered them seriously.\n  Offensive as they were, the President's actions have nothing to do \nwith his official duties, nor do they constitute the most serious of \nprivate crimes. In my judgment, these are matters best left to the \ncriminal justice system.\n\n\n                          REMOVAL FROM OFFICE\n\n  That brings me to the third and final question: do the charges so \nfundamentally threaten our democratic system of government that they \nconstitute high crimes and misdemeanors and justify removal of the \nPresident from office?\n  Our Founding Fathers told us two things about impeachment. First, the \nmatter at hand had better be a very significant crime--a ``high crime'' \nthat threatens our fundamental freedoms. These alleged crimes do not \nmeet that standard. Second, they told us that it better not be \npartisan. That's why they required a \\2/3\\ vote in the Senate to remove \na President.\n  They feared the passions of what they called a ``faction.'' This is a \nclassic case of just that. This proceeding was partisan in the House. \nIt has become partisan here. I'm not casting aspersions here. I am \nstating a fact.\n  Impeachment will fail. And it should. It lacks the fundamental \nlegitimacy only a bipartisan consensus can provide.\n  My colleagues, the Republic still stands. Our safety as a Nation is \nnot in jeopardy. Our Constitution has not been shaken.\n  Voting to impeach the President under these circumstances would \nundermine the core principle that lies at the heart of our system of \ngovernment: the separation of powers. Our Founding Fathers made it \ndifficult to remove a sitting President by design. They were convinced \nof the wisdom of having three co-equal branches of government. They did \nnot want the President serving at the pleasure--or being removed at the \ndispleasure--of the legislative branch.\n  Our Founding Fathers were right. Removing a popularly elected \nPresident from office would have implications not only for this \nPresident, but for every President to follow, and ultimately for the \nvery system of government who hold so dear. Thomas Jefferson once said, \n``I know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society \nbut the people themselves.''\n  My colleagues, we are a democracy. In a government ``of the people, \nby the people, and for the people,'' we cannot ignore the will of the \npeople. Removing the President under these circumstances would be the \nmost fundamental violation of the rule of law. It would overturn the \nrule of the people as expressed in a free election. It would adopt \nminority rule, overturning the clear wishes of a majority of the \nAmerican people.\n  Our freedom and liberty are not threatened by the wrongful acts of \nthis President. But our freedom and liberty might be threatened if a \nminority can overturn the will of the majority.\n  There may yet come a time when we have no choice but to substitute \nour judgment for the will of the people. I pray I never see that time. \nI know it has not come in this case.\n  My colleagues, I will vote against the articles of impeachment in the \ncase of William Jefferson Clinton.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. We are nearing one of the most important votes most \nof us will ever cast.\n  As an Arkansan, the impeachment process has been long and difficult. \nPresident Clinton is a dominating political influence in Arkansas and \nstill immensely popular in my home state, so I am acutely aware of the \npolitical implications of this vote for me.\n  As an Arkansan, I share pride in one of our own having achieved so \nmuch and having attained the highest elective office in the land. \nArkansas has produced more than its share of political leaders--the \nJoe. T. Robinsons, the\n\n[[Page S1472]]\n\nHattie Caraways, the John McClellans, and J.W. Fulbrights. But never \nbefore has an Arkansan reached the Presidency. I, with all of Arkansas, \nwas proud. We knew William Jefferson Clinton's intellect, his grasp of \npolicy issues. We knew his personality, his charisma. We had seen for \nyears his remarkable political skills, his uncanny ability to connect \nwith people. I believe I'm like most Arkansans--deeply conflicted--\npride mixed with embarrassment, and most of all pain.\n  This trial is not about private conduct. It is not about the \nPresident's personal behavior. We are all sinners. We are all flawed \nhuman beings. The President's personal life is his personal life. It's \nhis business, not mine. The facts that are relevant are those relating \nto law.\n  This trial is not about process. It seems to me that throughout this \nlong drama, many have sought to put Ken Starr on trial or the House \nmanagers on trial. Was Ken Starr on a vendetta or was he just doing an \nunpleasant job? Whichever, we have to deal with the facts and the \nevidence. Did the House managers, as we have heard from the President's \ncounsel so often, ``want to win too much?'' Frankly, both sides wanted \nto win, both sides were fervent in their presentations, and I'm glad we \ndidn't hear half-hearted arguments. A vigorous prosecution and defense \nis the basis of a successful adversarial system. What we are doing is \nimportant. I'm glad they believe in what they are doing, but in the end \nit's the facts, the evidence, with which we must grapple. The process \nwith all its flaws is secondary. The reality is, we are faced with a \nbody of evidence.\n  This trial is not about punishment. It's not about getting our pound \nof flesh from the Democrats. It's not about getting our retribution on \nthe President. It's not political vengeance. It's not about polls. If \npolls had prevailed, Andrew Johnson would have been removed, and that \nwould have been wrong. To argue that a popular President should not be \nremoved regardless of his actions, merely because he is popular, is to \nlower our Constitutional Republic to a meaningless level.\n  To say popularity should be a factor in our decision is to say that \nbad poll numbers and unpopularity is an argument for removal of a \nPresident. How contrary to our constitutional system. The popularity of \nthis President should never been mentioned, in my opinion. Nor should \npolitical consequences of our votes be the basis for our decision of \nwhether to remove this President.\n  What I had to weigh was the evidence. Voting to remove a President--\nthe very thought sobers and humbles me. But the facts are so \ninescapable, the evidence so powerful.\n  I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that when the President \ntestified before the federal grand jury and said that he had been \ntruthful to his aides in what he had said about his relationship with \nMs. Lewinsky--that he committed perjury and obstructed justice. When he \ntold Sidney Blumenthal that Ms. Lewinsky was a stalker and he was a \nvictim, he was not being truthful. He was trying to destroy her \nreputation and he would have, had it not been for the dress. He lied, \nand he lied about his lie to the grand jury.\n  I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that when the President led \nBetty Currie through a false rendition of his relationship with Ms. \nLewinsky that he was tampering with a witness and obstructing justice. \nHe did this not once, but twice. His explanation that he was refreshing \nhis memory offends all common sense. When he denied this coaching \nbefore the grand jury, he obstructed justice and committed perjury. Of \ncourse, there is much more to this case, but how much do we need?\n  If this trial was only about one man's actions, it might be easier. \nBut this trial is about so much more--the office of the Presidency, the \nprecedent of lowering the bar on the importance of our nation's rule of \nlaw. It's about the oath Bill Clinton took when he was sworn in as our \nPresident, to uphold our nation's laws. And it's about the oath the \nPresident took when he swore to tell the truth, the whole truth and \nnothing but the truth before the grand jury. The sanctity of the oath \nis the basis of our judicial system. To lessen the significance of \nviolating the oath is in fact an attack on our legal system and the \nrule of law.\n  There are men and women across America who languish behind bars today \nbecause they committed the crime of perjury, lying under oath. How can \nwe tell America that our President, the highest government official in \nthe land, is treated differently?\n  While I was growing up in Gravette, Arkansas, life seemed much more \nsimple than it is today. It was a simpler time. But then and now, the \nbedrock of our society is still truth and justice. This hasn't changed. \nOn August 25, 1825, Daniel Webster said, ``Whatever government is not a \ngovernment of laws, is a despotism, let it be called what it may.''\n  Today is a somber day for our country. This trial has been a sad \nchapter of American history, and I have a heavy heart. As difficult as \nthese votes will be, I know that I could not serve the people of \nArkansas with a clear conscience unless I do what I believe is right \nand uphold the law. I will vote guilty on both articles of impeachment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. Chief Justice, this past year certainly has been a \ndifficult time for America. I have to say, as a citizen, as a woman, \nand as a parent, I cannot begin to describe how deeply disappointed and \nangry I am with the President.\n  I came to Washington, D.C. in 1992. Over the last 6 years I have \nworked with Bill Clinton. I trusted him. I thought I knew him. I \nrefused to believe he would demean the presidency in the way that he \nhas. His behavior was appalling and has hurt us all.\n  But as a Senator, I have an obligation under the Constitution that \ntranscends any sense of personal betrayal I might have. I am sworn to \nrender my judgment based on the evidence presented and the larger \nquestion of what the framers of the Constitution meant when they wrote \nthe impeachment clause.\n  I have listened carefully throughout this debate. I have read and \nlistened to every available article and argument. Like all of you, I \nhave spent more hours on this case that I ever wanted to and have felt \nthe tremendous weight of this decision.\n  I believe that perjury and obstruction of justice can be considered \nhigh crimes. The question is whether the facts in this case support the \nallegations that the President committed these crimes.\n  The Republican House managers presented a theory. But after listening \ncarefully to both sides and, most importantly, reviewing the words of \nthe witnesses themselves, they did not prove their theory of perjury \nand obstruction of justice beyond a reasonable doubt to me. If we are \nto remove a President for the first time in our Nation's history, none \nof us should have any doubts.\n  We must also ask ourselves how it would affect the country to remove \nthis President after such a partisan process. A conversation I had with \na constituent not long ago really struck a chord with me. He said to \nme,\n\n       I am old enough to remember President Nixon's resignation. \n     I know how deeply it affected the psyche of an entire \n     generation. I know it made many of us cynical of politics for \n     a long, long time. Please don't put us all through that \n     turmoil again. This country would be punished and hurt by a \n     presidential removal. This country doesn't deserve to be \n     punished for this President's behavior.\n\n  So despite my personal disgust with the President's actions, I intend \nto vote ``not guilty'' on both articles of impeachment.\n  Our founders were wise. They knew the President would be imperfect. \nThey knew he would stumble and fall. While it would be wrong to suggest \nthey approved of such behavior, they were not interested in the \nindividual and his flaws. They sought to protect the nation.\n  They set a very high standard for the legislative body to meet before \noverturning the results of an election--the very basis of our \ndemocracy. They declared it would only be for the crimes most \nthreatening to our nation. They did not establish the impeachment \nprocess to punish a wrongdoer; they established it to protect America.\n  This President's behavior was reprehensible, but it does not threaten \nour nation. In the past year, despite the scandal that ran on the front \npage nearly every day, our country has prospered. Our economy is \ngrowing. Our waters and air are cleaner. Our communities are safer. Our \neducation system is stronger. America is not poised on the brink of \ndisaster. Our democracy is safe.\n\n[[Page S1473]]\n\n  But what of our legacy in this process? What will I tell my daughter, \nor tell a classroom of young students? Well, it doesn't take a lawyer \nor a constitutional scholar to tell them that no matter how difficult \nit is, tell the truth. The lie will hurt you much, much more. It can \nconsume you, your friends, your family, your nation. It can destroy \nthose you love and diminish you forever in their eyes.\n  This President now knows that. His legacy will be tainted with the \nanguish he inflicted on the people and country he loves because of his \nselfish and disgraceful behavior. It is a weight that he alone will \nbear for the rest of his life.\n  We have heard a lot of emotions and strong feelings on this floor \nfrom both sides. I respect the deep convictions of everyone in this \nroom. I am saddened it has appeared partisan. But it is my hope that we \ncan now turn the page on this sad part of America's history and put an \nend to the recriminations.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, point of personal privilege.\n  It is hard to stand before you without Scott Bates behind me. I knew \nhim as all of you did as a loyal, excellent Senate employee. But I also \nknew him as a Dad. We stood together as parents on a soccer field \ncheering on our daughters in victory and hugging them in defeat. He \nwill be missed.\n  But his absence should serve as a reminder that although we have been \ntotally engrossed in this issue for far too long, there is life outside \nof these doors. There are friends to be hugged, kids to be educated, \nparents to take care of.\n  I hope when this day is over, we will set aside our differences and \nremember there are a lot more important things each of us needs to be \nconcentrating on, both professionally and personally. It's time to move \non.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I intend to vote to convict the \nPresident of the United States on both articles of impeachment. To say \nI do so with regret will sound trite to some, but I mean it sincerely. \nI deeply regret that this day has come to pass.\n  I bear no animosity for the President. I take no partisan \nsatisfaction from this matter. I don't lightly dismiss the public's \nclear opposition to conviction. And I am genuinely concerned that the \ninstitution of the Presidency not be harmed, either by the President's \nconduct, or by Congress' reaction to his conduct.\n  Indeed, I take no satisfaction at all from this vote, with one \nexception--and an important exception it is--that by voting to convict \nI have been spared reproach by my conscience for shirking my duty.\n  The Senate faces an awful choice, to be sure. But, to my mind, it is \na clear choice. I am persuaded that the President has violated his oath \nof office by committing perjury and by obstructing justice, and that by \nso doing he has forfeited his office.\n  As my colleagues across the aisle have so often reminded me, the \ncountry does not want the President removed. And, they ask, are we not, \nfirst and foremost, servants of the public will? Even if we believe the \nPresident to be guilty of the offenses charged, and even if we believe \nthose offenses rise to the level of impeachment, should we risk the \nnational trauma of forcing his removal against the clearly expressed \ndesire of the vast majority of Americans that he should not be removed \neven if he is guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice?\n  I considered that question very carefully, and I arrived at an answer \nby reversing the proposition. If a clear majority of the American \npeople were to demand the conviction of the President, should I vote \nfor his conviction even if I believed the President to be innocent of \nthe offenses he is charged with? Of course not. Neither, then, should I \nlet public opinion restrain me from voting to convict if I determine \nthe President is guilty.\n  But are these articles of impeachment of sufficient gravity to \nwarrant removal or can we seek their redress by some other means short \nof removing the President from office? Some of those who argue for a \nlesser sanction, including the President's able counsel, contend that \nirrespective of the President's guilt or innocence, neither of the \narticles charge him with high crimes and misdemeanors. Nothing less \nthan an assault on the integrity of our constitutional government rises \nto that level. The President's offenses were committed to cover up \nprivate not public misconduct. Therefore, if he thwarted justice he did \nso for the perfectly understandable and forgivable purpose of keeping \nhidden an embarrassing personal shortcoming that, were it discovered, \nwould harm only his family and his reputation, but would not impair our \nsystem of government.\n  This, too, is an appealing rationalization for acquittal. But it is \njust that, a rationalization. Nowhere in the Constitution or in the \nexpressed views of our founders are crimes intended to conceal the \nPresident's character flaws distinguished from crimes intended to \nsubvert democracy. The President thwarted justice. No matter how unfair \nhe or we may view a process that forces a President to disclose his own \nfailings, we should not excuse or fail to punish in the \nconstitutionally prescribed manner evidence that the President has \ndeliberately thwarted the course of justice.\n  I do not desire to sit in judgement of the President's private \nmisconduct. It is truly a matter for him and his family to resolve. I \nsincerely wish circumstances had allowed the President to keep his \npersonal life private. I have done things in my private life that I am \nnot proud of. I suspect many of us have. But we are not asked to judge \nthe President's character flaws. We are asked to judge whether the \nPresident, who swore an oath to faithfully execute his office, \ndeliberately subverted--for whatever purpose--the rule of law.\n  All of my life, I have been instructed never to swear an oath to my \ncountry in vain. In my former profession, those who violated their \nsworn oath were punished severely and considered outcasts from our \nsociety. I do not hold the President to the same standard that I hold \nmilitary officers to. I hold him to a higher standard. Although I may \nadmit to failures in my private life, I have at all times, and to the \nbest of my ability, kept faith with every oath I have ever sworn to \nthis country. I have known some men who kept that faith at the cost of \ntheir lives.\n  I cannot--not in deference to public opinion, or for political \nconsiderations, or for the sake of comity and friendship--I cannot \nagree to expect less from the President.\n  Most officers of my acquaintance would have resigned their commission \nhad they been discovered violating their oath. The President did not \nchoose that course of action. He has left it to the Senate to determine \nhis fate. And the Senate, as we all know, is going to acquit the \nPresident. As much as I would like to, I cannot join in his acquittal.\n  The House managers have made, and I believe some of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle would agree, a persuasive case that the \nPresident is guilty of perjury and obstruction. The circumstances that \nled to these offenses may be tawdry, trivial to some, and usually of a \nvery private nature. But the President broke the law. Not a tawdry law, \nnot a trivial law, not a private law.\n  The tortured explanations with which the President's attorneys have \ntried to defend him against both articles fail to raise reasonable \ndoubts about his guilt. It seems clear to me, and to most Americans, \nthat the President deliberately lied under oath, and that he tried to \nencourage others to lie under oath on his behalf. Presidents may not be \nexcused from such an abuse no matter how intrusive, how unfair, how \ndistasteful are the judicial proceedings they attempt to subvert.\n  The President's defenders want to know how can I be certain that the \noffenses, even if true, warrant removal from office. They are not \nexpressly mentioned in the Constitution as impeachable offenses. Nor \ndid the founders identify perjury or obstruction as high crimes or high \nmisdemeanors. Were an ordinary citizen accused of perjury in a civil \nproceeding he or she would in all likelihood not be prosecuted or \nforced out of political necessity into a perjury trap.\n  No, an ordinary citizen would not be treated as the President has \nbeen treated. But ordinary citizens don't enforce the laws for the rest \nof us. Ordinary citizens don't have the world's mightiest armed forces \nat their command. Ordinary citizens do not usually have the opportunity \nto be figures of historical importance.\n\n[[Page S1474]]\n\n  Presidents are not ordinary citizens. They are extraordinary, in that \nthey are vested with so much more authority and power than the rest of \nus. We have a right; indeed, we have an obligation, to hold them \nstrictly accountable to the rule of law.\n  Are perjury and obstruction of justice expressly listed as high \ncrimes and misdemeanors? No. Why? Because they are self-evidently so. \nJust as the President is self-evidently the nation's chief law \nenforcement officer, despite his attorneys' quibbling to the contrary. \nIt is self-evident to us all, I hope, that we cannot overlook, dismiss \nor diminish the obstruction of justice by the very person we charge \nwith taking care that the laws are faithfully executed. It is self-\nevident to me. And accordingly, regretfully, I must vote to convict the \nPresident, and urge my colleagues to do the same.''\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. Chief Justice, the great question now before the \nSenate is not whether the rule of law will prevail--it surely will--\nboth by the actions of this body and by possible proceedings within the \njudicial system.\n  The question before the Senate is whether we should take action \nagainst the President beyond that allowed for in our nation's courts. \nWe are, I believe, confronted by two threshold questions which must \nfirst be resolved before consideration can or need be given to weighing \nthe evidence presented by the House Managers. First, is whether the \nArticles of Impeachment have been adequately drawn to allow the accused \nto know with precision the wrong-doing to which he is accused, and to \nrequire that a \\2/3\\ majority vote of the Senate be secured upon a \nsingle act of wrong-doing in order to convict. As a second threshold \nmatter, if the Articles are at least adequately drawn, do they, if \ntrue, allege wrong-doing of sufficient import to justify for the very \nfirst time in our nation's long history, the over-turning of the \npeople's will as expressed in a free, fair and democratic national \nelection? I am troubled by the adequacy of the articles, but even \naccepting them, the second threshold question of impeachability is \nsimply not met.\n  Only if these threshold questions are adequately met in the mind of \nan individual Senator, can that Senator proceed to determine whether \nthe weight of the evidence is sufficient to convict. And even if both \nthreshold questions are ignored, it is impossible for me to say that \nthe circumstantial evidence presented reaches a ``beyond a reasonable \ndoubt'' standard on either article. Reasonable doubt means that if \nthere are multiple reasonable theories as to what occurred--if one of \nthe reasonable theories is consistent with innocence, then an acquittal \nmust follow. Especially relative to article two--I can understand the \nbelief of some that a plausible scenario of obstruction was \nestablished. Some may even believe that the President was more likely \nthan not obstructing justice. But the evidence is clearly not so \npowerful as to lead anyone to believe that no reasonable and innocent \nscenario remains.\n  I am both profoundly honored and humbled to have this historic \nresponsibility to participate with my Senate colleagues, Republican and \nDemocrat, in perhaps the most grave proceeding envisioned by the \nauthors of our national Constitution. I have listened carefully to both \nsides of this dispute, and I have also carefully reviewed the thoughts \nof many of our nation's leading scholars of history and constitutional \nlaw. It is clear to me that the results of this trial have \nramifications which go far beyond the fortunes of William Jefferson \nClinton.\n  The decision made by the Senate this week will have an utterly \nprofound impact on the relationship between the executive and \nlegislative branches of our government for the rest of time. \nAccordingly, it is essential that the decisions made in this proceeding \nnot be driven by transitory passions of partisan politics, but rather, \nwith an eye toward the long-term stability and integrity of our \ndemocracy.\n  My humble reading of history leads me to believe that the never-\nfailing bipartisan honoring of national presidential elections over \nthese past two centuries has been one of the greatest sources of our \nnational success. While holding a president accountable to all the same \ncivil and criminal laws that apply to the general citizenry is \nabsolutely essential, the writers of our Constitution properly intended \nfor the reversal of fair elections at the hands of Congress to be \nexceedingly rare and difficult.\n  The learned opinions of our nation's leading scholars overwhelmingly \nsupport the understanding that presidents should not be removed from \noffice by Congress short of some horrific personal misconduct or \nmisconduct which arises from executive authority and threatens the \nnation--such as treason or bribery. By requiring a \\2/3\\ vote for the \nover-turning of presidential elections, the founders of our nation also \nmade it crystal clear that such an extraordinary step should not and \ncannot be taken unless there is an overwhelming bipartisan outcry \nagainst the President's actions.\n\n  The American public and most Members of Congress, including myself, \nhave criticized President Clinton's personal conduct in harsh terms. \nBut the American public also seems to understand that at stake is not \nsimply Bill Clinton's future, but the integrity of our election system \nand the long-term freedom of the executive branch from partisan \ncongressional attack--this understanding about the need for stability, \nfor proportionality, for continuity, is a natural and a deeply \nconservative inclination on the part of our citizenry.\n  The writers of our Constitution wanted some degree of proportionality \nbetween a president's conduct and the penalties applied--otherwise they \nwould have made impeachment applicable to all crimes and misdemeanors. \nIt is certainly conceivable that the will of the people expressed in an \nelection may someday be rightly overturned by Congress. But it is also \ncertain to me that while this president's personal conduct (involving \nimmaterial testimony to a lawsuit dismissed by a federal court as \nhaving no merit) is deserving of public condemnation, and even possible \nprosecution within the judicial system, it simply does not rise to the \nlevel of extraordinary danger to the nation that justifies removal from \noffice.\n  Some will no doubt say that I have set a high standard for \noverturning presidential elections. I would very much agree. \nParticularly as a recently former member of the House of \nRepresentatives, I have witnessed first hand the depth and the \nintensity of partisan anger that can occur from time to time in \nCongress and among portions of the national public. It is a reaction to \nthat open partisanship demonstrated by the House and the Independent \nCounsel that surely is at the foundation of the American public's \noverwhelming contempt for this proceeding and the view that this \nprocess is politics as usual, an exercise in raw political power and \nbeneath what should be the dignity of Congress.\n  I have no certain solutions for that sad and angry state of affairs, \nother than to attempt to conduct my own political life in as thoughtful \nand moderate a manner as I am capable, but I believe the Constitution \nprovided our nation with a strong bulwark against negative and hateful \npartisanship by creating an executive branch which is largely shielded \nfrom congressional partisanship and which is instead disciplined by law \nand by the electoral will of the people.\n  I greatly fear that any lesser standard would result, even without an \nindependent counsel law, in a situation whereby civil actions against \nstanding presidents will be routinely brought as yet another \ndestructive partisan political tactic. These multiple and nefarious \nactions will then be followed by never-ending legal discovery \nproceedings, and they in turn followed by impeachment articles or the \nthreat of impeachment each time the House is controlled by a different \npolitical party than the Presidency. I fear the wrong decision here \nwill lead our nation into an ever downward spiral where impeachment \nproceedings will be routine.\n  It is critically important, in my view, for this United States Senate \nto say, Stop!'' Enough!'' We must send an unmistakable message to the \nHouse, the nation and the world, that we will not permit the stability \nand independence of the executive branch of our government to be \njeopardized by anything less than heinous crimes or gross threats to \nthe nation.\n  This leaves, of course, other avenues for Congress and the public to \nexpress great displeasure with the President's dishonorable conduct. If \nillegal activity did in fact take place, that activity\n\n[[Page S1475]]\n\nwould be subject to discipline in the courts. While there are divided \nopinions on its wisdom, it is possible that some sort of collective \ncensure may be agreed upon by the Senate, and certainly individual \nSenators are free to place their condemnations of the President's \npersonal behavior in the Congressional Record. The House impeachment of \nthe President, the public humiliation of Bill Clinton and his family, \nas well as the great private fortune this dispute will have consumed \nwill also serve as punishment enough. But, I think it is also important \nfor this Senate to understand that the writers of our Constitution did \nnot create an impeachment process as one more form of punishment, but \nexclusively to protect the viability of our nation.\n\n  Given my sacred oaths as a United States Senator and as a participant \nin this impeachment trial, and given my abiding commitment to the \nConstitution and the well-being of our nation, I have no choice but to \nvote against both Articles of Impeachment. I do not know nor do I care \nwhat the political consequences might be of the decision I make here--I \nam a Democrat elected six consecutive times state-wide from my largely \nRepublican state, and I have long been proud of the bipartisan support \nextended to me by the good people of South Dakota. In turn, I have long \nrecognized that neither political party has a monopoly on good ideas or \nbad, good people or bad. But I know this--the issue before me is too \ngrave for politics. At the end of the day, when my service in this body \nis done, I want my children, my family and myself to view my decisions \nhere as honorable, as an exercise in responsible judgement, and in a \nsmall way, as efforts that strengthened the bulwark of democracy that \nour Constitution represents.\n  The President dishonorably lied to the American people, however, the \ntwo Articles before the Senate fail, first because they do not allege \noffenses that give rise to removal from office, and secondly, because \nit cannot be said that the evidence proves guilt of perjury or \nobstruction of justice beyond all reasonable doubt (to such a degree \nthat no innocent and reasonable explanation exists).\n  I will vote not guilty on both Article one and Article two.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. Chief Justice, for the first time in 120 years, and \nonly for the second time in U.S. history, the Senate is about to \nconclude a Presidential impeachment trial. Our Founding Fathers viewed \nthe power to remove a President as a necessary constitutional \nsafeguard, but they wanted to make certain that the process was \nsufficiently difficult that the will of the voters would be overturned \nonly for the gravest of reasons. They wrote the words ``high crimes and \nmisdemeanors'' as a threshold, but left it to us to determine what \ntransgressions met this standard. All of us have endeavored to fulfill \nthis enormous responsibility.\n  From the beginning of the consideration of impeachment last year, \nmany Members of Congress in both parties have made public statements \nexpressing their opinions that the President lied to a federal grand \njury and that he obstructed justice on numerous occasions. These \njudgments are apparently shared by large majorities of the American \npeople as illustrated in frequent public opinion polls. The same polls \nhave consistently found that a large majority of Americans do not want \nthe President to suffer the Constitutional consequence of these \nbreaches of law, namely, removal from office.\n  Since the House voted for impeachment, almost all 45 Democrats and \nsome Republicans in the Senate have voiced their skepticism about \nvoting to remove President Clinton from office. Early in the trial, 44 \nDemocrats voted to dismiss the impeachment proceedings outright. Thus, \na two-thirds majority vote needed for a guilty verdict has never been a \nlikely outcome of the trial.\n  In the background, most Senate Democrats and several Republicans have \nworked on a motion to censure President Clinton. Our distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Feinstein, drafted a censure resolution that \nattracted substantial bipartisan support and was published in the New \nYork Times of February 6, 1999. It stated:\n\n       Whereas William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United \n     States, engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a \n     subordinate employee in the White House, which was shameless, \n     reckless and indefensible;\n       Whereas William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United \n     States, deliberately misled and deceived the American people \n     and officials in all branches of the United States \n     Government;\n       Whereas William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United \n     States, gave false or misleading testimony and impeded \n     discovery of evidence in judicial proceedings;\n       Whereas William Jefferson Clinton's conduct in this matter \n     is unacceptable for a President of the United States, does \n     demean the Office of the President as well as the President \n     himself, and creates disrespect for the laws of the land;\n       Whereas President Clinton fully deserves censure for \n     engaging in such behavior;\n       Whereas future generations of Americans must know that such \n     behavior is not only unacceptable but also bears grave \n     consequences, including loss of integrity, trust and respect;\n       Whereas William Jefferson Clinton remains subject to \n     criminal and civil actions;\n       Whereas William Jefferson Clinton's conduct in this matter \n     has brought shame and dishonor to himself and to the Office \n     of the President; and\n       Whereas William Jefferson Clinton, through his conduct in \n     this matter, has violated the trust of the American people: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate does hereby censure \n     William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, \n     and condemns his conduct in the strongest terms.\n\n  Citizens might ask how a Senator could vote for a resolution stating \nthat President Clinton ``deliberately misled and deceived the American \npeople and officials in all branches of the United States Government'' \nand ``gave false or misleading testimony and impeded discovery of \nevidence in judicial proceedings'' and yet fail to vote ``guilty'' on \narticles of impeachment that specifically mention perjury and \nobstruction of justice. The answer to that question is at the heart of \nunderstanding the Senate trial.\n\n  With few exceptions, Senators recognize that the Constitution gives \nonly one outcome to a verdict of ``guilty,'' namely, removal from \noffice. At the same time, many Senators are shocked by conduct which \nthey call ``shameless, reckless, and indefensible,'' and they want \ntheir constituents to know that they have not been fooled or \noverwhelmed by Presidential charm. They have taken the initiative to \nexplicitly denounce the bizarre conduct and the extraordinary \ncorruption of this President. Members of both parties have deplored the \nfact that the President conducted an illicit sustained physical sexual \nrelationship in spaces close to the Oval Office and publicly denied \nthis to his family, his staff, and in televised statements to the world \nonly to see all of the elaborate cover-up collapse after DNA tests on \nthe dress of a young woman.\n  But the impeachment trial of President Clinton is not about adultery. \nThe impeachment trial involves the President's illegal efforts to deny \na fair result in the suit brought by Ms. Paula Jones. I have no doubt \nthat the President worked deliberately to deny justice in this suit. In \ndoing so, he lied to a federal grand jury and worked to induce others \nto give false testimony, thus obstructing justice.\n  Ms. Jones has often been described as a small person in our judicial \nsystem. In contrast, the President, who at the time of his inaugural \ntakes a solemn oath to preserve and protect equal justice under the law \nfor even the most humble of Americans, is a giant figure. As Senators \nwho also take a solemn oath, we must ask ourselves the fundamental \nquestion: ``Is any man or woman above the law?''\n  The legal defense team for the President does not admit that there is \nadequate proof of either perjury or obstruction of justice. They \ncontend that Senators must embrace a theory of ``immaculate \nobstruction'' in which jobs are found, gifts are concealed, false \naffidavits are filed, and the character of a witness is publicly \nimpugned, all without the knowledge or direction of the President, who \nis the sole beneficiary of these actions. The President's lawyers \nfurther contend that such crimes are, in any event, insufficient to \nremove the President. The drafters of the Constitution would have \nrejected these rationalizations for the indefensible Presidential \nmisconduct at issue. They were political men with a profound reverence \nfor the sanctity of the oath and our entire system of justice. They did \nnot suggest that Senators park their common sense and\n\n[[Page S1476]]\n\ntheir stewardship for the security of our country at the Senate door as \nthey entered into an impeachment trial.\n  In fact, we have discovered in this trial that the founding fathers \nwanted the Senate to act as ``triers'' of fact and in the roles of both \ntrial court and jury. Most importantly, they wanted us to act as \nguardians of the Constitution and thus the liberty and the rights under \nlaw of each individual American. Liberty itself is directly threatened \nwhen a President subverts the very judicial system that secures those \nrights.\n  During this trial, I have concluded that the prosecutors made their \ncase. I will vote to remove President Clinton from office not only \nbecause he is guilty of both articles of impeachment, but also because \nI believe the crimes committed here demonstrate that he is capable of \nlying routinely whenever it is convenient. He is not trustworthy. \nSimply to be near him in the White House has meant not only tragic \nheartache for his wife and his daughter but enormous legal bills for \nstaff members and friends who admired him and yearned for his success \nbut who have been caught up in his incessant ``war room'' strategies to \nmaintain him in office. Senator Feinstein begins her censure resolution \nwith the appropriate word ``shameless.'' The President should have \nsimply resigned and spared his country the ordeal of this impeachment \ntrial and its aftermath.\n  We have been fortunate that this damaged presidency has occurred \nduring a time of relative peace and prosperity. In times of war or \nnational emergency it is often necessary for the President to call upon \nthe nation to make great economic and personal sacrifices. In these \noccasions, our President had best be trustworthy--a truth teller whose \nlife of principled leadership and integrity we can count upon. Some \ncommentators have suggested that with the President having less than \ntwo years left in his term of office, the easiest approach is to let \nthe clock expire while hoping that he is sufficiently careful, if not \ncontrite, to avoid reckless and indefensible conduct. But as Senators, \nwe know that the dangers of the world constantly threaten us. Rarely do \ntwo years pass without the need for strong Presidential leadership and \nthe exercise of substantial moral authority from the White House.\n  Of particular concern are the implications of the President's \nbehavior for our national security. As Commander-in-Chief, President \nClinton fully understood the risks that he was imposing on the \ncountry's security with his secret affair in the White House. Even in \nthis post-Cold War era, foreign intelligence agents constantly look for \nopportunities for deception, propaganda, and blackmail. No higher \ntargets exist than the President and the White House. The President \neven acknowledged in a phone call with Ms. Lewinsky that foreign agents \ncould be monitoring their conversations. Yet this knowledge did not \ndissuade the President from continuing his affair. With premeditation, \nhe chose his own gratification above the security of his country and \nthe success of his presidency. Then he chose to compound the damage by \nsystematically lying about it over the span of many months.\n  I believe that our country will be stronger and better prepared to \nmeet our challenges with a cleansing of the Presidency. The President \nof the United States is the most powerful person in the world because \nwe are the strongest country economically and militarily, and in the \nappeal of our idealism for liberty and freedom of conscience. Our \nPresident must be strong because a President personifies the rule of \nlaw that he is sworn to uphold and protect. We must believe him and \ntrust him if we are to follow him. His influence on domestic and \nforeign policies comes from that trust, which a lifetime of words, \ndeeds, and achievements has built.\n  President Clinton has betrayed that trust. His leadership has been \ndiminished because most Americans have come to the cynical conclusion \nthat they must read between the lines of his statements and try to \ncatch a glimmer of truth amidst the spin. His subordinates have \ndemeaned public life by contending that ``everybody does it'' as a \ndefense of why the President has erred so grievously. But every \nPresident does not lie to a federal grand jury. Every President does \nnot obstruct justice. The last President to do so was President Nixon, \nand he had sufficient reverence for the office to resign before the \nHouse even voted articles of impeachment.\n  The impeachment trial must come to an end. The Presidency will be \nstrengthened and our ability as Americans to meet important challenges \nwill be strengthened if we begin to restore our faith in the truth and \njustice that our government must exemplify and preserve. It will not be \nenough simply to condemn the tragic misdeeds of President Clinton. He \nmust be removed from office as the Constitution prescribes, and we must \ncelebrate the strength of that same Constitution which also provides a \npath for a new beginning.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me begin by stating what I believe the American people \nview as the obvious. There are no good guys in this sordid affair. \nRightly or wrongly, the public has concluded that the President is an \nadulterer and liar; that Ken Starr has abused his authority by unfair \ntactics born out of vindictiveness; that the House Managers have acted \nin a narrowly partisan way and are now desperately attempting to \njustify their actions for their own political reputation. Finally, they \nhave concluded that Monica Lewinsky was both used and a user, while \nLinda Tripp, Lucianne Goldberg, Paula Jones and her official and \nunofficial legal team are part of a larger political plot to ``get the \nPresident''.\n  All of that is beyond our ability to effect. Our job is not to \ndissect the motives or even the tactics of Ken Starr, the trial \nlawyers, Linda Tripp, and others. Our only job is to determine whether \nthe President of the United States by his conduct committed the \nspecific acts alleged in the two Articles of Impeachment. Not \ngenerally, but specifically: Did he do what is alleged? And if he did, \ndo these actions rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors \nnecessary to justify the most obviously anti-democratic act the Senate \ncan engage in--overturning an election by convicting the President.\n  It is very important--both for history's sake and for fairness' \nsake--that we keep our eye on the ball. When I tried cases, I learned \nfrom a man named Sid Balick--he used to say at the outset to the jury:\n\n       Keep your eye on the ball. The issue is not whether my \n     client is a man you would want your daughter to date--a man \n     you would invite home to dinner. The issue is did my client \n     kill Cock Robbin--period.\n\n  But if we listen to the oft-times confusing presentation of the House \nManagers--they would have us think that it is sufficient for us to \nconclude that we would not trust him with our daughters and not invite \nhim home for dinner in order to convict.\n  Much more is required. The House set the standard we must repair to \nin the Articles--did he commit a criminal offense? That is what they \nallege; that is what they must prove.\n  The Managers keep saying that this case is about what standards we \nwant our President to meet. We hear Flanders Fields intoned--the honor \nof our most decorated heroes. How incredibly self-serving and \nautocratic such a plea is.\n  The American people are fully capable--without our guidance or \nadvice--to determine what standards they want our President to meet. \nThat is an appropriate question to ask ourselves when we enter the \nvoting booth to vote--it is not when we rise on this floor to vote.\n  Spare me from those who would tell the American people what standard \nthey must apply when voting for President. Ours is an Impeachment \nstandard and our oath to do justice under that standard.\n  Impeachment is about what standard to use in deciding whether or not \nto remove a President duly elected by the people.\n  These are two very different questions and we must not, we cannot, \nget them confused. You and I and the American people can apply any \nstandard we want our President to meet when we go to the polls on \nelection day.\n  Only the Constitution can supply the standards to use in deciding \nwhether or not to remove the President--and--in my view, this case does \nnot meet that standard, for two reasons.\n\n[[Page S1477]]\n\n  First, the facts do not sustain the House Managers' case. According \nto the House's own theory, we must find that the President has violated \nfederal criminal statutes--not just that he did bad things. In all good \nconscience, I just cannot believe that any jury would convict the \nPresident of any of the criminal charges on these facts. I also believe \nthat it is our constitutional duty to give the President the benefit of \nthe doubt on the facts. To me, the allegations that the President \nviolated Title 18 were left in a shambles on this floor.\n  But I do not have time to dwell on the facts. So let me turn to the \nsecond reason: the President's actions do not rise to the level \nrequired by the Constitution for the removal of a sitting President.\n  We have heard it argued repeatedly that the Constitution does not \ncreate different standards for Judges and the President. But that \nargument fails to comprehend the organizing principle of our \nconstitutional system--the separation of powers. The framers divided \nthe power of the federal government into three branches in order to \nsafeguard liberty. This innovation--the envy of every nation on earth--\ncan only serve its fundamental purpose if each branch remains strong \nand independent of the others.\n  We needed a President who was independent enough to spearhead and \nsign the Civil Rights Act. We needed a President who was independent \nenough to lead the nation and the world in the Persian Gulf War. We \nstill need an independent President.\n  The constitutional scholarship overwhelmingly recognizes that the \nfundamental structural commitment to separation of powers requires us \nto view the President as different than a federal judge. Consider our \npower to discipline and even expel an individual Senator. In such a \ncase, we do not remove the head of a separate branch and so do not \nthreaten the constitutional balance of powers. To remove a President is \nto decapitate another branch and to undermine the independence \nnecessary for it to fulfill its constitutional role.\n  Only a President is chosen by the people in a national election. No \nSenator, no Representative can make this claim. To remove a duly \nelected President clashes with democratic principles in a way that \nsimply has no constitutional parallel. By contrast, there is nothing \nanti-democratic in the Senate removing a judge, who was appointed and \nnot elected by the people.\n  Another contention we continue to hear is that the Framers clearly \nthought that obstruction of justice of any kind by a President was a \nhigh crime and misdemeanor. For this they cite the colloquy between \nColonel George Mason and James Madison, who argued that a President who \nabused his pardon power could be impeached. That colloquy illustrates \nthat it is not any obstruction that would satisfy the Constitution--\nrather, that the framers were immediately concerned about abuses of \nofficial power, such as the pardon power.\n  The House Managers have relied repeatedly on Alexander Hamilton's \nexplanation of impeachment found in Federalist No. 65. But careful \nreading demonstrates that these articles of impeachment are a \nconstitutionally insufficient ground for removing the President from \noffice. Federalist No. 65 states:\n\n       The subjects of [the impeachment court's] jurisdiction are \n     those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public \n     men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some \n     public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar \n     propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to \n     injuries done immediately to the society itself.\n\n  Hamilton had the word ``political'' typed in all capital letters to \nemphasize that this is the central, defining element of any impeachable \noffense. Having emphasized its meaning, he did not leave its definition \nto chance. While all crimes by definition harm society, impeachable \noffenses involve a specific category of offenses. Using Hamilton's \nterms, these are offenses committed when ``public men'' who ``violat[e] \nsome public trust'' cause ``injuries done immediately to the society \nitself.'' The public trust that resides in, to use Hamilton's hoary \nphrase, ``public men'' is what we would call today official power.\n  What other construction can be given these words? Hamilton did not \ndefine an impeachable offense to be any offense committed by public \nmen. He did not define an impeachable offense to be any reprehensible \nact committed by a bad man. Only those acts that abuse public office \nand so harm the public directly and politically are impeachable.\n  While I would like to take credit for this insight into Hamilton's \nmeaning, I actually stand in a line of interpretation that stretches \nback to the founding era. William Rawle wrote the first distinguished \ncommentary on the Constitution, ``A View of the Constitution of the \nUnited States of America.'' In this treatise, he came to precisely the \nsame interpretation I have described. He said, ``The causes of \nimpeachment can only have reference to public character and official \nduty. . . . In general those which may be committed equally by a \nprivate person as a public officer are not the subject of \nimpeachment.''\n  Joseph Story was not only a long-serving and important Justice of the \nSupreme Court of the United States, he was a preeminent constitutional \nscholar and author of a treatise that remains an important source for \nunderstanding the Constitution's meaning. He too emphasized that ``it \nis not every offense that by the constitution is . . . impeachable.'' \nWhich offenses did he regard to be impeachable? ``Such kinds of \nmisdeeds . . . as peculiarly injure the commonwealth by the abuse of \nhigh offices of trust.'' Justice Story tied the definition of \nimpeachable offenses to the purpose that underlies the separation of \npowers--safeguarding the liberty of the people against abusive exercise \nof governmental power. He observed that impeachment ``is not so much \ndesigned to punish an offender as to secure the state against gross \nofficial misdemeanors.''\n  There is no question that the Constitution sets the bar for \nimpeachment very high--especially where the President is involved. \nFederalist 65 bears this out, as do numerous other commentaries.\n  But Federalist 65 also sounds a warning--again, it is a warning that \nhas been invoked over and over again--that impeachments inevitably risk \nbeing hijacked by partisan political forces.\n  Federalist 65 worried that the ``animosities, partialities, \ninfluence, and interest on one side or the other'' would enable \npartisans to find a way to interpret words such as high crimes and \nmisdemeanors to match the outcome they otherwise wished to reach--not \nnecessarily out of any malevolence, but simply because of the great \ncapacity that we all have to rationalize.\n  Here the rationalization is pretty easy--the President is a disgrace \nto the office, I honor and revere the office of the Presidency, so \nthere must be some way to get this man out of that office. Therefore, \nhis actions must rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.\n  It is tempting to go down that road --but this is precisely the \ntemptation that the Framers urged us to avoid.\n  In Federalist 65, Hamilton defended the United States Senate as the \nonly body that could possibly hear a presidential impeachment. ``Where \nelse than in the Senate could have been found a tribunal sufficiently \ndignified, or sufficiently independent? What other body would be likely \nto feel confidence enough in its own situation to preserve, unawed and \nuninfluenced the necessary impartiality between an individual accused \nand . . . his accusers?''\n  Hamilton was placing the responsibility to be impartial squarely upon \nus--a responsibility that has become embodied in the oath we took when \nthe trial began.\n  Charles Black, the renowned constitutional law professor from Yale, \nboiled down the attitude that we as Senators must adopt in order to \nachieve an impartiality and independence sufficient to the \nresponsibilities of impeachment. He said we must act with a \n``principled political neutrality.''\n  That is a tough standard to meet. In the Johnson impeachment, for \nexample, James Blaine originally voted for the impeachment of the \nPresident in the House. Years later he admitted his mistake, saying \nthat `the sober reflection of after years has persuaded many who \nfavored Impeachment that it was not justifiable on the charges made,\n\n[[Page S1478]]\n\nand that its success would have resulted in greater injury to free \ninstitutions than Andrew Johnson in his utmost endeavor was able to \ninflict.''\n  And in our contemporary situation, former President Ford and our \ndistinguished colleague and former majority leader, Robert Dole, have \nboth urged us not to go down the road to impeachment, but to seek other \nmeans to express our displeasure.\n  Charles Black knew that principled political neutrality was hard to \nachieve, so he suggested one approach. He suggested that prior to \nvoting, a Senator should ask:\n\n       Would I have answered the same question the same way if it \n     came up with respect to a President towards whom I felt \n     oppositely from the way I feel toward the President \n     threatened with removal?\n\n  In reaching a final decision, the question I wish to pose to my \ncolleagues is this: Can you legitimately conclude that you would vote \nto remove a sitting President if he were a person towards whom you felt \noppositely than you do toward Bill Clinton?\n  Given the essentially anti-democratic nature of impeachment and the \ngreat dangers inherent in the too ready exercise of that power, \nimpeachment has no place in our system of constitutional democracy \nexcept as an extreme measure--reserved for breaches of the public trust \nby a President who so violates his official duties, misuses his \nofficial powers or places our system of government at such risk that \nour constitutional government is put in immediate danger by his \ncontinuing to serve out the term to which the people of the United \nStates elected him.\n  In my judgment, trying to assume a perspective of principled \npolitical neutrality, the case before us falls far, far short on the \nfacts and on the law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of a more comprehensive \nstatement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Senator Joseph R. Biden's Comprehensive Statement On Impeachment \n                             Deliberations\n\n       There are no good guys in this sordid affair. Rightly or \n     wrongly, the public has concluded that the President is an \n     adulterer and liar. Ken Starr has abused his authority by \n     unfair tactics born out of vindictiveness. The House Managers \n     have acted in a narrowly partisan way and are now desperately \n     attempting to justify their actions for their own political \n     reputation and that Monica Lewinsky was both used and a user, \n     while Linda Tripp, Lucianne Goldberg, Paula Jones and her \n     official and unofficial legal team are part of a larger \n     political plot to ``get the President''.\n       At this point, all that occurred before this is beyond my \n     ability to affect. My job as a United States Senator hearing \n     an impeachment trial is not to dissect the motives or even \n     the tactics of Ken Starr, the trial lawyers, Linda Tripp and \n     others. My only job is to determine whether the President of \n     the United States, by his conduct committed the acts alleged \n     in the two Articles of Impeachment before us. Not generally, \n     but specifically, did he do what is alleged--and if he did, \n     do these actions rise to the level of high crimes and \n     misdemeanors necessary to justify the most obviously anti-\n     democratic act the Senate can engage in overturning an \n     election.\n\n\n                      The Articles of Impeachment\n\n       When the Framers designed our elected branches of \n     government, they established a system of separate but equal \n     branches. The independence of the President from the \n     Congress, and vice versa, is constitutionally anchored in the \n     fact that each answers directly to the people through the \n     ballot box. The people determine who will serve in either \n     branch.\n       As I said in a speech last September at Syracuse Law School \n     and in another on the floor of the United State Senate, the \n     independence of the President from the Congress was no minor \n     detail in the constitutional design. The single major goal \n     and idea that best explains how the Framers constructed the \n     office of the Presidency was to make the presidency as \n     politically independent of the Congress as they could. They \n     believed his independence vital to the protection of our \n     liberties.\n       It takes a strong and independent President to sign the \n     Emancipation Proclamation in the face of congressional \n     opposition, as Abraham Lincoln did. It takes a strong and \n     independent President to sign the executive order integrating \n     the Armed Services in the face of congressional resistance, \n     as Harry Truman did. It takes a strong and independent \n     president to veto legislation in the face of strong \n     majorities, as Ronald Reagan, George Bush and all of our \n     Presidents have done.\n       We can, and we do, disagree about the wisdom of any \n     particular presidential decision, but none of us can doubt \n     that the institution of a strong and independent presidency \n     has enhanced our freedoms and made us a stronger nation.\n       For us to remove a duly elected president will unavoidably \n     harm our constitutional structure.\n       Accordingly, for this Senator, the starting point in my \n     thinking about the articles of impeachment must begin with \n     giving the President the benefit of the doubt, and to err on \n     the side of sustaining the independence of that office so \n     vital to the Framers and to the constitutional system they \n     designed. Impeachment must be used against a President only \n     as an extreme measure, when the President has so breached the \n     public trust that our system of government is put in danger \n     by his continuing to serve out the term to which the people \n     of the United States elected him.\n       Have the House Managers presented a case of sufficient \n     severity, and have they proved it with sufficient clarity, to \n     justify the drastic and awesome, step of convicting a duly \n     elected President?\n       On January 12, when the House Managers walked across the \n     rotunda to the Senate and presented their case against the \n     President, the country moved from the realm of sound bites \n     and political attacks to a serious and sober consideration of \n     the precise nature of the House's allegations against the \n     President, and of the full extent of the record evidence \n     against him.\n       The House Managers have told us that in their judgment two \n     dangers to our system of government justify taking this \n     unprecedented and awesome step.\n       First, they said that failing to remove the President will \n     undermine the rule of law and the administration of justice. \n     Permitting a serial perjurer and obstructor of justice to \n     escape punishment will bring disgrace on the oath ``to tell \n     the truth.'' It will mean that we can no longer with good \n     conscience punish other people who have committed perjury or \n     obstructed justice. The ultimate effects would be felt \n     throughout the judicial system. Like a pebble dropped into a \n     pond, they said, it will send out ripples to all corners of \n     our judicial system.\n       Second, they said that failing to remove the President will \n     also condone his plot or scheme to deny a specific civil \n     rights plaintiff--Paula Jones--of a full opportunity to \n     litigate her civil rights claims against the President. \n     Regardless of the ripple effects of his actions, the acts \n     themselves were violations of law that amounted to a failure \n     of the President to ``take care that the laws be faithfully \n     executed,'' in violation of his oath of office.\n\n\n           Multiple Violations of the Criminal Law Necessary\n\n       As I have said in earlier speeches on the impeachment \n     power, not all crimes are impeachable, and an impeachable \n     offense does not have to be a crime.\n       In this case, however, the House Managers have made it \n     quite clear that their case against the President depends \n     entirely on proving that he has committed crimes, and not \n     just a few crimes, but an elaborate scheme that included \n     ``lots and lots of perjury'' and ``many obstructions of \n     justice,'' to quote Mr. McCollum. The dangers the President \n     supposedly poses flow not from the President's reprehensible \n     conduct, or from the fact that he misled his family, his \n     aides, his cabinet and the nation about that conduct. This \n     impeachment is not about sex, they have insisted.\n       I asked Mr. Barr about this during the trial, and he said \n     ``What brings us here . . . is the belief by the House of \n     Representatives in lawful public vote that this President \n     violated, in numerous respects, his oath of office and the \n     Criminal Code of the United States of America--in particular, \n     that he committed perjury and obstruction of justice.'' Mr. \n     McCollum made the same point in his opening presentation, \n     when he said, ``The first thing you have to determine is \n     whether or not the president committed crimes. It's only if \n     you determine he committed the crimes of perjury, obstruction \n     of justice and witness tampering, that you ever move on to \n     the question of whether he is removed from office. . . . None \n     of us would argue to you that the president should be removed \n     from office unless you conclude he committed the crimes that \n     he is alleged to have committed.''\n\n\n           The Burden of Proof in Assessing the House's Case\n\n       So the question before the Senate is whether the President \n     is a serial perjurer and a massive obstructor of justice.\n       What standard of proof should a Senator apply in deciding \n     whether the record supports the accusations contained in the \n     articles of impeachment--the accusations that the President \n     violated the federal criminal law? The House Managers quite \n     correctly pointed out that the Senate has never sought to \n     determine for the entire body what the burden of proof should \n     be in an impeachment. In effect, we have left it to the good \n     judgment of each Senator to decide whether or not they are \n     convinced by the evidence presented to us.\n       For this Senator, fundamental fairness as well as the \n     nature of the House's case dictate that I ought to be \n     convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the President \n     violated the laws that the House alleges. Proof beyond a \n     reasonable doubt is the same standard applied in criminal \n     cases--it is the standard that would apply if the President \n     were\n\n[[Page S1479]]\n\n     tried in a criminal court for perjury or obstruction of \n     justice.\n       It seems to me that fundamental fairness counsels that I \n     apply the same standard as a criminal court precisely because \n     the House asserts that what makes his actions impeachable is \n     that he has violated federal criminal statutes regarding \n     perjury and obstruction of justice. It strikes me as absurd \n     that the Senate would have the arrogance to throw out a duly \n     elected President on these grounds unless it was convinced \n     that he would be convicted of those charges. Otherwise, we \n     would be saying in effect that even though the President \n     would not be convicted on these crimes, we are nevertheless \n     throwing him out of office because he committed those crimes. \n     That would clearly be giving the President less protection \n     than we provide any other citizen when charged with a crime.\n       Someone else can try to explain the logic of that decision, \n     but not me.\n       In addition, the standard of proof beyond a reasonable \n     doubt seems to me compelled by the fact that in the House's \n     explanation of the harm to our system of government if the \n     President is not thrown out, their entire explanation rises \n     and falls depending upon whether or not the President would \n     be convicted in a court of law for the crimes alleged. If he \n     could not be convicted in a court of law, then the Senate is \n     not ``condoning'' perjury or obstruction of justice any more \n     than a criminal court is condoning those crimes when someone \n     is acquitted on such charges. But if the Senate is not \n     condoning those crimes, there is no conceivable basis for \n     concluding that the public will be harmed by the President's \n     remaining in office.\n       Furthermore, in applying the standard of proof beyond a \n     reasonable doubt, the Senate simply must pay attention to the \n     precise legal definitions of the crimes. What the pundits \n     have condemned as legal hair splitting, and what the public \n     rightly condemns in the president's penchant for evasive \n     answers when responding to questions in a public setting, \n     must now necessarily occupy our attention with regard to the \n     President's answers under oath, such as a deposition or a \n     grand jury proceeding because the claim made by the House is \n     that the President violated specific criminal laws. If your \n     aim is to respect the rule of law, you must also respect the \n     rules of law--the precise legal definitions of the crimes, as \n     found in 18 U.S.C. Sec.  1623, the federal perjury statute, \n     and in 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  1503 and 1512, the applicable \n     federal obstruction of justice statutes.\n       I have now studied the record sent to us by the House, \n     listened to the presentations and arguments of the House \n     Managers and the President's counsel, reviewed the videotape \n     testimony of Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney \n     Blumenthal, and listened to the views of my colleagues.\n       On that basis, I have reached the conclusion that the House \n     has not presented evidence that could persuade a criminal \n     jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the President has \n     violated the applicable federal criminal statutes. There are \n     too many holes, too many conclusions reached only by drawing \n     negative inferences against the President, and too much \n     evidence that apparently contradicts or is inconsistent with \n     the House's case.\n       Now, let me be frank with you. I do not know for sure what \n     actually occurred. Notwithstanding that, I am forced to make \n     a judgment. In order to preserve the constitutional \n     separation of powers, the independence of the presidency and \n     the sovereignty of democratic elections, the President \n     deserves the benefit of the doubt. This record falls well \n     short of the certainty required to remove a President from \n     office.\n\n\n           the constitutional balance the senate must strike\n\n       While I believe that I must apply a standard of proof \n     beyond a reasonable doubt because of the nature of the \n     charges that the House has brought to us, it is also quite \n     true--and I have said as much on prior occasions--that the \n     Senate does not sit as a court of law when it tries an \n     impeachment. As Alexander Hamilton stated in Federalist 65, \n     impeachment is a political process.\n       ``Political'' in Hamilton's usage had two meanings as it \n     relates to impeachments. The first I have mentioned already, \n     and I have spoken about in this chamber before: impeachable \n     offenses are offenses against the body politic. In the words \n     of James Wilson, ``in the United States . . . impeachments \n     are confined to political characters, to political crimes and \n     misdemeanors, and to political punishments.''\n       The Senate's judgment in an impeachment trial is ultimately \n     political in a second sense, too. It is political in the \n     sense that the Senate has the responsibility to weigh the all \n     the consequences to the body politic in making its decision--\n     the consequences that might flow from removing the President \n     as well as the consequences that might flow from failing to \n     remove him.\n       That is what I mean, and what Hamilton meant, by the \n     ultimate judgment being a political one. As Senator Bumpers \n     reminded us, the consequences of the decision we make will \n     live on long after Bill Clinton has left office and long \n     after each of us has left office. We must hand our \n     constitutional structure on to our children and to future \n     generations with its foundation as solid as it was when it \n     was handed to us. It is our responsibility as Senators to \n     make a judgment as to how best to accomplish that objective.\n       The obligation to evaluate the competing costs of retention \n     and removal, incidentally, is what clearly distinguishes \n     judicial impeachments and presidential impeachments--very \n     different institutional and long term consequences weigh in \n     the balance in these two cases.\n       Removing the President from office without compelling \n     evidence would be historically anti-democratic. Never in our \n     history has the Senate overturned the results of an election \n     and removed a President from office. History could not more \n     plainly demonstrate what a dramatic step removing an elected \n     President would be. The founding of our republic was the most \n     dramatic assertion of the sovereignty of the people that the \n     world had ever known. Abraham Lincoln dedicated the \n     battlefield at Gettysburg to this proposition recalling that \n     our union stands for ``government of the people, for the \n     people, and by the people.''\n       The sovereignty of the people is exercised through national \n     elections. All citizens, but particularly those of us who \n     have had the honor to stand for election, have an instinctive \n     respect for the will of the people as expressed through \n     national elections. Thomas Jefferson, in his first inaugural \n     address, aptly called this democratic instinct a ``sacred \n     principle.'' Reversing the people's sovereign decision would \n     be in radical conflict with the principle on which our nation \n     is founded as understood and applied throughout our history.\n       For one branch to remove the head of a co-equal branch \n     unavoidably harms our constitutional structure. The framers \n     intentionally chose not to create a parliamentary system of \n     government. They meant for the President and Congress to be \n     independent of and co-equal with one another. Maintaining \n     each of those branches as strong and independent is \n     fundamental to the Constitution's very structure--a structure \n     they designed to safeguard the liberty of the governed \n     against abuses of power by those who govern.\n       It is true that impeachment is part of this structure. \n     Removing a president from office for sufficient reasons and \n     upon sufficient proof is therefore consistent with that \n     structure. At the same time, the great dangers inherent in \n     the too ready exercise of that power mean that impeachment \n     should be seen as an extreme measure.\n       The framers were accomplished, practical statesmen. They \n     recognized that impeachment could be misapplied to undermine \n     the primary structural guarantee of liberty--the separation \n     of powers. They worried that Congress would be tempted to use \n     the impeachment power to make the President ``less equal.'' \n     As Charles Pinckney warned his colleagues at the Philadelphia \n     Convention, Congress could hold impeachment ``as a rod over \n     the Executive and by that means effectively destroy his \n     independence.''\n       How are we to keep the impeachment power within its \n     constitutional boundaries, so that it stands ready to be used \n     appropriately but does not become a ``rod'' in the hands of a \n     partisan Congress, threatening the independence of the \n     Presidency, as Charles Pinckney worried during the \n     Constitutional convention?\n       The solution to this problem must lie in approaching the \n     Senate's ultimate decision from as much of a position of \n     bipartisanship as we can possibly achieve. This is the only \n     way in which we can possibly focus primarily on the \n     institutional consequences of our actions to see them in \n     terms of their long term consequences instead of their short \n     term partisan ones.\n       Nonpartisan faithfulness to the Constitution's structure, \n     which protects the liberty of the governed must determine our \n     action today.\n       This was my view of our role in 1974, when I rose on the \n     floor of the United States Senate and made a ``plea . . . for \n     restraint on the part of all parties involved in the \n     affair.'' That was in the case of the possible impeachment of \n     Richard Nixon. And it was my view last year, when I urged \n     restraint and bipartisanship as the attitude I hoped my \n     colleagues would adopt. And it remains my view.\n       Viewed from that perspective, it is hard for me to see how \n     the harms flowing from keeping Bill Clinton in office \n     outweigh the harms to our constitutional democracy that would \n     result from removing him.\n\n\n                   harmful consequences reconsidered\n\n       I have listened attentively to the House Managers' case. In \n     all honesty, I can sympathize with their sense of outrage at \n     the President's actions and his unwillingness to be fully \n     accountable for those actions for so many months. \n     Notwithstanding that, from the vantage point of a restrained \n     view, and as nonpartisan a view as I can muster, the dangers \n     they see from keeping President Clinton in office seem less \n     dire than they claim. At the same time the harms to our \n     system of government from removing him seem to me to be quite \n     serious.\n       The House Managers warn that failure to remove the \n     President would destroy or undermine the sound administration \n     of justice and threaten the rule of law. If true, that would \n     be a big deal.\n       But we need to step back a moment and cool down the \n     rhetoric. Manager Graham suggested as much when he reminded \n     us all of the resiliency of the American system of \n     government. ``So when we talk about the consequences of this \n     case,'' he said, ``no matter what you decide, in my opinion, \n     this country will survive. If you acquit the President, we \n     will survive. If you convict him, it will be traumatic, and \n     if you remove him, it will be traumatic, but we will \n     survive.''\n\n[[Page S1480]]\n\n       That same calmer judgment ought to apply to the \n     administration of justice and the rule of law. The House \n     Managers presented no evidence whatsoever of the dire \n     consequences they predict. And there is no evidence of such \n     dire consequences that they could present--because their \n     evaluation of the consequences is nothing but speculation.\n       I would submit to you that the consequences of failing to \n     remove the President will most likely be very different from \n     those described by the House. This is one pebble whose \n     ripples will in all likelihood simply wash up harmlessly on \n     the shores and be forgotten forever. I, frankly, do not see \n     how failing to remove the President will alter the conduct of \n     the next prosecutor having to decide whether to bring a \n     perjury indictment, nor do I think that juries will be \n     persuaded by a lawyer's argument that because the President \n     ``got away with it'' the jury should acquit his client. The \n     fact of the matter is, lots of perjury trials result in \n     acquittals without impacting the ability of the criminal \n     justice system to bring such charges where appropriate.\n       The House Managers' cry of alarm ignores the fact that we \n     are in an impeachment trial. This is not a criminal \n     proceeding and thus the manner in which the Senate deals with \n     the question has no implications at all for how a court of \n     law would deal with it.\n       The Constitution is very clear about this. In Article I, \n     Sec. 3, cl. 7, the Constitution provides that whether or not \n     a person is removed from office through impeachment that \n     party ``shall nevertheless be liable and subject to \n     Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to \n     Law.'' If the evidence is as overwhelming as the Managers \n     say, the President can be prosecuted for perjury and \n     obstruction after he leaves office.\n       The American people have a very robust understanding that \n     impeachment is a political process--and a particularly clear \n     understanding that this impeachment has been thoroughly \n     politicized until it got to the Senate--I don't think anyone \n     is confusing it with a legal process. No one, therefore, will \n     take any solace from the President's acquittal in terms of \n     their ability to commit perjury or obstruct justice and \n     thereby avoid criminal charges.\n       Now don't misunderstand me--I am not suggesting that \n     letting a guilty person off from a crime he or she has \n     committed is OK. I am saying, first, that the President has \n     not been charged with a crime in a criminal court, so that \n     failing to acquit him is not at all letting him off from a \n     crime, and second, that our decision will not have the kind \n     of ``sky is falling'' consequences described by the House in \n     any event. In my judgment, the rule of law and the sound \n     administration of justice in this country will be unaffected \n     by the action we take in the Senate, one way or the other.\n       The House Managers have also warned that failing to remove \n     the President will also condone his plot or scheme to deny a \n     specific civil rights plaintiff--Paula Jones--her day in \n     court, by withholding from her, through acts of perjury and \n     obstruction, full information about the ``nature and \n     details'' of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Just how \n     accurate and complete a description is this one? In order to \n     answer that question, we need a fuller picture of the \n     ``nature and details'' of the Jones litigation itself.\n       If you listened just to the House Managers, you would think \n     that the Jones lawsuit was just a run-of-the-mine typical \n     sexual harassment civil rights case.\n       It was not. From the very beginning, that lawsuit had been \n     politically motivated. All the facts we know about this case, \n     even taking Paula Jones at her word that the incident in the \n     Excelsior Hotel actually occurred, demonstrate that the \n     lawsuit was also without merit. She had never been harmed in \n     any way in her job, and the President had never repeated \n     anything remotely resembling an unwanted sexual advance on \n     her again. She had received merit pay raises in her state \n     employment and she had received good job performance reviews. \n     She was unable to prove that she had been damaged in any way \n     by the President's actions.\n       Actually, what damages she did assert--what caused her to \n     file the lawsuit, according to her testimony--was the result \n     of the publication of a hatchet-job article against President \n     Clinton run in the American Spectator. The article was one \n     salvo in an on going right wing probe into Clinton's life in \n     Arkansas, aimed simply at digging up anything that could be \n     politically damaging to the President. When the American \n     Spectator ran a story making an unflattering reference to a \n     ``Paula,'' Jones found a lawyer to file suit in order to \n     ``reclaim her good name.''\n       The lawyers Paula Jones eventually found were also \n     underwritten by right wing conservative Republican money. In \n     fact, investigative reporters as recently as this past Sunday \n     continue to reveal more and more details of the tightly knit \n     web of conservative lawyers and conservative financial \n     backers who have hounded this President relentlessly since \n     the day he took the office.\n       Now the President knew that the lawsuit was without merit--\n     he might have behaved obnoxiously with Paula Jones, but he \n     did not commit sexual harassment. He also knew that the real \n     motivation of the lawsuit, the motivation that funded it and \n     kept it going, was a political assault on him, not a legal \n     assault. The law suit and its powers of discovery were being \n     used to engage in a fishing expedition throughout Arkansas in \n     search of political dirt. Leaks from that discovery appeared \n     regularly in the Washington press.\n       The President knew something else, as well. He knew that \n     his illicit relationship with Monica Lewinsky had nothing to \n     do with the merits of the Jones litigation. On this matter, \n     you do not have to rely on the President's assessment or \n     mine, because the court independently concluded the same \n     thing. In the order denying the plaintiff's discovery into \n     the Lewinsky facts, Judge Wright said that the Lewinsky \n     facts, even if the allegations concerning them were true, had \n     nothing to do with the essential or core elements of Paula \n     Jones lawsuit.\n       So keeping Lewinsky out of the politically motivated Jones \n     case did not jeopardize Paula Jones' chances of prevailing, \n     which were non-existent in any event. What it did do was to \n     prevent the president's political enemies from using the \n     Jones discovery procedures to pry open that secret \n     relationship and expose it, all to the political damage of \n     the President.\n       In this context, it is understandable that the President \n     wanted to frustrate the Jones litigation. What is more, the \n     President can hardly be said to have prevented Paula Jones \n     from presenting a case, because there was no meritorious case \n     to present.\n       That doesn't justify perjury or obstruction, of course, but \n     it does provide an accurate context for appraising the House \n     Managers' second claim. If they are permitted to convert a \n     meritless and politically motivated lawsuit into a \n     presidential conviction for impeachable offenses, the Senate \n     will be rewarding behavior that we ought to condemn. We need \n     to think more than once about rewarding this kind of \n     political witch hunt.\n       All of what I have just said informs this Senator's \n     judgment concerning the harms to the country that would be \n     caused by failing to convict a President who had committed \n     the acts alleged by the House.\n       In fact, if the rule of law and the fair administration of \n     justice will not be destroyed--contrary to the House \n     Managers' assertions--and if the American people understand \n     that the President's actions were in the context of a \n     politically-motivated lawsuit and involved concealing an \n     embarrassing improper relationship that was irrelevant to \n     that lawsuit--then it is very hard for this Senator to see \n     how the President's continuing in office poses the sort of \n     grave danger to our system of government that the Framers had \n     in mind when they gave the Congress the awesome power to \n     impeach and remove an elected President.\n       In weighing the competing consequences of removal and \n     retention in office, we must honor the constitutional \n     obligation we undertook when we swore to do ``impartial \n     justice.''\n       To that end, I think we all could benefit from the wisdom \n     on several participants in the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, \n     131 years ago.\n       Two of them--Chief Justice Salmon Chase and Congressman \n     James G. Blaine--both of whom historians record as being \n     highly critical of Johnson and initially favoring his \n     removal--were nevertheless able to step back from the \n     partisanship of that moment and weigh the competing harms in \n     the way I have suggested is proper.\n       Chief Justice Salmon Chase, who himself had political \n     presidential ambitions, wrote to a friend on the day the \n     trial ended, saying, ``What possible harm can result in the \n     country from continuance of Andrew Johnson months longer in \n     the presidential chair, compared with that which must arise \n     if impeachment becomes a mere mode of getting rid of an \n     obnoxious President?''\n       And years later, James G. Blaine, who had voted for \n     impeachment in the House, said, ``The sober reflection of \n     after years has persuaded many who favored Impeachment that \n     it was not justifiable on the charges made, and that its \n     success would have resulted in greater injury to free \n     institutions that Andrew Johnson in his utmost endeavor was \n     able to inflict.''\n       And in our contemporary situation, former President Ford \n     and our distinguished colleague and former majority leader, \n     Robert Dole, have both urged us not to go down the road to \n     impeachment, but to seek other means to express our \n     displeasure.\n       We ought to follow these lessons, and to be attentive to \n     the damage that removing a duly elected President on these \n     charges will inflict on our system of government.\n       A decision to remove Bill Clinton will not destroy our \n     system of government. But it will stand as a precedent--the \n     very first time the United States Senate has removed any \n     president from office. If we vote to convict and remove the \n     President after a highly partisan impeachment for conduct \n     that appears to be private and non-official, we will create \n     an opportunity for impeachments to become a tool of partisan \n     politics by other means.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Engaging in the balance that the Constitution requires, I \n     cannot vote to convict the President. The evidence of proof \n     beyond a reasonable doubt that the President violated federal \n     criminal statutes has not been presented. Even were the \n     evidence stronger, the Constitution demands that we weigh the \n     competing considerations in a nonpartisan manner.\n       The President deserves our condemnation. He has brought \n     shame to himself.\n       But we have not reached this point due to his failings \n     alone. It has taken the volatile combination of his \n     blameworthiness and the unalloyed animosity of others toward \n     him that have brought us to the brink of a profound \n     constitutional moment.\n\n[[Page S1481]]\n\n       Given the essentially anti-democratic nature of impeachment \n     and the great dangers inherent in the too ready exercise of \n     that power, impeachment has no place in our system of \n     constitutional democracy except as an extreme measure--\n     reserved for breaches of the public trust by a President who \n     so violates his official duties, misuses his official powers \n     or places our system of government at such risk that our \n     constitutional government is put in immediate danger by his \n     continuing to serve out the term to which the people of the \n     United States elected him.\n       I urge my colleagues to remain faithful to the \n     constitutional design and to our obligation to do impartial \n     justice.\n       Below are significant issues of constitutional law, \n     positive law, or Senate procedure that have arisen during the \n     impeachment trial of President Clinton. As the impeachment \n     process moved forward in the House to the point where its \n     arriving in the Senate appeared likely, I began an intensive \n     study of the Constitution, the Framers' understanding, and \n     our historical constitutional practices in the Senate to \n     prepare for a possible impeachment trial, which I continued \n     once the Senate assumed jurisdiction over the matter. Over \n     the past several months, I have shared some of my conclusions \n     with my colleagues and the public in speeches and memoranda, \n     portions of which are below. (Bracketed comments are \n     additions to the original text, inserted to assist in \n     comprehension.)\n\n\n                             Bipartisanship\n\n       Mr. President, during the past twenty-six years as a United \n     States Senator, I have been confronted with some of the most \n     significant issues facing our nation. Issues ranging from who \n     sits on the highest court in the land to whether we should go \n     to war. These are weighty issues. But none of these decisions \n     has been more awesome, more daunting, more compelling, than \n     the issue confronting us at the present time.\n       The issue of whether to impeach a sitting President is a \n     monumental responsibility. A responsibility that no Senator \n     will take lightly.\n       And as imposing as this undertaking is, I am sad to say \n     that I have had to contemplate this issue twice during my \n     service in the Senate; once during President Nixon's term and \n     now.\n       And while the circumstances surrounding these two events \n     are starkly different, the consequences are starkly the same. \n     The gravity of removing a sitting President from office is \n     the same today as it was twenty-five years ago. Listen to \n     what I said on the floor of the United States Senate on April \n     10, 1974 during the Watergate crisis:\n       ``In the case of an impeachment trial, the emotions of the \n     American people would be strummed, as a guitar, with every \n     newscast and each edition of the daily paper in communities \n     throughout the country. The incessant demand for news or \n     rumors of news--whatever its basis of legitimacy--would be \n     overwhelming. The consequential impact on the federal \n     institutions of government would be intense--and not \n     necessarily beneficial. This is why my plea today is for \n     restraint on the part of all parties involved in the \n     affair.''\n       I could have said these same words today. It is uncanny how \n     much things stay the same.\n       Furthermore, in 1974 I urged my colleagues in the United \n     States Senate to learn from the story of Alice in Wonderland. \n     Then I cautioned that we remember Alice's plight when the \n     Queen declared ``sentence first, verdict afterwards.''\n       But the need for restraint is even greater today than it \n     was in 1974. In 1974, the impeachment question was not as \n     politically charged as it is today. In 1974 we were willing \n     to hear all the evidence before making a decision. Today, I \n     hope, for our nation's sake, that we do not follow the \n     Queen's directive in Alice in Wonderland and that we will \n     make a wise judgment after deliberate consideration.\n       My legal training combined with more than a quarter century \n     of experience in the United States Senate has taught me \n     several important lessons. Two of these lessons are \n     appropriate now.\n       First, an ordered society must first care about justice.\n       Second, all that is constitutionally permissible may not be \n     just or wise.\n       And it is with these two very important lessons guiding me, \n     that I embark upon a very important decision regarding our \n     country, our Constitution, and our President.\n       The power to overturn and undo a popular election of the \n     people, for the first time in our nation's history, must be \n     exercised with great care and sober deliberation.\n       We should not forget that 47.4 million Americans voted for \n     our President in 1996, 8.2 million more than voted for the \n     President's opponent.--[Speech, 10/2/98]\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Let me now stand back from the issues of substance and \n     procedure, and look at the impeachment mechanism as it has \n     actually functioned in our country's history. The proof of \n     the framers' design, after all, will be in how the mechanism \n     has worked in practice.\n       As we have seen, the framers worried that impeaching a \n     sitting president would most likely be highly charged with \n     partisan politics and pre-existing factions, enlisting all \n     the ``animosities, partialities, and influence and interest'' \n     that inevitably swirl around a sitting president. History \n     shows that they had a right to be worried.\n       Prior to the case of President Nixon, presidential \n     impeachment had only been used for partisan reasons.\n       History tells us that John Tyler was an enormously \n     unpopular president, facing a hostile Congress dominated by \n     his arch political enemy, Henry Clay. After several years of \n     continual clashes, numerous presidential vetoes and divisive \n     conflicts with the senate over appointments, a select \n     committee of the House issued a report recommending a formal \n     impeachment inquiry.\n       President Tyler reached out to his political enemies: he \n     signed an important bill raising tariffs which he had \n     formerly opposed--and he found other means of cooperating \n     with the Congress. In the end, even Henry Clay, speaking from \n     the Senate, urged a slowdown in the impeachment proceedings, \n     suggesting instead the lesser action of a ``want of \n     confidence'' vote rather than formal impeachment proceedings. \n     In early 1843, the resolution to proceed with an impeachment \n     inquiry was defeated on the House floor, 127 to 83.\n       In 1868, Andrew Johnson came much closer to conviction on \n     charges of serious misconduct. Although Johnson's impeachment \n     proceedings ostensibly focused on his disregarding the tenure \n     in office act, historians uniformly agree that the true \n     sources of opposition to president Johnson were policy \n     disagreements and personal animosity. [Text note: The \n     conflict this time was between Johnson's moderate post Civil \n     War policies toward the Southern states and the overwhelming \n     Radical Republican majorities in both chambers. One \n     especially volatile division was over whether Southern \n     Senators and Representatives ought to be admitted to Congress \n     prior to the enactment of Constitutional amendments expressly \n     denying the right of state succession. The Republicans feared \n     dilution of their voting strength if the southerners were \n     seated, especially since on effect of President Lincoln's \n     Emancipation Proclamation would be to increase House \n     representation for the Southern states, by virtue of the fact \n     that each freed slave would count as a whole person, instead \n     of the abandoned constitutional formula of three-fifths.\n       The Tenure in Office Act had been enacted over his veto to \n     restrict his ability to remove the Secretary of War --who was \n     allied with the Radical Republicans--from that office without \n     the Senate's consent. Johnson fired Edwin M. Stanton anyway, \n     claiming that the restriction on his removal authority was \n     unconstitutional.]\n       The conflict this time was between Johnson's moderate post-\n     Civil War policies toward the southern states and the \n     overwhelming Republican majorities in both chambers. The \n     Republicans feared dilution of their voting strength if the \n     southerners were seated.\n       Johnson's defenders in the Senate were eventually able to \n     hold on to barely enough votes to prevent his conviction. In \n     professor Raoul Berger's view, ``Johnson's trial serves as a \n     frightening reminder that in the hands of a passion-driven \n     congress, the process may bring down the very pillars of our \n     constitutional system.''\n       Yet, if the cases of Tyler and Johnson substantiate the \n     framers' fears, the Nixon situation vindicates the utility of \n     the impeachment procedures. Notice how different the Nixon \n     proceedings were from Tyler's and Johnson's. As the Nixon \n     impeachment process unfolded, there was broad bipartisan \n     consensus each step of the way.\n       While it would be foolish to believe that Members of \n     Congress did not worry about the partisan political \n     repercussions of their actions, such factional considerations \n     did not dominate decision making.\n       Political friends and foes of the president agreed that the \n     charges against the president were serious, that they \n     warranted further inquiry and, once there was definitive \n     evidence of serious complicity and wrongdoing, a consensus \n     emerged that impeachment should be invoked. The president \n     resigned after the House Judiciary Committee voted out \n     articles of impeachment by a 28-10 vote.\n       For me, several lessons stand out from our constitutional \n     understanding of the impeachment process and our historical \n     experience with it. Furthermore, I believe that a consensus \n     has developed on several important points.\n       While the founders included impeachment powers in the \n     Constitution, they were concerned by the potential partisan \n     abuse. We should be no less aware of the dangers of \n     partisanship. As we have seen, the process functions best \n     when there is a broad bipartisan consensus behind moving \n     ahead. The country is not well served when either policy \n     disagreements or personal animosities drive the process.\n       Many scholars who have studied the Constitution have \n     concluded that it should be reserved for offenses that are \n     abuses of the public trust or abuses that relate to the \n     public nature of the President's duties. Remember, what is \n     impeachable is not necessarily criminal and what is criminal \n     is not necessarily impeachable.--[Speech, 10/2/98]\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       I am here today to call for bipartisanship in the \n     impeachment process. It is a concept many will say they agree \n     with. But actions speak louder than words.\n       The framers of the Constitution knew that the greatest \n     danger associated with impeachment was the presence of \n     partisan factions that could dictate the outcome.\n       It is clear from the debates and from the commentaries on \n     the Constitutional Convention that the framers were concerned \n     that\n\n[[Page S1482]]\n\n     anything less than bipartisanship could, and would, do great \n     damage to our form of government. They knew that to \n     contemplate an action as profound as undoing a popular \n     election requires at a minimum that members of both parties \n     find that the alleged wrong is grave enough to overturn \n     the will of the majority of the American people.\n       The framers also understood the sentiment expressed nearly \n     200 years later by Congresswoman Barbara Jordan during the \n     impeachment proceedings of Richard Nixon.\n       She said, ``it is reason, and not passion, which must guide \n     our deliberations, guide our debate, and guide our \n     decision.''\n       But the current debate is guided by faction, not reason. \n     One example: The House Judiciary Committee this month heard a \n     battery of witnesses address the question of what is an \n     impeachable offense. Democrats called legal experts who \n     testified that the President's acts are not impeachable \n     offenses, and Republicans called witnesses who were just as \n     certain they were. By the end of the hearing, anyone \n     listening would have the overwhelming impression that there \n     was no consensus in the legal community on the issue, that it \n     was an open question.\n       Yet the vast majority of historians and legal scholars have \n     concluded--and stated publicly--that nothing that President \n     Clinton has been accused of rises to the level of an \n     impeachable offense. The hearing was a political charade. We \n     are told that ultimately, this is a political process. \n     Ultimately, it is. The question is whether it is going to be \n     a fair process. I argue that it can, and must be fair.\n       In his marvelous book on the impeachment process, published \n     while the country was in the throes of President Nixon's \n     Watergate troubles, Professor Charles Black alerted us to the \n     danger of partisanship.\n       Because the constitution and its history provide us with \n     more questions about impeachment than answers, he said, ``it \n     is always tempting to resolve such questions in favor of the \n     immediate political result that is palatable to us, for one \n     can never definitely be proved wrong, and so one is free to \n     allow one's prejudices to assume the guise of reason.''\n       Black was echoing Alexander Hamilton, who warned in \n     Federalist 65 that impeachments:\n       ``will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole \n     community, and to divide it into parties, more or less \n     friendly or inimical, to the accused. In many cases, it will \n     connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will \n     enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence and \n     interest on the one side, or on the other; and in such cases \n     there will always be the greatest danger, that the decision \n     will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties \n     than by the real demonstrations of guilt or innocence.''\n       I don't think I am being partisan myself in warning about \n     the risks of partisan excess. As a 32 year-old Senator, I \n     expressed this same concern about the fate of a Republican \n     President. On April 10, 1974, I rose on the floor of the \n     United States Senate and said:\n       ``In the case of an impeachment trial, the emotions of the \n     American people would be strummed, as a guitar, with every \n     newscast and each edition of the daily paper in communities \n     throughout the country.\n       The incessant demand for news or rumors of news--whatever \n     its basis of legitimacy--would be overwhelming. The \n     consequential impact on the federal institutions of \n     government would be intense--and not necessarily beneficial. \n     This is why my plea today is for restraint on the part of all \n     parties involved in the affair.''\n       I make the same plea for restraint today. And while the \n     circumstances surrounding these two events are starkly \n     different, the consequences for our Nation are the same. The \n     gravity of removing a sitting president from office is the \n     same today as it was twenty-four years ago.\n       The American people understand that the consequences of \n     impeaching a sitting President are grave and, thus far, they \n     have shown a remarkable restraint--more than some of the \n     pundits and experts. But I believe they have reached two \n     clear conclusions: Congress should resolve the matter \n     expeditiously and resolve the matter in a fair and non-\n     partisan manner.\n       These conclusions have great significance to the \n     impeachment process. I believe the American people will \n     ultimately make their judgment about the proceedings and the \n     outcome based in part, on whether the House Judiciary \n     Committee votes along strict party lines and whether the \n     House of Representatives acts in a similar manner.\n       That may not be fair, but I believe that is how they will \n     judge it. Therefore, it seems clear to me that for history's \n     sake, and with the Committee's legacy in mind, Chairman Hyde \n     and the Republican majority in the House must bend over \n     backwards to demonstrate that they have conducted this \n     proceeding based on principle, not politics.\n       There is yet another issue where public opinion comes into \n     play. That is the question of whether the President's \n     transgressions warrant impeachment. We know from survey after \n     survey that the American people believe the President's \n     actions do not justify impeaching him.\n       Should that have any bearing on the outcome? Many of my \n     colleagues say they will ignore public opinion. In most \n     cases, this is a sound position for a member of Congress to \n     take. When we are elected to the House and the Senate, we are \n     sent here to exercise judgment, not simply to be weathervanes \n     that shift with the political winds. The fact that this is an \n     impeachment proceeding doesn't change that--it makes it even \n     more important that we exercise our best judgment.\n       But I believe it is a serious mistake to take the position \n     that public opinion should have no bearing on how we act and \n     what we do. Let me explain. Many people--and many legal \n     scholars--have said that impeachment should be reserved for \n     grave breaches of the public trust. Surely, if we are trying \n     to decide whether an offense is a breach of the public trust, \n     it is important to know what the public thinks. If the \n     American people think the President's actions do not warrant \n     impeachment, we should listen to their views, and take them \n     seriously.\n       It would be a serious mistake to ignore public opinion for \n     another, more fundamental reason. This is their President we \n     are talking about. The President of the United States doesn't \n     serve at the pleasure of the legislature, as a prime minister \n     does in a parliamentary system. He is elected directly by the \n     people of the United States.\n       The election of a President is the only nationwide vote \n     that the American people ever cast. That is a big deal. If \n     the American people don't think they have made a mistake in \n     electing Bill Clinton, we in the Congress had better be very \n     careful before we upset their decision.\n       This was brought home to me several weeks before the \n     elections at a filling station in Wilmington. The woman \n     working the cash register looked up at me with something of a \n     scowl on her face. I assumed--incorrectly, it turned out--\n     that she had voted against me the last time I ran. She said, \n     ``You're Joe Biden, aren't you?'' I nodded. She said, ``What \n     are you going to do to President Clinton on this Lewinsky \n     thing?'' I started to give her a noncommital answer about the \n     process needing to go forward, but she brought me up short. \n     ``Don't you or anyone else take my vote away, Joe. He's my \n     President! If you remove him, I will never vote again.''\n       This woman--and the American people--understand the genius \n     of the American system in their bones. They know that the \n     Congress and the President are separate branches of \n     government. They understand that each branch is responsible \n     to them, not to the other branch of government. Just as they \n     know that the Senators from their state are theirs, and the \n     Representative from their district is theirs, they know that \n     the President is theirs, too.\n       Anyone who wants to impeach Bill Clinton needs to keep in \n     mind what the American people think about it, because he is \n     their President.\n       Let me be absolutely clear. This does not mean just doing \n     what the opinion polls say. It means proceeding in a manner \n     that the American people understand to be fair. In the case \n     of an impeachment, fair means bipartisan. It means putting \n     aside the disagreements that stem from partisan factions. The \n     time for partisan factions to play a role is in the process \n     of elections, where candidates advance competing policies and \n     platforms and the people vote. Once the election is held, our \n     leaders hold office until the next election. It is simply \n     antithetical to our constitutional democracy to use \n     impeachment to overturn an election on partisan grounds. It \n     violates the independence of the Presidency and it usurps the \n     people's voice.\n       The Framers saw this danger when they wrote the impeachment \n     power into the Constitution. Hamilton warned that an \n     impeachment would ``connect itself with pre-existing \n     factions,'' just as Black much later saw that impeachment was \n     an occasion for ``prejudices to assume the guise of reason.''\n       So those who wish to proceed with impeachment in the face \n     of the public's contrary opinion bear a special obligation \n     and confront a special risk. The obligation they face is that \n     they must proceed in a bipartisan manner, so that we can \n     defend the Congress's actions as fair and consistent with the \n     constitutional framework--so that if impeachment goes \n     forward, those who support it can look my constituent, or \n     their constituent, straight in the eyes and defend the \n     process as fair and just.\n       Should they fail to do this, the risk they face is the \n     chance that they will inflict more damage on our system of \n     government and induce more cynicism and disgust with politics \n     than anything the President has done so far.\n       So we must be prudent. Otherwise we will succumb to the \n     danger the Framers warned against. We will subject the \n     President to what amounts to a vote of no confidence. If you \n     disapprove of his presidency and its policies, or if you do \n     not like the man, vote to impeach. If, on the other hand, you \n     support his presidency and his policies, or if you do like \n     the man, vote to acquit. But that is not our system of \n     government.\n       When Benjamin Netanyahu returned home after signing the Wye \n     accords, he faced a vote of no confidence. If he had lost, he \n     would have been out of office and another government would \n     have to be formed.\n       That is simply not our system of government. Ours is not a \n     parliamentary system. That is not how impeachment is supposed \n     to operate.\n       Reflect for just a moment on how different our government \n     is. Here, the President and the Congress are separate \n     branches of government. Each is elected directly by the \n     people. The President and Vice President are the only \n     officials elected by ALL the people. Through the electoral \n     process, they answer to all the people. In such a system, a \n     vote of no confidence, as a means of removing the\n\n[[Page S1483]]\n\n     head of government when the Congress disapproves of his \n     leadership, contradicts the theory of separated powers. It \n     would trample on the choice made by the people through the \n     electoral process.\n       This is no small matter. It goes to the heart of the \n     constitutional design. As Jack Rakove, the Stanford \n     historian, noted during the recently held House hearings on \n     the standard for impeachment, the prevailing principle that \n     guided the Framers in shaping the institution of the \n     Presidency during the Philadelphia Convention, the one major \n     goal and idea that best explains how that office took shape \n     over the summer of 1787, was their intention on ``making the \n     presidency as politically independent of the Congress as they \n     could.''\n       The Framers saw the system of separated powers and checks \n     and balances as a bulwark in support of individual liberty \n     and against government tyranny. The separation of powers \n     prevents government power from being concentrated in any \n     single branch of government. Permit one branch of government \n     to subjugate another to its partisan wishes, and you permit \n     the kind of concentration of power that can lead to tyranny.\n       So the system the Framers established is utterly \n     incompatible with the idea that sharp partisan divisions \n     could be sufficient to impeach. Preserving our system, with \n     its checks and balances and separation of powers, ought to be \n     part of our consideration as we attempt to resolve the \n     current controversy.\n       How do we ensure that impeachments do not become the \n     partisan showdowns that the Framer's warned about? The answer \n     is both simple and elusive. The only thing that prevents the \n     impeachment power from being abused is the good faith of \n     Members of Congress.\n       Professor Black proposed a simple test. He said that for \n     the purposes of impeachment, members take off their party's \n     hat--shed their partisan identity--and then try to take on \n     the identity of a member of the other party. In other words, \n     Republicans who favor Clinton's impeachment should try to \n     pretend they are Democrats, and see if they still hold that \n     same conclusion. Democrats who scoff at impeachment in the \n     present instance should try to see it from the Republican's \n     point of view.\n       It is very difficult to perform this test, especially in \n     the highly charged partisan atmosphere in which we live, but \n     you get the point. Before we undertake such a solemn act as \n     impeachment, we should examine our reasoning very carefully \n     to be sure we are not simply following partisan instincts.\n       Impeachment can be legitimate if and only if it emanates \n     from a bipartisan conviction that the president has committed \n     high crimes and misdemeanors--when people of opposing \n     viewpoints can come together in agreement over the \n     seriousness of the offense and the appropriateness of the \n     sanction.\n       Partisanship need not disappear entirely--that would be \n     impossible. It simply must be held in check for a time--a few \n     weeks, perhaps a month--and by a relatively small number of \n     people, so that a bipartisan consensus can take shape.\n       Look back at the Nixon impeachment. It took on legitimacy \n     when a core of Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee \n     were moved by the nature of President Nixon's offenses to \n     break party ranks and vote for articles of impeachment. In \n     the Senate, it was the stark reality of eroding Republican \n     support that prompted President Nixon to resign. There was \n     bipartisan consensus that what Nixon did was impeachable.\n       Partisanship did not evaporate entirely during the \n     impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson. In fact, the entire \n     episode was riddled with partisanship, and overall it stands \n     as an excellent example of how not to conduct an impeachment.\n       Still, seven Republican Senators did vote with the \n     Democrats for acquittal, shedding their partisan preferences, \n     to prevent that impeachment from succeeding. It took only \n     that amount of bipartisanship to save the country from an \n     impeachment that most people--in retrospect--have concluded \n     would have been a terrible mistake. The fact that a \n     conviction in the Senate requires a two-thirds majority \n     guarantees a measure of necessary bipartisanship except in \n     all but the most lopsided Senates.\n       But bipartisanship should not wait until the matter reaches \n     the Senate chamber. In previous impeachments the votes in \n     both the House and the Senate have been by overwhelming \n     majorities. In the past, except for the Johnson impeachment, \n     the only times articles of impeachment reached the floor were \n     in cases of tremendous bipartisan consensus that the offenses \n     satisfy the constitutional standard and that the officer \n     ought to be removed.\n       As for the Johnson impeachment itself, according to James \n     Blaine, one of the Republican House members who voted for \n     impeachment, he and others came in time to regret the effort. \n     In private correspondence, Blaine wrote that, ``the sober \n     reflection of after years has persuaded many who favored \n     impeachment that it was not justifiable on the charges made, \n     and that its success would have resulted in greater injury to \n     free institutions than Andrew Johnson in his utmost endeavor \n     was able to inflict.''\n       The conclusion I reach is this. The burden is, as it always \n     has been, on those who seek to impeach and convict a \n     President. To overturn a popular election, they must convince \n     the American people and at least some in the President's \n     party that the President's actions meet the high standard for \n     impeachment settled upon by our founders in the Constitution.\n       This is what I mean by bipartisanship.\n       The standard is ``principled political neutrality.''\n       And one measure of whether a member has met that principle \n     is to ask in Professor Black's words: ``Would they have \n     answered the same question the same way if it came up with \n     respect to a president towards whom [they] felt oppositely \n     from the way [they] feel toward the President threatened with \n     removal.''\n       The American people will know whether each member met that \n     test. They will not demand unanimity, but they will demand \n     consensus.\n       Thus far, the House Judiciary Committee has proceeded \n     without dignity, causing the American people to lose respect \n     for the Committee.\n       As a result, the burden of demonstrating that they are \n     proceeding with a standard of ``principled political \n     neutrality'' will be politically difficult to meet.\n       Ken Starr will make his case, the President should be \n     allowed to make his. Then let them decide if the President's \n     conduct meets the test of what the framers had in mind by \n     ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''\n       The choice is not whether the President's self-evidently \n     shameful and possibly criminal conduct must be punished by \n     impeachment or be condoned. The choice is whether the process \n     for dealing with his conduct is removal from office or some \n     other means--censure, or perhaps even a criminal trial after \n     he has left office.\n       To those who say that failure to bring articles of \n     impeachment against the President would amount to condoning \n     his immoral behavior or overlooking a criminal act, \n     notwithstanding the fact it does not meet the test of an \n     impeachable offense, I say they do not understand our system \n     of government. For the Constitution contemplates and the law \n     provides for such a circumstance--it is called a criminal \n     trial after his term is served. It is a way to punish the \n     President without doing damage to the system of separated \n     powers or overruling the judgment of the American people.\n       Failure to impeach, even failure to proceed with a criminal \n     action, does not mean that the President has not paid for his \n     immoral behavior--he has already been sentenced to a hundred \n     years of shame in the history books, which is not an \n     insignificant penalty.\n       So I say to my colleagues in the House, do your duty. \n     Proceed with principled political neutrality. For if you do, \n     history will judge you kindly. And if you do not, it will \n     judge you harshly.\n       And for those of us who hold high public office and the \n     public trust, history is a judge.--[Speech, 11/18/98]\n\n\n                            Burden of Proof\n\n       What is the standard of proof? The Constitution does not \n     set forth an express standard of proof that the evidence must \n     meet in order to allow the Senate to convict the president. \n     Practice has left to each Senator to determine for him or \n     herself what standard to apply.\n       From the judicial setting there are three major standards \n     from which to choose. Most civil trials require a plaintiff \n     to prove his or her case by a preponderance of the evidence. \n     This means that the plaintiff must prove that it is more \n     likely than not that the plaintiff's assertions are true. \n     Criminal trials require the most exacting degree of proof. \n     The prosecution must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a \n     reasonable doubt. A third, middle course is applied in some \n     cases. This standard, clear and convincing evidence, requires \n     proof that substantially exceeds a mere preponderance but \n     that does not eliminate all reasonable doubt. There must be a \n     very high degree of probability that the evidence proves what \n     the plaintiff asserts, but the proof may fall short of \n     certainty.\n       Many Senators, analogizing to a criminal trial, have \n     expressed that they would require the House Managers to prove \n     their case ``beyond a reasonable doubt.'' In anticipation of \n     an impeachment trial of President Richard Nixon, Senators Sam \n     Ervin, Strom Thurmond, and John Stennis all declared that \n     they would apply the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. But \n     it is clear that individual Senators may opt for a civil \n     standard.\n       This issue may not have more than rhetorical significance \n     for the impeachment trial of President Clinton. These \n     standards are meant to guide juries in their fact-finding \n     capacity. Insofar as the trial focuses on the question \n     whether the President's conduct justifies conviction and \n     removal from office, the proceedings will call on the Senate \n     in its judicial character. Resolving that question requires \n     the Senate to exercise its legal and political judgment in \n     order to determine whether the constitutional punishment fits \n     the misconduct. It does not call upon the Senate to make a \n     factual determination about what conduct actually occurred.--\n     [Memorandum, 12/28/98]\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n           The Burden of Proof in Assessing the House's Case\n\n       But can the President rightly be charged with having \n     committed the massive number of crimes that the House \n     Managers allege? As Mr. McCollum said, if we cannot conclude \n     that the President has violated the law, even the House \n     Managers would agree that he should not be removed from \n     office. Even if\n\n[[Page S1484]]\n\n     you accept their recitation of the dire consequences of \n     President Clinton remaining in office, if the President \n     cannot be shown to have been a serial perjurer and a massive \n     obstructor of justice, the Senate should acquit.\n       What standard of proof should a Senator apply in deciding \n     whether the record supports these charges? Both the House \n     Managers and the President's counsel addressed this \n     significant issue. The House Managers quite correctly pointed \n     out that the Senate has never sought to determine for the \n     entire body what that burden of proof should be in an \n     impeachment. In effect, we have left it to the good judgment \n     of each Senator to decide whether or not they are convinced \n     by the evidence presented to us.\n       For this Senator, fundamental fairness as well as the \n     nature of the House's case indicate that I ought to be \n     convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the President \n     violated the laws that the House alleges. Proof beyond a \n     reasonable doubt is the same standard applied in criminal \n     cases--it is the standard that would apply if the President \n     were tried in a criminal court for perjury or obstruction of \n     justice.\n       It seems to me that fundamental fairness counsels that I \n     apply the same standard a criminal court would apply \n     precisely because the House asserts that what makes his \n     actions impeachable is that he has violated the criminal \n     statutes regarding perjury and obstruction of justice. It \n     strikes me as absurd that the Senate would have the arrogance \n     to throw out a duly elected President on these grounds unless \n     it was convinced that he would be convicted of those charges. \n     Otherwise, we would be saying in effect that even though the \n     President would not be convicted on these crimes, we are \n     nevertheless throwing him out of office because he committed \n     those crimes. Someone else can try to explain the logic of \n     that decision to the voters, but not me.\n       In addition, the standard of proof beyond a reasonable \n     doubt seems to me compelled by the fact that in the House's \n     explanation of the harm to our system of government if the \n     President is not thrown out, their entire argument rises and \n     falls depending upon whether or not the President would be \n     convicted in a court of law for the crimes alleged. If he \n     could not be convicted in a court of law, then the Senate is \n     not ``condoning'' perjury or obstruction of justice any more \n     than a criminal court is condoning those crimes when someone \n     is acquitted on such charges. The Senate, like a court, is \n     simply saying, ``not proven.'' But if the Senate is not \n     condoning those crimes, there is no conceivable basis for \n     concluding that the public will be harmed by the President's \n     remaining in office.\n       [There is another way to look at this: In any impeachment, \n     a Senator must simply be convinced to his or her satisfaction \n     that the defendant committed the acts alleged. That standard \n     never changes. However, when the articles of impeachment \n     allege that offenses rise to an impeachable level because \n     these actions violate the law and have harmful consequences \n     to the country because the defendant has violated the law and \n     would not be punished, in that case a Senator must be \n     convinced that a defendant would in fact be punished by a \n     criminal court. In other words, the Senator must simply be \n     convinced that a court would find that there is proof beyond \n     a reasonable doubt.\n       In contrast, if the charges were that the president had \n     lied to the American people, the Congress or foreign leaders, \n     and that the harmful consequences flowed from being unable to \n     rely upon his word, then a Senator must simply be convinced \n     that the President lied, relying upon whatever level of proof \n     is sufficient to convince him or her of that fact.]--\n     [Memorandum, 1/21/98]\n\n\n                                Censure\n\n       In recent days, some have suggested that because the Starr \n     report provides prima facie evidence of what are arguably \n     impeachable offenses, the House and the Senate have a \n     constitutional responsibility to see the impeachment process \n     through to its conclusion. In my view, the constitutional \n     history that I have sketched here this evening shows this \n     position to be entirely mistaken. Indeed, if anything, \n     history shows a thoroughly understandable reluctance to have \n     the procedure invoked.\n       Stopping short of impeachment would not be reaching a \n     solution ``outside the Constitution,'' as some suggest--it \n     would be entirely compatible and consistent with the \n     Constitution.\n       The 28th Congress [which contemplated but then terminated \n     impeachment proceedings against President Tyler] hardly \n     violated its constitutional duty when the House decided that, \n     all things considered, terminating impeachment proceedings \n     after cooperation between the Congress and the President \n     improved was a better course of action than proceeding with \n     impeachment based on his past actions, even though it \n     apparently did so for reasons no more laudable than those \n     that initiated the process.\n       Impeachment was and remains an inherently political \n     process, with all the pitfalls and promises that are thus put \n     into play. Nothing in the document precludes the Congress \n     from seeking means to resolve this or any other putative \n     breach of duty short of removing him from office. In fact, \n     the risky and potentially divisive nature of the impeachment \n     process may counsel in favor of utilizing it only as a last \n     resort.\n       Of course, impeachment ought to be used if the breach of \n     duty is serious enough--what the Congress was prepared to do \n     in the case of Richard Nixon was the correct course of \n     action. However, nothing in the Constitution precludes the \n     congress from resolving this conflict in a manner short of \n     impeachment.\n       The crucial question--the question with which the country \n     is currently struggling--is whether the President's breaches \n     of conduct--which are now well-known and which have been \n     universally condemned--warrant the ultimate political \n     sanction. Are they serious enough to warrant removal?\n       In answering that, we need to ask ourselves, what is in the \n     best interest for the country?\n       And while I have not decided what ultimately should happen, \n     I do want to suggest that it is certainly constitutionally \n     permissible to consider a middle ground as a resolution of \n     this matter. Such an approach might bring together those of \n     the President's detractors who believe there needs to be some \n     sanction, but are willing to stop short of impeachment, as \n     well as those of the President's supporters who reject \n     impeachment, but are willing to concede that some sanction \n     ought to be implemented.\n       As a country, we have not often faced decisions as stark \n     and potentially momentous as the impeachment of a president. \n     On the other hand, we would be wise not to overstate such \n     claims--surely we have faced some moments just as stark and \n     serious as this one. We have survived those moments, and we \n     will survive this one.\n       Whatever the outcome of the present situation, I am \n     confident that our form of government and the strength of our \n     country present us not with any constitutional crisis, but \n     rather with the constitutional framework and flexibility to \n     deal responsibly with the decisions we face in the coming \n     months.--[Speech, 10/2/98]\n\n\n                     Crimes and Misdemeanors, High\n\n       Let me say at the outset, that what President Clinton did \n     was reprehensible. It was a horrible lapse in judgment and it \n     has brought shame to him personally and to the office of the \n     president. His actions have hurt his family, his friends, his \n     supporters and the country as a whole. President Clinton has \n     said this himself.\n       Let me also say that I have not made any decision as to \n     what I think should happen. I have not come to any conclusion \n     as to what consequences the President should face for his \n     shameful behavior. I believe the oath I have taken precludes \n     me and other Senators from prejudging, as I may be required \n     to serve as a judge and juror in the trial of the century.\n       I can only make an assessment after hearing all of the \n     evidence: evidence against the President, and evidence in \n     support of the President.\n       No one knows how this will turn out. However, I have given \n     the topic some thought and would like to explore some of the \n     issues that surely will confront responsible Members of \n     Congress and all Americans as we enter this difficult period \n     in our history.\n       The framers of the Constitution who met in Philadelphia in \n     the summer 1787 considered offering the country a \n     constitution that did not include the power to impeach the \n     president. After all, any wrongs against the public could be \n     dealt with by turning the president out in the next election.\n       One delegate to the constitutional convention, Charles \n     Pinckney of South Carolina, worried that the threat of \n     impeachment would place the president under the thumb of a \n     hostile congress, thereby weakening the independence of the \n     office and threatening the separation of powers. According to \n     James Madison's notes, Pinckney called impeachment a ``rod'' \n     that congress would hold over the president.\n       In being reluctant to include an impeachment power, the \n     framers were not trying to create an imperial presidency. In \n     fact, what they were worried about was protecting all \n     American citizens against the tyranny of a select group.\n       In their view, the separation of powers constituted one of \n     the most powerful means for protecting individual liberty, \n     because it prevented government power from being concentrated \n     in any single branch of government. To make the separation of \n     powers work properly, each branch must be sufficiently strong \n     and independent from the others.\n       The framers were concerned that any process whereby the \n     legislative branch could sit in judgment of the president \n     would be vulnerable to abuse by partisan factions. Federalist \n     No. 65 begins its defense of the impeachment process by \n     warning of the dangers of abuse. It argues that impeachments:\n       ``Will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole \n     community, and to divide them into parties, more or less \n     friendly or inimical, to the accused. In many cases, it will \n     connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will \n     enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence and \n     interest on one side, or on the other; and in such cases \n     there will always be the greatest danger, that the decision \n     will be regulated more by the comparative strength of the \n     parties than by the real demonstration of guilt or \n     innocence.''\n       So the framers were fully aware that impeachment \n     proceedings could become partisan attacks on the president--\n     charged with animosities generated by all manner of prior \n     struggles and disagreements, over executive branch decisions, \n     over policy disputes, over resentment at losing the prior \n     election. Federalist No. 65 expresses the view that the use \n     of impeachment to vindicate these animosities would actually \n     be an abuse of that power.\n       This sentiment is as true today as it was when the \n     constitution was being written. It\n\n[[Page S1485]]\n\n     was also true when Richard Nixon faced impeachment in 1974. \n     In fact, it would have been wrong for Richard Nixon to have \n     been removed from office based upon a purely partisan vote. \n     No president should be removed from office merely because one \n     party enjoys a commanding lead in either house of the \n     congress.\n       Yet while the framers knew that impeachment proceedings \n     could become partisan, they needed to deal with strong anti-\n     federalist factions.\n       The anti-federalists strenuously argued that the federal \n     government would quickly get out of step with the sentiments \n     of the people and become vulnerable to corruption and \n     intrigue, arrogance and tyranny. This charge proved close to \n     fatal as the ratifying conventions in the states took up the \n     proposed constitution.\n       The framers of the Constitution knew that the Constitution \n     would have been even more vulnerable to charges of \n     establishing a government remote from the people if the \n     president were not subject to removal except at the time of \n     re-election.\n       James Madison's notes of the Philadelphia constitutional \n     convention record his observations of the debate. He:\n       ``Thought it indispensable that some provision should be \n     made for defending the community against the incapacity, \n     negligence or perfidy of the chief magistrate [that is, the \n     president]. The limitation of the period of his service was \n     not a sufficient security. He might lose his capacity after \n     his appointment. He might pervert his administration into a \n     scheme of speculation or oppression. He might betray his \n     trust to foreign powers.''\n       So in the end, the framers of the Constitution risked the \n     abuse of power by the congress to gain the advantages of \n     impeachment.\n       Once the decision to include the power of impeachment had \n     been made, the remainder of debate on the impeachment clauses \n     focused on two issues:\n       1. What was to constitute an impeachable offense or what \n     were the standards to be?\n       2. How was impeachment to work or what were the procedures \n     to be?\n       As we shall see, the framers proved unable to separate \n     these two issues entirely. Understanding how they are \n     intertwined, however, helps us to understand the full \n     implications of the power.\n       The Constitution provides that ``the House of \n     Representatives shall. . . have the power of impeachment.'' \n     (Article I, Section 2, Clause 5).\n       The framers decision that the House of Representatives \n     would initiate the charges of impeachment follows the pattern \n     of the English Parliament--where the House of Commons \n     initiates charges of impeachment. Beyond this, the choice \n     must have seemed fairly compelled by two related \n     considerations.\n       The first, already mentioned, was the need to provide the \n     people as a whole with assurances that the government they \n     were being asked to create would be responsive to the \n     interests and concerns of the people themselves.\n       The second was the framer's substantive understanding of \n     the impeachment power. It was a power to hold accountable \n     government officers who had, in Hamilton's terms, committed \n     ``an abuse or violation of some public trust'' thereby \n     committing an injury ``done immediately to the society \n     itself.''\n       If the gravamen of an impeachment is the breach of the \n     public's trust, no branch of the federal government could \n     have seemed more appropriate to initiate such a proceeding \n     than the House, which was conceived and defended as the \n     chamber most in tune with the people's sympathies and hence \n     most appropriate to reflect the people's views.\n       The Constitution further provides that the president shall \n     be ``removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction \n     of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and \n     misdemeanors.'' (Article II, Section 4).\n       This language went through several changes during that \n     summer of 1787. In initial drafts, the grounds for \n     impeachment were restricted to treason and bribery alone. \n     When the matter was brought up on September 8, 1787, George \n     Mason of Virginia inquired as to why the grounds should be \n     restricted to these two provisions.\n       He argued that ``attempts to subvert the constitution may \n     not be treason as above defined.'' Accordingly, he moved to \n     add ``maladministration'' as a third ground.\n       James Madison objected to Mason's motion, contending that \n     to add ``so vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure \n     during the pleasure of the senate.'' Here again, we see the \n     worry that impeachment would be misused by the congress to \n     reduce the independence of the president, allowing partisan \n     factions to interfere at the expense of the larger public \n     good.\n       The objection apparently proved effective because mason \n     subsequently withdrew the motion and substituted the phrase \n     ``or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''\n       What does the phrase mean? It is clear the framers thought \n     it to be limited in scope. But beyond this, constitutional \n     scholars have been debating the meaning of this phrase from \n     the very early days of the republic.\n       Yet despite this on-going dialogue, I believe there are two \n     important points of agreement as to the original \n     understanding of the phrase, and a third issue where the \n     weight of history suggests a settled practice.\n       First, as we have already seen, the framers did not intend \n     that the president could be impeached for \n     ``maladministration\" alone.\n       Second, a great deal of evidence from outside the \n     convention shows that both the framers and ratifiers saw \n     ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' as pointing to offenses that \n     are serious, not petty, and offenses that are public or \n     political, not private or personal.\n       In 1829, William Rawle authored one of the early \n     commentaries on the Constitution of the United States. In it, \n     Rawle states that ``the legitimate causes of impeachment. . . \n     can only have reference to public character and official \n     duty.''\n       He went on to say, ``in general, those offences which may \n     be committed equally by a private person as a public officer \n     are not the subjects of impeachment.''\n       In addition, more than one hundred fifty years ago, Joseph \n     Story, in his influential Commentaries on the Constitution, \n     stated that impeachment is:\n       ``Ordinarily'' a remedy for offenses ``of a political \n     character,'' ``growing out of personal misconduct, or gross \n     neglect, or usurpation, or habitual disregard of the public \n     interests, in the discharge of the duties of political \n     office.''\n       The public character of the impeachment offense is further \n     reinforced by the limited nature of the remedy for the \n     offense. In the English tradition, impeachments were \n     punishable by fines, imprisonment and even death. In \n     contrast, the American constitution completely separates the \n     issue of criminal sanctions from the issue of removal from \n     office.\n       The Constitution states that ``judgment in cases of \n     impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from \n     office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of \n     honor, trust or profit under the United States.'' (Article I, \n     Section 3, Clause 7).\n       The remedy for violations of the public's trust in the \n     performance of one's official duties, in other words, is \n     limited to removal from that office and disqualification from \n     holding future offices. Remedies that I might add, correspond \n     nicely to the public nature of the offenses in the first \n     instance.\n       Additional support comes from yet another commentator, \n     James Wilson, a delegate to the convention from Pennsylvania. \n     In his lectures on the Constitution, Wilson wrote that ``in \n     the United States and Pennsylvania, impeachments are confined \n     to political characters, to political crimes and \n     misdemeanors, and to political punishments.''\n       All in all, the evidence is quite strong that impeachment \n     was understood as a remedy for abuse of official power, \n     breaches of public trust, or other derelictions of the duties \n     of office.\n       The third point to make about the scope of the impeachment \n     power is this: to be impeachable, an offense does not have to \n     be a breach of the criminal law.\n       The renowned constitutional scholar and personal friend and \n     advisor, the late Phillip Kurland, wrote that ``at both the \n     convention that framed the constitution and at the \n     conventions that ratified it, the essence of an impeachable \n     offense was thought to be breach of trust and not violation \n     of the criminal law. And this was in keeping with the primary \n     function of impeachment, removal from office.''\n       If you put the notion that an impeachable offense must be a \n     serious breach of an official trust or duty, together with \n     the point that it does not have to be a criminal violation, \n     you reach the conclusion that not all crimes are impeachable, \n     and not every impeachable offense is a crime. [Speech, 10/2/\n     98]\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Reference has been made to an exchange between George Mason \n     and James Madison at the Virginia Ratifying Convention. Mason \n     is reported to have worried that a president might ``stop \n     [an] inquiry'' into wrongdoing involving the president. \n     Madison is reported to have replied that this concern was not \n     substantial because the House of Representatives could \n     impeach the president if he did so. The exchange, it has been \n     argued, proves that the Framers viewed obstruction of justice \n     as clearly an impeachable offense.\n       A more extended look at the colloquy shows that Mason's \n     precise concern was that the President would use his pardon \n     power to pardon people whose investigations might reveal \n     presidential involvement in criminal activities. Mason used \n     this concern as the basis for arguing that the pardon power \n     should be placed in the House, and not with the President. To \n     this concern, Madison replied that if the President so abused \n     the pardon power, he could be impeached. So it was an action \n     that abused an official power of the President that Madison \n     thought was impeachable.\n       Here is a condensed version of the exchange as reported in \n     Eliot's Debates.\n       Mr. GEORGE MASON, animadverting on the magnitude of the \n     powers of the President, was alarmed . . . Now, I conceive \n     that the President ought not to have the power of pardoning, \n     because he may frequently pardon crimes which were advised by \n     himself. It may happen, at some future day, that he will \n     establish a monarchy, and destroy the republic. If he has the \n     power of granting pardons before indictment, or conviction, \n     may he not stop inquiry and prevent detection?\n       Mr. MADISON, adverting to Mr. Mason's objection to the \n     President's power of pardoning, said it would be extremely \n     improper to vest it in the House of Representatives, and not \n     much less so to place it in the Senate. . . . There is one \n     security in this case to which gentlemen may not have \n     adverted: if the President be connected, in any suspicious \n     manner, with any person, and there\n\n[[Page S1486]]\n\n     be grounds to believe he will shelter him, the House of \n     Representatives can impeach him. . . . This is a great \n     security.'' [Memorandum, 2/9/99]\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n     ii. the meaning of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' under the \n                              constitution\n\n       The Constitution establishes that the President ``shall be \n     removed from Office on Impeachment for and Conviction of \n     Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' \n     That instrument, by design, does not contain an express \n     definition of the phrase ``other high Crimes and \n     Misdemeanors.'' The framers intended the Constitution to \n     endure for centuries and recognized that they could not \n     provide a more specific definition that would justly serve \n     the nation's interest into an unknowable future. Instead, \n     they wisely entrusted the construction and adaptation of that \n     phrase to the judgment and conscience of the people's chosen \n     representatives in Congress. Thus, the Senate is left to \n     exercise what Alexander Hamilton termed our ``awful \n     discretion'' to judge whether the President's conduct \n     warrants removing him from office.\n       While the Constitution calls upon each Senator to bring his \n     or her good faith political judgment to bear on the meaning \n     of the constitutional standard of ``other high Crimes and \n     Misdemeanors,'' it does not abandon us to an ad hoc or \n     partisan exercise of our discretion. Indeed, the framers \n     strongly urged in both the Philadelphia convention and the \n     state ratifying conventions that the constitutional standard \n     is not properly understood to allow impeachment to be used as \n     a tool of partisan punishment. The Constitution itself, the \n     history of its framing and ratification, and the construction \n     given through faithful interpretation and practice since its \n     ratification converge to provide powerful guidance for \n     determining what offenses justify impeachment and conviction. \n     These touchstones of constitutional interpretation reveal \n     that high crimes and misdemeanors are great offenses \n     characterized by two elements: (1) grave harm to the \n     constitutional system of government that (2) results from \n     official misconduct.\n\n\n                     a. the history of impeachment\n\n       The framers met in Philadelphia in 1787 because the \n     government under the Articles of Confederation was so \n     ineffectual as to have brought the fledgling union to ``the \n     last stage of national humiliation.'' They intended to \n     establish a government through which the people could \n     effectively define and pursue the general welfare. To do so, \n     the framers understood that the government whose charter they \n     were about to write would have to be entrusted with broad \n     coercive powers to act directly upon American citizens. At \n     the same time, the framers were practical statesmen who \n     understood that the powers necessary to make a government \n     effective could be misused make it potentially an instrument \n     of oppression. Madison explained the dilemma:\n       ``If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If \n     angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal \n     controls on government would be necessary. In framing a \n     government which is administered by men over men, the great \n     difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government \n     to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to \n     control itself.''\n       To meet this potential threat to liberty, the framers \n     divided the federal government into three co-equal branches \n     and further divided the legislative branch into two houses in \n     order to require the concurrence of the branches before the \n     government's coercive power could be brought to bear on the \n     people. Thus, while Article 1, Section 1 of the Constitution \n     vests the legislative power in Congress, this power is \n     subject to presidential veto and judicial review for \n     constitutionality. Executive action generally requires a \n     legislative basis or appropriations or other legislative \n     support and is subject to judicial review.\n       Finally, the establishment and jurisdiction of the federal \n     courts generally depends upon legislative authorization, \n     subject again to presidential veto. Within this structure \n     each branch is to be independent and is ``armed'' to defend \n     itself against encroachments by the others. As Justice Robert \n     Jackson observed, ``the Constitution diffuses power the \n     better to secure liberty . . . . It enjoins upon its branches \n     separateness but interdependence, autonomy but reciprocity.''\n       Maintaining the independence of the three branches of \n     government dominated the debates regarding impeachment at the \n     Constitutional Convention. Initially, the framers considered \n     offering the country a constitution that did not include the \n     power to impeach the president. After all, any wrongs against \n     the public could be dealt with by turning the president out \n     in the next election. One delegate to the constitutional \n     convention, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina, worried that \n     the threat of impeachment would place the president under the \n     thumb of a hostile congress, thereby weakening the \n     independence of the office and threatening the separation of \n     powers. According to James Madison's notes, Pinckney called \n     impeachment a ``rod'' that congress would hold over the \n     president.\n       In being reluctant to include an impeachment power, the \n     framers were not trying to create an imperial presidency; \n     they were concerned about protecting all American citizens \n     and the nation as a whole. In their view, the separation of \n     powers constituted one of the most powerful means for \n     protecting individual liberty, because it prevented \n     government power from being concentrated in any single branch \n     of government. To make the separation of powers work \n     properly, each branch must be sufficiently strong and \n     independent from the others.\n       The framers' worry was largely animated by the concern that \n     any process whereby the legislative branch could sit in \n     judgment over the president would be vulnerable to abuse by \n     partisan factions. Federalist No. 65 begins its defense of \n     the impeachment process by warning of its potential for \n     abuse. It argues that impeachments:\n       ``Will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole \n     community, and to divide them into parties, more or less \n     friendly or inimical, to the accused. In many cases, it will \n     connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will \n     enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence and \n     interest on one side, or on the other; and in such cases \n     there will always be the greatest danger, that the decision \n     will be regulated more by the comparative strength of the \n     parties than by the real demonstration of guilt or \n     innocence.''\n       The framers were fully aware that impeachment proceedings \n     could become partisan attacks on the president charged with \n     animosities generated by all manner of prior struggles and \n     disagreements over executive branch decisions, over policy \n     disputes, over resentment at losing the prior election. \n     Federalist No. 65 expresses the view that the use of \n     impeachment to vindicate these animosities would actually be \n     an abuse of that power.\n       Although the framers were concerned about impeachment \n     proceedings becoming partisan, they needed to deal with \n     strong anti-federalist factions. They were very aware that \n     the anti-federalists strenuously urged that the federal \n     government would quickly get out of step with the sentiments \n     of the people and would become vulnerable to corruption and \n     intrigue, arrogance and tyranny. This charge proved close to \n     fatal as the ratifying conventions in the states took up the \n     proposed constitution. The framers of the constitution knew \n     that the constitution would have been even more vulnerable \n     to charges of establishing a government remote from the \n     people if the president were not subject to removal at all \n     except at the time of re-election.\n       James Madison's notes of the Philadelphia Constitutional \n     Convention record his observations of the debate where he:\n       ``Thought it indispensable that some provision should be \n     made for defending the community against the incapacity, \n     negligence or perfidy of the chief magistrate. The limitation \n     of the period of his service was not a sufficient security. \n     He might lose his capacity after his appointment. He might \n     pervert his administration into a scheme of speculation or \n     oppression. He might betray his trust to foreign powers.''\n       So in the end, the framers of the constitution risked the \n     abuse of power by the Congress to gain the advantages of \n     impeachment.\n\n\n                B. The Constitution's Text and Structure\n\n       The Constitution does not define impeachable offenses, yet \n     its text and structure provide clear manifestation that these \n     words refer to official misconduct causing grave harm to our \n     constitutional system of government. The starting point for \n     any analysis of the Constitution's meaning must be its text, \n     which in relevant part reads, ``the President . . . shall be \n     removed from Office on Impeachment for and Conviction of \n     Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.''\n       Here, the text sets forth a list that begins with terms \n     that have definite meaning (treason, which is defined in the \n     Constitution itself, and bribery, whose definition was fixed \n     at common law) and proceeds to relatively indefinite terms, \n     high crimes and misdemeanors. In this setting, two rules of \n     construction, ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis, instruct \n     that the meaning of the indefinite terms are to be understood \n     as similar in kind to the definite terms. Application of \n     these canons of construction is bolstered here by the text \n     itself. The indefinite element, ``high Crimes and \n     Misdemeanors,'' is introduced by the term ``other.'' This \n     specifically refers the reader back to the preceding definite \n     terms, treason and bribery, as supplying the context and \n     parameters for the meaning of the indefinite phrase, ``high \n     Crimes and Misdemeanors.''\n       Every criminal offense, including such trivial infractions \n     as parking offenses, involves public or societal harm. It is \n     for this reason that criminal cases are titled, ``The State \n     versus . . .'' or ``The Government versus. . . .'' Each of \n     the definite impeachable offenses, treason and bribery, are \n     distinct in that they cause grave harm to the public not in \n     some undifferentiated sense but in a way that strikes \n     directly at our system of constitutional government. The \n     Constitution defines treason as ``levying War against [the \n     United States] or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them \n     Aid and Comfort,'' which plainly involves the most serious \n     offense against our system of government. Similarly, bribery \n     inescapably involves a serious subversion of the processes of \n     government. In describing the common characteristics of \n     treason and bribery, Professor Charles Black of Yale Law \n     School explained that each offense ``so seriously threaten[s] \n     the order of political society as to make pestilent and \n     dangerous the continuance in power of their perpetrator.''\n       Furthermore, Professor Edwin Corwin quoted with approval \n     the statement of Justice Benjamin Curtis who said in defense \n     of\n\n[[Page S1487]]\n\n     President Andrew Johnson that ``treason and bribery . . . \n     these are offenses which strike at the existence of [the] \n     government. `Other high crimes and misdemeanors.' Noscitur a \n     sociis. High crimes and misdemeanors; so high that they \n     belong in this company with treason and bribery.''\n       In this constitutional setting, the terms treason and \n     bribery take on a second distinctive aspect. As used in \n     Article II, Section 4, each term involves official \n     misconduct. Bribery, by definition, occurs only where a \n     public official undertakes an official act in return for \n     payment or some other corrupt consideration. Likewise, \n     treason necessarily involves official misconduct in the \n     impeachment context. To be sure, it is possible for a private \n     citizen to commit treason by giving aid and comfort to the \n     enemies of the United States. It must be remembered that \n     impeachment proceedings may be pursued only against civil \n     officers of the United States. By limiting impeachable \n     treason to civil officers, the Constitution expressly \n     contemplates that treason will provide a grounds for \n     impeachment and conviction only where a civil office is used \n     to adhere to or aid the enemies of the United States.\n       The textual construction expressed above--that high crimes \n     and misdemeanors refer to grave harms to our constitutional \n     system of government that result from official misconduct--\n     comports with and draws significant support from the \n     Constitution's structure. First, the structure reflects the \n     framers' conscious decision not to adopt a parliamentary \n     system of government, in which the executive power is \n     subordinate to and controlled by the legislature. The \n     structure also reflects the framers' judgment that the \n     executive branch not be accorded primacy; their experience \n     with the tyranny of the British monarchy was too recent to \n     have permitted them to accept executive supremacy. Instead, \n     the Constitution establishes three branches that are \n     independent, strong, and co-equal. Construing the category of \n     high crimes and misdemeanors too broadly would threaten the \n     independence of the executive and judicial branches. This \n     specific concern animated James Madison in the Philadelphia \n     Convention and moved him to object to vague and potentially \n     expansive formulations of the grounds upon which the \n     President could be impeached and removed from office.\n       The formulation of high crimes and misdemeanors must be \n     understood as consistent with the Constitution's overall \n     structure. In as much as the Constitution's structure \n     specifically rejects the parliamentary form, the power of \n     impeachment and removal must be construed and exercised in a \n     way that respects this fundamental constitutional judgment. \n     Understanding the grounds for impeachment to be limited to \n     cases of official misconduct that cause serious harm to our \n     system of government allows the Congress to protect the \n     public against oppressive official action without undermining \n     the necessary independence of the President or the judiciary.\n       The Constitution's structure also supports limiting the \n     category of impeachable offenses to those involving official \n     misconduct. The constitutional separation of powers is \n     designed to safeguard liberty against tyrannical or \n     oppressive exercise of the government's power. In advocating \n     the specific governmental structure erected in the \n     Constitution, Madison repeatedly described the motivating \n     concern to be establishing internal mechanisms, specifically \n     the system of checks and balances, to control the federal \n     government's power and minimize threat to the liberty of the \n     people. This supports limiting the scope of impeachable \n     offenses to official misconduct; that is, to conduct in which \n     the civil officer misuses his or her official power. Other \n     sorts of misbehavior by civil officers are simply beyond the \n     concern of the separation of powers, of which the impeachment \n     powers are a significant component. Indeed, the Constitution \n     specifically provides that civil officers, including the \n     President, remain subject to criminal prosecution and \n     punishment for wrongdoing that does not involve official \n     conduct.\n\n\n     C. History of the Debates and Ratification of the Constitution\n\n       Moving beyond the text and structure of the Constitution \n     itself, the debates at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, \n     where the Constitution was drafted, and those in the \n     subsequent state ratifying conventions provide important \n     insight into the meaning of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' \n     Close examination of these proceedings demonstrates that the \n     framers gave careful consideration to Congress's impeachment \n     powers. This consideration led them to understand the \n     Constitution as setting forth a very narrow category of \n     impeachable offenses.\n       Through most of the convention, the drafts of the \n     Constitution denominated treason and bribery as the exclusive \n     grounds for impeachment and removal of civil officers. In \n     September 1787, as the convention was drawing to a close, \n     Colonel George Mason and James Madison undertook colloquy \n     that gave this provision its ultimate formulation. Because \n     treason was expressly and narrowly defined in the \n     Constitution itself, Mason was concerned that the impeachment \n     power would not reach ``great and dangerous offenses'' and \n     that ``attempts to subvert the Constitution may not be \n     treason'' as defined in Article III of the Constitution. \n     Mason moved to add ``maladministration'' as a catchall \n     category. Significantly, this offense, which had been an \n     accepted ground for impeachment in British practice, \n     comprises exclusively official misconduct.\n       Madison objected to this addition, not because it was too \n     restrictive, but because it was too vague and so potentially \n     too expansive. He feared that ``so vague a term will be \n     equivalent to a tenure during the pleasure of the Senate.'' \n     Here again it is clear that the framers were concerned that \n     impeachment would be misused by the Congress to reduce the \n     independence of the President. In response Mason withdrew his \n     own original motion and moved to add ``or other high Crimes \n     and Misdemeanors.'' His motion was quickly approved.\n       The purpose of Mason's motions was to include all offenses \n     that pose a threat to our system of constitutional government \n     similarly to that posed by treason. Madison expressed the \n     important concern that the expansion not be left so far open \n     as to erode the essential independence of the other branches, \n     and particularly of the President. In responding to Madison's \n     concern, Mason must be understood to have intended to narrow \n     a definition that already applied solely to official \n     misconduct. The colloquy between Mason and Madison, then, \n     strongly supports construing the phrase high crimes and \n     misdemeanors to cover only official misconduct that threatens \n     grievous harm to our governmental system.\n       Madison was not alone in his concern that Congress might \n     use impeachment as a tool for encroachments upon the \n     executive branch. This concern was raised in various state \n     ratifying conventions as well. For example, in supporting the \n     Constitution at the Pennsylvania Convention, James Wilson \n     repeatedly assured the delegates that only ``great injuries'' \n     could serve as a basis for invoking impeachment. In his \n     lectures on the Constitution, Wilson went on to say that ``in \n     the United States and Pennsylvania, impeachments are confined \n     to political characters, to political crimes and \n     misdemeanors, and to political punishments.'' In the North \n     Carolina Convention, several defenders of the Constitution, \n     including James Iredell who was a delegate to the \n     Philadelphia Convention and later became a Justice of the \n     Supreme Court, argued that impeachment would ``arise from \n     acts of great injury to the community.'' The debates \n     surrounding ratification in New York produced the Federalist \n     Papers. Alexander Hamilton explained that,\n       ``[t]he subjects of [the Senate's impeachment] jurisdiction \n     are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of \n     public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or \n     violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which \n     with peculiar propriety may be denominated POLITICAL, as \n     they relate chiefly to injuries done to the society \n     itself.''\n       Like Hamilton, the founding generation understood \n     impeachment to be a political remedy for political offenses. \n     It is important to bear in mind what they meant by \n     ``political.'' They meant that which relates to government \n     and the pursuit of the general welfare; that which involves \n     the system of government or ``society in its political \n     character.'' They specifically did not mean political in the \n     sense of partisan which the framers affirmatively feared. \n     Charles Pinckney, James Wilson, and Alexander Hamilton, for \n     example, each decried construing the impeachment powers in \n     ways that would allow these powers to be put to partisan \n     ends. They lodged the power to try impeachments in the Senate \n     precisely because they thought the Senate would have the \n     necessary independence, stature, and impartiality to prevent \n     the impeachment powers from becoming a tool of factionalism \n     and partisanship. The framers expected that the Senate was, \n     among government institutions, uniquely capable of fidelity \n     to the constitutional limits partisanship that the framers \n     understood to be implicit in the phrase high crimes and \n     misdemeanors.\n       Leading constitutional scholarship of the founding era \n     reflects the same view of the intended narrow scope of high \n     crimes and misdemeanors. Justice Joseph Story, in his \n     pathbreaking Commentaries on the Constitution, looked to \n     British practice to understand the scope of impeachment in \n     the United States Constitution. Recognizing that the U.S. \n     Constitution intended to confine impeachment to a narrower \n     set of offenses than those permitted under British law, he \n     observed that even in Great Britain, ``such kinds of misdeeds \n     . . . as peculiarly injure the commonwealth by the abuse of \n     high offices of trust are the most proper and have been the \n     most usual ground for this kind of prosecution in \n     parliament.'' Story went on to say that impeachment is a \n     remedy for offenses ``of a political character,'' ``growing \n     out of personal misconduct, or gross neglect, or usurpation, \n     or habitual disregard of the public interests, in the \n     discharge of the duties of political office.''\n       The public character of the impeachment offense is further \n     reinforced by the limited nature of the remedy for the \n     offense. In the English tradition, impeachments were \n     punishable by fines, imprisonment and even death. In \n     contrast, the American Constitution completely separates the \n     issue of criminal sanctions from the issue of removal from \n     office. The Constitution states that ``judgment in cases of \n     impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from \n     office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of \n     honor, trust or profit under the United States.'' The remedy \n     for violations of the public's trust in the performance of \n     one's official duties, in other words, is limited to removal \n     from that office and disqualification from holding future \n     offices.\n\n[[Page S1488]]\n\n       Therefore, the Constitution contemplates both an \n     impeachment and a criminal action as consequences for \n     Presidents who commit impeachable offenses. This differs from \n     the English model which only provides for criminal \n     punishments after an impeachment conviction. If, however, a \n     President engages in egregious but non-impeachable activity, \n     the Constitution subjects the President to criminal \n     liability. Impeachment therefore, is viewed not as a \n     mechanism to punish a President, but rather a device to \n     protect the populace. As Story said, impeachment proceedings \n     are ``not so much designed to punish an offender as to secure \n     the state against gross official misdemeanors.''\n       Impeachment, therefore, is intended to preserve the \n     constitutional form of government by removing from office an \n     official who subverts the Constitution and is not intended to \n     be a remedy for someone who breaks the law in connection with \n     a private matter.\n       At least one important early treatise writer, William \n     Rawle, concluded that only official misconduct could provide \n     a basis for impeachment. He contended that ``the causes of \n     impeachment can only have reference to public character and \n     official duty. . . . In general those which may be committed \n     equally by a private person as a public officer are not the \n     subject of impeachment.'' Additional support for this \n     proposition comes from the renowned constitutional scholar, \n     Phillip Kurland who wrote that ``at both the convention that \n     framed the Constitution and at the conventions that ratified \n     it, the essence of an impeachable offense was thought to be \n     breach of trust and not violation of the criminal law. And \n     this was in keeping with the primary function of impeachment, \n     removal from office.'' Finally, additional support for this \n     proposition comes from the United States Department of \n     Justice. As a legal memorandum produced by the Justice \n     Department's Office of Legal Counsel during impeachment \n     proceedings against President Nixon observed, ``[t]he \n     underlying purpose of impeachment is not to punish the \n     individual, but is to protect the public against gross abuse \n     of power.''\n\n\n                d. constitutional practice and precedent\n\n       Another important guide to the meaning of the Constitution \n     is the construction applied throughout our history by those \n     who have been charged with applying its provisions. The \n     significance of constitutional practice is heightened in the \n     absence of applicable judicial interpretation. As Justice \n     Frankfurter stated:\n       ``The Constitution is a framework for government. Therefore \n     the way the framework has consistently operated fairly \n     establishes that it has operated according to its true \n     nature. Deeply embedded traditional ways of conducting \n     government cannot supplant the Constitution or legislation, \n     but they give meaning to the words of a text or supply them. \n     It is an inadmissibly narrow conception of American \n     constitutional law to confine it to the words of the \n     Constitution and to disregard the gloss which life has \n     written upon them.''\n       In the history of the United States, the Senate has never \n     convicted any President of an impeachable offense. This fact \n     stands out as the sum total of the Senate's practical \n     construction of the Constitution's impeachment provisions as \n     they relate to the President of the United States. It must \n     serve as a chilling call to self-restraint in construing \n     those provisions.\n       The Senate has convicted other civil officers of \n     impeachable offenses, including high crimes and misdemeanors. \n     There is reason to doubt whether these cases, mostly \n     involving federal judges, provide directly analogous \n     precedent for cases involving the President. First, the \n     Madison-Mason colloquy and the debates in the state ratifying \n     conventions demonstrate the framers' primary concern was with \n     the use of impeachment as a vehicle for encroachments on the \n     President's structurally necessary independence from the \n     legislature. Second, federal judges serve life terms and are \n     not elected. The automatic removal of the President upon \n     conviction of high crimes and misdemeanors has the widely \n     remarked upon consequence of artificially altering the \n     expected result of an election and thus is regarded as in \n     tension with democratic principles. Moreover, because the \n     President serves a limited term of four years, the need for \n     an artificial removal mechanism is less urgent than it is in \n     the case of judges who would otherwise serve an illimitable \n     term.\n       These caveats aside, an examination of congressional \n     practice in the case of the fifteen officers who have been \n     impeached by the House strongly supports construing high \n     crimes and misdemeanors as aimed primarily at official \n     misconduct that results in grave harm to our constitutional \n     system of government. In every case, the misconduct cited as \n     impeachable involved the misuse of office or the power of \n     office. No case involved impeachment for conduct that did not \n     involve the exercise of the impeached person's office or \n     official power. The closest the Congress has come to \n     impeaching and convicting an officer for conduct not \n     involving abuse of office was the case of Judge Harry \n     Claiborne. Judge Claiborne was impeached, convicted, and \n     removed from office for committing tax evasion. \n     Superficially, this conduct did not itself involve his \n     judicial office in any direct way. The income he was \n     convicted of withholding, however, allegedly came from \n     improper payments to him, which were made because of his \n     judicial office. In their essence, then, the charges against \n     him were charges of serious abuse of office involving what \n     amounted to bribery, though the articles of impeachment did \n     not formally recount the source of the income at the heart of \n     the tax evasion case against Judge Claiborne. [Memorandum, \n     12/22/98]\n\n\n                           evidence, rules of\n\n       Are the Federal Rules of Evidence Applicable? Neither the \n     Senate nor its presiding officer, the Chief Justice, is \n     required to follow the Federal Rules of Evidence in ruling on \n     evidentiary objections during an impeachment trial. As a \n     matter of practice these decision makers have relied upon the \n     Federal Rules in considering evidentiary objections, but have \n     not always excluded evidence that the Federal Rules would \n     exclude or admitted evidence that the Federal Rules would \n     allow. The Senate's approach has been to receive all evidence \n     except where doing so would be unfair to one of the parties. \n     In determining what is fair, the Senate has placed great \n     weight on the Federal Rules.\n       The refusal to adopt the Federal Rules of Evidence is \n     apparently based on the judgment that the Senate is highly \n     sophisticated as a jury examining political crimes and \n     weighing political remedies. Consequently, the Senate does \n     not need the sort of protections that juries commonly \n     require. The concern raised by not adopting the Federal Rules \n     is that, where the only limit on the discretion of individual \n     Senators is their sense of fairness, party-line voting may \n     emerge and the impeachment process could come to be viewed as \n     lacking the necessary impartiality.\n       While the Senate has never accepted that it is bound by the \n     Federal Rules, it may vote to require their application in a \n     given case. In fact, the Senate did just that on at least one \n     occasion. During the Rule XI committee deliberations in the \n     impeachment trial of Judge Harry Claiborne, Senator Orrin \n     Hatch argued that the committee should accept the Federal \n     Rules as binding. Then-Senator Albert Gore argued against \n     accepting the Federal Rules.\n       Is the Starr Report Admissible? Either or both parties may \n     seek to introduce the referral and supporting documentation \n     that independent counsel Kenneth Starr submitted to the House \n     Judiciary Committee. Much of this material would not be \n     admissible in a judicial proceeding. The referral itself is \n     not evidence, but a summation of evidence contained in the \n     attachments. The attachments include grand jury testimony \n     where witnesses were not subject to cross-examination and \n     other material could represent hearsay.\n       There is some precedent for admitting the record and \n     proceedings from a judicial proceeding as substantive \n     evidence in an impeachment trial. In the impeachment trial of \n     Judge Harry Claiborne, one of the House Managers, then-\n     Representative Michael DeWine, argued that the Rule XI \n     committee should accept the record of the criminal trial in \n     which Judge Claiborne was convicted of tax evasion charges. \n     Specifically, Manager DeWine argued that accepting the \n     evidence would establish an important precedent in favor of \n     economy and efficiency in impeachment proceedings. The \n     committee accepted DeWine's argument and received the trial \n     record as substantive evidence.\n       In Judge Claiborne's case, the committee agreed to receive \n     evidence that had been subject to cross-examination by Judge \n     Claiborne's attorneys. If the President's counsel objects to \n     the Senate receiving the Starr report and supporting \n     materials, he could distinguish the Claiborne precedent on \n     the ground that the President's lawyers had no opportunity to \n     cross examine grand jury witnesses.\n       Is Evidence of Prosecutorial Misconduct Admissible? The \n     President's counsel may seek to introduce evidence of \n     prosecutorial misconduct. The House Managers or Senators may \n     object on the grounds that such evidence is irrelevant. \n     Either the President committed high crimes or misdemeanors, \n     or he did not; evidence relating to what the independent \n     counsel may have done to investigate the President is beside \n     the point.\n       The President, however, would have a powerful contrary \n     argument, particularly if the Starr report and supporting \n     documents are admitted as substantive evidence. The report \n     itself represents the conclusions drawn by the independent \n     counsel. The supporting documents represent evidence and \n     testimony collected by the independent counsel without \n     opportunity for supplementation, challenge or cross-\n     examination by the President. Understanding the independent \n     counsel's bias or impartiality is crucial to assessing the \n     weight and credibility of this type of evidence. For example, \n     the independent counsel's office will have chosen to pursue \n     certain lines of questioning with witnesses before the grand \n     jury. If the independent counsel acted from bias, there is a \n     reasonable inference that the roads the prosecutor chose not \n     to follow would have revealed evidence favorable to the \n     President. If, on the other hand, the independent counsel is \n     impartial, one may reasonably infer that he sought to uncover \n     all relevant information whether favorable or unfavorable to \n     the President.\n       In addition, if officials in the Office of the Independent \n     Counsel threatened witnesses, that fact is relevant to \n     assessing the credibility of the testimony and evidence given \n     by those witnesses.\n       In one previous case, the Rule XI committee voted to allow \n     the defense to present evidence of prosecutorial misconduct, \n     although\n\n[[Page S1489]]\n\n     it did not allow the defense to pursue elements of its theory \n     that were purely speculative and highly dubious.--\n     [Memorandum, 12/28/98]\n\n\n                            Findings of Fact\n\n       Various proposals to have the Senate vote on ``findings of \n     fact'' prior to a final vote on the articles of impeachment \n     are circulating. The most onerous of these would ask the \n     Senate to ``find'' that the President had violated federal \n     laws against perjury and obstruction of justice.\n       Under one presumed scenario, the findings of fact would \n     pass, while the subsequent vote on the articles would fail. \n     Thus, while the President would remain in office, his legacy \n     would be besmirched by an impeachment trial's finding that he \n     was guilty of crimes.\n       There are several constitutional arguments against this \n     procedure, each based on the fact that it is either \n     equivalent to, or tantamount to, separating a vote on guilt \n     or innocence from a vote on removal.\n       Very early in the Senate's history, the Senate did in fact \n     separate these two votes, notably in the case of Judge John \n     Pickering. Pickering was charged with drunkenness, among \n     other things, but not with any crimes. The Senate voted \n     separately on whether he was guilty under the articles and \n     then on whether or not he should be removed from office. \n     (They voted to convict and to remove.)\n       This procedure might signal that the Senate believed that \n     in an impeachment trial a person could be found guilty by the \n     Senate of offenses that did not rise to the level of \n     ``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' \n     Under that interpretation, the second vote would be necessary \n     to establish whether or not the offenses justified removal \n     from office.\n       However, this possible interpretation of the trial \n     procedure was repudiated in the 1936 impeachment trial of \n     Judge Halstead Ritter, when the chair ruled that removal \n     followed automatically from a finding of guilty, so that a \n     separate vote on removal was not in order. The ruling was \n     based on the text of Article II, Section 4, of the \n     Constitution which provides that ``The President [and other \n     civil officers] shall be removed from Office on Impeachment \n     for, and Conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high \n     Crimes and Misdemeanors.''\n       The dominant view of constitutional scholars is that the \n     chair's ruling in the Ritter case was correct. Notice that \n     there are two significant components of the Ritter \n     interpretation: (1) the president, vice president or other \n     civil officers can only be impeached for ``treason, bribery, \n     or other high crimes and misdemeanors,'' and (2) removal then \n     follows by operation of Constitutional law upon conviction.\n       Against this background, the proposed findings of fact \n     could produce substantial constitutional mischief. Suppose \n     they received a \\2/3\\'s vote. If the offenses outlined in the \n     findings of fact are high crimes and misdemeanors, the \n     President would have been removed from office by operation of \n     Constitutional law.\n       Suppose, further, that the Senate then took the final vote \n     on the articles and on that vote the yeas were less than \\2/\n     3\\'s. Looking strictly at this vote, the President has been \n     acquitted, and remains in office.\n       Who, then, is the President of the United States after \n     these two votes have been cast--Bill Clinton or Al Gore? In \n     other words, who decides whether the first vote convicted the \n     President of high crimes and misdemeanors?\n       Senators might well argue that the very fact that the \n     Senate took the second vote proves that the first vote was \n     not on offenses that justified removal. That would be an \n     ironic position for many Republican Senators to be in, \n     however, as many of them are on record defending the \n     proposition that perjury and obstruction of justice are \n     clearly impeachable offenses.\n       One argument against the proposed findings of fact, then, \n     is that it could create enormous uncertainty about who \n     occupies the office of President. The impact of that \n     uncertainty on foreign and domestic policy would potentially \n     be quite great, infecting every official action the President \n     might undertake. (Perhaps Bill Clinton and Al Gore could do \n     everything in tandem--co-sign all official documents, co-\n     attend all foreign negotiations, etc. --thereby eliminating \n     the legal ambiguities by creating a true co-presidency.)\n       The uncertainty would, in all likelihood, result in \n     litigation. Suit could be brought by someone adversely \n     affected by a law ``signed'' by Bill Clinton that would \n     otherwise have been pocket vetoed due to the adjournment of \n     Congress, claiming that the bill never became law. Or it \n     could be brought by someone seeking the benefits of a law \n     that Bill Clinton had ``vetoed,'' claiming that the veto had \n     no effect because Bill Clinton was not President.\n       Even if such litigation would eventually lead to a \n     resolution of the uncertainty, the country would suffer \n     during the interim.\n       There is a real possibility, however, that the Supreme \n     Court would find the question of what constitutes a ``high \n     crime and misdemeanor'' to be nonjusticiable. In United \n     States v. Nixon, the Court held that nearly all questions \n     regarding the Senate's power to try impeachments are \n     nonjusticiable, and it might well so find in this instance, \n     as well.\n       Even if the findings of fact did not garner \\2/3\\'s \n     support, a second argument against the findings of fact can \n     be based on the two-part Ritter interpretation of the \n     impeachment power (i.e., impeachment available only for high \n     crimes and misdemeanors; removal follows automatically from \n     conviction). The contemplated bifurcated vote provides a \n     mechanism for doing exactly what the Ritter interpretation \n     and the prevailing view among scholars say the constitution \n     does not permit: impeaching and convicting a person of lesser \n     offenses than high crimes and misdemeanors.\n       The consequences of sanctioning impeachment for ``low'' \n     crimes and misdemeanors in this way are spelled out nicely in \n     a draft op-ed by Jed Rubenfeld. He argues that if the Senate \n     proceeds with the proposed findings of fact,\n\n       ``[t]he Senate would then have taken another big step \n     toward transforming impeachment into a tool of partisan \n     politics.\n       ``The Clinton Impeachment would then establish the \n     proposition that it is a legitimate senatorial function in an \n     impeachment proceeding to ``find'' that the President \n     committed crimes or serious misconduct (but not high crimes). \n     In that case, why shouldn't a majority of the House impeach \n     every President who has engaged in conduct worthy of censure? \n     It would no longer matter whether this conduct rose to the \n     level of high crimes and misdemeanors, for after all, one of \n     the Senate's legitimate and proper functions would be to find \n     that the President had committed ``low'' or ``medium'' crimes \n     or other serious misconduct not requiring removal from \n     office.\n       ``If the Senate wants to censure the President, let it. But \n     impeachment is not about finding criminal guilt or innocence, \n     and it is not about censure. It is about removal from office. \n     The Senate must vote, up or down, on conviction and removal. \n     Anything less or in-between is more partisan mud.''\n\n       The idea that the House could routinely start up the Senate \n     impeachment trial apparatus on the basis of offenses \n     insufficient to constitute high crimes and misdemeanors \n     because the bifurcated vote procedure supplied the Senate \n     with a way to cope with such charges would probably have been \n     anathema to the Framers, who thought that impeachment ought \n     to be rarely used and reserved for the most serious breaches \n     of public trust.\n       Judge Bork agrees that the bifurcated approach poses \n     serious separation of powers problems. He wrote in the \n     February 1, edition of the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       ``That course would also create an unconstitutional \n     political weapon in the permanent struggle between the \n     legislative and executive branches. Had the Isenbergh-Kmiec \n     proposition been accepted during Iran-Contra, is there any \n     doubt that the Democratic House and Senate would have \n     impeached Ronald Reagan and, unable to convict him by a two-\n     thirds vote, adopted findings of fact by a majority vote that \n     effectively condemned him as the perpetrator of high crimes \n     and misdemeanors? This is precisely what the separation of \n     powers does not allow and what anyone who thinks ahead should \n     disavow.''\n\n       (The Isenbergh-Kmiec proposition mentioned by Judge Bork \n     refers to a law review article by Professor Isenbergh of \n     Chicago Law School arguing that the Ritter interpretation is \n     wrong--that in fact people can be impeached under the \n     Constitution for offenses less than high crimes and \n     misdemeanors, in which case lesser sanctions than removal are \n     also available to the Senate.)\n       These are powerful arguments. There are responses to them, \n     however, which I believe make the ultimate judgment as to \n     whether or not the bifurcated procedure passes constitutional \n     muster open to reasonable disagreement.\n       As to the complaint that the procedure unconstitutionally \n     bifurcates a unitary vote, the complaint just misconceives \n     what the findings of fact motion is. It is not a vote on \n     guilt or innocence of impeachable offenses at all because it \n     doesn't by its terms convict the President of anything. It is \n     antecedent to any question of conviction for impeachable \n     offenses or of remedy. It leaves Senators free to vote any \n     way they wish on guilt or innocence and thus does not split \n     up the conviction/remedy questions. If necessary, this could \n     be made crystal clear through careful drafting, such as by \n     phrasing the motion as, ``Without prejudice to the final \n     question of guilt or innocence on any of the articles of \n     impeachment, the Senate finds . . .''\n       This interpretation also responds to the complaint urged by \n     Rubenfeld and echoed by Bork. Because the findings of fact \n     are toothless as regards guilt or innocence, passing such a \n     motion is not equivalent to convicting the President of low \n     crimes and misdemeanors. The Rubenfeld-Bork objection would \n     lie if and only if the Senate purported to convict the \n     President of such offenses, and then sought to avoid removing \n     him by rejecting the articles. But it is not doing that when \n     it makes findings of fact. Because such findings lack any \n     conceivable juridical effect, they are no more offensive to \n     the Constitution than a censure resolution.\n       One could even imagine a findings of fact motion serving a \n     purpose that would be beneficial to the impeachment process. \n     Findings of fact could help provide a clear historical record \n     as to what this United States Senate believed did not rise to \n     the level of impeachable offenses (or did rise to that level, \n     depending upon the outcome of the vote on conviction). \n     Historically, the Senate has left to each individual Senator \n     the responsibility to make an overall unitary determination \n     as to the facts that have been proven, the requisite burden \n     of proof as to those facts, and\n\n[[Page S1490]]\n\n     the ultimate consequences that flow from those facts, taking \n     into account both the costs of retaining the civil officer in \n     office as well as the costs of removing him or her. It could \n     be argued that our constitutional practices would be just as \n     well served if the basis for the final judgment was expressed \n     in more discrete and articulated collective judgments, first \n     as to the facts proven, and then as to their consequences.\n       This last point runs counter to the Senate's current rules \n     and practices, of course. Rule XXIII of the rules of \n     impeachment provides that ``an article of impeachment shall \n     not be divisible for the purpose of voting thereon at any \n     time during the trial.'' This provision was adopted in 1986. \n     Some of its legislative history is pertinent:\n       ``The portion of the amendment effectively enjoining the \n     division of an individual article into separate \n     specifications is proposed to permit the most judicious and \n     efficacious handling of the final question both as a general \n     matter and, in particular, with respect to the form of the \n     articles that proposed the impeachment of President Richard \n     Nixon. The latter did not follow the more familiar pattern of \n     embodying an impeachable offense in an individual article \n     but, in respect to the first and second of those articles, \n     set out broadly based charges alleging constitutional \n     improprieties followed by a recital of transactions \n     illustrative or supportive of such charges. The wording of \n     Articles I and II expressly provided that a conviction could \n     be had thereunder if supported by `one or more of the' \n     enumerated specifications. The general view of the Committee \n     at that time was expressed by Senators Byrd and Allen, both \n     of whom felt that division of the articles in question into \n     potentially 14 separately voted specifications might `be time \n     consuming and confusing, and a matter which could create \n     great chaos and division, bitterness, and ill will . . . .' \n     ''\n       The rule and its history suggests that the Senate currently \n     operates under a norm of maximum individual Senatorial \n     autonomy in reaching an overall unitary judgment as to guilt \n     or innocence, without the interposition of potentially \n     divisive antecedent motions seeking to clarify exactly what \n     acts the Senate as a body has found the accused to have \n     committed.\n       It is possible to object to the proposed findings of fact \n     as being inconsistent with Rule XXIII. The rejoinder to that \n     objection, of course, is a version of what has already been \n     stated: the findings need not be construed as ``dividing'' \n     any article of impeachment, but rather as a motion antecedent \n     to an eventual vote on the articles. Still, the findings do \n     seem inconsistent with the spirit of Rule XXIII and with its \n     evident intention to avoid divisive preliminary votes of this \n     kind.\n       Putting aside constitutional or rule-based objections to \n     the proposed findings of fact, Rubenfeld-Bork make a very \n     powerful practical argument that this bifurcation will have \n     pernicious consequences. We are currently living through \n     proof of how all-consuming an impeachment and trial of a \n     President can be. The country loses time and attention that \n     could be devoted to constructive matters of public interest, \n     trust in the ability of elected officials to work together by \n     placing the nation's business first is eroded, and the \n     Presidency is placed under a cloud of uncertainty during the \n     pendency of the proceedings. Lowering the impeachment bar \n     through the use of this bifurcated procedure would be unwise \n     and, as suggested earlier, would most likely be viewed with \n     alarm by the Framers who drafted the impeachment power into \n     the Constitution.\n       There is, finally, an argument that such findings would \n     amount to an unconstitutional Bill of Attainder. The risk \n     that such findings would be found to be an unconstitutional \n     ``trial by legislature'' is enhanced (a) by the fact that \n     under some of the proposals, the finding would be that the \n     President had violated the law; (b) by the fact that the \n     findings would occur in the context of a Senate trial.\n       Such Senate action could well have an adverse effect on \n     President Clinton's bar membership. Bar rules disqualify \n     individuals who have been convicted of perjury or obstructed \n     justice. If those consequences followed from the Senate \n     action, they could be construed as punishment, thus bringing \n     the findings of fact within the constitutional prohibition on \n     bills of attainder.--[Memorandum, 2/2/99]\n\n\n                     Impeachment Rules, Changes to\n\n       The existing Senate Rules establish the basic contours of \n     how an impeachment trial will proceed. Many questions remain \n     open, however--just as in civil cases, the federal rules of \n     civil procedure provide the basic contours, but the actual \n     route traveled by any trial depends upon the particular facts \n     and law of each case, the motions that parties choose to \n     bring, and, in general, the manner in which the parties \n     choose to litigate the matter.\n       This section highlights the major questions that deserve \n     examination before the trial begins. It also discusses the \n     available mechanisms for resolving outstanding procedural \n     issues.\n       Should any of the existing rules be modified? The existing \n     Rules were last amended in 1986. Should the Senate wish to \n     revise any of them, motions to do so would be in order on the \n     first day and would be fully debatable. Once actual the trial \n     begins motions are not debatable, and a motion to suspend, \n     modify, or amend the rules would require unanimous consent. \n     Before the trial begins (the period between the exhibition of \n     the articles of impeachment and the presentation of opening \n     statements by the parties), Senate precedent supports \n     allowing debate on preliminary motions that relate to how the \n     Senate will organize itself to conduct the trial. It appears \n     that such motions are subject to the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, and not the limitations on debate contained in the \n     impeachment Rules. Thus, they could be filibustered during \n     the pre-trial stage. As a motion to suspend, modify, or amend \n     the rules, any such motion would be subject to a heightened \n     cloture requirement. Standing Rule XXII requires a two-thirds \n     vote to invoke cloture and end debate on a motion to suspend, \n     modify, or amend the rules.\n       The impeachment rules provide for the proceedings to be \n     ``double-tracked'' (with legislative business conducted in \n     the morning session and the impeachment trial conducted in \n     the afternoon). Even after the trial has commenced, then, a \n     motion to suspend, modify, or amend could be made in a \n     morning legislative session, but would be subject to \n     filibuster with a two-thirds cloture requirement.--\n     [Memorandum, 12/28/98]\n\n\n                         Obstruction of Justice\n\n       The House relies on two different federal obstruction of \n     justice statutes. The first, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1503, is the \n     general obstruction of justice statute. The second, 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1512(b), addresses witness tampering.\n       A. Elements of the General Obstruction of Justice Statute\n       To establish a violation of the general obstruction of \n     justice statute (Sec.  1503), the government must prove each \n     of the following:\n       (1) that there was a pending judicial proceeding;\n       (2) that the defendant knew this proceeding was pending; \n     and\n       (3) that the defendant corruptly influenced, obstructed, or \n     impeded the due administration of justice or endeavored to \n     corruptly influence, obstruct, or impede the due \n     administration of justice.\n       The first two elements are straightforward. The third \n     element is more complex. In general:\n       ``Corruptly'' means to engage in an act voluntarily and \n     deliberately for the purpose of improperly influencing, \n     obstructing, or interfering with the administration of \n     justice.\n       ``Endeavor'' means that the defendant also knowingly and \n     deliberately acted or made an effort which had a reasonable \n     tendency to bring about the desired result of interfering \n     with the administration of justice.\n       The defendant must engage in misconduct that has the \n     ``natural and probable effect'' of interfering with the due \n     administration of justice. He need only ``endeavor'' to \n     obstruct justice; he need not succeed.\n       B. Elements of the Witness Tampering Statute\n       To establish a violation of the witness tampering statute \n     (Sec.  1512(b)), the government must establish that the \n     defendant:\n       (1) knowingly\n       (2) corruptly persuaded another person or attempted to do \n     so, or engaged in misleading conduct toward another person\n       (3) with the intent\n       to influence, delay, or prevent a witness's testimony from \n     being presented at official federal proceedings,\n       to cause or induce any person to withhold testimony or \n     physical evidence from an official federal proceeding; or\n       to prevent a witness from reporting evidence of a crime to \n     federal authorities.\n       Unlike the general obstruction of justice statute, the \n     witness tampering statute does not require that the \n     defendant's misconduct be committed during the pendency of \n     federal proceedings. Thus, the defendant need not be aware of \n     any pending or contemplated federal proceedings or \n     investigations at the time he engages in his obstructive \n     conduct. Nonetheless, it must be proved that the defendant \n     intended by his prohibited conduct to obstruct a federal \n     proceeding or the reporting of a federal crime.\n       There is no judicial consensus as to the meaning of \n     ``corrupt persuasion,'' but several courts have defined the \n     term to mean that the defendant's attempts to persuade ``were \n     motivated by an improper purpose.''\n       The term ``misleading conduct'' is defined in 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec.  1515 to include (A) knowingly making a false statement; \n     (B) intentionally omitting information from a statement and \n     thereby causing a portion of such statement to be misleading, \n     or intentionally concealing a material fact, and thereby \n     creating a false impression by such statement; (C) with \n     intent to mislead, knowingly submitting or inviting reliance \n     on a writing or recording that is false, forged, altered, or \n     otherwise lacking in authenticity.\n       At least one court has held that a defendant violates the \n     witness tampering statute when he tells a potential witness a \n     false story as if the story were true, intending that the \n     witness believe the story and testify to it before the grand \n     jury.--[Memorandum, 1/15/99]\n\n\n                                Perjury\n\n       Under federal law, a witness commits grand jury perjury if \n     shown, when under oath before a federal grand jury, to have \n     made a: knowingly false declaration that is of a material \n     matter that the grand jury has the power to investigate. \n     Proof only of an intent to mislead is not sufficient for a \n     perjury conviction.\n       ``Knowingly false declarations'' can be proved by evidence \n     that the individual did not believe a declaration to be true \n     at the time it was made.\n\n[[Page S1491]]\n\n       Only unambiguous questions can form the basis of perjury \n     convictions. If a question can reasonably be interpreted in \n     multiple ways, perjury can not be based only on the \n     questioner's intended meaning and there must be evidence of \n     what the person answering understood when responding.\n       Grand jury perjury can not be based on an answer that was \n     literally true even if misleading and nonresponsive to the \n     question asked. The burden is on the questioner to identify \n     evasive answers and press for clarity at the time rather than \n     let it pass and charge perjury later.\n       Grand jury perjury convictions can be based on the \n     testimony of a single uncorroborated witness. And, even if no \n     single statement can be shown to be knowingly false, perjury \n     can be shown if the individual knowingly made multiple \n     material declarations under oath that are ``inconsistent to \n     the degree that one of them is necessarily false.''\n       A ``material matter'' for perjury convictions under federal \n     law must have had some bearing on the substantive elements of \n     the issues that the grand jury was convened to investigate \n     and would have some bearing on influencing or impeding that \n     investigation, regardless of whether the statement actually \n     was misleading on a particular point.\n       The Minority Views in the House Report argue that because \n     the judge in the Jones sexual harassment case ruled in \n     January 1998 that evidence relating to Monica Lewinsky was \n     not ``essential to the core issues in that case,'' Jones' \n     lawyers could not have introduced evidence about her \n     relationship with the President in order to attack his \n     credibility in that suit, so that his statements on the \n     subject are not material under perjury law.--[Memorandum, 12/\n     30/98]\n\n\n                        President, Indictment of\n\n       The New York Times recently reported that Ken Starr and his \n     staff have recently concluded that the Constitution does not \n     prohibit them from indicting and prosecuting President \n     Clinton while he is still in office. The independent counsel \n     has a legitimate reason for seeking an indictment before the \n     end of President Clinton's term. The grand jury that is \n     currently impaneled and that has heard all the evidence \n     will expire by August. If the Independent Counsel waits \n     until the President leaves office, he will have to impanel \n     a new grand jury and present evidence all over again.\n       This memorandum reviews the constitutional issues that \n     would be raised if a prosecutor were to attempt to indict and \n     prosecute a sitting President. It concludes that the \n     Constitution permits a prosecutor to indict a sitting \n     President, but does not allow the prosecutor to proceed to \n     prosecute the indictment until the President's term has \n     expired. Although the Constitution does not forbid indictment \n     of a sitting President, there are significant prudential \n     arguments counseling against such a move. Moreover, there may \n     be a statutory impediment to indicting the President.\n\n\n                                I. Text\n\n       Until recently, numerous commentators interpreted the \n     Constitution's text to prohibit criminal prosecution of any \n     officer before the officer was impeached and removed. The \n     only provision on point states, ``Judgment in cases of \n     impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from \n     office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of \n     honor, trust, or profit under the United States; but the \n     party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to \n     indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to \n     law.'' Article I, section 3. This interpretation reads the \n     phrase ``the party convicted shall nevertheless . . .'' to \n     mean that only parties who have been convicted are subject to \n     judicial process. In other words, impeachment and conviction \n     is a prerequisite to judicial process.\n       The better reading has always been that the Constitution's \n     text is ambiguous. It can just as easily be understood to \n     mean that impeachment and conviction, if that should occur \n     first, are not a bar to judicial process. This interpretation \n     has been vindicated by recent practice. The three judges \n     impeached and convicted in the late 1980s were all indicted \n     and prosecuted criminally first. In addition, Vice President \n     Spiro Agnew was indicted while in office, as was sitting Vice \n     President Aaron Burr in 1804. The provision cited does not \n     distinguish between the President and other officers subject \n     to impeachment. Thus, if the President is to be treated \n     differently than other impeachable officers, it must be on \n     some basis other than the Constitution's text.\n\n\n                             II. Structure\n\n       Even the most originalist minded cosntitutional scholars do \n     not limit their arguments to those based on language alone. \n     They also argue based on the structure of the document taken \n     as a whole. Shifting the focus from text to structure, there \n     is strong reason to conclude that the Constitution does not \n     forbid indictment of a sitting President but that it does \n     prohibit taking the further step of prosecuting him \n     criminally.\n       The Constitution structures the federal government by \n     dividing it into three branches. In order to safeguard \n     liberty, each of these branches must be fully functioning at \n     all times. Anything that significantly impairs the \n     President's ability to act as a check on the other branches \n     may violate the Constitution's structural safeguards. By \n     contrast, there are hundreds of district court judges. A \n     criminal proceeding against one of them has only remote \n     ramifications for the constitutional role of the judiciary as \n     an collective institution.\n       The constitutional status of the President is unique, and \n     materially distinguishable from that of other impeachable \n     officers, such as district court judges or even the Vice \n     President. First, the President, of course, is the head of \n     one of the three constitutional branches of government. The \n     other branches have collective heads. The legislative branch \n     is headed by the entire Congress, while the judiciary is \n     headed by the Supreme Court. To indict and prosecute the \n     President is in this sense the constitutional equivalent of \n     indicting and prosecuting the entire Congress or the entire \n     Supreme Court.\n       Second, the presidency is a uniquely consuming office. Its \n     occupant is perpetually on duty. Nearly every President from \n     George Washington through George Bush has expressed just how \n     consuming the office is. For example, Lyndon Johnson related \n     that ``Of the 1,885 nights I was President there were not \n     many when I got to sleep before 1 or 2 a.m. and there were \n     few mornings when I didn't wake up by 6 or 6:30.'' The \n     Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides \n     for presidential succession in the case of disability, \n     recognizes not only how consuming the office is, but how \n     critical it is that the office be filled at all times.\n       Third, the President acts as the embodiment of the nation \n     on the international stage and even in domestic matters. As \n     Justice Robert Jackson reminded us, the presidential office \n     locates the executive power ``in a single head in whose \n     choice the whole nation has a part, making him the focus of \n     public hopes and expectations. In drama, magnitude and \n     finality his decisions so far overshadow any others that \n     almost alone he fills the public eye and ear.''\n       Against this structural argument stand rule of law \n     considerations. The continuing vitality of the rule of law as \n     a fundamental principle requires that the President be \n     subject to law as are all citizens. This commitment is voiced \n     in the President's constitutional duty to ``take care that \n     the laws be faithfully executed.'' The primary purpose of \n     this provision is to make it clear that the President, unlike \n     the King of England, has no ``dispensing power,'' that is, no \n     power to declare a law inapplicable to himself or anyone \n     else. Similarly, the courts have placed great weight on the \n     integrity of the criminal justice system. In a variety of \n     executive privilege cases, the courts have placed a great \n     premium on according prosecutors access to evidence and on \n     preserving evidence.\n       Determining whether the Constitution permits either \n     indictment or prosecution of a sitting President requires \n     balancing these considerations.\n\n\n      Punishments upon Conviction of High Crimes and Misdemeanors\n\n       If the Senate convicts the President of high crimes and \n     misdemeanors, the Constitution requires that he be removed \n     from office. ``The President--shall be removed from office \n     upon impeachment for and conviction of--high crimes and \n     misdemeanors.'' The Constitution allows the Senate to impose \n     an additional punishment upon convicting the President; it \n     may disqualify the President from holding any office of \n     honor, trust or profit. Odd as it sounds, this \n     disqualification probably does not apply to membership in the \n     House of Representatives of the Senate. This is because the \n     text of the Constitution, in several clauses, makes it clear \n     that members of Congress are not ``officers.'' The very first \n     impeachment trial proceeded against Senator Blount. Senator \n     Blount was acquitted and many Senators refused to convict on \n     the basis of their constitutional interpretation that a \n     senator is not an officer and so is not subject to \n     impeachment.--[Memorandum, 12/28/98]\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Very early in the Senate's history, the Senate did in fact \n     separate these two votes, notably in the case of Judge John \n     Pickering. Pickering was charged with drunkenness, among \n     other things, but not with any crimes. The Senate voted \n     separately on whether he was guilty under the articles and \n     then on whether or not he should be removed from office. \n     (They voted to convict and to remove.)\n       This procedure might signal that the Senate believed that \n     in an impeachment trial a person could be found guilty by the \n     Senate of offenses that did not rise to the level of \n     ``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' \n     Under that interpretation, the second vote would be necessary \n     to establish whether or not the offenses justified removal \n     from office. However, this possible interpretation of the \n     trial procedure was repudiated in the 1936 impeachment trial \n     of Judge Halstead Ritter, when the chair ruled that removal \n     followed automatically from a finding of guilty, so that a \n     separate vote on removal was not in order. The ruling was \n     based on the text of Article II, Section 4, of the \n     Constitution which provides that ``The President [and other \n     civil officers] shall be removed from Office on Impeachment \n     for, and Conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high \n     Crimes and Misdemeanors.''\n       The dominant view of constitutional scholars is that the \n     chair's ruling in the Ritter case was correct. Notice that \n     there are two significant components of the Ritter \n     interpretation: (1) the president, vice president or other \n     civil officers can only be impeached for ``treason, bribery, \n     or other high crimes and misdemeanors,'' and (2) removal then \n     follows by operation of Constitutional law upon conviction.--\n     [Memorandum, 2/2/99]\n\n[[Page S1492]]\n\n                         Role of Chief Justice\n\n       The Chief Justice of the United States is the Presiding \n     Officer over the Senate's deliberations when the President \n     has been impeached. His role is loosely analogous to that of \n     a trial judge, but with less ultimate authority. He directs \n     preparations for the trial, as well as the trial proceedings \n     themselves. Under the precedent of the Johnson trial, the \n     Chief Justice can make rulings on all evidentiary and \n     procedural motions and objections, although he can also refer \n     them directly to the Senate for its determination (this was \n     in fact Chief Justice Chase's practice on evidentiary motions \n     made during the Johnson trial). His rulings can be overruled \n     by majority vote of the Senators present and voting.\n       The Constitution dictates that the Chief Justice acts as \n     the presiding officer during an impeachment trial of the \n     President. The extent and content of his role is subject to \n     determination by the Senate. There could be sentiment to \n     expand his powers, such as by making him the chair of a Rule \n     XI committee, on the theory that the Chief Justice will be \n     non-partisan and impartial. Other powers that might be \n     granted to the Chief could include authority to conduct pre-\n     trial proceedings or to oversee settlement negotiations. If \n     the Chief Justice is perceived as impartial, his rulings on \n     evidence and other motions will carry great weight and place \n     a heavy burden on anyone seeking to overrule them. On the \n     other hand, a determined majority can substantially minimize \n     the effect of the Chief Justice on the proceedings by \n     reversing his rulings and refusing to grant him powers beyond \n     the inherent powers of the presiding officer.--[Memorandum, \n     12/28/98]\n\n\n                         Role of House Managers\n\n       The House of Representatives appoints a delegation of its \n     own members to serve as prosecutors of the impeachment. These \n     managers exhibit the articles of impeachment and perform all \n     functions normally performed by a prosecutor. They make an \n     opening and closing statement on the case, decide what \n     evidence to present and what witnesses to call, subject to \n     the Senate's decision to issue a subpoena to compel \n     attendance of involuntary witnesses. The managers lead \n     examination of witnesses they offer and cross-examine \n     witnesses called by the President's counsel. They may also \n     make procedural, evidentiary, and other motions.--\n     [Memorandum, 12/28/98]\n\n\n                      Role of President's Counsel\n\n       The President may choose an attorney or agent to present \n     his defense. These attorneys perform the same functions in \n     defense of the President as the house Managers perform in \n     behalf of the impeachment. Neither the President's Counsel \n     nor the House Managers may appeal a ruling of the Chief \n     Justice. Only a member of the Senate may do that.--\n     [Memorandum, 12/28/98]\n\n\n                           Role of the Senate\n\n       [The constitutional text, the Framer's understanding, and \n     our constitutional practices] Provide important anchors for \n     any impeachment inquiry, but they do not resolve all \n     questions of scope that may arise. Much remains to be worked \n     out--and only to be worked out--in the context of particular \n     circumstances and allegations.\n       As Hamilton explained in the Federalist No.65, impeachment \n     ``can never be tied down by . . . strict rules, either in the \n     delineation of the offence by the prosecutors, or in the \n     construction of it by the judges. . .''\n       After all of the legal research, we are still left with the \n     realization that the power to convict for impeachment \n     constitutes an ``awful discretion.''\n       This brings us directly to the Senate's role. To state it \n     bluntly: I believe the role of the Senate is to resolve all \n     the remaining questions. Let me elaborate.\n       The Senate's role as final interpreter of impeachments was \n     recognized from the beginning of the republic. For example, \n     to refer again to Joseph Story, after he devoted almost fifty \n     sections of his commentaries to various disputed questions \n     about the impeachment power, he concluded that the final \n     decision on the unresolved issues ``may be reasonably left to \n     the high tribunal, constituting the court of impeachment.''\n       The court of impeachment he refers to is the United States \n     Senate. Similarly, the Federalist papers refer to Senators as \n     the judges of impeachment.\n       Speaking of the Senate as the jury in impeachment trials is \n     perhaps a more common analogy these days, but the judge \n     analogy is more accurate.\n       In impeachment trials, the Senate certainly does sit as a \n     finder of fact, as would a jury. But it also sits as a \n     definer of the applicable standards, as would a judge.\n       The Senate, in other words, determines not only whether the \n     accused has performed the acts that form the basis for the \n     House's Articles of Impeachment, but also whether those \n     actions justify removal from office.\n       Once again we find support for this view from the country's \n     history. In 2 of the first 3 impeachments brought forward \n     from the House to the Senate, the Senate acquitted the \n     accused.\n       In each of the two acquittals, however, the Senate did not \n     disagree with the House on the facts. One case involved a \n     senator, William Blount, the other an Associate Justice of \n     the Supreme Court, Samuel Chase. In neither one was there any \n     question that the individuals had done the deeds that formed \n     the basis of the House's Articles of Impeachment.\n       In each case, however, the Senate concluded that the deeds \n     were not sufficient to constitute valid grounds for \n     impeachment and so they acquitted.\n       Eventually, then, if the current impeachment proceeds, it \n     will fall to the Senate to decide not only the facts, but the \n     law, and to evaluate whether or not the specific actions of \n     the president are sufficiently serious to warrant \n     impeachment.\n       The framers intended that the senate have as its objective \n     doing that what was best for the country, taking context and \n     circumstance fully into account.\n       I should try to be as clear as I can be about this point, \n     because the media discussion has come close to missing it. It \n     seems to be widely assumed that if the President committed \n     perjury, then he must be impeached and convicted.\n       Conversely, you may think that unless it can be proven that \n     the President committed perjury or violated other laws, \n     impeachment cannot occur.\n       Both statements are wrong. Not all crimes are impeachable, \n     and not every impeachable offense is a crime.\n       The Senate could decline to convict even if the President \n     has committed perjury, if it concluded that under the \n     circumstances, this perjury did not constitute a sufficiently \n     serious breach of duty to warrant removal of this President. \n     On the other hand, the Senate could convict the President of \n     an impeachable offense even if it were not a violation of the \n     criminal law. For instance, if the Senate concluded that the \n     President had committed abuses of power sufficiently grave, \n     it need not find any action to amount to a violation of some \n     criminal statute.--[Speech, 10/2/98]\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Senators have a multifaceted role that defies a simple \n     label. They act in part as a jury, which considers evidence \n     and makes the ultimate determination of whether to convict or \n     acquit the President. This role explains the limitations that \n     the rules impose on the ability of Senators to debate or \n     discuss motions and evidence in open session.\n       Senators also act as judges, with authority to decide \n     whether a ruling by the Chief Justice should stand. This law \n     interpreting role is also a component of the ultimate \n     decision on conviction or acquittal. Senators must determine \n     not only whether the factual allegations against the \n     President are true, they must also determine whether the \n     facts alleged, if true, represent a high crime and \n     misdemeanor.\n       Senators may also take actions that resemble those \n     typically undertaken by counsel for the parties. They may \n     propound questions (though only in writing) of witnesses or \n     of counsel; they may make objections to questions by counsel \n     or to evidence sought to be introduced; and they make any \n     motion that a party may make.\n       The Senate has the power to compel the attendance of \n     witnesses by instructing the Chief Justice to issue subpoenas \n     and to enforce obedience to its orders. The Senate also has \n     authority to punish summarily contempts of and disobedience \n     to its orders, although the rules of impeachment do not \n     specify the penalties it may impose. Under the Standing Rules \n     of the Senate, the Senate can also refer a contempt citation \n     to the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia \n     for prosecution pursuant to 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  191-194 for \n     criminal prosecution.--[Memorandum, 12/28/98]\n\n\n                            Trial, Nature of\n\n       The Constitution assigns the Senate the sole power to try \n     all impeachments. This power imposes upon the Senate a duty \n     to adjudicate every case in which the House of \n     Representatives impeaches a civil officer of the United \n     States. The framers were deeply concerned that impeachment \n     could become a partisan tool used to gain control and \n     influence over civil officers, and the President in \n     particular. They entrusted to the Senate the role of \n     adjudicating impeachments because the Senate's structurally \n     conferred capacity for deliberation, independence, and \n     impartiality would allow it to act as a check against \n     partisanship. The Constitution fortifies the Senate in this \n     role by providing that conviction requires a vote of two-\n     thirds of the members present.\n       The Constitution, however, does not define the Senate's \n     power to ``try'' impeachments and appears to leave broad \n     discretion for the Senate to interpret it as allowing \n     whatever method of inquiry and examination is best suited to \n     a given case. Justice White declared emphatically that ``the \n     Senate has very wide discretion in specifying impeachment \n     trial procedures . . . .'' The constitutional power, and \n     corresponding duty, to try impeachments does not absolutely \n     require the full Senate or a committee to take live witness \n     testimony subject to cross examination. The Senate has \n     routinely entertained and voted on motions for summary \n     adjudication. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine that the \n     Senate would be constitutionally required to hold live \n     evidentiary proceedings in every conceivable impeachment \n     case. If, for example, the House were to impeach an official \n     who is not a civil officer, it would be absurd to construe \n     the Constitution to require the Senate to go forward with an \n     evidentiary proceeding. Similarly, if the House were to \n     impeach a civil officer on the grounds of misconduct that is \n     not properly considered a high crime or misdemeanor, no \n     constitutional purpose is served by an evidentiary hearing.\n       Even if an impeachment meets all of the constitutional \n     criteria to invoke a Senate\n\n[[Page S1493]]\n\n     trial, evidentiary proceedings may be unnecessary. It is \n     well-established that the House managers charged with \n     prosecuting the impeachment may introduce the record of other \n     proceedings as substantive evidence in the Senate trial. The \n     House managers have independent discretion over their \n     prosecution of the case, and may decide to rest their case on \n     the documentary record. In addition, the impeached defendant \n     may choose to present no affirmative evidence in his defense. \n     Where the parties have decided that the documentary record is \n     sufficiently encompassing to allow adjudication, the \n     Constitution does not require the Senate to ferret out \n     additional evidence.\n       Strong support for summary adjudication as a faithful \n     discharge of the Senate's constitutional duty to try \n     impeachments can also be found in the operation of the \n     federal judiciary. The constitution guarantees ``the right of \n     trial by jury'' in ``suits at common law.'' There is a \n     tension between the right to trial by jury and summary \n     adjudication by the court. Where a federal court grants \n     summary judgment or dismisses a lawsuit, for example because \n     it fails to state a claim, there is no trial at all, let \n     alone a trial by jury. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has \n     upheld the authority of the federal courts to grant motions \n     to dismiss and motions for summary judgment. There would seem \n     to be even less concern regarding summary adjudication in the \n     context of a Senate impeachment trial. This is because the \n     Senate acts as both judge (finder of law) and juror (finder \n     of fact) so there is no concern about the proper allocation \n     of the adjudicative function between judge and jury.\n       The Constitution imposes upon the Senate a duty to try \n     impeachments so that the Senate can act as a check against \n     partisan abuse of the impeachment process. Fidelity to the \n     Constitution requires the Senate carefully to interpret the \n     law of impeachment as set forth in the Constitution and to \n     apply that law to the facts and circumstances of every \n     impeachment approved by the House of Representatives. As with \n     the federal judiciary, this adjudicative duty, however, does \n     not require the Senate to discover new evidence or to hold \n     evidentiary proceedings where the record does not warrant.--\n     [Memorandum, 12/22/98]\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n           I. The History of Presidential Impeachment Trials\n\n       We have had exactly one impeachment trial of a President, \n     Andrew Johnson, in 1868. This resulted in his acquittal by a \n     single vote. In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee voted to \n     send articles of impeachment with respect to President \n     Richard Nixon to the House floor, but President Nixon \n     resigned shortly thereafter, and the articles were never \n     voted on by the full House.\n       However, fourteen other impeachment trials have been held \n     in the Senate over the country's history. In preparation for \n     these trials, almost all of which involved federal judges, \n     the Senate has developed a set of standing Rules of Procedure \n     and Practice for such trials, as well as a body of precedent \n     concerning questions of procedure that have arisen and been \n     answered in previous trials. These rules and precedent \n     provide a good basic outline to how the trial of President \n     Clinton will proceed in the Senate, unless they are altered \n     or amended prior to the beginning of President Clinton's \n     trial.\n\n\n           II. Current Senate Rules of Procedure and Practice\n\n       Senate procedures while hearing an impeachment are \n     strikingly different from those that operate during normal \n     legislative and executive business. Senators are combinations \n     of judges and jurors. Senators take an oath to do ``impartial \n     justice.'' They cannot debate or discuss matters in open \n     session. They are expected to commit questions to writing and \n     send them to the Presiding Officer. The Senate when sitting \n     to consider impeachment is a very different body than the \n     Senate we are used to seeing on C-SPAN.\n       Major points to bear in mind:\n       The trial and its rules take precedence over normal \n     business. Once the trial begins, the rules set forth a \n     schedule for continuing the trial until conclusion. The \n     fundamental provisions are Rule III, stating that the Senate \n     shall continue in session from day to day (Sundays excepted) \n     until the trial is concluded, and Rule XIII, stating that the \n     trial proceedings shall begin at 12 noon each day, unless \n     otherwise provided by the Senate.\n       Majority rules. Motions and objections during the \n     proceedings are governed by majority vote.\n       There are few opportunities to filibuster. Unlike the \n     normal Senate, almost all trial motions, decisions, and \n     orders are resolved under strict time limits--although these \n     time limits would not prevent a determined effort to prolong \n     the trial through repeated motions, whether by counsel or by \n     a group of Senators. In fact, during the trial itself, \n     motions, objections or challenges to rulings by the chair \n     raised by Senators (which must be submitted in writing to the \n     Presiding Officer) are voted on without debate at all, unless \n     the Senate elects to go into closed session. In that case, \n     each Senator is entitled to speak once for no more than 10 \n     minutes.\n       Where the impeachment Rules are silent, the Standing Rules \n     of the Senate apply.  Precedents extending back at least to \n     the Johnson impeachment support this.\n\n\n      iii. how might the matter be resolved without a formal trial?\n\n       A. The Senate's duty to try the impeachment. The \n     Constitution provides that ``the Senate shall have sole power \n     to try all impeachments.'' Some consider this provision to \n     impose a duty upon the Senate to try or adjudicate all \n     impeachments. Even if the Constitution imposes such a duty, \n     the Senate has not understood this duty to adjudicate as \n     necessarily requiring a formal trial. There is precedent for \n     the Senate considering dispositive motions that would allow \n     the Senate to render a judgment without holding a trial. (In \n     the impeachment proceedings against Judges Ritter, Claiborne, \n     and Nixon, the Senate entertained motions to strike articles \n     of impeachment or to summarily adjudicate the matter.) \n     Although such a motion is not specifically discussed in the \n     impeachment rules, the Senate has not viewed dispositive \n     motions as seeking to suspend, modify, or amend the rules. As \n     a result, dispositive motions are ordinary trial motions \n     subject to the limits on debate set forth in the impeachment \n     rules and governed by simple majority vote.\n       An additional method available to resolve the matter is \n     adjournment sine die. In the case of Andrew Johnson, the \n     Senate voted on three articles of impeachment, acquitting on \n     each. Rather than vote on the remaining eight articles, the \n     Senate simply adjourned the impeachment proceedings sine die. \n     The impeachment rules allow for a vote to adjourn sine die. \n     Adjournment sine die does not specifically pass judgment on \n     the articles of impeachment and so may not be satisfactory to \n     those who consider the Senate duty-bound to try the \n     impeachment.\n       B. Different motions to adjudicate the matter without an \n     evidentiary trial. Several different motions would seem \n     possible, some drawing on analogies to judicial proceedings.\n       1. A motion to dismiss would assert that the articles of \n     impeachment fail as a matter of law to state actions upon \n     which a conviction may constitutionally be based. Such an \n     assertion could be based upon the claim that the articles do \n     not state ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' Because the \n     articles accuse President Clinton of committing perjury \n     before a grand jury and of obstructing justice (among other \n     things), a ``motion to dismiss'' would assert that such \n     actions can never support conviction for high crimes or \n     misdemeanors. Additionally, a ``motion to dismiss'' could be \n     a vehicle for the President to raise the contention that the \n     articles of impeachment lapsed when the 105th Congress \n     adjourned sine die.\n       While there are no Senate rules governing the timing of \n     motions, analogy to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n     would require a motion to dismiss to be made before the \n     President submits his answer to the summons, or along with \n     his answer to the summons.\n       2. In contrast to the motion to dismiss, a motion for \n     summary judgment asserts (1) that the parties agree on all \n     material facts and (2) that those facts compel judgment for \n     the moving party. A party submitting a motion for summary \n     judgment is agreeing to have the dispute finally adjudicated \n     on the basis of the facts asserted in his moving papers. The \n     opposing party has the option of filing a cross motion for \n     summary judgment or of objecting that the parties are not in \n     agreement as to all material facts and that a trial is \n     required on the disputed facts. If the opposing party chooses \n     the first course of action (and this could be done by prior \n     agreement between the parties), then the Senate could enter \n     judgment in the case without holding any evidentiary trial.\n       On a motion for summary judgment, the Senate by majority \n     vote could issue a judgment for the President if it concluded \n     that the undisputed facts fail to establish the existence of \n     a high crime or misdemeanor warranting the President's \n     removal from office. Because this motion rests on a view of \n     the undisputed facts in the specific case, granting the \n     President's motion for summary judgment would mean only that \n     the specific perjury and obstructions charged in these \n     articles of impeachment do not warrant conviction and removal \n     from office (or that the facts failed to establish that these \n     offenses had actually been committed). It would not imply \n     that perjury or obstruction of justice could never serve as \n     grounds adequate to impeach, convict, and remove a President \n     from office.\n       3. The trial might also be ended by a motion for a directed \n     verdict. Such a motion in civil litigation is brought after \n     the plaintiff has concluded his case, and before the \n     defendant mounts a defense. The motion asserts that the \n     plaintiff's evidence is insufficient to sustain the claim, \n     and that no reasonable fact finder would disagree. Were the \n     House Managers to decide to submit the impeachment to the \n     Senate based solely on evidence already gathered by Starr, \n     the President could bring a ``motion for a directed verdict'' \n     prior to an evidentiary trial involving any live witness \n     testimony.\n       4. Finally, the Senate's own precedents supply the \n     possibility of a fourth option, a motion for summary \n     disposition. Such a motion might be entertained as an \n     alternative to any of the motions just discussed, in order to \n     avoid contending with the technicalities of such motions.\n       In the impeachment trial of Judge Harry Claiborne, for \n     example, the House Managers introduced a motion for summary \n     disposition. Both sides argued this motion without invoking \n     the federal rules of civil procedure or judicial opinions \n     relating to summary dispositions. The parties disputed only \n     whether\n\n[[Page S1494]]\n\n     the facts warranted further evidentiary proceedings in the \n     Senate or if the matter could be decided solely on the basis \n     of Judge Claiborne's conviction for tax evasion. The Senate \n     considered the motion without reference to judicial \n     standards.\n       This approach is consistent with the Senate's position that \n     it is not bound by the federal rules of civil procedure. \n     Removing the motion from the technical categories and \n     requirements under those rules allows each Senator the \n     discretion to consider whether additional evidentiary \n     proceedings, including live testimony, will serve the public \n     interest.\n       C. Should the Senate appoint a committee? If the matter is \n     not resolved on a summary basis, Rule XI provides that the \n     Senate can appoint a committee to ``receive evidence and take \n     testimony'' rather than having the Senate as a whole do so. \n     This procedure has been employed in the case of trials of \n     federal judges, and has been sustained by the Supreme Court. \n     Such a committee would not and could not decide the case, but \n     it could assemble the evidence submitted, prepare a \n     transcript of all testimony and submit it to the Senate. The \n     committee meetings could be televised so that noncommittee \n     Senators would be able to watch them as they occurred, and \n     videotapes could also be prepared for subsequent review. A \n     number of the early proponents of what is now Senate Rule XI \n     option are on record stating their view that such a committee \n     should not be used for a presidential trial.\n       Composition of a Rule XI committee would be very important. \n     Traditionally, these committees have been composed of twelve \n     members, six from each party with the committee chair chosen \n     from the committee members in the majority party. The Chair \n     exercises the same role within the committee that the Chief \n     Justice fulfills in the full Senate. This is significant \n     because the decisions of the chair may be reversed only by a \n     majority vote. If the votes in committee are on straight \n     party lines, the ruling of the chair will be upheld in every \n     instance. A complicating factor in a presidential impeachment \n     is the requirement that the Chief Justice preside. This may \n     require that the Chief Justice serve as the chair of a rule \n     XI committee if one is appointed. In this event, the rulings \n     of the Chief Justice would be upheld on any party-line \n     vote.--[Memorandum, 12/28/98]\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       House Managers have asserted repeatedly that live witness \n     testimony will resolve discrepancies between the testimony of \n     witnesses, and therefore they ought to be called. There are \n     several points to be made against this point of view.\n       Demeanor evidence is notoriously unreliable. Recall, for \n     example, Alger Hiss/Whittaker Chambers. Some people were \n     convinced by one side, some people by the other.\n       Demeanor evidence is not necessarily dispositive, in any \n     event. Both witnesses can come across as reliable, honest and \n     trustworthy. Witnesses often give credible performances while \n     dissembling.\n       The House Managers are poorly situated to claim the \n     necessity of hearing from live witnesses in order to resolve \n     credibility issues. The House Judiciary Committee heard from \n     no live witnesses, except Ken Starr, and yet the managers \n     have had no difficulty in deciding all credibility disputes \n     against the President or anyone giving testimony favorable to \n     his story.\n       Any gains from live witnesses need to be assessed against \n     the costs. The costs will come when the Senate chamber \n     descends into the facts of the case with the specificity that \n     will come from live testimony.\n       For example, one prominent disagreement that the House \n     Managers have cited is that between President Clinton and Ms. \n     Lewinsky regarding whether the President ever touched Ms. \n     Lewinsky's breasts or genitalia. If both witnesses are called \n     and reiterate their prior testimony, the Senate will \n     certainly get the opportunity to observe their demeanor. This \n     might shed some additional light on the question, but it \n     probably won't. The possibility of securing the additional \n     credibility data must be weighed against the serious negative \n     ramifications such proceedings would likely have.\n\n\n                             a. indictment\n\n       The Supreme Court engaged in a similar balancing exercise \n     in deciding Clinton v. Jones. In that case, the court held \n     that requiring the President to submit to judicial process in \n     a civil case and go through an entire civil trial would not \n     so damage the presidency as to justify interfering with the \n     ordinary judicial process that vindicates the rule of law. \n     Considering only indictment, as distinct from prosecution of \n     a criminal trial, seems to impose less of a burden on the \n     President. Indictment alone imposes no demands on the \n     President's time.\n       An attempt to distinguish indictment could proceed on two \n     bases. First, the President is apt to be more concerned about \n     being criminally convicted than found civilly liable. Thus, \n     an indictment could be a greater distraction from the \n     President's duties than is a civil suit. Second, criminal \n     indictment, unlike filing a civil complaint, stigmatizes the \n     President.\n       Each of these distinctions is subject to dispute. As the \n     Paula Jones suit itself demonstrates, a civil case can be ex \n     tremely distracting. If a criminal indictment is more \n     distract ing, it seems doubtful that it is so much more \n     distracting as to be constitutionally significant. A \n     distinction based on stigma seems particularly weak in this \n     case.\n       President Clinton has been impeached. Correctly or not, the \n     House of Representatives has construed this impeachment as \n     analogous to a grand jury indictment. It is thus not obvious \n     that an actual criminal indictment would add materially to \n     the stigma the President has already suffered.\n       Even accepting these grounds of distinction, the \n     independent counsel may seek a sealed indictment. A sealed \n     indictment would not be made known either publically or to \n     the President. If an indictment remains sealed until the \n     President leaves office, it is difficult to see how it could \n     either distract the President or stigmatize him.\n\n\n                             b. prosecution\n\n       Prosecution presents a different matter. Unlike an \n     indictment with nothing more, proceeding to an actual \n     prosecution would place significant physical and temporal \n     burdens on the President. Preparing for trial and then \n     actually presenting a defense would consume the President's \n     time and attention over a lengthy period. During the pendency \n     of criminal proceedings, the President would repeatedly face \n     a choice between spending the time necessary to mount a \n     meaningful defense and devoting time to fulfilling his \n     constitutional and statutory duties. Even if the President \n     were to choose to spend no time on his defense, it is \n     difficult to imagine that his mind could be fully focused on \n     his official duties.\n       To so stigmatize and distract the President would seriously \n     undermine his ability to act as a check on the legislative \n     branch. It would also impose significant costs in terms of \n     the nation's standing internationally.\n       The Supreme Court's decision in Clinton v. Jones could be \n     taken to support subjecting the President to criminal \n     prosecution while in office. In that case, the President had \n     argued that the civil lawsuit should be stayed until the \n     President's term in office expired. He based this position on \n     concerns that the demands of defending a civil lawsuit would \n     impermissibly inter fere with his ability to discharge his \n     official duties. Admittedly, it is unlikely that defending \n     against a criminal prosecution is any more time consuming \n     than defending a civil lawsuit.\n       There are, however, several crucial distinctions between a \n     civil and a criminal lawsuit. In the Jones case, the Supreme \n     Court emphasized that the burden imposed on the President \n     could be minimized through proper case management by the \n     trial judge. A court does not have the same broad array of \n     options available in a criminal proceedings. Perhaps most \n     significantly, the options for settling the suit without a \n     trial are quite different. President Clinton settled the \n     Paula Jones case by making a cash payment with no admission \n     of wrongdoing. The rough equivalent of settlement in a \n     criminal proceeding is a plea bargain. Such a ``settlement,'' \n     however, requires the defendant to admit to some criminality. \n     As such, there is far greater pressure on the president to \n     proceed to trial in a criminal prosecution as opposed to a \n     civil prosecution. Moreover, the President's attendance at \n     a civil trial is not nearly so crucial as is his \n     attendance at a criminal prosecution. The Sixth Amendment \n     expresses the constitutional commitment to allowing a \n     criminal defendant's presence at trial. Finally, consider \n     what follows a judgment in a criminal trial as opposed to \n     a civil trial.\n       The Paula Jones suit threatened the President with nothing \n     more than an assessment of monetary compensation. An adverse \n     verdict at a criminal trial threatens imprisonment. It is \n     clear that the Constitution does not allow the judiciary to \n     order the imprisonment of the President. Thus, at the very \n     least, sentencing would have to be stayed until the President \n     leaves office.\n       Extending the holding in Clinton v. Jones to cover criminal \n     prosecutions is subject to an additional objection. The \n     course of events since the Court rendered that decision casts \n     significant doubt upon the conclusions the Court drew in that \n     case. In Clinton v. Jones, the Supreme Court doubted that the \n     civil lawsuit would consume much time or attention of the \n     President. It could not be plainer that this prediction was \n     wrong. While there is no reason to believe that the Court is \n     considering overruling Clinton v. Jones, there is very \n     powerful reason to apply the practical lessons we have \n     learned since that decision to any claim for extending the \n     Clinton v. Jones holding to criminal prosecutions. In light \n     of all that has occurred since that ruling, it is wildly \n     implausible to contend that a criminal proceeding against the \n     President would not significantly disrupt his ability to \n     fulfill his constitutional and statutory duties.\n       Against this significant disruption is concern for the rule \n     of law. As a practical matter, it is critical to recall that \n     sentencing would be stayed until the President leaves office. \n     Given this, it is doubtful that staying the trial as well \n     would add significant concern from the standpoint of the rule \n     of law. It is important to bear in mind what the rule of law \n     requires. It demands that similarly situated citizens be \n     treated similarly. In light of the President's unique \n     constitutional role, it is error to contend that the \n     President must be treated identically to a private citizen. \n     The rule of law must encompass the fundamental law of the \n     Constitution, and account for the peculiar role of the \n     President within the constitutional structure. Accommodating \n     that role by staying criminal proceedings until the President \n     is out of office respects the rule of law as long\n\n[[Page S1495]]\n\n     as the President is subject to criminal prosecution once out \n     of office. Under these circumstances, the President is \n     subject liability in the same way as any citizen.\n       The New York Times reports that these conclusions accord \n     with the view of most scholars. According to the Times, most \n     scholars accept that the President may be indicted while in \n     office, but that he may not be prosecuted. This assessment of \n     the state of scholarship is probably accurate, but there is \n     significant dissent as to each conclusion. In other words, \n     the scholarship does not betray a consensus.\n\n\n                             III. Practice\n\n       There is very little practical experience dealing with the \n     question of indicting or prosecuting a sitting President. The \n     only precedent is the investigation of President Richard \n     Nixon. The biographer to special counsel Archibald Cox \n     reports that Cox had concluded that the separation of powers \n     forbids indicting a sitting President. Cox's successor, Leon \n     Jaworski, decided against seeking to indict President Nixon, \n     although his decision was based on prudential considerations \n     and he did not reach a certain constitutional interpretation.\n       In 1972, Vice President Spiro Agnew argued to the Supreme \n     Court that a sitting Vice President could not be indicted. \n     Then-Solicitor General Robert Bork submitted an amicus brief \n     on behalf of the United States in which he argued that a \n     sitting Vice President could be impeached, but a sitting \n     President could not be. Judge Bork repeated this position \n     yesterday in an op-ed published in the New York Times.\n\n\n                              IV. History\n\n       A number of framers made statements that appear to assume \n     that the President may not be indicted while in office. In \n     The Federalist Alexander Hamilton claimed that the President \n     would be ``liable to be impeached, tried, and removed from \n     office; and would afterwards be liable to prosecution and \n     punishment in the ordinary course of law.'' In two other \n     numbers of The Federalist Hamilton repeated this sequence and \n     that criminal process comes ``after'' impeachment and \n     conviction. In none of these passages, however, is Hamilton \n     addressing the specific question of whether the President \n     could be subject to criminal process while in office. It may \n     represent no more than Hamilton's assumption as to what the \n     ordinary sequence would in fact be.\n       Another framer, Gouverneur Morris, explained that the \n     Constitution vests the power to try impeachments in the \n     Senate rather than the judiciary because the judiciary would \n     ``try the President after the trial of impeachment.'' In the \n     First Congress, Vice President John Adams and Senator (later \n     Justice) Oliver Ellsworth expressed the view that ``the \n     President personally is not . . . subject to any [judicial] \n     process whatever.'' But their view was disputed, for example \n     by Senator William Maclay.\n       The Supreme Court reviewed this historical record in \n     Clinton v. Jones. They concluded that history provides no \n     answer to this question. These comments reflect the view of \n     only a few, albeit influential, individuals and either were \n     not made in the context of whether a sitting President could \n     be indicted or were disputed.\n\n\n                      V. Prudential Considerations\n\n       Even if the Constitution does not prohibit indictment, that \n     does not mean there are not powerful prudential arguments \n     against indictment. Brett Kavanaugh, who was Associate \n     Independent Counsel in Ken Starr's office for three years, \n     put this argument most succinctly in a recent article he \n     published in the Georgetown Law Journal:\n       The President is not simply another individual. He is \n     unique. He is the embodiment of the federal government and \n     the head of a political party. If he is to be removed, the \n     entire government likely would suffer, [and] the military or \n     economic consequences to the nation could be severe. . . . \n     Those repercussions, if they are to occur, should not result \n     from the judgment of a single prosecutor--whether it be the \n     Attorney General or special counsel--and a single jury. \n     Prosecution or nonprosecution of a President is, in short, \n     inevitably and unavoidably a political act.\n       Thus, as the Constitution suggests, the decision about the \n     President while he is in office should be made where all \n     great national political judgments in our country should be \n     made--in the Congress of the United States.\n       There is an additional, closely related, consideration--\n     protecting Congress's constitutional impeachment power. If an \n     independent counsel can indict a sitting President, this act \n     alone tends to force Congress's hand with respect to \n     impeachment. The mere fact of an indictment is an additional \n     factor that generates some pressure to impeach and convict a \n     sitting President. That pressure is even more coercive in the \n     context of a prosecution and verdict than of indictment \n     alone.\n\n\n                    VI. Department of Justice Policy\n\n       Professor David Strauss recently argued that there is no \n     need to address the constitutional issues because the \n     independent counsel is statutorily barred from indicting a \n     sitting President. The United States Code instructs that the \n     independent counsel ``shall except where not possible comply \n     with the written or other established policies of the \n     Department of Justice respecting enforcement of the criminal \n     laws.'' 28 U.S.C. 594(f). Professor Strauss argues Judge \n     Bork's Supreme Court brief in the Spiro Agnew case \n     established the Department's policy on indicting a sitting \n     President and that this policy is confirmed in the practice \n     of special counsels Cox and Jaworski.\n       This is a strong argument, but there is a response: the \n     brief in the Agnew case represents not a policy but an \n     interpretation of the Constitution. That interpretation, the \n     response would continue, has been demonstrated to be in error \n     by the subsequent decision in Clinton v. Jones. An article \n     published by Ken Starr's advisor on constitutional law, \n     Professor Ronald Rotunda, argues that Clinton v. Jones makes \n     clear what had previously been obscure--namely that a sitting \n     President may be indicted and prosecuted.--[Memorandum, 2/4/\n     99]\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. In light of our time constraints, I would like to focus \nmy remarks today primarily on the one issue--more than any other--that \nhas arisen during our deliberations: namely, whether the President \nshould be convicted if we find he committed the acts alleged in the \nArticles.\n  I believe this issue is not only central to the case at hand, it is \nalso central to all future evaluations and applications of what we do \nhere.\n  In arguing for the President, White House lawyers have asserted that \nthe threshold for Presidential removal must be very high--and I agree. \nAt the same time, however, we must remember that there is an inverse \nrelationship between the level at which we set the removal bar and the \ndegree of Presidential misconduct we will accept.\n  So, then, where do we set the bar?\n  As we know, the Constitution says: The President, Vice President, and \nall civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office \non Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high \nCrimes and Misdemeanors.\n  Now it has been suggested by some that a ``high Crime'' must be a \ntruly heinous crime. But that interpretation is obviously wrong. \nTreason is certainly among the most heinous crimes. But bribery is not.\n  Taking a bribe, like treason, is however, a uniquely serious act of \nmisconduct by a public official. That suggests a different meaning for \n``high Crime,'' one that is linked somehow to the fact that the person \ncommitting it holds public office.\n  Alexander Hamilton's comment about the impeachment power, quoted by \nso many of us here, provides the clue. In Federalist 65, Hamilton says: \n``The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed \nfrom the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the \nviolation of some public trust.''\n  The President's lawyers invoked this line, but in my view they \nmisread it. They argued that what it means is that a President's \nconduct must involve misuse of official power if he is to be removed \nfrom office.\n  But that is not what the Constitution demands, or what Hamilton's \ncomment, fairly read, suggests. Otherwise, as has been noted, we would \nhave to leave in office a President or a federal judge who committed \nmurder, so long as they did not use any powers of their office in doing \nso.\n  Rather, as Hamilton's language connotes, and our own precedents in \nthe judicial impeachment cases confirm, the connection the Constitution \nrequires between an official's actions and functions is a more \npractical one: the official's conduct must demonstrate that he or she \ncannot be trusted with the powers of the office in question.\n  This rule certainly encompasses official acts demonstrating unfitness \nfor the office in question--but it also reaches beyond such acts.\n  In my view, we need not determine the outer limits of this principle \nto decide the question before us today: whether the President's \nactions, as alleged in these Articles, constitute a violation of a \n``public trust'' as Hamilton uses the term.\n  The answer to that question is plain when we consider the President's \nconduct in relation to his responsibilities.\n  The President's role and status in our system of government are \nunique. The Constitution vests the executive power in the President, \nand in the President alone. That means he is the officer chiefly \ncharged with carrying out our laws. Therefore, far more than any \nfederal judge, he holds the scales of justice in his own hands.\n  In the wrong hands, that power can easily be transformed from the \npower to carry out the laws, into the power to bend them to one's own \nends.\n  The very nature of the Presidency guarantees that its occupant will \nface\n\n[[Page S1496]]\n\ndaily temptations to twist the laws for personal gain, for party \nbenefit or for the advantage of friends.\n  To combat these temptations, the Constitution spells out--in no \nuncertain terms--that the President shall ``take care that the laws be \nfaithfully executed,'' and the President's oath of office requires him \nto swear that he will do so.\n  If he obstructed justice and tampered with witnesses in the Jones \ncase, a federal civil rights case in which he was the defendant, the \nPresident violated his oath and failed to perform the bedrock duty of \nhis office. He did not faithfully execute the laws.\n  A President who commits these acts thereby makes clear that he cannot \nbe trusted to exercise the executive power lawfully in the future, to \nhandle impartially such specific Presidential responsibilities as \nserving as the final arbiter on bringing federal civil or criminal \ncases or determining the content of federal regulations--especially if, \nas will often be the case, he has a personal or a political interest in \nthe outcome.\n  Surely retaining a President in office under these circumstances \nconstitutes exactly the type of threat to our government and its \ninstitutions so many have said must exist for conviction.\n  That brings the President's alleged conduct squarely within the \npurview of our impeachment power, whose purpose, as described by \nHamilton, is to deal with ``the violation of some public trust.''\n  Furthermore, if the Articles' allegations are true, how can we leave \nthe executive power in the hands of a President who, through his false \ngrand jury testimony, even attempted to obstruct and subvert the \nimpeachment process itself?\n  For this particular grand jury before which the President testified \nwas not only conducting a criminal investigation; it was also charged, \nunder Congressional statute, with advising the House of Representatives \nas to whether it had received any substantial and credible information \nthat might constitute grounds for impeachment.\n  The framers placed the impeachment power in our Constitution as the \nultimate safeguard to address misuse of the executive power.\n  A President who commits perjury, intending to thwart an investigation \nthat might otherwise lead to his impeachment, has, I believe, committed \na quintessential ``high Crime.''\n  Such conduct of necessity impedes, and could even preclude, Congress \nfrom fulfilling its constitutional duty to prevent the President from \nusurping power and engaging in unlawful conduct.\n  To permit such behavior would set an unacceptable precedent, because \nit could, in the future, allow nullification of the impeachment process \nitself, rendering it meaningless.\n  Hence, a President who acts to subvert what the Framers viewed as the \nultimate Constitutional check on abuse of executive power, most \ncertainly violates the public trust as defined by Hamilton.\n\n  Throughout this discussion I have analyzed this case as though one or \nmore of the underlying counts in each impeachment Article were \nestablished. I recognize that not everyone has reached this \nconclusion--and I confess that I have spent countless hours attempting \nto make this determination of guilt or innocence on each Article.\n  However, after listening to and studying the evidence, I have \nconcluded beyond any reasonable doubt that the President committed one \nor more of the acts alleged under each Article. Time does not permit me \nto fully explain the basis for my conclusions. But, in my view, that is \nwhere the evidence inescapably points.\n  In my opinion, there is no way that the President could have \ntestified as he did in his Jones deposition concerning his relationship \nwith Monica Lewinsky, unless he believed Ms. Lewinsky would validate \nhis false statements if called as a witness.\n  The President may not have explicitly told her to lie, but when he \ncalled her on December 17, he did say ``You can always say you were \ncoming to see Betty or that you were bringing me letters.''\n  To whom did he intend her to say this? They'd already agreed on the \nuse of these cover stories in non-legal contexts. The only new audience \nwas, clearly, the Jones court, and the President's comments that night \nwere surely aimed at influencing Ms. Lewinsky's potential testimony \nbefore that court, if she were to be subpoenaed.\n  That this was the President's intent, is confirmed by his own \ntestimony in the Jones case. What did he say when asked if Ms. Lewinsky \nhad come to see him? He said that Ms. Lewinsky had come to visit Betty \nCurrie and perhaps deliver him papers.\n  In my opinion, there is also no way you can refresh your memory by \nmaking assertions you know to be false to another person--as the \nPresident twice did to Betty Currie after that deposition. No, the \npurpose of those statements was to cause her to validate the false \ntestimony he had just given, if she were to be subpoenaed.\n  And finally, if you believe that was the President's intention, then \nyou must conclude he committed material perjury later, in his grand \njury testimony, when in response to the question: ``You are saying that \nyour only interest in speaking with Ms. Currie in the days after your \ndeposition was to refresh your own recollection?'' he answered with one \nword: ``Yes.''\n  And there is more.\n  Fellow Senators, none of us asked for this task, but we must live \nwith the consequences of our actions, not just on this administration, \nbut on our nation for generations to come.\n  That responsibility cannot be shirked. It has led me to a difficult \nbut inexorable decision.\n  I deeply regret that it is necessary for me to conclude that \nPresident William Jefferson Clinton committed obstruction of justice \nand grand jury perjury as charged in the Articles of Impeachment \nbrought by the House, that these are ``High Crimes and Misdemeanors'' \nunder our Constitution, and that therefore I must vote to convict him \non these charges.\n\n\n                                opinion\n\n  The President has been impeached on the grounds that he obstructed \njustice and tampered with witnesses in connection with a federal civil \nrights suit in which he was the defendant, and that he committed \nperjury before a grand jury charged with investigating whether his \nprevious conduct warranted prosecution or possible impeachment. It is \nour duty to determine whether the President did what the Articles of \nimpeachment charge and, if so, whether his actions were ``high Crimes \nand Misdemeanors'' that under our Constitution should bar him from \nfurther service in his office.\n  In considering these questions, I have done my best to imagine that I \nwas deciding them, not about a President of the opposing political \nparty, with whom I disagree on many issues, but about a President of my \nown party. I have tried to imagine what I would do if confronted with \nthe same evidence concerning a popular Republican President whose \npolicies I strongly supported. I have tried to decide the case before \nme just as I would the case of such a President.\n  Let me start with the facts.\n  After a great deal of listening, research and contemplation, I am \ncompelled by the evidence to conclude that the President did engage in \nthe conduct charged in both Articles. In reaching this conclusion, I \nrely exclusively on those elements of the case that I believe have been \nproven beyond a reasonable doubt. Because I believe these dictate my \nconclusion, I do not decide whether in an impeachment trial, the \nConstitution requires application of this highest of evidentiary \nstandards, which governs in ordinary criminal cases, or whether it \nwould also be proper for me to rely on any of the other conduct charged \nby the House, much of which I might well find proven under either of \nthe lower civil law standards.\n  Let me briefly outline the basis for my conclusions. I will start \nwith the second Article, because the conduct giving rise to it actually \noccurred first.\n  In my view the evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt that, for \nover eleven months, from December 6, 1997 to November 13, 1998, when \nthe President agreed to pay Paula Jones $850,000 to withdraw her sexual \nharassment lawsuit, the President engaged in a systematic course of \nobstructing justice and tampering with witnesses in Ms. Jones's case. \nThere is no room for reasonable doubt that as part of this course of \nconduct the President made statements to Ms. Monica Lewinsky and Ms. \nBetty Currie that were intended to cause them to validate,\n\n[[Page S1497]]\n\nthrough testimony he thought they could well be called upon to give, \nthe false story he was planning to tell or had already told in his own \ndeposition. These statements to Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Currie constitute \nthe second and sixth Acts of obstruction and witness tampering charged \nby the House. There is also no room for reasonable doubt that the \nPresident supported efforts to conceal gifts he had given to Ms. \nLewinsky after those gifts had been subpoenaed as evidence in that \ncase. That constitutes the third act of obstruction charged by the \nHouse.\n  As to the first Article: I am convinced that the House has shown \nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the President perjured himself before \nthe grand jury in two instances. First, he stated that his only purpose \nin talking to Ms. Currie in the days following his Jones deposition was \nto refresh his own recollection, thereby falsely claiming to the grand \njury that he did not intend to tamper with her potential testimony if \nshe were called as a witness in the Jones case. Second, he reaffirmed \nthe veracity of his Jones deposition denial of ``sexual relations'' \nwith Ms. Lewinsky, under the definition of that term approved by the \ncourt in that case. This was not merely a ``lie about sex'' to protect \nhis family. By the time of his grand jury appearance, the President had \nalready acknowledged to his family his improper relationship with Ms. \nLewinsky. Before the grand jury, the President falsely asserted the \ntruth of his earlier sworn statements for the sole purpose of \nprotecting himself from possible prosecution or impeachment.\n\n  In light of these conclusions, the final overriding issue is whether \nthe President's actions constitute ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' \nrequiring his removal from office under Article II, section 4 of the \nConstitution. As has been acknowledge on both sides, reasonable people \ncan differ on this question. And indeed it is only on this issue, \nwhether the President must be removed, that Americans are \nconsequentially divided. A decided majority of Americans agree that the \nPresident committed the crimes alleged in at least one of the Articles. \nAnd in their hearts I believe a significant majority of my colleagues \ndo as well.\n  The public, like us, is in disagreement over what the consequences \nshould be. A clear majority oppose removal, but for a variety of \nreasons--ranging from a feeling that the President does not deserve to \nbe removed, to a concern not to endanger current economic conditions, \nto a preference for the President over the Vice President, to the \nbelief that, because the President has less than two years remaining in \nthis term, removing his is not worth the disruption it would cause.\n  These considerations would legitimately play a role in our decision \nif we were functioning as a legislative body in a parliamentary system \ndeciding whether to retain the current government. But that is not our \nrole here. The Constitution requires the Senate to sit not in an \nordinary legislative capacity on this matter, but as a court of \nimpeachment. That is why, at the beginning of a trial on Articles of \nImpeachment, Article I, section 3 of the Constitution states that \nSenators must take a special oath to do impartial justice. Accordingly, \nit is my view that our decision cannot be based on other \nconsiderations, but instead must be based on what the Constitution \ndictates, and taken with a view toward the precedent we will establish \nregarding what is acceptable Presidential behavior.\n  In arguing for the President, White House lawyers have asserted that \nthe threshold for Presidential removal must be very high--and I agree. \nAt the same time, however, we must remember that there is an inverse \nrelationship between the level at which we set the removal bar and the \ndegree of Presidential misconduct we will accept.\n  So, then, where do we set the bar? What does the Constitution \ndictate? What precedent should we set for the ages?\n  Let us start with the text of the Constitution, which states simply: \n``The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United \nStates shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction \nof, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.''\n  The first interpretation that has been suggested is that a ``high \nCrime'' must be a truly heinous crime. But that is obviously wrong. \nTreason is certainly among the most heinous crimes. But bribery is not.\n  Taking a bribe, like treason, is however uniquely serious misconduct \nby a public official. That suggests a different meaning for ``high \nCrime,'' one that is linked somehow to the fact that the person \ncommitting it holds public office.\n\n  A comment by Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 65 provides the clue.\n  In Federalist 65, speaking of impeachment, Hamilton says: ``The \nsubjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the \nmisconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the violation of \nsome public trust.''\n  The President's lawyers invoke this line, but they misread it. They \nargue that what it means is that to require removal, a President's \nconduct must involve misuse of official power.\n  But that is not what the Constitution demands, or what Hamilton's \ncomment fairly read suggests. Otherwise we would have to leave in \noffice a President or a federal judge who committed murder, so long as \nthey did not use any powers of their office in doing so. Rather, as \nHamilton's language connotes, and our own precedents confirm, the \nconnection the Constitution requires between the official's actions and \nfunctions is a more practical one: the official's conduct must \ndemonstrate that he or she cannot be trusted with the powers of the \noffice in question. This rule encompasses official acts demonstrating \nunfitness for the office in question, but it also reaches beyond such \nacts.\n  We need not determine the outer limits of its principle to decide the \nquestion before us today: whether the President's actions here \nconstitute a violation of a ``public trust'' as Hamilton uses the term. \nThe answers to that question is plain when we consider his conduct in \nrelation to his responsibilities.\n  The President's role and status in our system of government are \nunique. The Constitution vests the executive power in the President, \nand in the President alone. That means he is the officer chiefly \ncharged with carrying out our laws. Therefore, far more than any \nfederal judge, he holds the scales of justice in his own hands.\n  In the wrong hands, that power can easily be transformed from the \npower to carry out the laws into the power to bend them to one's own \nends. The very nature of the Presidency guarantees that its occupant \nwill face daily temptations to twist the laws for personal gain, for \nparty benefit or for the advantage of friends in or out of power. To \ncombat these temptations, the Constitution spells out in no uncertain \nterms that the President shall ``take care that the laws be faithfully \nexecuted,'' and his oath of office requires him to swear that he will \ndo so.\n  By obstructing justice and tampering with witnesses in the Jones \ncase, a federal civil rights case in which he was the defendant, the \nPresident violated his oath and failed to perform the bedrock duty of \nhis office. He did not faithfully execute the laws. He thereby made \nclear that he cannot be trusted to exercise the executive power \nlawfully in the future, to handle impartially such specific \nPresidential responsibilities as serving as the final arbiter on \nbringing federal civil or criminal cases or determining the content of \nfederal regulations--especially if, as will often be the case, he has a \npersonal or political interest in the outcome.\n  Surely retaining a President in office under these circumstances \nconstitutes the type of threat to our government and its institutions \nso many have said must exist for conviction. That brings his conduct \nsquarely within the purview of our impeachment power, whose purpose, as \ndescribed by Hamilton, is to deal with ``the violation of some public \ntrust.''\n  Obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and grand jury perjury are \nserious federal crimes. How do we explain to others who commit them, \nmany out of motives surely as understandable as the President's, that \nwhile the President stays in the White House, his Department of Justice \nis trying to send them to prison? How can we expect ordinary \ncitizens to accept that the President can remain in office after lying \nrepeatedly under oath in court proceedings, but that it is still their \nduty to tell the truth?\n\n[[Page S1498]]\n\n  Finally, how can we leave the executive power in the hands of a \nPresident who, through his false grand jury testimony, has even \nattempted to obstruct and subvert the impeachment process itself? For \nthe particular grand jury before which the President testified falsely \nwas not only conducting a criminal investigation; it was also charged, \nunder Congressional statute, with advising the House of Representatives \nwhether it had received any substantial and credible information that \nmight constitute grounds for impeachment.\n  The framers placed the impeachment power in our Constitution as the \nultimate safeguard to address misuse of the executive power. A \nPresident who commits perjury, intending to thwart an investigation \nthat might otherwise lead to his impeachment, has committed a \nquintessential ``high Crime.'' This crime impeded, and could have even \nprecluded, Congress from fulfilling its duty to prevent the President \nfrom usurping power and engaging in unlawful conduct. To permit such \nbehavior could, in effect, allow nullification of the impeachment \nprocess itself, rendering it meaningless. Hence, a President who acts \nto subvert what the Framers viewed as the ultimate Constitutional check \non abuse of executive power, most certainly violates the public trust \nas defined by Hamilton.\n  To allow a President to continue in office after committing these \nacts would place the Presidency above the law and grant the President \npowers close to those of a monarch. This, in turn, presents a clear and \npresent danger to the rule of law, the birthright of all Americans. \nIndeed, we Americans take the rule of law so thoroughly for granted \nthat while it has been much invoked in these proceedings, there has \nbeen little discussion of what it means or why it matters. Simply put, \nthe rule of law is the guarantee our system makes to all of us that our \nrights and those of our countrymen will be determined according to \nrules established in advance. It is the guarantee that there will be no \nspecial rules, treatment, and outcomes for some, but that the same \nrules will be applied, in the same way, to everyone.\n  If America's most powerful citizen may bend the law in his own favor \nwith impunity, we have come dangerously close to trading in the rule of \nlaw for the rule of men. That in turn jeopardizes the freedoms we hold \ndear, for our equality before the law is central to their protection.\n  We are a great nation because, in America, no man--no man--is above \nthe law. Americans broke from Great Britain because the mother country \nclaimed it had a right to rule its colonies without restraint, as it \nsaw fit. Our tradition of chartered rights--rights laid down in laws, \nwhich no king, Parliament or other official could breach--culminated in \nour Constitution. That Constitution, which is itself only a higher law, \nprotects us from tyranny. Once the law becomes an object of convenience \nrather than awe, that Constitution becomes a dead letter, and with it \nour freedoms and our way of life.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, my grandparents did not come to this country \nseeking merely a more convenient, profitable life. They came here \nseeking the freedoms that were given birth on Bunker Hill and in the \nConvention at Philadelphia.\n  I know some people mock as self-righteous or feckless the piety many \nAmericans have toward their heritage and toward the Constitution that \nguards their freedom. But I will never forget that it is not the \npowerful or those favored by the powerful who need the law's \nprotection.\n  If we set a precedent that allows the President--the chief magistrate \nand the most powerful man in the world--to render the judicial process \nsubordinate to his own interests, we tell ordinary citizens, like my \ngrandparents, that Americans are no longer really equal in the eyes of \nthe law. We tell them that they may be denied justice. And we thereby \nforfeit our own heritage of constitutional freedoms.\n  None of us asked for this task, but we must live with the \nconsequences of our actions, not just on this administration, but on \nour nation for generations to come. That responsibility cannot be \nshirked. It has led me to a difficult but inexorable decision. I deeply \nregret that it is necessary for me to conclude that President William \nJefferson Clinton committed obstruction of justice and grand jury \nperjury as charged in the Articles of Impeachment brought by the House, \nthat these are ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' under our Constitution, \nand that therefore I must vote to convict him on these charges.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. Chief Justice, I will vote against the articles of \nimpeachment accusing the President of the United States of perjury \nbefore a grand jury and obstruction of justice.\n  The Republican House Managers have asked the Senate to remove the \nPresident from office, overturning a free and fair election in which \n100 million Americans cast their vote. Short of voting on whether or \nnot to send our sons and daughters to war, I can envision no more \nprofound decision.\n  I have taken this responsibility as seriously as anything I have done \nin my life. A little over a month ago, I escorted the Chief Justice \ninto this chamber and stood with my colleagues when we took a \ncollective oath, as an institution, to render impartial justice in this \ntrial. Then, we individually signed our names and pledged our honor to \nfaithfully fulfill our oath. That was an indelible and profound moment.\n  I have sought to fulfill both responsibilities--to be impartial and \nto render justice. I have sought to be impartial, which I view as a \ntest of character and will. And I have sought to pursue justice, which \nto me includes the responsibility to perform the homework--do the \nreading, review the evidence and weigh the facts.\n  I have listened carefully, and with an open mind, to the \npresentations of the Republican House Managers and the President's \nCounsel. I have reviewed the evidence. I have read all of the key \nwitnesses' testimony before the grand jury. I have intensely studied \nthe law pertaining to perjury and obstruction of justice, discussed the \nissue with respected lawyers, developed an appropriate standard of \nproof, and reviewed the House testimony of Republican and Democratic \nformer prosecutors for their views on the charges. Finally, I have read \nwhat our nation s founders wrote about impeachment during those months \nin 1787 when the Constitution was formed, and considered the writings \nof many of today's finest scholars.\n  As I reviewed the historical underpinnings of impeachment, I have \nreflected on the intentions of the Founding Fathers who developed our \nfamed system of ``checks and balances''--our Constitution. That system, \ndesigned with the precision of Swiss watchmakers and the concern of \nloving parents, has served our nation very well over the last 200 years \nand served as a guidepost for nations around the world as they \nstruggled to establish democracies.\n  I wondered what the Framers of the Constitution would think of this \ntrial--how they would counsel us. In fact, we can use their rationale \nand their framework to guide us as we reach conclusions about the \nevidence and as we determine whether that evidence merits removing a \npresident from office.\n  Using all this as my guide, I have concluded that the evidence \npresented by the House Managers does not meet a sufficient standard of \nproof that President Clinton engaged in the criminal actions charged by \nthe House. I conclude that the President should not be removed from \noffice.\n  In coming to that conclusion, I have used the highest legal standard \nof proof--``beyond a reasonable doubt,'' which is required in federal \nand state criminal trials. I believe that removing a president is so \nserious, and such an undeniably tumultuous precedent to set in our \nnation's history, that we should act only when the evidence meets that \nhighest standard. The United States Senate must not make the decision \nto remove a President based on a hunch that the charges may be true. \nThe strength of our Constitution and the strength of our nation dictate \nthat we be sure--beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  The House Managers' case is thin and circumstantial. It doesn't meet \nthe standard of ``beyond a reasonable doubt.''\n  The first article of impeachment, charging the president perjured \nhimself before the grand jury, has not been proven beyond a reasonable \ndoubt.\n\n[[Page S1499]]\n\n  For instance, the House Managers claim that President Clinton \ncommitted perjury when he used the term ``on certain occasions'' to \ndefine the number of times he had inappropriate contact with Ms. \nLewinsky. The Managers believed the term ``on certain occasions'' meant \nfewer than the 11 times that were counted by Federal investigators and \nthey labeled it ``a direct lie.''\n  But there is no clear numeric or legal definition of ``certain \noccasions.'' To disagree about the definition of ``certain occasions'' \nis not perjury. And it is not material whether it was 11 times or ``on \ncertain occasions.'' President Clinton admitted the relationship, which \nwas the material point.\n  The Republican House Managers also claimed President Clinton \ncommitted perjury by not recalling the exact date, time, or place of \nevents that occurred two years before. This was because other witnesses \nrecalled things slightly differently. I do not believe this is or can \nbe perjury because well-established court standards state that ``the \nmere fact that recollections differ does not mean that one party is \ncommitting perjury.''\n  Overall, the House Manager's assertions rest on Mr. Clinton's vague \nand unhelpful responses to the Independent Counsel's questions. While \nthose responses may be frustrating to the Independent Counsel, the \nRepublican House Managers, and, perhaps the American public, they are \nnot perjurious as defined by law.\n  Similarly, the case presented by the Republican House Managers has \nnot presented sufficient direct evidence to prove beyond a reasonable \ndoubt that the President obstructed justice. Instead, the House \nManagers relied on extensive conjecture about what the President may \nhave been thinking. In fact, there is direct and credible testimony by \nmultiple witnesses that is directly contrary to the House Managers \nconjecture, leaving ample room for doubt.\n  The Republican House Managers also did not prove beyond a reasonable \ndoubt that there was a causal connection between Ms. Lewinsky s job \nsearch and the affidavit she gave in the Jones lawsuit. Ms. Lewinsky \ntestified clearly and repeatedly that she was never promised a job for \nher silence. That testimony is not challenged by any other witness. In \nfact, other witnesses support that testimony and her most recent \ndeposition by the House Managers confirms it.\n  From the outset of this trial, I established that I would use a two-\ntier analysis for my deliberations. First, I would determine whether \nthe evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the president was \nguilty of the charges. Second, I would then determine whether or not \nthose charges rose to the level of ``high crimes and misdemeanors''--\nthe standard required by the Constitution for conviction and removal of \na president.\n\n  Since my analysis of the charges brought by the Republican House \nManagers determined that they had not been proven beyond a reasonable \ndoubt, the question of determining high crimes and misdemeanors is, I \nbelieve, moot. I will say, however, that I am again taken by the wisdom \nand prescience of the Founding Fathers in addressing this point. I, \nlike many, have read and re-read the work of Alexander Hamilton with \nparticular interest. On March 7, 1788, he wrote ``Federalist 65,'' \noutlining the reasons for, and consequences of, an impeachment trial in \nthe Senate. In that writing, Mr. Hamilton asserted that the proper \nsubject of an impeachment trial would be ``the abuse or violation of \nsome public trust . . . as they relate to injuries done immediately to \nthe society itself.''\n  I believe it is clear from those words, and the words of others who \ndrafted the Constitution, that impeachment was not intended to be used \nfor an act that did not meet that standard it was not meant to be used \nfor punishment of the president. I believe that the Framers intended \nthe last resort of impeachment to be used when a presidential action \nwas a clear offense against the institutions of government. I do not \nbelieve that President Clinton's conduct, as wrong as it was, rises to \nthat level.\n  I wish to choose my words judiciously for I believe the behavior of \nthe president was wrong, reckless and immoral. President Clinton has \nacknowledged that his behavior has harmed his family and the nation, \nand that his behavior, in the end, is what brought us to this day. Mr. \nClinton engaged in an illicit, inappropriate relationship and tried to \nhide it out of shame and the fear of disgrace. Those actions are \nclearly deplorable and should be condemned in the most unequivocal \nterms. But the evidence simply and profoundly does not prove criminal \nwrongdoing.\n  Certainly, the impeachment process has been a difficult period in our \nnation's history. It has challenged the strength of our institutions \nand the strength of our nation. But, Mr. Chief Justice, I still find \nreason for tremendous hope.\n  First, I find hope in the unflagging commitment of the United States \nSenate to do the right thing for the right reason. I am proud to be a \npart of this Senate that was ably led by Mr. Lott and Mr. Daschle and \nconducted this trial in a serious, bipartisan, reflective, and \ncooperative spirit.\n  I am reassured that Alexander Hamilton and other constitutional \nFramers saw fit to charge the Senate with the responsibility to try \nsuch a case. I hope and believe that we have fulfilled their \nexpectations to be a sufficiently dignified and independent tribunal, \none that could preserve ``unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary \nimpartiality'' between the parties in this trial. I would like to thank \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle for meet their \nresponsibilities with such commitment, honor, professionalism, and \nconcern for this body and the judgment of history. I will modestly \npresume that history will say we discharged our duty well.\n  I will never forget one of our finest hours--when, early in the \nprocess, we convened in the old Senate Chamber to deliberate. I had the \nhonor to preside, with my Republican colleague Mr. Mack, over that \ncolloquy in which we established a process that would maintain the \ndignity of the Senate and provide a framework for conducting the trial. \nThat precedent set an important tone for the proceedings that followed \nand I believe that the good will generated in that historic meeting \nheld throughout our deliberations.\n  Finally, I also find tremendous hope in the growing national \nconsensus that we must move forward together to address pressing \nproblems in our neighborhoods, communities and cities. Over the last \nmonth, the nation has cried out for a focus on education, preserving \nSocial Security and Medicare, investing in our economy, and providing \nglobal leadership.\n  We should now heed those calls. I will not say that now we must \n``return to the nation's business.'' In fact, as difficult and time \nconsuming as this process has been, I believe fulfilling our duty to \n``render impartial justice'' has been the nation's business. I am \nhopeful that with the conclusion of this trial, we may all return to \nthe work of making our nation more prosperous, our families stronger, \nour children better educated, our communities more cohesive, and our \nworld safer at home and abroad. I believe we will move on knowing that \nwe have fulfilled our constitutional responsibilities with diligence \nand honor.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Despite the handicaps placed upon the House managers, I \nfeel they did an excellent job in presenting their case in support of \nthe articles of impeachment and laying out the facts. I listened to \nthem carefully, as I listened to the White House Counsel and the \nPresident's lawyers in their vigorous defense of William Jefferson \nClinton.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues say that it was one particular \nfact or incident that led them to their conclusion. That was not the \ncase with me. I needed to listen to all the facts throughout the trial, \nbefore I truly could decide how I would vote.\n  But after carefully weighing all the evidence, all of the facts, and \nall the arguments, I have come to the conclusion--the same conclusion \nreached by 84% of the American public--that President Clinton committed \nperjury and wove a cloth of obstruction of justice.\n  Lead presidential counsel Charles Ruff said in testimony before the \nHouse Judiciary Committee, and here during the Senate trial, that fair-\nminded people could draw different conclusions on the charges.\n\n[[Page S1500]]\n\n  I disagree in one aspect, but agree in another. I personally feel \nthere is no room to disagree on whether the President is guilty of the \ncharges in both Article One and Article Two; he committed perjury and \nhe clearly obstructed justice. But I agree we will differ on whether \nthese charges rise to the level of high crimes which dictate \nconviction. Again, I believe they do and have voted yes, on both \narticles.\n  The President was invited by letter to come and testify before the \nSenate. As the central figure in this trial, he alone knows what \nhappened, and if truthful, he could have addressed the compelling \nevidence against him. He refused.\n  It has been said that many have risked their political futures during \nthis process. Perhaps--yet I will not hesitate telling constituents in \nmy state how and why I voted the way I did. With a clear conscience, I \nwill stand in their judgment and I will live with and respect whatever \ntheir decision on my political future may be.\n  But remember, those who vote to acquit--that is, to not remove this \nPresident--will have the rest of their political lifetimes to explain \ntheir votes. They also will be judged.\n  Collectively too, we will have to await what history will say about \nthis trial and how it was handled. Will this Senate be judged as having \nfollowed the rule of law; that is, deciding this case on the facts, or \nwill we be remembered as the rule-making body who deferred to public \nsentiment? The polls say this President is too popular to remove. If we \nbase our decision on his popularity rather than the rule of law, we \nwould be condoning a society where a majority could impose injustice on \na minority group, only because it has a larger voice. A rule of law is \nfollowed so that justice is done and our Constitution is respected, \nregardless of popularity polls.\n  The foundation of our legal system, I believe, is at risk, if the \nSenate ignores these charges. The constitutional language of \nimpeachment for judges is the same as for the President. Judges are \nremoved from the bench for committing perjury, and also face criminal \ncharges, as do ordinary citizens. We must not accept double standards.\n  The prospect of such a double standard was raised countless times by \nthe House managers. Consider the irony created by a two-tiered standard \nfor perjury. A President commits perjury, yet remains in office. But \nwould a cabinet member who committed perjury be allowed to keep his or \nher job? Would a military officer who committed perjury be allowed to \ncontinue to serve? Would a judge who committed perjury remain on the \nbench? They would not, and yet our President, the nation's chief law \nenforcement officer, is allowed to keep his office after having \ncommitted the same offense.\n  Again, in my view, this is a double standard and is completely \nunacceptable for a nation that prides itself on a legal system which \nprovides equal justice under the law.\n  As to our final duty, the final vote, I believe the so-called ``so \nwhat'' defense has controlled the outcome. ``He did it, but so what'' \nwe have heard it a thousand times from a hundred talking heads. We have \nheard it from our colleagues, too, in both chambers. Well, for this \nSenator, ``so what'' stops at perjury and obstruction of justice. I \nwill cast my vote with sorrow for the President, his family, and for \nthe toll this trial has taken on the nation, but with certainty that it \nis the only choice my conscience and the Constitution permits me to \nmake.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. Chief Justice and my colleagues. Thank you very much, \nMr. Chief Justice, as so many people have said before, for serving with \nyour patience and your fairness. If you care to extend your time with \nus, I would invite you to help preside over my Medicare commission--if \nyou would like to help out in that regard.\n  I also want to acknowledge and thank our two leaders for the fairness \nand the patience that they both have exhibited to all of us and the \ngood job they have done keeping this body together, which I happen to \nthink is extremely important as well.\n  I think it is always very difficult for us to sit in judgment of \nanother human being, and particularly is that very difficult when it \ninvolves moral behavior, or moral misbehavior as this case essentially \nis all about. I was always taught that there was a higher authority \nthat made those types of decisions, but here we are, and that is part \nof our task.\n  I think it is also especially difficult to make those kinds of \ndecisions when they involve someone you know and someone you actually \ndeal with in a relatively close relationship, almost on a day-to-day \nbasis. It is difficult when it is someone that you can in private kid \nwith or that you in private can joke with, as is the case for many of \nus with this accused whom we now sit in judgment of.\n  I know this President and he is someone I have admired for his \npolitical accomplishments and I have admired for what he has been able \nto do for this country, but also quite well recognize the human \nfrailties that he has, as all of us have. If this were a normal trial, \nmany of us wouldn't even be here; we would have been excused a long \ntime ago; we would never have been selected to sit in judgment of this \nPresident. We would have been excused because of friendship, we would \nhave been excused because we know him, we would have been excused \nbecause we campaigned for him and with him, or we would have been \nexcused for the opposite reasons--because he is a political adversary \nthat we have campaigned against, that we have given speeches against, \nthat we disagree with publicly on just about everything he stands for. \nNone of us would find ourselves sitting in judgment of this individual \nif it were a normal trial. But, then again, it is not a normal trial, \nand these certainly are not normal times.\n  For many of us, this is the first time we have ever had a President \nwho has sort of been a contemporary--certainly for me, and many of my \ncolleagues are in that same category. I was here, as many of you in my \ngeneration, when President Johnson was here, and served throughout the \ntime of President Johnson all the way through President Bush. I have \nmet them all and knew them all to various degrees but never in the same \nway that I and many of us know this particular President, because he \nreally is in the same generation as we are. I think we have that \nfeeling, when we talk with him. I mean, many times I feel he knows what \nI am going to say before I say it and he understands what I am trying \nto convey to him before I even have say anything about the subject \nmatter.\n  I think that many of us have had, with him, the same type of life \nexperiences, and that our lives have been shaped by similar events \nbecause we really are of the same generation. So it is very difficult, \ncoming from that position and now sitting in judgment of a person for \nhis moral behavior. So I think we have to be extremely careful, those \nof us who come from this side with that personal friendship and \nrelationship, as well as those who come from the opposite side, as a \npolitical adversary. It is very difficult to set those emotions aside \nand say I am going to be fair in judging someone I just cannot stand \npolitically, that I don't agree with on anything, and I wish he wasn't \nmy President; in fact, I supported someone else. So, it is very \ndifficult for all of us to try to set that aside and come to an honest \nand fair and decent conclusion.\n  I think the American people have been able to do that. I think they \nhave had a good understanding of what this case is about from the very \nbeginning. They understood what it was about before the trial ever \nstarted, they understood what it was about during the trial, and I \nthink they understand what it is all about after the trial. I think \nthey understand what happened. I think they know when it happened, they \nknow where it happened, and they know what was said about it. I think \nthat they were correct from the very beginning.\n  What we really have is a middle-aged man, who happens to be President \nof the United States, who has a sexual affair with someone in his \noffice, and that when people started finding out about it, he lied \nabout it, tried to cover it up, tried to mislead people about what \nhappened. I would daresay that this is not the first time in the \nhistory of the world that this has ever happened. I daresay it probably \nwill not be the last time that it will happen. It is probably not the \nfirst time it has happened in this city.\n  All of that does not make it right; it does not make it acceptable. \nIt does\n\n[[Page S1501]]\n\nnot make it excusable. It cannot be condoned and it cannot be \noverlooked. Actions that are wrong have consequences, and now the \nconsequences must be determined by the Senate.\n  The question here is not really whether anything wrong was done. For \nheaven's sakes, everybody knows that what was done was clearly wrong. \nIt was unacceptable. It was embarrassing. It was indefensible and any \nother adjective you can possibly think of to really describe it. But \nthat is not really the question before us, and we can all agree on \nthat. I think the question is not even whether this was perjury or \nwhether it was obstruction of justice under the terms of the \nConstitution.\n  I think the only question before us is whether what happened rises to \nthe highest constitutional standards of high crimes and misdemeanors \nunder the Constitution, justifying automatic removal of this President \nfrom the office of President.\n  I have concluded that the Constitution was designed very carefully to \nremove the President of the United States for wrongful actions as \nPresident of the United States in his capacity as President of the \nUnited States and in carrying out his duties as President of the United \nStates. For wrongful acts that are not connected with the official \ncapacity and duties of the President of the United States, there are \nother ways to handle it. There is the judicial system. There is the \ncourt system. There are the U.S. attorneys out there waiting. There may \neven be the Office of Independent Counsel, which will still be there \nafter all of this is finished.\n  But we here cannot expand the Constitution in this area. I think \nhistory supports my position. I will cite you just a quick two \nexamples. Senator Slade Gorton earlier spoke about the situation with \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. As Secretary, he was \nhaving an affair with a woman here in this city and they found out \nabout it. He was paying off the husband of the wife that he was having \nan affair with. He was trying to get her to burn the evidence, which \nwere letters that he had sent, to try to cover it up--criminal acts. \nBut the Congress that was investigating him, came to the conclusion \nthat the behavior was private. It was wrong, it was terrible, it was \ncriminal, but it was private behavior and he was not impeached. Not \nbecause, I think, as Slade tried to say, that he wasn't impeached \nbecause he admitted it, he only admitted it when he got caught. But he \nwas not impeached because they decided that it was essentially private \nbehavior. That was in 1792, and Adams and the Founding Fathers were \nhere at that time and they came to that conclusion.\n  More recently, the situation with President Richard Nixon, I think, \nis a clear example of what we are struggling with here, to find this \nconnection between official duties and what he did. One of the articles \nthat they accused President Nixon with was that he had, not once, but \nfour times filed fraudulent income tax returns under the criminal \npenalty of perjury--that he deducted things that he should not have \ndeducted and that he didn't report income that should have been \nreported. By a 26-to-12 vote, the House Judiciary Committee said, among \nother things, that ``the conduct must be seriously incompatible with \neither the constitutional form and principles of our Government or the \nproper performance of the constitutional duties of the President's \noffice.'' They said that it did not demonstrate public misconduct, but \nrather private misconduct that had become public. I think the situation \ntoday is very similar.\n  These are clear examples both in the beginning of our country's \nhistory and very recently about the need for this nexus or connection \nbetween the illegal acts and the duties of the office of the President.\n  Let me conclude by saying I am voting not to convict and remove. But \nthat is not a vote on the innocence of this President. He is not \ninnocent. And by not voting to convict we can't somehow establish his \ninnocence. If the standard of removal was bad behavior, he would be \ngone. I mean there would probably be no disagreement about that. But \nthat is not the standard.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on conviction and removal and ask our colleagues \nto join in a bipartisan, strong, clear censure resolution and spell out \nwhat happened and where it happened and when it happened and what was \nsaid about what happened so that history will be able to, forever, look \nat that censure resolution and study it and learn from what we do \ntoday. That, my colleagues, I think is an appropriate and a proper \nremedy.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have listened carefully to the arguments of the House \nManagers and the counter-arguments by the White House counsel during \nthis impeachment trial. I have taken seriously my oath to render \nimpartial justice.\n  While the legal nuances offered by both sides were interesting and \nessential, I kept thinking as I sat listening that the most obvious and \nimportant but unstated question was: What standard of conduct should we \ninsist our President live up to?\n  Only by taking into account this question do I believe that we in the \nSenate can properly interpret our Founding Fathers' impeachment \ncriteria comprised of ``bribery, treason or other high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.'' Clearly, the Constitution recognizes that a President \nmay be impeached not only for bribery and treason, but also for other \nactions that destroy the underlying integrity of the Presidency or the \n``equal justice for all'' guarantee of the Judiciary.\n  All reasonable observers admit that the President lied under oath and \nundertook a substantial and purposeful effort to hide his behavior from \nothers in order to obstruct justice in a legal proceeding. My good \nfriends and Democratic colleagues, Senators Joe Lieberman, Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan, Bob Kerrey, Diane Feinstein, and Robert Byrd, among \nothers, have bluntly acknowledged publically that the President lied, \nmisled, obstructed, and attempted in many ways to thwart justice's \nimpartial course in a civil rights case. The sticking point has been: \nDoes this misbehavior rise to the level of impeachable offenses?\n  I have concluded that President Clinton's actions do, indeed, rise to \nthe level of impeachable offenses that the Founding Fathers envisioned.\n  I am not a Constitutional scholar, as I have told you before. But, \nmore than 200 years ago, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John Jay \nsummed up my feelings about lying under oath and its subversion of the \nadministration of justice and honest government:\n\n       Independent of the abominable insult which Perjury offers \n     to the divine Being, There is no Crime more pernicious to \n     Society. It discolours and poisons the Streams of Justice, \n     and by substituting Falsehood for Truth, saps the Foundations \n     of personal and public rights. . . . Testimony is given under \n     solemn obligations which an appeal to the God of Truth \n     impose; and if oaths should cease to be held sacred, our \n     dearest and most valuable Rights would become insecure.\n\n  Lying under oath is an ``insult to the divine Being . . . It \ndiscolours and poisons the Streams of Justice . . . and . . . saps the \nFoundations of personal and public Rights.''\n  How can anyone, after conceding that the President lied under oath \nand obstructed justice, listen to this quotation and not conclude that \nthis President has committed acts which are clearly serious, which \ncorrupt or subvert the political and government process, and which are \nplainly wrong to any honorable person or to a good citizen?\n  We must start by saying that this trial has never been about the \nPresident's private sex acts, as tawdry as they may have been.\n  This trial has been about his failure to properly discharge his \npublic responsibility. The President had a choice to make during this \nentire, lamentable episode. At a number of critical junctures, he had a \nchoice either to tell the truth or to lie, first in the civil rights \ncase, before the grand jury and on national television. Each time he \nchose to lie. He made that fateful choice.\n  Truthfulness is the first pillar of good character in the Character \nCounts program of which I have been part of establishing in New Mexico. \nMany of you in this chamber have joined me in declaring the annual \n``Character Counts Weeks.'' This program teaches grade school \nyoungsters throughout America about six pillars of good character. \nPublic and private schools in every corner of my state teach children \nthat character counts; character makes a difference; indeed, character \nmakes all the difference.\n\n[[Page S1502]]\n\n  Guess which one of these pillars comes first? Trustworthiness. \nTrustworthiness.\n  So what do I say to the children in my state when they ask, ``Didn't \nthe President lie? Doesn't that mean he isn't trustworthy? Then, \nSenator, why didn't the Senate punish him?''\n  Let me quote one of the most critical passages from Charles L. Black, \nJr., and his handbook on impeachment, one of the seminal works on the \nimpeachment process. He ponders this question: what kinds of non-\ncriminal acts by a President are clearly impeachable? He concludes that \n``high crimes and misdemeanors'' are those kinds of offenses which fall \ninto three categories: ``(1) which are extremely serious, (2) which in \nsome way corrupt or subvert the political and governmental process, and \n(3) which are plainly wrong in themselves to a person of honor, or to a \ngood citizen, regardless of words on the statute books.''\n  Well, there you have it in my judgment. The President lied under oath \nin a civil rights case, he lied before a grand jury and he lied on \nnational television to the American people.\n  Regarding Article II, obstruction of justice the House Managers \nproved to my satisfaction the following facts:\n  (1) The President encouraged Monica Lewinsky to prepare and submit a \nfalse affidavit; (2) He encouraged her to tell false and misleading \ncover stories if she were called to testify in a civil rights lawsuit; \n(3) He engaged in, encouraged or supported a scheme to conceal his \ngifts to Monica Lewinsky that had been subpoenaed in the civil rights \nlawsuit; (4) He intensified and succeeded in an effort to find Monica \nLewinsky a job so that she would not testify truthfully in the civil \nrights lawsuit; (5) He gave a false account of his relationship with \nMonica Lewinsky to Betty Currie in order to influence Ms. Currie's \nexpected testimony in the civil rights lawsuit; (6) At his deposition \nin a Federal civil rights action against him, William Jefferson Clinton \nallowed his attorney to make false and misleading statements to a \nFederal judge characterizing an affidavit, in order to prevent \nquestioning deemed relevant by the judge. Such false and misleading \nstatements were subsequently called to the attention of the judge by \nhis attorney; (7) He lied to John Podesta, Sidney Blumenthal, Erskine \nBowles and other White House aides regarding his relationship with \nMonica Lewinsky to influence their expected testimony before the \nFederal grand jury.\n  In this day and age of public yearning for heroes, we criticize \nbasketball, football and baseball players, and actors and singers who \ncommit crimes or otherwise fail to be ``good role models.'' One of \nthose celebrities said a few years ago that he was only a basketball \nplayer, not a role model. He said in essence: ``Want a role model, look \nto the President.''\n  Do not underestimate, my friends, the corrupting and cynical signal \nwe will send if we fail to enforce the highest standards of conduct on \nthe most powerful man in the nation.\n  Finally, I want to address a question that my good friend, Senator \nByrd, raised over the weekend in a television show. After declaring \nthat the President had lied and obstructed justice, and after \nconcluding these acts were impeachable offenses, Senator Byrd, for whom \nI have great respect, noted that it was very hard, in his judgment, to \nimpeach a president who enjoyed the public popularity that this \nPresident enjoys.\n  Let me respond to that. Popularity is not a defense in an impeachment \ntrial. Indeed, one of our Founding Fathers addressed this issue of \npopularity directly in the oft-quoted Federalist Papers: ``It takes \nmore than talents of low intrigue and the little arts of popularity'' \nto be President. And, popularity isn't a pillar of Character Counts.\n  What if a President committed the same acts as those alleged in this \ntrial but he was presiding over a weak economy, a stock market at a \nthree-year low, 12 percent unemployment, 16 percent inflation and a \nnation worried about their job security and families? I wonder if this \nwould be a straight party line vote. I just wonder.\n  Conversely, I wonder if you had a President who committed one of the \nimpeachable crimes enumerated in the Constitution--bribery or treason. \nAnd the facts were obvious and clear: he gave a job to someone in \nexchange for a $5,000 bribe and the entire episode was on video tape. \nIn this hypothetical, what if this bribery-perpetrating President was \nvery popular but the House, nonetheless, impeached him. It would be the \nSenate's responsibility to hold a trial. In this example, economy is \nstrong, the country is at peace, everyone's stock market investments \nare soaring. Would we then interpret the Constitution to provide a \npopularity defense? Would we create a ``booming economy exception'' to \nthe conviction and removal clause of the Constitution? I doubt it. I \ndoubt it very much. Let me repeat, temporary popularity of a President \ncannot be a legitimate defense against impeachment.\n  The President has committed high crimes and misdemeanors, in \nviolation of his oath of office. He lied under oath. He obstructed \njustice. His behavior was unworthy of the Presidency of the United \nStates.\n  Thus, I sadly conclude that the President is guilty of the charges \nmade against him by the House of Representatives and I will vote to \nconvict him on both counts before the Senate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Chief Justice and colleagues, in his award-winning \nbook ``The Making of the President, 1960,'' Theodore H. White refers to \nan American Presidential election as ``the most awesome transfer of \npower in the world.''\n  He notes that:\n\n       No people has succeeded at it better or over a longer \n     period of time than the Americans. Yet as the transfer of \n     this power takes place, there is nothing to be seen except an \n     occasional line outside a church or school or file of people \n     fidgeting in the rain, waiting to enter the voting booths. No \n     bands play on election day, no troops march, no guns are \n     readied, no conspirators gather in secret headquarters.\n\n  And later in that opening chapter White observes:\n\n       Good or bad, whatever the decision, America will accept the \n     decision and cut down any man who goes against it, even \n     though for millions the decision runs contrary to their own \n     votes. The general vote is an expression of national will, \n     the only substitute for violence and blood.\n\n  I begin with those quotes to underscore the critical significance of \na Presidential election in the structure of our national politics. Many \nlearned commentators have observed that one of the original \ncontributions to the art of government made by the Constitutional \nConvention was to develop a Presidential, as opposed to a \nparliamentary, system of government, wherein the executive is chosen by \nthe electorate and is not dependent upon the confidence of the \nlegislature for his office. As former Attorney General Katzenbach \nobserved:\n\n       It is a serious matter for the Congress to remove a \n     President who has been elected in a democratic process for a \n     term of four years, raising fundamental concerns about the \n     separation of powers.\n\n  He goes on to note that if the removal power is not limited, as it \nclearly is, impeachment could be converted into a parliamentary vote of \nno confidence which, whatever its merits, is not our constitutional \nsystem. The separation of powers embraced in our Constitution and the \nfixed term of the President have been credited by many observers with \nproviding stability to our political system.\n  It is important therefore to recognize that in considering the matter \nbefore us we do so in the context of a Presidential election, wherein \nthe people have chosen the single leader of the executive branch of our \nGovernment--the President.\n  Since the Framers put the impeachment remedy in the Constitution, it \nis obvious they recognized that there may be circumstances which \nrequire the Congress to remove a duly elected President. However, in my \njudgment, as the Framers indicated, we need to be very careful, very \ncautious, very prudent, in undertaking that remedy lest we introduce a \ndangerous instability in the workings of our political institutions.\n  Viscount Bryce, whose bust is at the foot of the steps in the hallway \nbelow, was a distinguished commentator about the American political \nsystem. He wrote in ``The American Commonwealth'' in discussing the \nimpeachment of a President:\n\n       Impeachment is the heaviest piece of artillery in the \n     congressional arsenal, but because it is so heavy, it is \n     unfit for ordinary\n\n[[Page S1503]]\n\n     use. It is like a 100-ton gun which needs complex machinery \n     to bring it into position, an enormous charge of powder to \n     fire it, and a large mark to aim at. Or to vary this simile, \n     impeachment is what physicians call a heroic medicine, an \n     extreme remedy proper to be applied against an official \n     guilty of political crimes.\n\n  Let me turn next to the argument which seeks to draw an analogy \nbetween the impeachment of a President and the impeachment of judges, \nan argument that cites three recent cases in which judges have been \nremoved from office. In my view, this analogy misses the mark.\n  Two of the judges that the Senate convicted and thus removed from \noffice had been accused in a criminal case, tried before a jury, found \nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and were in jail. Until we removed \nthem they were still drawing their salary. In the third case, the \ndefendant had been acquitted of bribery, but a judicial inquiry found \nthat he had perjured himself to cover up the bribery misdeeds. \nDifference No. 1: Judges can be criminally prosecuted while in office; \nthe President cannot. (At least that has been the theory up to this \npoint.)\n  Secondly, elected versus appointed. Judges are appointed to the bench \nfor life. They can only be removed by impeachment. The President is \nelected by the people for a 4-year term and can only hold two such \nterms. As President Ford, when he was a Congressman, stated:\n\n       I think it is fair to come to one conclusion, however, from \n     our history of impeachments. A higher standard is expected of \n     Federal judges than of any other civil officers of the United \n     States. The President and the Vice President and all persons \n     holding office at the pleasure can be thrown out of office by \n     the voters at least every 4 years.\n\n  Thirdly, one needs to consider the injury to the branch of Government \nwhich would result from the removal of the officer. The removal of one \njudge out of hundreds and hundreds of judges does not significantly \naffect the operation of the judicial branch of our Government. The \nremoval of the President, the single head of the executive branch, \nobviously is in an entirely different category. The President, under \nour system, holds the executive power. In the end, executive branch \ndecisions are his decisions.\n  In the minority report in the House Watergate proceedings, Republican \nMembers stated:\n\n       The removal of a President from office would obviously have \n     a far greater impact upon the equilibrium of our system of \n     Government than removal of a single Federal judge.\n\n  The House Judiciary Committee majority report accompanying the \narticle of impeachment against Judge Walter Nixon in 1989 similarly \nstated as follows:\n\n       Judges must be held to a higher standard of conduct than \n     other officials. As noted by the House Judiciary Committee in \n     1970, Congress has recognized that Federal judges must be \n     held to a different standard of conduct than other civil \n     officers because of the nature of their position and the \n     tenure of their office.\n\n  In putting on their case, the House Republican managers sought to \nportray a simple logical progression--first that the material which \nthey brought before the Senate showed violations of provisions of the \nFederal Criminal Code, i.e., perjury and obstruction of justice. Then \nthey argued that if you find such crimes, you have high crimes and \nmisdemeanors and, ergo, removal from office. But let us look at this \nsupposed logical progression which I view as flawed at each step.\n  First, I do not believe the House managers carried the burden of \nproof with respect to the commission of crimes. Since they relied on \nthe Federal Criminal Code--charging crimes--in making their case, it is \nappropriate that they be held to the burden of proof of beyond a \nreasonable doubt--the standard used in criminal cases.\n  In the House Judiciary Committee a panel of distinguished former \nFederal prosecutors testified that a responsible Federal prosecutor \nwould not have brought a criminal prosecution on the basis of the case \nset out in the Starr Report on which the House Judiciary Committee \nrelied. One of them, Thomas P. Sullivan, a veteran of 40 years of \npractice in Federal criminal cases, and U.S. Attorney for the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois from 1977 to 1981, stated the following:\n\n       If the President were not involved, if an ordinary citizen \n     were the subject of the inquiry, no serious consideration \n     would be given to a criminal prosecution arising from alleged \n     misconduct in discovery in the Jones civil case having to do \n     with an alleged coverup of a private sexual affair with \n     another woman or the follow-on testimony before the grand \n     jury. The case simply would not be given serious \n     consideration for prosecution.\n\n  Now, let me move beyond this question of proving the case and address \nthe next step in the managers' ostensible logical progression, namely \nthat the crimes that they were trying to prove are high crime and \nmisdemeanors and, therefore, a vote for conviction and removal must \nfollow.\n  Actually, in considering this issue we must bear in mind the ultimate \nquestion: Does the conduct warrant removal from office? The House logic \nseems to be that any perjury, any obstruction of justice, warrants \nremoval. As serious as those charges are, not all such conduct in all \ninstances may rise to the level of an impeachable offense. In \nconsidering this matter, it is important to understand that the House \narticles included within them not only the charges but also the \npenalty. In the ordinary criminal case, there is a two-step judgment--\nguilt and then sentence. In an impeachment case, the finding of guilty \ncarries with it removal from office--the remedy provided by the \nConstitution.\n  There is an important precedent for the view that in certain \ncircumstances offenses of the sort alleged here may not rise to the \nlevel of a high crime and misdemeanor. That precedent is found in the \ntax article of impeachment of Richard Nixon which was before the House \nJudiciary Committee in 1974. That article charged President Nixon with \nknowingly filing tax returns which fraudulently claimed that he had \ndonated pre-Presidential papers before the date Congress had set for \neliminating such a charitable tax deduction. (It was worth $576,000 in \ndeductions.) This deduction was claimed in tax returns that contained \nthe following assertion just above the taxpayer's signature:\n\n       Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined \n     this return, including accompanying schedules and statements, \n     and, to the best of my knowledge and belief, it is true, \n     correct and complete.\n\n  The House Judiciary Committee voted down that article of impeachment \nby a vote of 12 for, 26 against. As one of nine Democrats who joined \nthe Republicans in voting against this article of impeachment in the \nNixon case, I did not believe that in the circumstances of that case it \nrose to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor, I did not believe it \nwas conduct against which the Founding Fathers intended the Congress to \ninvoke the impeachment remedy.\n  Let me turn briefly to the procedure followed in this impeachment \nmatter, since good procedure enhances the chances of good results while \nbad procedure does the opposite. I am prompted to do so by various \ncomments made by House managers criticizing the Senate for the \nprocedure we have followed. I think the Senate has handled this matter \nwell under very difficult circumstances. Given that the House managers \nquestioned our procedure, let us look at the procedure on the House \nside.\n  The House, which brought in no ``fact'' witnesses, came to the Senate \nand said to us, ``In order to evaluate testimony that is in the record, \nyou must bring witnesses in and look them in the eye in order to assess \ntheir credibility.'' Obviously, one must ask, how did the House \nmanagers assess the credibility of witnesses when they brought none \nbefore them and yet voted to bring articles of impeachment recommending \nthe President's removal to the Senate?\n  Secondly, the other day, in response to a reasonable request by the \nPresident's lawyers on how the House planned to proceed in using \ndeposition excerpts, a House manager said, ``I believe the appropriate \nlegal response to your request is that it is none of your damn business \nwhat the other side is going to put on.'' This same attitude marked the \ntreatment of President Clinton's lawyers before the House Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Contrast this with the House Judiciary Committee's conduct in the \nmatter of President Nixon's impeachment when the President's lawyers \nsat in with the committee in its closed sessions when committee staff \npresented findings of fact. The President's lawyers were able to \nchallenge material,\n\n[[Page S1504]]\n\nto ask questions, to supplement all presentations. Fact witnesses were \ncalled in and were subjected to questions by all. There was an \nunderstanding of the gravity of the matter for the Nation and the \nabsolute imperative of having a fair process.\n  In this matter the House Judiciary Committee took only a few weeks to \nreport impeachment articles. In the Nixon case the committee took 6 \nmonths. In the Judge Hastings case, the House Judiciary Committee \nreceived an 841-page report from the Judicial Conference as to why \nHastings should be removed. Nevertheless, the committee undertook its \nown examination of the evidence. It heard 12 fact witnesses, deposed or \ninterviewed 60 others, and held 7 days of hearings.\n  In closing, it is very important to keep in mind the distinction \nbetween the person who is President and the Office of President of the \nUnited States provided for in our Constitution.\n  President Clinton has engaged in disgraceful and reprehensible \nconduct which has severely sullied and demeaned his tenure as \nPresident. Because of his shameful and reckless behavior he has brought \ndishonor upon himself, deeply hurt his family, and grievously \ndiminished his reputation and standing now, and in history.\n  But the diminishing of Bill Clinton must not lead us to diminish the \nPresidency for his successors as our Nation moves into the new \nmillennium. There is a danger to the Nation in deposing a political \nleader chosen directly by the people and we must be wary of the \ninstability it would bring to our political system.\n  In the report of the staff of the impeachment inquiry in 1974 on the \nconstitutional grounds for Presidential impeachment, the conclusion \nstates:\n\n       Not all presidential misconduct is sufficient to constitute \n     grounds for impeachment. There is a further requirement--\n     substantiality. In deciding whether this further requirement \n     has been met, the facts must be considered as a whole in the \n     context of the office, not in terms of separate or isolated \n     events. Because impeachment of a President is a grave step \n     for the nation, it is to be predicated only upon conduct \n     seriously incompatible with either the constitutional form \n     and principles of our government or the proper performance of \n     constitutional duties of the presidential office.\n\n  I do not believe the conduct examined here meets this test.\n  I will vote against removing the President.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. Chief Justice and colleagues, my friends, I am not \ngoing to try to dazzle you with my knowledge of the law which is \nminimal, or the forty hand-written pages I've taken during these \nproceedings. But, I signed the same oath you did with a pen that should \nhave had on it ``United States Senate,'' but did not. It said, ``Untied \nStates Senate.''\n  We were asked to turn the pens back in. I heard they are going to be \nvaluable collectors' items, and I am not turning mine in. I want to see \nwhat it's worth.\n  And there you have it. An imperfect Senator being asked to judge an \nimperfect President.\n  One of our colleagues noted yesterday that we all come from different \nbackgrounds. It's true and, perhaps, I am living proof that the \ngreatness of this nation because I could be here at all.\n  The same body where someone named Daniel Webster, John F. Kennedy and \nHarry Truman once served also welcomed a mixed blood kid from the wrong \nside of the tracks. The offspring of an alcoholic father and a \ntubercular mother; in and out of orphanages; a law breaker and high \nschool drop out who lied, cheated, stole and did many other shameful \nthings make me a poor judge indeed of someone else who used poor \njudgment.\n  I would rather take a beating than to judge someone else for their \nindiscretions. But, as one of our colleagues said yesterday, ``We \ndidn't ask for this.''\n  Still, with all my own human failings, I, like you, must try to \nseparate them from the rule of law. I wish I had the historical \nknowledge of Senator Byrd or the legal knowledge of Orrin Hatch or the \ngovernment experience of John Warner. But, I don't--I must use common \nsense.\n  I want to tell you an anecdote--about a conversation I had with the \nPresident right after he made his rather startling confession before \nthis nation and a group of reverends which I watched from my Denver \noffice as millions of others were also watching at the same time.\n  I was so moved by his statement that I wrote him a personal note \ntelling him how sorry I was for what his family was going through. I \ntold him I would not be one to pile on; that I would make no statements \nto the press; nor would I be a party to the impeachment process going \non in the other body.\n  As I look around this room, I see several others who subscribed to \nthat same conduct as this proceeding moved to the Senate and took on \nsoap opera proportions, and members of both parties ran pell mell to \nthe cameras at each recess.\n  I sit right there in the back row fifteen feet from the cloakroom. \nBut, at each recess by the time I walk to the cloakroom and glance at \nthe TV, some of my colleagues have already sprinted somewhere else to \nbe in front of the cameras. As you know, I used to be on the U.S. \nOlympic Team, and I tell my speedy friends--you could have made the \nteam.\n\n  About three days after I wrote to the President, he called me to \nthank me for my note and we spoke for about 15 minutes. I asked him how \nhis family was dealing with it and he told me they were having good \ndays and bad, but it was hardest on his daughter, Chelsea, because she \nwas away at college without the family unit to console her. He told me \nhe would keep my note always. I felt badly then, and I do now.\n  As I look around this room in which so many great people in our \nhistory have spoken and I read their names written in the desk drawers \nalong with those who no one remembers, I tell you that I like this \nPresident.\n  He came through a difficult childhood as I did, and I genuinely like \nhim and feel sorry for both him and his family. But after agonizing as \nmany of my Senate friends have, I remember the first question my then \nnine-year-old son, Colin, asked me 17 years ago when I told him I was \ngoing to run for public office. He asked, ``Dad, are you going to lie \nand stuff?''\n  I told him, ``No.'' I don't have to learn how to lie--I still \nremembered how to lie from my delinquent days. I'm still trying to \nforget it.\n  I told him, human frailties not withstanding, elected officials \nshould not ``lie and stuff.''\n  Every one of us knows that when we step into the public arena, we are \njudged by a different standard. Being honest and truthful becomes more \nimportant because we must set the examples.\n  As a senator, if I ever forget it, this body will not have to throw \nme out because I will have brought it on myself, and I'll save this \nbody the time and expense and resign.\n  I would not fear being thrown out. When I was young and not yet \nhouse-broken, I was thrown out of a lot of places. I swore a lot of \noaths--not when I went in, but when I came out.\n  There is a difference: one is about anger in private--the other is \nabout honor in public. If we are not going to honor our oath, why don't \nwe get rid of it and have an every-man-for-himself kind of elected \nofficial?\n  Better yet, let's change it. Mr. Chief Justice, you could say: \n``Senators-elect. Raise your right hand and repeat after me: `On my \nhonor, I'll do my best, to help myself and lie like the rest.''\n  I took a solemn oath--perhaps it is the only thing in common I share \nwith John F. Kennedy, Harry Truman and Daniel Webster as well as the \nfounders of this nation--and that is why honoring it is all the more \nimportant to me.\n  Simply speaking, the President did, too. And, so even though I like \nhim personally, I find I can only vote one way. And that is guilty on \nboth articles.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, in the impeachment case of President \nClinton I have read the depositions, reviewed the massive volume of \nevidence and carefully followed the detailed presentations of both the \nHouse managers and the President's counsel. The instructions for my \ndecision come from two places: the oath I took to do impartial justice \nand the Constitution of the United States.\n  Nebraskans, including me, are angry about the President's behavior. \nWe find it deplorable on every level. It has permanently and deservedly \nmarred his place in history. But impeachment is not about punishing an \nindividual; it is\n\n[[Page S1505]]\n\nabout protecting the country. We punish a President who behaves \nimmorally, lies and otherwise lacks the character we demand in public \noffice with our votes. Presidents are also subject to criminal \nprosecution when they leave office.\n  Impeachment must be reserved for extreme situations involving crimes \nagainst the state. Why? Because the founders of our country and the \nframers of our Constitution correctly placed stability of the republic \nas their paramount concern. They did not want Congress to be able to \neasily remove a popularly elected President. They made clear they \nintended a decision to impeach to be used to protect the nation against \nonly the highest of crimes.\n  On December 19, 1998, the House of Representatives, on an almost \nstraight party-line vote, approved and delivered to the Senate two \narticles of impeachment. The Constitution permits me to judge and \ndecide upon only these articles, not to wander through all of the \nPresident's conduct looking for any reason for removal.\n  Some Nebraskans have told me the President should be removed from \noffice by the Congress because he is no longer trusted, has lost the \nrespect of many, and has displayed reprehensible behavior. As strong as \nthose feelings are, the Constitution does not provide for overturning \nan election even if all of these things are true.\n  Three recent letters to the editor in the Omaha World-Herald help \nmake the point. The first, from a man in Kearney, says that by voting \nto dismiss the trial, I ``voted to support sexual harassment,'' among \nother things. A second, from Honey Creek, Iowa, raises allegations \nregarding the President and China, says he is ``dangerous'' and urges \nSenator Hagel and I to ``oust him now.'' The third, from Omaha, reminds \nreaders of an often quoted comment I once made about the President's \ncredibility and asks how, in light of that, I could vote to leave him \nin office.\n  However, the House did not charge the President with these offenses. \nImpeachment is not a judgment of a President's character, all his \nactions, or even his general fitness for office. We make those \ndecisions every four years at the ballot box. Our job in contemplating \nthe extraordinary step of overturning an election is to judge only \nthose charges the House actually brought.\n  Because the premium on Constitutional stability is so high, I decided \nto judge the case against the strictest possible standard: proof beyond \na reasonable doubt. In other words, the President can be convicted only \nif there is no reasonable interpretation of the facts other than an \nintent to commit perjury and obstruction of justice. The following is a \nsummary of my analysis of this case:\n  Article One accuses the President of perjury in his August 17, 1998, \ntestimony to a Federal grand jury, during which he waived his rights \nagainst self incrimination. Most important in determining guilt or \ninnocence is the rule of law governing perjury, which makes it clear \nthat a person has not committed perjury just because they misled or \neven lied. Perjury occurs when a false statement is made under oath \nwith willful intent to mislead in a material matter. Lying is immoral; \nperjury is illegal. I should not accuse the President of ignoring the \nrule of law and then ignore it myself in making a judgment.\n  After reading and watching the President's grand jury testimony, \nlistening to the arguments of the House managers and the President's \nlawyers, discussing this case with prosecutors and reviewing the \nimpeachment trial of U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings, I have \nconcluded the President did not commit the crime of perjury beyond a \nreasonable doubt. I frequently found the President's testimony \nmaddening and misleading, but I did not find it material to a criminal \nact.\n  Article Two accuses the President of obstructing justice in seven \ninstances. The House managers relied on circumstantial evidence, saying \nthat common sense provides only one conclusion about why the President \nacted the way he did. However, the direct evidence, including the \ntestimony of Monica Lewinsky herself, rebutted the circumstantial \nevidence. Second, while the House managers were correct in saying that \ncommon sense could lead to a conclusion that the President intended to \nobstruct justice, common sense could also lead to other reasonable \nconclusions about the reasons for his actions. Third, with respect to \nthe allegations of obstructing justice in the civil case, Paula Jones' \nlawsuit was thrown out, then eventually settled. In the end, justice \nwas done.\n  As reprehensible as I find the President's behavior to be, I do not \nbelieve that high crimes and misdemeanors as defined by the Framers \nhave been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I will vote to \nacquit on both Articles. My vote to acquit is not a vote to exonerate. \nWhile there is plenty of blame to go around in this case, the person \nmost responsible for it going this far is the President of the United \nStates. He behaved immorally, recklessly and reprehensibly. These were \nhis choices. In the final analysis, they do not merit removal, but they \ndo merit condemnation.\n  While I am confident this vote is the right one--not just for this \ncase, but as a precedent for future Congresses and Presidents too--I \nunderstand that reasonable people could reach the opposite conclusion. \nThe bitterness in America on both sides of this debate has saddened me. \nI hope and pray that with this vote behind us the people's Congress can \nreturn without rancor to the important work of our country.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. We are not here today because the President had a \nrelationship that he himself has described as inappropriate and wrong. \nAs House Manager James Rogan appropriately noted, ``Had the President's \nbad choice simply ended with this indiscretion, we would not be here \ntoday. Adultery may be a lot of things, but it is not an impeachable \noffense. Unfortunately, the President's bad choices only grew worse.'' \nIt is not the President's inappropriate relationship, but his \ndeliberate and willful attempts to conceal and mislead that brings us \nto this point.\n  The very foundation of this nation is the rule of law not of men. The \nframers of our Constitution specifically provided Article II, Section 4 \nof the Constitution which states, ``The President, Vice President, and \nall civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office \non Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high \nCrimes and Misdemeanors.''\n  On January 7, 1999, as one of my first official duties as a United \nStates Senator, I took an oath to consider the evidence and arguments \nin the impeachment case against the President. We answered in the \naffirmative when the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court administered \nthe following oath:\n\n       Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to \n     the trial of the impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, \n     President of the United States, now pending, you will do \n     impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws, so \n     help you God?\n\n  I understood that the private inappropriate conduct of the President \nalone did not then and does not now rise to a level necessitating his \nremoval from office. My responsibility is to fulfill the oath I took to \ndetermine impartially based on the facts, evidence and testimony \nwhether the President committed high Crimes and Misdemeanors as \noutlined in the Constitution.\n  During my 33 years in public office, I have had to make some very \ndifficult decisions. As governor, I had to make determinations on \nhundreds of requests for commutations and pardons. To my recollection, \nin no case have I labored more than I have over the Articles of \nImpeachment of our President.\n  After an exhaustive study, which included reading volumes of \ntranscripts, watching the taped testimony and listening to the able \narguments made by the House Managers, the White House counsel and my \ncolleagues in the Senate, I have reached the conclusion that, beyond a \nreasonable doubt, the President committed both perjury and obstruction \nof justice as outlined in Articles I and II in the Articles of \nImpeachment.\n  I also have concluded that the President's obstruction of justice was \npremeditated and undertaken over a long period of time beginning when \nhe learned that Monica Lewinsky was placed on the witness list in the \nJones case.\n  It is particularly disturbing that he used his brilliant mind and \nsuperb interpersonal skills to sweep other people into his scheme, \nthereby impairing\n\n[[Page S1506]]\n\ntheir credibility, all to extricate himself from taking responsibility \nfor his conduct. But for a conclusive DNA analysis, he may have \nsucceeded in that scheme.\n  By committing perjury and obstructing justice, the President is \nguilty of high Crimes and Misdemeanors. As constitutional scholar \nCharles Cooper said, ``The crimes of perjury and obstruction of \njustice, like the crimes of treason and bribery, are quintessentially \noffenses against our system of government, visiting injury immediately \non society itself.''\n  He violated his oath of office and failed to fulfill his \nresponsibility under the Constitution, which provides that the \nPresident ``shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' \nJudge Griffin Bell has correctly noted, ``A president cannot faithfully \nexecute the laws if he himself is breaking them.'' The President has \nundermined the fundamental principle that we are a nation ruled by laws \nand not by men. There is no way in good conscience that we as a nation \ncan have a lawbreaker remain as President of the United States when his \nconduct in office has included the very same acts that have resulted in \nthe impeachment of Federal judges and have sent hundreds of people to \nprison. Ours is a nation of equal justice under the law.\n  I believe the framers of the Constitution had a President like Bill \nClinton in mind when they drafted the impeachment provisions in Article \nII, Section 4--a very popular, brilliant communicator with \nextraordinary interpersonal skills who abuses his power, violates his \noath of office, and evades responsibility for his actions because he \nbelieves he is above the law.\n  One who has committed high Crimes and Misdemeanors disqualifies \nhimself from serving as President, Commander-in-Chief, and chief law \nenforcement officer. The President also represents much more than these \ntitles and responsibilities. He is a symbol of the greatness of the \nAmerican people. Presidential scholar Clinton Rossiter observed that \nthe president of the United States is ``the one-man distillation of the \nAmerican people.'' And, President William Howard Taft described the \npresident as ``the personal embodiment and representative of their \ndignity and majesty.''\n  By virtue of his own conduct, William Jefferson Clinton has forfeited \nhis elected right to hold the office of president. I sincerely believe \nthat this country can survive the removal of a popular president who \nhas forfeited public trust. But, our country cannot survive the \nabandonment of trust itself.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. Chief Justice, the Senate must now fulfill a \nweighty and solemn duty. For only the second time in the more than two \nhundred years since our founding fathers established the Constitution, \nwe must vote on Articles of Impeachment against a President.\n  When considering this issue, which goes to our core constitutional \nresponsibilities as Senators, each of us must come to a conclusion \nbased on his or her conscience. Guided by the Constitution, we must \nbring all of our moral beliefs, our education, our careers, and our \nexperiences as public servants to the question. And we must try to \nreach a decision that will serve the best interests of the nation for \ngenerations to come.\n  As I reflect on the impeachment proceedings, I think first of the \nrange of emotions I have felt. From the moment I realized that the \nPresident had engaged in this shameful relationship, I have struggled \nwith my thoughts.\n  I was angry, of course. I was ashamed for the President, a talented \nman--someone I consider a friend. How could he risk so much with his \ndisgraceful behavior?\n  And I was saddened. I do not know how the President will reconcile \nhimself to his family. I could imagine the embarrassment and the \nhumiliation of the First Lady and his daughter Chelsea. I pitied them \nas they felt the searing glow of the public spotlight.\n  I am sure that colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, have \nempathized with similar emotions.\n  But now we must put those feelings aside. We have a very specific \ncharge under the Constitution. That hallowed document delineates our \nduty. Under Article II, Section 4, we must determine whether the \nPresident has committed ``high Crimes or Misdemeanors'' requiring his \nremoval from office.\n  In my view, our founding fathers meant to set a very high standard \nfor impeachment. Clearly, the phrase ``high Crimes or Misdemeanors'' \ndoes not include all crimes. But what are the crimes that meet that \nstandard? I find the words of George Mason to be compelling. He \nunderstood the phrase to mean ``great and dangerous offenses'' or \n``attempts to subvert the Constitution.''\n  When applying this standard, we must also consider the national \ninterest. The founding fathers vested the impeachment power in the \nSenate, and not the judiciary, precisely because this body would be \naccountable to the people.\n  In the words of Alexander Hamilton, only the Senate would ``possess \nthe degree of credit and authority'' required to act on the weighty \nissue of whether to remove a federal official. In my view, this means \nthat we must look not just at the facts and the law, but we must also \ntry to determine what is in the best interests of the nation.\n  But we should not read the polls, or some other temporary gauge of \nthe public temperament. Instead, we must look back through history, and \ntoward the future, to reach a decision that will reflect well on the \nSenate and the nation for generations to come.\n  In my view, this case does not involve efforts to subvert the \nConstitution, and the national interest will not be served by removing \nthe President from office.\n  Before turning to the evidence, I want to express my concern with the \nway in which the Articles of Impeachment are written.\n  They do not specify which statements and actions by the President are \nunlawful. Instead, they make general allegations. With this approach, \nwe cannot fulfill our duty to the American people. The American people \nmust know specifically what Presidential conduct justifies overturning \nan election.\n  While the Articles could have been more clearly written, there is a \nmore fundamental problem. There is simply insufficient evidence for a \nvote to convict. Whether you apply the standard of beyond a reasonable \ndoubt, or even the lower standard of clear and convincing evidence, the \nHouse Managers have not proved their case.\n  With regard to Article I, the evidence does not support a charge of \nperjury. The President may have been uncooperative and evasive. He \ncertainly was misleading. But he never committed perjury as that term \nis defined in the law. Consequently, the President should be acquitted \non Article I.\n  There is also insufficient evidence to convict the President on \nArticle II, which charges him with obstruction of justice. The main \nproblem with this Article is that testimony from the principal \nwitnesses do not support the allegations. Monica Lewinsky, Betty \nCurrie, and Vernon Jordan testified that the President did not tamper \nwith witnesses, conceal evidence, or take any other actions that would \nconstitute obstruction of justice. All of the witnesses support the \nPresident's version of events.\n  I realize that some of you may view the evidence differently. But I \nthink we must still consider whether this is an appropriate case for \nthe Senate to use the awesome power of impeachment to overturn a \nnational election.\n  I further ask you to consider the precedent we would set with a \nconviction of this President. We risk making the impeachment power \nanother political weapon to be wielded in partisan battles.\n  Our founding fathers warned against this. In the Federalist Papers, \nNumber 65, Alexander Hamilton noted that the prosecution of impeachable \noffenses would ``connect itself with the pre-existing factions.'' And \nthat this would create ``the greatest danger, that the decision will be \nregulated more by the comparitive strength of parties than by the real \ndemonstrations of innocence or guilt.''\n  Prior to the present case, the House of Representatives had seriously \nconsidered Articles of Impeachment against only two Presidents--Andrew \nJohnson and Richard Nixon. In the more than two hundred years since the \nConstitution was established, the House set the impeachment machinery \nin motion in only two occasions.\n  Today, no one doubts that the serious abuses of our constitutional \nsystem by\n\n[[Page S1507]]\n\nthe Nixon Administration warranted impeachment proceedings. And the \nbipartisan approach of Congress solidified President Nixon's decision \nto resign.\n  But history has not been kind to those who pushed the impeachment of \nPresident Johnson upon the nation. Scholars agree that the charges were \nbaseless--a purely partisan campaign. Indeed, Chief Justice Rehnquist, \nwho has presided so effectively in this case, wrote in his book on \nimpeachment that if the Senate had convicted President Johnson ``a long \nshadow would have been cast over the independence'' of the presidency.\n  So for most of our history, the fears of our founding fathers have \nnot been realized. Congress has not resorted to impeachment even when \nprevious administrations faced far-ranging scandals--the Whiskey Ring \nscandal during the tenure of President Grant; the Teapot Dome scandal \nin the Harding administration.\n  And more recently allegations that Presidents Reagan and Bush were \nnot truthful regarding the Iran-Contra scandal.\n  Historically, Congress has held its hand when circumstances might \nhave warranted a pull of the impeachment lever. But contrast that \nhistory with the circumstances surrounding this case.\n  President Clinton was a defendant in a civil lawsuit. In determining \nwhether that lawsuit should be allowed to go forward while the \nPresident was in office, the Supreme Court of the United States noted \nthat the case involved ``unofficial conduct.'' That case was eventually \ndismissed, and the plaintiff reached a settlement with the President.\n  But with that lawsuit in place, the plaintiff's attorneys had license \nto probe into the President's personal life. The private lives of many \npeople were paraded through the press.\n  And then the Independent Counsel joined the hunt. Although he was \noriginally appointed to investigate a real estate transaction in \nArkansas, and even though he eventually cleared the President of any \nwrongdoing in that matter and other reckless accusations, the \nIndependent Counsel turned his attention to a private affair.\n  I think this background cautions against the use of the awesome and \nirrevocable power of impeachment. Think for a minute about how future \npartisans might proceed. We have a readily accessible legal system. \nAnyone with the filing fee can bring a lawsuit. And our laws provide \ngreat leeway in the discovery process.\n  If we take the wrong path now, we can expect to see future Presidents \nhauled into court. They will be questioned repeatedly, and it will not \nbe hard for skilled attorneys to hurl charges of perjury and \nobstruction of justice. We cannot allow the Presidency to be weakened \nin this way.\n  Once again, we find the wisdom of our founding fathers providing \nguidance.\n  James Wilson, who participated in the Philadelphia Convention at \nwhich the Constitution was drafted, observed that the President is \n``amenable to [the law] in his private character as a citizen, and in \nhis public character by impeachment.''\n  In other words, the legal system, our civil and criminal laws provide \nthe proper venue for a President who has failed in his private \ncharacter.\n  And in this case, the legal system can and will continue to address \nthe President's personal transgressions.\n  The Paula Jones lawsuit has been settled. When he leaves office, the \nPresident could be subject to further prosecution. But there is simply \nno injury to our constitutional system, no aspect of what James Wilson \ncalled the President's public character, which must be remedied through \na Senate conviction under the impeachment power. Of course, I \nunderstand the great pain inflicted by the President's private \ncharacter. As I said earlier, his behavior was reprehensible. He has \nshamed himself, his family, and the nation.\n  And I understand the desire to punish the President for his conduct. \nBut we must remember the many ways in which the President has already \nbeen punished. He has suffered enormous embarrassment and humiliation. \nBeyond that personal pain, he has also been subject to public \ncondemnation. Every Member of Congress is on the record rebuking his \nbehavior.\n  Of course, this may not satisfy some. They may want more punishment. \nBut please remember--the purpose of the impeachment power is not to \npunish. Instead, impeachment serves to protect the nation from corrupt \nofficials.\n  So, to render a proper verdict, we must put aside the powerful desire \nto punish. And I submit that to impeach the President in this case \nwould be a terrible use of the impeachment power, lacking \nproportionality and perspective.\n  Now, we must step back from the partisan precipice. We must not \nweaken the Presidency for future generations. We must reject these \nArticles of Impeachment and help restore the balance of power between \nthe branches of the government.\n  Let us put this matter behind, heal the wounds inflicted by \npartisanship, and rededicate ourselves to the challenges facing our \nnation.\n  Mr. BOND. On Friday, February 12, 1999, I voted to convict President \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton on both counts of the Impeachment Articles \nbrought by the United States House of Representatives charging that he \ncommitted perjury and obstruction of justice. My reasons follow.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n  On January 16, 1998, at the request of the United States Attorney \nGeneral Janet Reno, the three judges of the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit expanded the previously \nentered Order authorizing the Office of Independent Counsel Kenneth W. \nStarr to look into certain matters relating to a lawsuit brought \nagainst President William Jefferson Clinton by former Arkansas state \nemployee Paula Jones alleging sexual harassment. Pursuant to that \nOrder, Ms. Jones' attorneys issued subpoenas for evidence and deposed \nMr. Clinton and others seeking information on a pattern of conduct that \nmight be relevant to the issues in the Jones case.\n  The President denied in a deposition in the Jones case and in a \nforceful statement to the American public that he had sexual relations \nwith ``that woman,'' referring to Monica Lewinsky. Subsequently, \nhowever, Ms. Lewinsky turned over a stained blue dress that she had \nworn in an encounter with the President; a scientific examination \nrevealed that the DNA on the dress was President Clinton's DNA.\n  The Office of Independent Counsel convened a federal grand jury to \nlook into the matter and deposed Mr. Clinton in The White House on \nAugust 17, 1998, about his participation in the Jones lawsuit.\n  The Office of Independent Counsel then referred the matters developed \nin the investigation to the United States House of Representatives, \nwhich on December 19, 1998, voted two Articles of Impeachment against \nMr. Clinton alleging that he committed perjury before the federal grand \njury in four instances and that on seven occasions he had obstructed \njustice by tampering with witnesses and evidence in the Jones case \nproceedings.\n  For the sake of brevity, I shall only cover several of the \nallegations and evaluate the evidence supporting them.\n\n\n                              allegations\n\n  Counsel for the President has admitted that there was an \ninappropriate relationship between the President and Ms. Lewinsky and \nthat they had concocted a cover story to conceal their relationship and \nactivities. On December 17, 1997, at approximately 2 a.m., Mr. Clinton \ntelephoned Ms. Lewinsky after he learned that she had been summoned for \na deposition in the Jones case. According to this testimony he called \nto tell her of the death of the brother of Mr. Clinton's secretary. Ms. \nLewinsky states that he told her about the death of the brother, but \nthat he also reminded her of their cover story and notified her that \nshe was included on the witness list in the Jones case.\n  According to Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, Mr. Clinton further stated \nthat they might be able to avoid her testimony if she executed an \naffidavit. Although Mr. Clinton had also reminded Ms. Lewinsky of her \ncover story, the White House Counsel made much of the fact that Ms. \nLewinsky said that the President did not tell her to file a false \naffidavit and did not link the cover story to the need to file an \naffidavit.\n\n[[Page S1508]]\n\n  I do not believe it is at all inconsistent with a scheme or out of \nthe ordinary to note that the President would not make such a \nconnection. As an experienced attorney, the President would know he \nwould be in grave danger if he ever explicitly asked anyone to file a \nfalse affidavit or to lie under oath. To paraphrase a statement made \nduring the trial by Vernon Jordan, ``He is no fool.'' He would have \nknown that such a statement could be revealed by subsequent judicial \ninquiry.\n  Mr. Clinton did not have to tell Ms. Lewinsky expressly to execute a \nfalse affidavit. She knew that in the absence of contrary instructions \nshe was to continue to follow their story. She was referred by the \nPresident's best-friend Vernon Jordan to an attorney who drafted the \naffidavit for her. The President, through Mr. Jordan, was kept advised \nof the progress of the affidavit.\n  During the time that Mr. Jordan was serving as liaison between the \nattorney and the President in the procuring of the affidavit, he was \nalso pursuing a job search for Ms. Lewinsky, which he admitted was \nunder his control.\n  The President's lawyer was presented the affidavit and offered it \ninto the evidence when the President was summoned before federal judge \nSusan Webber Wright to participate in the deposition on January 17, \n1998, by the Jones attorneys. The President's attorney, Mr. Bennett, \nreferred to the deposition in evidence and stated that it showed that \nthere ``is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form'' \nwith Mr. Clinton. Mr. Bennett further stated, ``In preparation of the \nwitness for this deposition, the witness (Mr. Clinton) is fully aware \nof Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, for I have not told him a single thing he \ndoesn't know  * * * '' (Clinton deposition transcript, Evidentiary \nRecord, Vol. XIV, at p. 23.) Although the videotape of the deposition \nshowed the President looking in the direction of the attorney when the \naffidavit was presented, Mr. Clinton subsequently stated that he was \nnot paying attention and had no knowledge of the representations made \nby his attorney about the affidavit.\n\n  I believe that to be totally incredible.\n  The President had known that Ms. Lewinsky would be a prime subject of \nthe deposition and he had asked Ms. Lewinsky to file an affidavit and \ntook steps to be kept advised of the progress of that affidavit. \nSubsequent events showed that his attorney, Mr. Bennett did not at the \ntime know the falsity of the affidavit and that Mr. Clinton was \napparently the only one at the deposition who was fully aware of the \nfraud that was being perpetrated on the court.\n  When Mr. Bennett later learned the falsity of the affidavit, he did \nwhat any attorney hates to do and that is to advise the court that he \nprovided false information. He asked that the affidavit and his \ncharacterization of it be disregarded.\n  I believe Mr. Clinton encouraged the execution of a false affidavit, \nsecured job assistance to help prevent truthful testimony, and allowed \nhis attorney to make false statements as alleged in Article II, \nparagraphs 1, 4, and 5.\n  When Mr. Clinton testified before the federal grand jury on August \n17, 1998, he was asked:\n\n       A. If he misled Judge Wright in some way then you would \n     have corrected the record and said, excuse me Mr. Bennett, I \n     think the judge is getting a mis-impression by what you are \n     saying?\n       A. . . . I wasn't even paying much attention to this \n     conversation.\n       Q. Do you believe, Mr. President, that you have an \n     obligation to make sure that the presiding federal judge was \n     on board and had the correct facts?\n       A. I don't believe I ever even focused on what Mr. Bennett \n     said in the exact words he did until I started reading this \n     transcript carefully for this deposition.--(Deposition of \n     President Clinton, page 30, lines 2-5.)\n  I therefore believe he provided perjurious, false and misleading \ntestimony to the Federal grand jury concerning statements he allowed \nhis attorney to make to a federal judge as alleged in Article I, \nparagraph 3.\n  On December 28, 1997, the President met in his White House office \nwith Ms. Lewinsky and exchanged gifts. During the course of the \nconversation Ms. Lewinsky raised the question of what to do with other \ngifts he had provided her and which had been subpoenaed by the \nattorneys for Paula Jones. According to Ms. Lewinsky, he made no \ndefinitive statement about the gifts.\n  Very shortly thereafter, according to Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, Mr. \nClinton's personal secretary Bettie Currie initiated a series of \ntelephone conversations, in which in effect Ms. Currie communicated to \nMs. Lewinsky that she understood from the President that Ms. Lewinsky \nhad something for her. Pursuant to those telephone calls Ms. Currie \npicked up gifts from Ms. Lewinsky and took them back to Ms. Currie's \napartment where she stored them under her bed.\n  During the course of proceedings in the Senate, Ms. Lewinsky was \nasked in a deposition about these telephone calls and expanded upon her \ntestimony about them. A prior statement by Ms. Currie that Ms. Lewinsky \nhad actually initiated the call was recanted by Ms. Currie, and I \nbelieve the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky is credible. By hiding the gifts \nrather than presenting them to the Jones attorneys pursuant to the \nsubpoena Ms. Lewinsky committed a felonious act and, if Ms. Currie had \nknowledge of the subpoena, she also committed a felonious act of \nconcealing materials covered by a valid subpoena. Mr. Clinton, by \norchestrating, facilitating, and encouraging the suppression of \nevidence under subpoena, also committed a felonious act. I, therefore, \nbelieve that the charge in Article II, paragraph 3, of the Impeachment \nArticles is proven.\n  During the course of his deposition by the Jones attorneys, President \nClinton continued to rely on his cover story and on the perjurious \naffidavit submitted by Ms. Lewinsky. During that deposition he referred \nrepeatedly to Ms. Currie as one who would corroborate the cover story \nwhich he and Ms. Lewinsky had devised. Immediately after his testimony \non Saturday, January 17, 1998, he called Ms. Currie and summoned her to \ncome into his office on a Sunday, January 18, 1998. There he stated \nfive rhetorical questions to Ms. Currie: (1) ``I was never really alone \nwith her . . . right?''; (2) ``You were always there when Monica was \nthere . . . right?''; (3) Monica came to see me and I never touched her \nright . . . right?''; (4) ``She wanted to have sex with me and I can't \ndo that . . . ?''; (5) ``You could see and hear everything . . . \nright?''\n  Each of these statements supported the position taken by the \nPresident in the Jones deposition, but each one of these statements was \nfalse. The President was transmitting to Ms. Currie what he wanted her \nto say should she be called as a witness in this case. For good \nmeasure, he even went back to her a couple of days later and walked her \nthrough the statements again. It is uncontroverted that he made those \nstatements, but he attempted to justify them on the basis that he was \ntrying to refresh his memory.\n  His statements to Ms. Currie on January 18, 1998, and several days \nlater constituted relating a false and misleading account of relevant \nevents to influence corruptly the testimony of a witness in a federal \ncivil rights action as alleged in Article II, paragraph 6, of the \nImpeachment proceedings.\n  Subsequently, he also made statements to his subordinates including \nSidney Blumenthal, John Podesta, and Erskin Bowles. The statements he \nmade to them were also known by him to be false and were designed to \nprovide misleading information through them which could be and \nsubsequently was transmitted under oath in the judicial proceedings by \nthe subordinates.\n  His statements to his subordinates on January 21, 23, and 26, 1998, \nwere false and misleading statements to potential witnesses in a \nfederal grand jury proceeding to influence corruptly the testimony of \nthose witnesses as alleged in Article II, section 7, of the Articles of \nImpeachment.\n  At his federal grand jury testimony on August 17, 1998, Mr. Clinton \nfalsely and corruptly denied he had attempted to influence the \ntestimony of witnesses and impede the discovery of evidence in civil \nrights actions as set out in the analysis above. Thus, the committed \nthe acts as charged in Article I, paragraph 4, the count charging \nperjury. (See Clinton grand jury transcript at 107-08, Evidentiary \nRecord, Vol. III, Part 1 of 2, pp. 559-60.)\n  I believe that the evidence presented on the above charges was clear \nand convincing that the President engaged in a continuing scheme to \nfabricate and establish in federal court proceedings a false story \nabout his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and that\n\n[[Page S1509]]\n\nthrough circumstantial evidence, the direct testimony of Ms. Lewinsky, \nMs. Currie, Mr. Blumenthal, and others, plus the corroborating \nevidence, he was shown to have committed the acts charged.\n  The totality of his actions can be judged in the success with which \nhe maintained his cover story. Had it not been for the DNA on the \nstained dress, there is little likelihood that the false cover story \nwould have been exposed for the lie that it was. In perpetrating that \nfalse and misleading story Mr. Clinton tampered with witnesses, \nobstructing justice in the civil rights lawsuit brought against him by \nPaula Jones. He also falsely misrepresented these acts in testimony \nbefore the grand jury August 17, 1998.\n\n\n                      High Crimes and Misdemeanors\n\n  Having resolved in my mind the question that clear and convincing \nevidence shows that William Jefferson Clinton obstructed justice and \ncommitted perjury before a grand jury, the next issue is whether these \nactivities rise to the level of offenses for which removal from office \nis the appropriate remedy. Defenders of the President have said that no \none would press charges in a case like this, that it was not grave \nenough to merit a criminal proceeding, and that it certainly was not \nsufficient to warrant removing the President from office.\n  With respect to the seriousness of the offense, it is worthy of note \nthat during the year 1997, 182 people were sentenced by federal judges \nfor perjury and another 144 were sentenced for obstruction and witness \ntampering. These prosecutions were brought by Clinton Administration \nappointees and in many instances in front of Clinton-appointed judges.\n  The case of Dr. Barbara Battaglia is particularly compelling. In a \nlaw suit brought by a patient of a Veterans Administration hospital \nalleging sexual harassment, Dr. Battaglia was asked in a deposition if \nshe had had consensual sex with the plaintiff. Her answer to that \nquestion was a simple, ``No.'' When that denial was shown to be a lie, \nshe was convicted of a felony and sentenced to house arrest with an \nelectronic monitoring device. She has lost her ability to practice \nmedicine and also her ability to utilize her law degree to practice \nlaw.\n  The serious nature of these offenses is particularly clear when \nconsidered in the context of the proceedings. The United States Supreme \nCourt had ruled unanimously that Mr. Clinton, as President, had to \nanswer the lawsuit filed by Paula Jones. A federal judge was assigned \nto the suit and presided over the deposition in which Mr. Clinton \ntestified and at which time he and his lawyer presented the false \naffidavit.\n  It is totally inconsistent within the context of this case and the \nsound functioning of the judicial system to say that the Supreme Court \nmeant that Mr. Clinton should respond to these charges but he was not \nbound to respond truthfully. His actions in procuring and using false \naffidavits, causing the hiding of subpoenaed evidence, and tampering \nwith a potential witness by giving false information to use in any \ntestimony effectively denied the plaintiff the civil rights the Supreme \nCourt ruled she had. To say that the acts are not grave, not high-\ncrimes, and not a threat to the judicial system, is untenable. No \nlawyer could make such a statement in open court and not be subjected \nto the loss of a license to practice law.\n\n  Likewise, his lies to a grand jury from his White House office were a \nserious challenge to the administration of justice.\n  Moreover, the debates of the authors of the Constitution showed that \nthey considered obstructing justice would warrant the President's \nimpeachment and conviction. George Mason asked if the President could \nadvise someone to commit a crime and then before an indictment or \nconviction use the power of a pardon to stop inquiry and prevent \ndetection. James Madison responded that, ``If the President be \nconnected, in any suspicious manner, with any person, and there be \ngrounds to believe he will shelter him, the House of Representatives \ncan impeach him.'' (See Elliott, Debates on the Adoption of the Federal \nConstitution, at 498.)\n  Another argument has also been made by the White House counsel and \nsupporters of the President that to remove the President from office on \nimpeachment would be to nullify the election. This argument suggests \nthat impeachment is never an appropriate remedy, provided the President \nis popular and the country is enjoying good times. The Office of the \nPresidency is not so brittle that it would be gravely damaged by \nremoving the current President or any other President. The Founding \nFathers certainly did not envision that impeachment could only apply to \nan unpopular President or one who was leading the country in hard-\ntimes.\n  At the height of a Cold War with United States forces engaged in \nVietnam, impeachment proceedings against President Richard M. Nixon \nforced him to leave office. The country was not wounded, it did not \nlose its way; Vice President Gerald Ford assumed the Presidency and \ncontinued the course of government. In this case, Vice President Al \nGore would assume office and would be expected to continue the policies \nof the Clinton Administration.\n  The United States Senate in recent years did not shirk from driving \nfrom office a colleague accused of obstructing justice in a sexual \nharassment case. No one objected that we had ``nullified'' the votes of \nthe citizens of his state.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that the President has been so \nstrong and forceful in foreign policy and conducted such wise relations \nwith other nations that we could not afford to lose him. That argument, \ntoo, smacks of a referendum on the President's conduct of office, not a \njudgment on his wrongful acts. If we were to judge impeachment on the \nbasis of the policies of the President, then impeachment could always \nbe expected to be purely a partisan matter turning on the approval or \ndisapproval of formulation or implementation of policy by \nthe President. The framers rightfully dismissed any option that the \nproper or improper administration of the regular powers of the \nPresident would be involved in a decision on impeachment, either \npositively or negatively.\n\n  In addition, we have the precedents set by the removal by the Senate \nof judges who have been found to have committed perjury. During my \ntenure in the Senate we have twice removed judges for committing \nperjury because of the serious adverse impact jerjury has on our \njudicial system. If a judge is removable for committing the significant \nact of perjury, can the one who appoints the judge be held to a lower \nstandard?\n  The President not only appoints the judges, he appoints the Attorney \nGeneral, the United States Attorneys, and the Supreme Court Justices. \nCertainly we should impose no lower standard on the person with the \nultimate responsibility for the proper administration of justice than \non those he appoints.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  It is precisely in good times, with the President high in the polls, \nthat it is incumbent upon the Senate to exercise very thoroughly and \ncarefully the responsibility under the Constitution to make the \ndifficult decision on whether the President has committed high-crimes \nand misdemeanors warranting his removal from office. If we are to have \na government of laws and not of men and not of public opinion polls, \nthen we must judge the President on the evidence presented to us. I \nbelieve that the acts that he committed constitute high-crimes and \nmisdemeanors warranting his conviction.\n  I should note that the Senate made a serious mistake in beginning the \nproceedings by limiting the ability of the House Managers to call \nwitnesses. The absence of witnesses to testify to the acts alleged as \nthe basis of impeachment charges significantly impeded the progress \ntoward resolving the allegations against the President. I trust that \nthe Senate will not make the same mistake in future impeachment \nproceedings.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. Chief Justice, colleagues, sitting in judgment of the \nPresident of the United States is not easy for any of us. It is \nparticularly difficult for me because of the personal and political \nrelationship I have had with this President over the last 20 years. We \nserved together as Governors in the early eighties, as several of you \ndid. We traveled together on foreign trade missions. We shared similar \npriorities for our States. At my urging, he\n\n[[Page S1510]]\n\njoined the fledgling Democratic Leadership Council, which would later \nbecome an intellectual and organizational resource for his Presidential \ncampaign.\n  From our earliest meetings, I recognized in him, as many of you have \nrecognized, gifts of head and heart and a truly extraordinary range of \npolitical and communication skills that marked him with a potential for \ngreatness. It was not as a friend, however, but as a U.S. Senator that \nI took an oath to render impartial justice under the Constitution in \nthis impeachment trial. I was fully prepared to convict and remove the \nPresident from office if I concluded that the articles charged met the \ntest of high crimes and misdemeanors as envisioned by the framers of \nour Constitution, and if the evidence convinced me of his guilt beyond \nany reasonable doubt. That is the standard I would require to remove \nthis President or any President from office.\n  As we wrestle with the decisions before us today, I believe that it \nis incumbent upon us to reflect on the consequence of these decisions \ntomorrow; for while this trial is about this President, it is also \nabout the future of this Republic. We simply cannot escape the fact \nthat what we do today will affect the strength and stability of our \nNation because the actions we take, the precedent we set, directly \naffects the separation of powers and the independence of the Presidency \nas an institution.\n  The writings of the framers and the overwhelming consensus of the \nscholarship that has followed demonstrate that the mechanism for \nremoving a President was central to maintaining the delicate balance of \npower among the three branches of Government. The Founding Fathers \nstruggled to resolve the tension between making it too difficult to \nremove a President, thereby creating a king, and making it too easy, \nthereby creating a weak Chief Executive who would serve at the pleasure \nof the legislature. As more than 400 scholars concluded last November, \nthe lower the threshold for impeachment, the weaker the President.\n  The resolution of this dilemma--where to set the standard for \nremoval--occupied the brilliant minds of several Virginians who took \npart in our constitutional debates two centuries ago. When George Mason \noffered specific language to define an impeachment standard, James \nMadison worried about making the standard too low. In worrying, he \nreplied that so vague a term would be equivalent to a tenure at the \npleasure of the Senate. After much deliberation, our founders finally \nagreed that the President should be removed only for committing \ntreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors against the \nUnited States. Thereafter, as we all know, a Committee on Style, which \nhad no authority to make substantive changes, dropped the last four \nwords, considering them redundant.\n  Alexander Hamilton defined impeachable activities as those that \nrelate chiefly to the injuries done immediately to society itself. \nDuring the debate, Edmund Randolph, a Virginia Governor, reflected \nconcerns. He stated that the Executive will have great opportunities of \nabusing his power, particularly in time of war when the military force \nand, in some respects, the public's money will be in his hands. \nClearly, our founders created impeachment not to punish the President, \nbut to protect the Republic. They had lived under a king and they \ndidn't want another.\n  History and common sense tell us, therefore, that the threshold for \nimpeachment should be high--very high. It should be difficult, not \neasy, to impeach a President of the United States because impeachment \nis the ultimate sanction for protecting the Republic. It is a weapon to \nbe respected and feared, but wielded only under the most compelling \ncircumstances. Similarly, history and common sense tell us that \nremoving a President is not the same as removing a Federal judge. In \nJames Madison's records of the debate at the Federal Constitution, he \nwrote, ``The judiciary hold their places not for a limited time, but \nduring good behavior.'' The Executive was to hold his place for a \nlimited term, like the members of the legislature.\n  Like them--particularly the Senate, whose Members would continue in \nappointment in the same term of 6 years--he would periodically be tried \nfor his behavior by his electors, who would continue or discontinue him \nin trust, according to the manner in which he had discharged it. \nLikewise, removing a President is not the same as removing a member of \nthe Armed Forces for violating the military code of conduct. The \nUniform Code of Military Justice is required to maintain the good order \nand discipline for waging war and securing peace. And all of us who \nhave served in the Armed Forces understood that we swore an oath to \nobey a code not required of any civilian, even those with the power to \nsend us into harm's way--a civilian Commander in Chief, our Secretary \nof Defense, and Members of Congress.\n  Finally, removing a President is not the same as punishing a citizen \nin a court of law. Like any citizen, a President can be fully punished \nin court after he leaves office, and the failure to convict him in an \nimpeachment trial in no way precludes a subsequent criminal \nprosecution.\n  If a President is subject to the law, then he is clearly not above \nit, as some have claimed.\n  Some also argued that since the President's oath requires him to \nfaithfully execute the laws, any violation of those laws should thereby \nwarrant his removal from office. While that argument may be appealing, \nit simply was not the standard adopted by the framers. Their standard \nwas narrowly confined to treason, bribery, or other high crimes or \nmisdemeanors. And it is against this standard that we are called upon \nto judge the conduct of this President.\n  I believe the President lied. When he came before the television \ncameras and addressed the American people, wagging his finger and \ndenying that he had sexual relations with a subordinate employee, he \nlied. This offensive public conduct, which has caused me the greatest \npersonal anguish, is an act that will be forever seared into our \nNation's memory. His deception was calculated, politically motivated, \nand directed at each and every one of us.\n  Though clearly reprehensible, this lie did not violate any law and \nwas not the subject of any article of impeachment. So, while I am \nconvinced that the President lied to us, I am not convinced beyond a \nreasonable doubt that he lied to the grand jury, which is the sole \nbasis for the first of the two impeachment articles.\n  Despite the apparent strength of the evidence, the House of \nRepresentatives defeated an article alleging perjury in the President's \ncivil deposition. They voted to impeach the President for perjury based \nsolely on his testimony before the grand jury. Article I alleges that \nthe President willfully provided perjurious, false, and misleading \ntestimony to the grand jury.\n  I listened intently to the arguments presented by both sides, and I \nhave read the President's grand jury testimony carefully. In my \njudgment, the President's grand jury testimony ultimately boiled down \nto a few irreconcilable discrepancies, and while often slippery, hair-\nsplitting, legalistic, and, in the words of the President's counsel, \n``maddening,'' was not perjurious beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  On article I, therefore, I will vote not guilty.\n  Article II alleges obstruction of justice, a crime difficult to prove \nbecause it requires a determination beyond a reasonable doubt about \nwhat a person intended by his words or deeds.\n  In this case, it is extremely difficult to determine whether the \nPresident's intentions were to obstruct justice in a civil or a \ncriminal proceeding, or whether his intention was to mislead his family \nand the Nation about an embarrassing personal relationship. While his \nintent is difficult to prove, the unconstitutional bundling of charges \ncontained in article II is clear to me.\n\n  Article I, section 3, of the Constitution clearly requires that in an \nimpeachment trial no person shall be convicted without the concurrence \nof two-thirds of the Members present. The rule of law requires \nconcurrence by two-thirds.\n  While article I, in my judgment, violates this constitutional \nrequirement, at least it focuses on a single event. Article II is \nflagrantly worse. Drafted in the disjunctive and containing 7 subparts \neach alleging a separate act of obstruction of justice, the bundling of \nthese allegations would allow removal\n\n[[Page S1511]]\n\nof the President if only 10 Senators agreed on each of the 7 separate \nsubparts. If, for example, 10 Senators voted to convict based solely on \nsubpart 1 and a different group of 10 Senators voted to convict based \non subpart 2, and so on, it would be possible to reach a total of 70 \nvotes for conviction. But that total would not have been reached with a \ntwo-thirds concurrence on any individual subpart.\n  Such a pleading is not allowed under the Federal Rules of Criminal \nProcedure and would be thrown out by every Federal court in the land. \nSurely the founders did not envision removing a President from office \nif no more than 10 Senators could agree on a given allegation.\n  Trying to justify this unconstitutional bundling by citing a similar \napproach in the Richard Nixon case is weak because the Nixon charges \nwere not presented to the Senate. Trying to justify this \nunconstitutional bundling by citing the Senate impeachment rules is no \nmore compelling since our rules cannot conflict with the Constitution. \nWe simply cannot remove a President from office with an article of \nimpeachment that so clearly violates constitutional standards that we \nare required by law to follow.\n  On article II, therefore, I will vote not guilty.\n  Thus, I will vote not to convict on both articles because the \nfactual, legal, and constitutional standard for removal was not met.\n  I am not prepared to say, however, that perjury and obstruction of \njustice are not impeachable offenses, because I believe it would be a \nmistake to attempt to do that which the founders chose not to do--to \ndefine what is impeachable with specificity.\n  For impeachment to remain what our forefathers intended it to be--a \ndeterrent to misconduct and a means to protect the Republic--future \ngenerations should be free in each case to examine the facts, apply the \nlaw, and follow the Constitution and to render impartial justice. That \nis the impeachment process we have inherited from those who came before \nus, and that is the precedent we bequeath to the ongoing chronicles of \nAmerican history.\n  The legacy of this trial, I believe, is not what becomes of one man. \nThis trial is larger than one man. The legacy of this trial is that the \nSenate, sitting as a Court of Impeachment, proved worthy of the faith \nof our founders to render justice.\n  No matter what judgment is rendered, however, this trial cannot \nexonerate the President. A vote against conviction is not a vote to \ncondone his lying to the American people, nor does it suggest that any \nMember of the U.S. Senate believes that perjury or obstruction of \njustice charges are anything but serious. They are very serious \ncharges.\n  Sadly, the vote we are poised to take on these charges has divided \nour Nation. In the eyes of too many of our citizens, this vote will \nrepresent either a nonmilitary coup attempt against a duly elected \nPresident or a victory for those bent on accelerating the moral decline \nof the Nation. In truth, this vote represents neither. A vote for \nacquittal indicates nothing more and nothing less than what it says. \nThe case to remove the President from office was not proven.\n  We sit in judgment today not because we are free from human \nfailings--I certainly have my share--but because our forefathers \nbestowed upon the Senate the responsibility of protecting the Republic \nby judging the President when articles of impeachment are exhibited by \nthe House of Representatives. In doing so, they carefully and \ndeliberately limited the scope of our judgment.\n  We are judging the President in his capacity as President, and we are \ncalled upon to decide only one issue--whether he should be removed from \noffice. The Senate does not have the duty nor the capacity to rule on \nthe broader character of the President. In our limited role, we are not \ncalled upon to judge him as husband and father, for that is the \nprovince of his family. We are not called upon to judge him as accused \ncitizen, for that is the province of the courts. We are not called upon \nto judge him as sinner, for that is the province of God. And we are not \ncalled upon to judge his legacy, for that is the province of history.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. Chief Justice, thank you for your dignity. And to \nboth our leaders, thank you for your patience.\n  Colleagues, I will vote to acquit the President, and it is not \nbecause his poll numbers are high or because the economy is good. And \nit is not because Bill Clinton is a Democrat.\n  When I was in the House of Representatives, an impeachment resolution \nwas filed against Republican President Ronald Reagan--an impeachment \nresolution because of Iran-Contra, which involved selling arms to a \nterrorist nation with the proceeds going to the Nicaraguan contras. \nThis was against the law of the United States of America--against the \nlaw--against the rule of law.\n  I voted for that law, but I never went on that impeachment resolution \nagainst Ronald Reagan because I felt it would have hurt the country and \nbecause there was no bipartisan support for it.\n  I think the same should be said of this impeachment. There is no \nbipartisan support for it and the President's removal would hurt the \ncountry.\n  One more preface: It has been said that what the President did in \nthis case was worse than what Senator Packwood did.\n  In this case, we have a consensual affair, wanted by both parties. It \nwas irresponsible and indefensible: a young woman, a relationship wrong \nin every way, a president trying desperately to hide the affair.\n  The young woman was secretly tape recorded and forced to testify. Her \nmother was forced to testify.\n  The more than 20 women who complained about Senator Packwood alleged \nforced sexual misconduct against them. One victim was 17 years old. \nThey wanted to tell their stories.\n  So each of us can decide for himself or herself the relationship of \none case to the other. But surely that is not the issue before us.\n  Neither is the Paula Jones case, which was thrown out of court by a \nRepublican female judge who ruled that there was no sexual harassment \nby the President. Testimony about a consensual sexual affair was \nimmaterial.\n  Yes, the case was later settled, but that doesn't change its history: \nno sexual harassment, determined by a Republican female judge.\n  So, Senator Packwood is not before us, nor is Paula Jones. What is \nbefore us is the sanctity of the Constitution.\n  Let me now offer an apology to my constituents for voting in favor of \nthe Independent Counsel Law in its current form--a law that has given \none person an unlimited budget, unlimited scope, unlimited time and an \nunlimited ability to hurt people, and to hurt them badly.\n  The Senate is now sitting as a court of impeachment, primarily \nbecause, for over four years, we had an Independent Counsel spending \nmore than $42 million searching for an impeachable offense.\n  And while I condemn the President's behavior, it was no excuse for \nthe Ken Starr witchhunt, which went from a real estate deal, to several \nother fruitless investigations, to a sex deal built around illegally \nrecorded phone conversations with someone named Linda Tripp. Linda \nTripp, who says she's like all of us. Heaven help us if all of us act \nlike Linda Tripp, secretly recording our dear friends. What a country \nthis would be!\n  I also want to comment on one other matter which is personal to me, \nand that is my daughter's family connection to the First Lady.\n  While none of my Senate colleagues questioned the propriety of my \nparticipation in the impeachment matter--for which I thank you all--I \nwas the target of a barrage or questions by the media and others \noutside this body.\n  I just want to say that yes, my daughter is married to the First \nLady's brother, a brother who loves and admires his sister and doesn't \nwant to see her hurt. So, I am far from being a defender of the \nPresident's behavior.\n  But I am a fierce defender of our Constitution.\n  That is why I have joined a small number of senators, led by the \ndistinguished senator from West Virginia, in fighting amendments to \nthat precious document.\n  Believe me, being against the line-item veto and the balanced budget \namendment were not popular positions in my state; my positions made my \nreelection tougher. But I have never\n\n[[Page S1512]]\n\ndoubted that defending the Constitution is worth risking my Senate \nseat, which I cherish so much.\n  And it is because of my deep reverence for the Constitution that I \nbelieve we must reject the articles of impeachment before us today.\n  Why? Because the high crimes and misdemeanors constitutional \nrequirement for removal has not been met--not even close.\n  The Constitution does not say remove the President if he fails to be \na role model for our children. It does not say remove the President if \nhe violates the military code of conduct, or the Senate Ethics Code. It \ndoes not say remove the President if he brings pain to his family.\n  It says very clearly that the President shall be impeached and \nremoved from office only for committing treason, bribery or other high \ncrimes and misdemeanors.\n  In his Commentaries on the Constitution, Justice Joseph Story \nendorsed the view that ``those offenses which may be committed equally \nby a private person as a public officer are not the subject of \nimpeachment.'' This means that presidential impeachable offenses are, \ngenerally, acts which could not be done by anyone other than the \npresident.\n  Impeachment and removal from office was not meant to be a punishment \nof the President, but rather a protection of the country from a tyrant \nwho would use his or her power against the people and the Constitution.\n  This President is not a tyrant who is threatening our democracy and \nfreedom or the delicate balance of powers set up by our Constitution. \nSo the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' standard established by the \nConstitution has not been met in my view.\n  We must also reject these articles because there is every reason to \ndoubt the House managers' case on perjury and obstruction of justice. \nThey have presented not one shred of direct evidence for their claims, \nand the details of their circumstantial case have been decimated in \nmany respects. As one manager said on national television, he couldn't \nwin the case in a court of law as it was presented in the House.\n  I don't see how the case was strengthened in the Senate. In fact, I \nbelieve that it was weakened in the Senate.\n  When you have clear statements by Monica Lewinsky that the President \nnever, ever told her to hide gifts and never discussed the contents of \nher affidavit--when you have Betty Currie saying she never felt \nintimated by the President and Vernon Jordan saying the job search was \nnever connected to anything else--it seems to me there is substantial \ndoubt on both counts.\n  That leads to another point. Rejecting these articles of impeachment \ndoes not place this President above the law. As the Constitution \nclearly says, he remains subject to the laws of the land just like any \nother citizen of the United States.\n  As Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution says, the President \n``shall . . . be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and \nPunishment, according to Law.'' So it should be a comfort to those who \nbelieve the President committed crimes surrounding his affair that the \nPresident, indeed, is subject to the rule of law--our Founders made \nthat certain.\n  At this point, I want to thank Senator Tom Harkin for his challenge \nto the House Managers that the Senate is not a jury. In so ruling, \nChief Justice Rehnquist, in my view, gave us the charge to look at the \nbig picture, and that is very important.\n  Part of that picture is how the House of Representatives acted in \nthis matter. I served in the House for ten years, and I never saw the \nminority party denied a vote on an alternative of their choosing in an \nimportant matter. Yet Democrats and moderate Republicans were denied a \nvote on censure, and I believe this was a disaster for democracy in \nthat body.\n  Listen to what a Republican House Member who voted against \nimpeachment wrote to a constituent:\n\n       I regret that Congressional Republicans were so blinded by \n     their opposition to President Clinton that they voted to \n     impeach him rather than stand by the traditional principles \n     of their Party. I also regret that threats were made against \n     me by the Republican leadership in an attempt to keep me from \n     voting my conscience.\n\n  Those are the words of one of the five brave Republicans who voted \nagainst impeachment in the House. To me that speaks volumes about the \nkind of illegitimate process that got us here, and I believe in my \nheart that history will judge the House proceedings very harshly.\n  But I believe that the Senate, if it rejects the articles in a \nbipartisan way, will be viewed in a better light, and history will say \nthat in 1999 the Senate decided that impeachment should not be used by \none party to overturn the results of a presidential election that it \ndid not like.\n  As Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote of the Senate acquittal of President \nAndrew Johnson in 1868:\n\n       The importance of the acquittal can hardly be overstated. \n     With respect to the chief executive, it has meant that as to \n     the policies he sought to pursue, he would be answerable only \n     to the country as a whole in the quadrennial presidential \n     elections, and not to Congress through the process of \n     impeachment.\n\n  If I may, Mr. Chief Justice, I understand from your wise words that \nthe President does not and should not serve at the pleasure of the \nHouse and Senate.\n  The Senate did the right thing in 1868--and by its decision not to \nremove the President, it brought stability to our nation. We should do \nno less now.\n  Voting against the articles of impeachment is the right thing to do \nto keep faith with our Constitution and to keep faith with our \ndemocracy for generations to come.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. Chief Justice, today the Senate finds itself at an \nunlikely crossroads in American history. We have assembled as a court \nof impeachment to sit in judgement of our President, William Jefferson \nClinton, on the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. We have \nworked our will in this matter according to a process rooted in English \ncommon law, written by our Founders into the Constitution, and \nexercised against the Chief Executive only once before in American \nhistory.\n  This is not a task to be taken lightly, and we have not arrived \neasily at our decision. The Senate today is engaged in weighty \nstruggles that go to the very heart of our private and public lives. We \nare at an unlikely juncture between principle and public opinion, \nrepentance and the rule of law, perception and punishment, forgiveness \nand findings of fact. These are difficult issues, Mr. Chief Justice. We \napproach our task fully aware that our decisions today will reverberate \nacross this great land and throughout the length and breadth of \nhistory.\n  There has been much discussion about how we got here. And while the \nanswer to that question may be varied in all its permutations, then \namplified in the echo-chamber that is our modern public debate, it can \nbe said with assurance that this whole unseemly business began when the \nPresident, caught in an improper private act, took deliberate steps to \nconceal it. And for all the other parties blamed for our presence here \ntoday--the media, the independent counsel, the political factions \nopposed to the President, the House of Representatives--it must be \nclearly understood that this process began with the deliberate and \nwilful acts of the President of the United States to lie in a Supreme \nCourt sanctioned civil rights inquiry and obstruct the due course of \njustice. It all started with the high-handed disregard for the law \nexhibited by the nation's Chief Executive. It ends today.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, when the sound and fury of the moment has passed, \nand this episode can be observed with the objectivity that comes with \nthe passage of time, I believe it will be self-evident that we have \nfollowed the Constitution to the best of our abilities. In a free, \ndemocratic society such as ours, the foundation of freedom is an \nindependent judiciary, the rule of law, and most importantly the \nConstitution. Our Constitution is the framework for American society, \nand I have been constantly reminded throughout these proceedings of the \nimportance of our duty to honor the dignity of this document.\n  The magnitude of this undertaking deserves no less than a sincerity \nof purpose and an absolute confidence in the wisdom of our Founders. \nThe American people should not be swayed by those who argue the \nprominence of this case--in all its tawdry and unseemly detail--has \nmade unnecessary a thorough process of determining the truth.\n\n[[Page S1513]]\n\n We stand in judgement of the President. Our decisions will be \nremembered throughout history. Our precedent may be followed by future \nSenates. Yet, still we have heard throughout this exercise the \nunfortunate call to end these proceedings, save a few weeks, and inject \nthe politics of expediency into a monumental Constitutional \nundertaking. I find these arguments display a remarkable lack of \nconfidence in the sound and just system outlined by our Founders to \naddress very serious charges levied against the President of the United \nStates.\n  I am grateful the Senate rejected those calls and put in place a \nresponsible mechanism for the thorough airing of fact and argument. I \nam confident our process during this trial, though far from perfect, \nwas appropriate. We allowed time for detailed presentations on the part \nof the House of Representatives and the President. We held an extensive \nquestion-and-answer session to review and clarify matters presented by \nboth sides. And we have allowed for the appropriate and necessary \ndeposition of key witnesses. Unfortunately, the simple fact is that the \noutcome of this matter was, in many minds, predetermined. In spite of \nthis, the integrity of the process was, time and again, fought for and \nprotected. Now--today-- it only remains for us to cast our votes.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n  I wish to address my remarks not so much to the people listening in \nthis room today, but rather to those future generations who will look \nback at the record and transcripts for guidance, direction, and a more \nthorough understanding of the process that played out in this chamber \nduring the first two months of 1999. I mentioned earlier the \nsignificance of the Constitution. I cannot stress enough the essential \nrole that this historical document has played in the trial of William \nJefferson Clinton. This document laid the framework for what has taken \nplace. Be it understood, the Senate tried the President because the \nConstitution requires that we do so. There is no exception for popular \nPresidents, such as William Jefferson Clinton. The Constitution \nprovides for this process to be applied to everyone evenhandedly.\n  Although the trial of this President was not a trial in the \ntraditional sense, it is important to note that if the impeachment of a \nPresident presents itself again, there is nothing restricting a more \ntraditional trial from occurring. In fact, I would encourage future \nSenates to utilize a judicial proceeding more closely aligned to a \ntypical courtroom trial. Every impeachment trial will have its own \ndynamic environment, determined by the political and social context in \nwhich it occurs. The trial of William Jefferson Clinton occurred in a \nprosperous time. The citizens of this nation are largely satisfied, the \nPresident enjoys consistently high approval ratings, and the economy is \noutstanding. Impeaching and then trying the President has not \nengendered popular public support. I make these observations for future \ngenerations who reflect on this process simply to explain the mood of \nour nation and the political environment in which this proceeding \noccurred. As a result, we should not deceive ourselves into believing \nthat public opinion did not impact this process. I would like to \nbelieve, however, that the competing demands of expediting the process \nversus honoring our Constitutional duties created a struggle that \nproduced the most fair trial possible under the circumstances. \nAccordingly, the process we followed and the rules complied with may \nnot be appropriate for the next trial. The decisions made in this \nenvironment should not be considered to set precedent that is \ninflexible. In fact, the precedent we set deserves thoughtful \nconsideration and reasoned critique when reflected upon in the years \nand decades to come.\n\n  In that light, our official duties in this matter began on December \n19, 1998, when the United States House of Representatives impeached the \nPresident, William Jefferson Clinton. After listening to the evidence, \nreading the trial memorandums and the record, and carefully considering \nthe arguments presented by both the House Managers and White House \ncounsel, I believe the President is guilty of both articles.\n  Before I address the merits of the case against the President, I \nthink it is necessary to discuss whether the crimes of perjury and \nobstruction of justice constitute high crimes and misdemeanors as \ncontemplated by the Framers of our Constitution. This topic has been \nthe subject of much controversy in the past months.\n  It is true that private acts are the genesis of the matter before us. \nHad the acts stayed private, we would not be here today. The President, \nhowever, brought these private acts under our public purview and \ncreated a matter of public concern when he used his position and his \npower to deny and obstruct the civil rights of Paula Jones.\n  Contrary to what has been asserted, this is not just a case about a \nsexual encounter between the President and a young White House intern. \nThis instead is a case about depriving Paula Jones, an individual who \nsought and was granted the right to file a civil rights action against \nthe President, of her constitutional right to a day in court, a right \nwhich nine justices of the Supreme Court unanimously decided that she \ndeserved. And--almost unbelievably--on the heels of this Supreme Court \nmandate, the President seemed to strengthen his efforts to deny Paula \nJones' civil rights. Once these acts moved into the public arena, \nforming the basis for charges as serious as perjury and obstruction of \njustice, it is my opinion these acts became high crimes and \nmisdemeanors as envisioned by our Founders. While our only precedent \ninvolves the impeachments of federal judges, I am satisfied the \nstandards used in these cases also apply to the charges levied against \nthe President.\n  The President of the United States is the head of the Executive \nBranch and the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of this nation. When the \nFounding Fathers established our tripartite system of government, it \nwas decided that the three branches of government would operate as \nchecks and balances on one another. As a result, no branch would be \nmore powerful than the other. This structure is at the very core of our \nsuccess as a Republic.\n  By obstructing justice and lying under oath, William Jefferson \nClinton violated his duty as Chief Law Enforcement Officer, \ndisrespected the Judicial Branch of the government, and undermined the \nfoundations of our judicial system's truth-seeking process. If I were \nto determine that the President's actions did not constitute high \ncrimes and misdemeanors, I would be asserting that the Executive Branch \nand the Office of the Presidency are more important than the Judicial \nBranch, and that the President of the United States is not obligated to \nabide by the rule of law. As a citizen and as a Senator, I cannot, in \ngood faith, ignore the separation of powers argument. In my view, the \nPresident's conduct was in violation of the rule of law and his actions \nhave betrayed the trust of the people of the United States. It is my \nfirm belief that the serious offenses committed by William Jefferson \nClinton are high crimes and misdemeanors and warrant impeachment, \nconviction, and removal from office.\n  Amazingly, we continue to hear the argument that although the \nPresident's actions rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors, \nhe should not be removed from office. The Constitution provides if a \nPresident is found guilty of high crimes, then he is automatically \nremoved from office. Our Constitution does not allow for finding the \nPresident guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors, and then permitting \nhim to stay in office. Only an amendment to the Constitution would make \nsuch a step permissible.\n  There were several points during the trial of the President when I \nhad a visceral reaction to certain charges raised by the House \nManagers. This reaction occurred, each time, at precisely the point \nwhen the Managers discussed the President's strategy to attack the \ncharacter of Monica Lewinsky, Kathleen Willey and others. The callous \ndisregard for the soul of another human being and the unsympathetic \nwounding of the character of another carried out by the President using \nthe apparatus of the Presidency is chilling and deserves condemnation \nby those who cherish freedom.\n\n  Before I proceed to my view of the specific articles, it may help to \nexplain that I approach this process unencumbered by a law degree. \nWhile that in no way gives me license to disregard the legal aspects of \nthe matter\n\n[[Page S1514]]\n\nbefore me, it does permit me to translate legal concepts into layman's \nterms. As I worked my way through the voluminous record and sat through \ndays of the trial, I found it easiest to understand this case if I \napproached it in chronological order. Given that, I will discuss the \nObstruction of Justice count first, because in the course of this \ntragic series of events, I believe the President started down this \nslippery slope by the actions he took, as opposed to the words he \nspoke. Sadly, the words, uttered under an oath to tell the truth, came \nlater.\n\n\n                         Obstruction of Justice\n\n  I view obstruction of justice, in its most simple terms, as actions \nthat somehow interfere with the fact-finding or truth-seeking mission \nof a lawsuit. The record before us is replete with examples which, in \nmy opinion, prove that the President of the United States intended to, \nand did in fact, obstruct justice. Specifically, I believe the \nPresident obstructed justice by corruptly engaging in, encouraging, and \nsupporting a scheme to conceal evidence that had been subpoenaed in the \nJones case; by encouraging Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in \nthe Jones case; by allowing his attorney to make false and misleading \nstatements to a federal court judge; by relating false and misleading \nstatements to Ms. Currie and presidential aides in order to influence \ntheir testimony; and by intensifying and succeeding in an effort to \nsecure job assistance for Ms. Lewinsky in order to encourage her to \ntestify favorably toward the President in the Jones case.\n  I believe the first example of obstruction occurred when the \nPresident was issued a subpoena in the Paula Jones case. This case was \na federal civil rights action in which the President was sued for \nsexual harassment, hostile work environment harassment, and intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress. As part of the discovery process in \nthe Jones case, subpoenas were issued to several former state and \nfederal employees suspected of having sexual relations with the \nPresident. Included in these was a subpoena which requested the \nPresident to produce the gifts he had received from Monica Lewinsky. \nThis request was denied by the President on five different occasions, \nas ultimately five separate subpoenas were issued. As a last resort, \nJudge Wright granted Paula Jones' motion to compel the President to \nproduce gifts. The President, however, still did not turn over the \ngifts and instead replied that he had none. The President's \nunwillingness to comply is ironic given that later--in his grand jury \ntestimony--he stated that he receives and gives hundreds of gifts a \nyear, and that the whole gift-giving concept is inconsequential to him. \nThe President's behavior belies his testimony.\n  The gift concealment continued beyond the President refusing to turn \nover the presents Ms. Lewinsky gave him. Ms. Lewinsky was also \nsubpoenaed in the Jones case and was asked to turn over gifts the \nPresident had given to her. According to Ms. Lewinsky, when she \nsuggested to the President that the gifts be hidden, he responded that \nhe would have to ``think about it.'' I am aware that the record does \nnot reflect a specific directive by the President to Ms. Lewinsky to \nhide the gifts. My reading of the record and my interpretation of the \nevidence, however, leads me to the inescapable conclusion that the \nChief Law Enforcement Officer of the country, and a well-educated \nlawyer to boot, did not fulfill his duty to turn gifts over himself and \ndid not abide by his duty again when Ms. Lewinsky asked him what she \nshould do with her gifts.\n  There is some confusion over exactly how the President's secretary, \nMs. Currie, came to be in possession of the gifts that the President \ngave Ms. Lewinsky. I find it compelling, however, that when the \nPresident and Ms. Lewinsky met on the morning of December 28, Ms. \nLewinsky suggested that the gifts the President had given to her should \nbe hidden. A few hours later phone calls were made from Ms. Currie to \nMs. Lewinsky. On that same afternoon, Ms. Currie arrived at Ms. \nLewinsky's residence to pick up the gifts, and ultimately, the gifts \nwere found under Ms. Currie's bed. In my view, this is sufficient \nevidence to connect the President's involvement with the gift \nconcealment. I find it hard to believe that Ms. Currie would on her \nown, without influence from the President, decide to hide Ms. \nLewinsky's gifts.\n  As an aside, I feel compelled to point out a pattern that seems to \nhave evolved during this administration. The hiding of evidence in a \npersonal residence harks back to the mysterious reappearance of the \nWhitewater billing records in the White House residence several years \nago. There seems, in my mind, a proclivity on the part of the President \nto cause the disappearance of key evidence whenever wrongdoing is \nalleged. Hence, gifts under the bed equate to billing records in the \nWhite House residence.\n  In view of the President's actions up to this point, I am convinced \nthe President was involved in Ms. Currie's receipt of the gifts. The \nsimple truth is that, in spite of repeated requests, the gifts the \nPresident received were never produced and only some of the gifts given \nto Ms. Lewinsky were produced. In my view, it was no accident that \ngifts which were not handed over were instead hidden beneath the \nPresident's secretary's bed.\n  As the Jones case progressed, so did the President's determination to \nobstruct justice. As fate would have it, Monica Lewinsky was named as a \nwitness in the civil rights action. Upset and scared, the President \nsuggested to Ms. Lewinsky that if she were subpoenaed she could file an \naffidavit in an effort to avoid testifying in a deposition. Ms. \nLewinsky did in fact file an affidavit. The affidavit was claimed by \nthe President to be truthful because of what Ms. Lewinsky understood \n``sexual relations'' to mean at that time.\n\n  While the President maintains the truth of the affidavit even until \nthis day, Ms. Lewinsky testified before the grand jury that, in fact, \nit was not a truthful affidavit. Specifically, she testified before the \ngrand jury that she was willing to submit a false affidavit under the \npenalty of perjury because she did not think that her affair with the \nPresident was anyone's business. I assume that we would still not have \nMs. Lewinsky's admission that the affidavit was false, but for the fact \nthat she was in fear of being prosecuted for perjury herself.\n  I think the President's behavior in regard to the affidavit of Ms. \nLewinsky fits squarely in the definition of obstruction of justice. I \nam not impressed with the President's argument that this conduct became \n``irrelevant'' when Judge Wright later determined that the Lewinsky \nmatter was not essential to the Jones lawsuit.\n  On the contrary, I am compelled by the fact that when the President \nwas weaving this contorted web, it was his clear intent to conceal his \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky. At the time the Lewinsky affidavit was \nprepared, the President could not have known Judge Wright would later \ndetermine that the Lewinsky matter was unrelated to the Jones lawsuit \ndue to the consensual nature of the President and Ms. Lewinsky's \nrelationship. Rather, the President was making every effort to see that \nnothing about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was disclosed.\n  The next crucial event arrived on the day of the President's \ndeposition in the Jones case. At the deposition, the President's \nattorney, Bob Bennett, stated that Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit was true. \nSpecifically, Mr. Bennett stated that ``there is no sex of any kind, \nshape, or form.'' The President claims, not surprisingly, that he was \nnot paying attention when his attorney made these statements, and in \naddition, that the Lewinsky affidavit was technically true because the \nword ``is'' means ``at this time.''\n  My review of the President's videotaped testimony leads me to believe \nthe President was paying attention to Mr. Bennett. When watching the \nvideotape, it is apparent to me the President's attention is riveted on \nevery person who speaks. He is attentive and his eyes track the \nspeakers as they engage in dialogue. I believe the President purposely \nallowed Mr. Bennett to mislead the court. Part of the record before us \nincludes a letter from Mr. Bennett asking the trial court not to rely \non the affidavit or his comments regarding the document. Thus, it \nappears Mr. Bennett also believed that the President allowed him to \nmislead the court.\n  Moreover, I am not persuaded by the President's argument that the \naffidavit\n\n[[Page S1515]]\n\nwas technically true because ``is'' means ``at this time.'' I am \noffended by the President's lack of respect for the truth-seeking \nprocess our justice system is designed to foster and protect. Indeed, I \nam disturbed that the President would attempt to manipulate each and \nevery word. To take the President's interpretation of ``is'' to its \nlogical conclusion that nothing was occurring at that very minute is \nridiculous.\n  Clearly, things did not go well at the Jones deposition. In fact, the \nPresident admitted later in his grand jury testimony that he was \nsurprised by the depth of the inquiry regarding Monica Lewinsky. This \nprobing questioning made the President increasingly desperate. On \nSaturday, after the President's deposition, he called his secretary, \nMs. Currie, and asked her to come to the White House the following day. \nBoth the President and Ms. Currie testified that such a Sunday meeting \nwas out of the ordinary. When Ms. Currie arrived, the President called \nher into the Oval Office and made several statements, which he later \ndescribed as questions, regarding Monica Lewinsky. Ms. Currie testified \nbefore the grand jury, that the President said the following to her:\n\n       I was never really alone with Monica, right?\n       You were always there when Monica was there, right?\n       Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?\n       You could see and hear everything, right?\n       She wanted to have sex with me, and I cannot do that.\n\n  This conversation was repeated between the President and Ms. Currie \nagain two days later. Though Ms. Currie testified that on both \noccasions she felt ``no real pressure'' to agree with the President, \nshe did nonetheless think he wanted her to agree with him. And, agree \nshe did.\n  Lawyers for the President have defended his actions by stating that \nthe President was refreshing his memory with Betty Currie because he \nwas aware that the media frenzy regarding Monica Lewinsky was about to \nbreak loose. I find this explanation unconvincing for numerous reasons. \nThe first, and perhaps most obvious reason is that a person does not \ntypically refresh his recollection with statements he knows to be \nfalse. It is beyond belief that the President could assert such a \ndefense. He knew he was alone with Ms. Lewinsky, and even he testified \nhe would have been an ``exhibitionist'' if he had conducted these acts \nin public view. In fact, when asked during the grand jury proceedings \nif Ms. Currie was nearby when he and Ms. Lewinsky had intimate contact, \nthe President responded: ``I never--I didn't try to involve Betty in \nthat in any way.'' Further, the President's statements to Ms. Currie \nimplying that she was always present, and that she could see and \nhear everything, defy logic by indicating that Ms. Currie was always \nwith the President and Ms. Lewinsky. The President clearly knew that \nwas not the case.\n\n  The sum of this evidence convinces me the President was not only \nobstructing justice by tampering with a potential future witness, but \nalso violating the gag order that had been put into effect by Judge \nWright in the Jones case. The irony here is that one reason Ms. Currie \nbecame a potential witness was due to the President's own urging. \nThroughout the Jones deposition the President repeatedly offered ``you \nshould ask Betty.'' Then, on the very next day following these remarks, \nhe summoned Ms. Currie to the White House and asked and answered his \nown leading questions. Importantly, the following week, Ms. Currie was \nsubpoenaed to testify in the Jones matter.\n  I have also concluded the President's conversations with his aides \nconcerning his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky constitute witness \ntampering. The President told his aides, John Podesta, Sidney \nBlumenthal, and Erskine Bowles, misleading and untrue statements about \nhis relationship with Monica Lewinsky. In fact, Mr. Podesta testified \nin the grand jury proceedings that the President was extremely explicit \nin his comments about denying any physical relationship and any sexual \ncontact with Ms. Lewinsky.\n  Although the President's approach to this group of potential \nwitnesses differed from his approach to Ms. Currie in that he did not \nask this group to agree with his statements, I find these conversations \nequally disturbing. To mislead his key aides, who he admitted might be \ncalled to testify before the grand jury, demonstrates that there are no \nbounds on the President's attempts to protect himself. He was willing \nto mislead any person who might have blocked his intricate obstruction \nplan.\n  In addition, I believe that the President obstructed justice by \nintensifying and succeeding in an effort to secure job assistance for \nMs. Lewinsky in order corruptly to prevent her from truthfully \ntestifying in the Jones case. Although the President promised Ms. \nLewinsky assistance with her New York job search prior to her name \nappearing on a witness list in the Jones case, it seems odd and much \ntoo coincidental that the President's assistance intensified after he \nlearned that Ms. Lewinsky was on the witness list.\n  In October, Ms. Lewinsky expressed her interest to the President in \nmoving to New York and finding a job. In early November, Ms. Lewinsky \nhad a meeting with Vernon Jordan to discuss potential jobs in New York \nCity. Ms. Lewinsky testified before the grand jury that this meeting \nresulted in no activity taking place. However, unbeknownst to Ms. \nLewinsky, her job search would take a 360 degree turn in December. \nPossibly the most important day was December 6, 1997, when the \nPresident learned that Ms. Lewinsky's name had appeared on a list of \npotential witnesses in the Jones case. A little over a month later, Ms. \nLewinsky was offered and accepted a job with Revlon in New York City.\n  Because I feel the sequence of events that took place in December is \nextremely telling; I will lay these events out. On December 6, the \nPresident learned Ms. Lewinsky was a potential witness in the Jones \ncase. On December 7, the President and Mr. Jordan met at the White \nHouse. According to both parties, however, Ms. Lewinsky was never \ndiscussed. On December 8, Mr. Jordan received Ms. Lewinsky's resume by \ncourier. On December 11, Mr. Jordan met with Ms. Lewinsky and made \nphone calls to various New York companies on her behalf. On December \n17, after a job in New York seemed like a much more likely prospect for \nMs. Lewinsky, the President telephoned Ms. Lewinsky at 2:00 a.m. to \ninform her that her name was on a witness list in the Jones case. On \nDecember 19, Ms. Lewinsky was served a subpoena in the Jones case. On \nDecember 31, Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan ate breakfast together at the \nPark Hyatt Hotel. On January 7, Ms. Lewinsky signed an affidavit to be \nfiled in the Jones case in which she denied having sexual relations \nwith the President. On January 8, Ms. Lewinsky interviewed in New York \nwith MacAndrews and Forbes, a company recommended by Mr. Jordan. On \nthat same day, Ms. Lewinsky informed Mr. Jordan that the interview did \nnot go well. Mr. Jordan made a call to the Chairman of the Board and \nChief Executive Officer at MacAndrews and Forbes. On the morning of \nJanuary 9, Ms. Lewinsky was given a second interview. On that same \nmorning, Ms. Lewinsky was given an informal job offer, which she \naccepted. On January 13, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky received a formalized job \noffer.\n  It is apparent from the above time line that the President's efforts \nin finding Ms. Lewinsky a job in New York intensified at an excessive \nrate once it was discovered that Ms. Lewinsky was going to be a witness \nin the Jones case. The President was well aware of the fact that Ms. \nLewinsky's testimony could be harmful to him, and thus, it was in his \nbest interest to get Ms. Lewinsky a job in New York as soon as \npossible. It seems to be no coincidence that the President did not tell \nMs. Lewinsky that she was a potential witness until eleven days after \nhe learned of this news. Rather, it appears the President was using \nthese eleven days to ensure that Ms. Lewinsky understood the President \nwas her friend and was trying to assist her in her New York job hunt. \nInterestingly, Ms. Lewinsky was not informed of her witness status \nuntil after interviews in New York had been scheduled for her by Vernon \nJordan.\n\n\n                     Perjury Before The Grand Jury\n\n  The President is also charged with making perjurious, false, and \nmisleading testimony to a Federal grand jury concerning his corrupt \nefforts to influence the testimony of witnesses and to impede the \ndiscovery of evidence in the Jones civil rights action. My review of \nthis charge, and the evidence offered,\n\n[[Page S1516]]\n\nleads me to conclude that the President engaged in several separate \nacts of perjury. Specifically, the President lied under oath regarding \nthe nature and details of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky; lied \nregarding his conversation with Ms. Currie on the day following his \nJones deposition; lied regarding his knowledge of Ms. Lewinsky's \naffidavit in the Jones case; lied regarding statements made to aides \nabout his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky; lied regarding prior false \nand misleading statements he allowed his attorney Bob Bennett to make \nto a federal judge in the Jones case; and lied when he denied engaging \nin a plan to hide gifts that had been subpoenaed in the Jones case.\n\n  After the Jones deposition, on January 26, 1998, the President went \non national television and declared: ``I did not have sexual relations \nwith that woman, Miss Lewinsky.'' In addition, he denied that he urged \nher to lie about the affair. Over the next seven months, the President \ncontinued to deny the relationship. In the face of mounting evidence to \nthe contrary, the Office of the Independent Counsel sought and received \npermission from the Attorney General to expand its investigation to \ninclude whether the President lied under oath in his Jones deposition.\n  Seven months later, on August 17, 1998, the President appeared before \na grand jury to answer questions regarding his Jones deposition and his \nalleged affair with Ms. Lewinsky. Prior to his testimony, the President \ntook a solemn oath to tell the truth. Specifically, when asked during \nthe grand jury proceedings what this oath meant to him, the President \nstated: ``I have sworn on an oath to tell the grand jury the truth, and \nthat's what I intend to do.'' Moreover, the President stated: ``I will \ntry to answer, to the best of my ability, other questions including \nquestions about my relationship with Ms. Lewinsky; questions about my \nunderstanding of the term ``sexual relations,'' as I understood it to \nbe defined at my January 17, 1998 deposition; and questions concerning \nalleged subornation of perjury, obstruction of justice, and \nintimidation of witnesses.''\n  In my opinion, however, the President violated his stated intention \nto answer questions honestly and to the best of his ability. Perjury is \ndefined by the United States Code as ``whoever under oath in any \nproceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United \nStates knowingly makes any false material declaration or makes or uses \nany other information, including any book, paper, document, record, \nrecording, or other material, knowing the same to contain any false \ndeclaration.'' See 18 USC s.1623. I believe that the President's \nstatements fall within the above definition because his statements were \nboth false and material to the proper inquiry of the grand jury.\n  First, the President gave false and misleading testimony during the \ngrand jury proceedings concerning the nature and details of his \nrelationship with Monica Lewinsky. On August 17, 1998, the President \nread a prepared statement to the grand jury as a response to the \nquestion of whether he was physically intimate with Monica Lewinsky. \nThe prepared statement said:\n\n       When I was alone with Ms. Lewinsky on certain occasions in \n     early 1996 and once in early 1997, I engaged in conduct that \n     was wrong. These encounters did not consist of sexual \n     intercourse. They did not constitute sexual relations as I \n     understood that term to be defined at my January 17, 1998, \n     deposition. But they did involve inappropriate intimate \n     contact.\n       These inappropriate encounters ended, at my insistence, in \n     early 1997. I also had occasional telephone conversations \n     with Ms. Lewinsky that included inappropriate sexual banter.\n       I regret that what began as a friendship came to include \n     this conduct, and I will take full responsibility for my \n     actions.\n\n  During Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony, she stated that the \nPresident had contact with various parts of her body. Even under the \nlimited interpretation that the President has given the Jones \ndefinition of ``sexual relations,'' the contact between the President \nand Ms. Lewinsky, as testified to by Ms. Lewinsky, constituted sexual \nrelations on the part of both parties.\n  Before the grand jury, the President referred to his prepared \nresponse nineteen times in order to avoid providing honest and complete \nanswers to the questions posed. By referring to his prepared statement, \nthe President asserted that his encounters with Ms. Lewinsky did not \nconstitute ``sexual relations.'' The fact is that the evidence \noverwhelmingly affirms that the President had sexual contact with Ms. \nLewinsky and his attempts at legal hairsplitting to maneuver around the \ntruth failed.\n  To address part of the perjury charge creates the need to resolve the \ncredibility conflict between the President and Ms. Lewinsky. By finding \nthat the President committed perjury in regard to testimony concerning \nthe nature and details of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, it is \nclear that I find the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky to be more honest and \nforthright. Some may question why I believe the testimony of Ms. \nLewinsky over the testimony of the President. First and foremost, I \nbelieve Ms. Lewinsky had no motive to lie, whereas the President had \nevery motive to conceal the details of this intimate relationship. Not \nonly was his Presidency on the line, but his credibility with his staff \nwould be destroyed if the truth were exposed. Even more importantly, \nthe President's credibility is questionable because he had to fear that \ndiscovery of the truth would cause his family immense devastation.\n\n  Furthermore, I believe Ms. Lewinsky is more credible because her \nstatement is corroborated. Ms. Lewinsky told the intimate details of \nher relationship to her therapists, her friends, Linda Tripp, her \nmother, and her aunt. Thus, it is not difficult to find that Ms. \nLewinsky is a more credible witness than the President.\n  I further believe the President made perjurious and misleading \nstatements before the grand jury when he disclosed his version of his \nconversations with Betty Currie. As stated earlier, I believe that the \nrhetorical questions the President asked Ms. Currie on two separate \noccasions were an effort to coach a potential witness in the Jones \ncase. During his grand jury testimony, the President testified that he \nquestioned Ms. Currie because he thought the story would break in the \npress, he needed to get the facts down, and he was trying to refresh \nhis memory. The reality is the President was never trying to refresh \nhis memory. Ms. Currie even acknowledged in the grand jury proceedings \nthat based on the way the President stated the questions and his \ndemeanor, she believed he wished for her to agree with his statements.\n  In addition, according to the President's own grand jury testimony, \nhe told no one of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Specifically, \nduring grand jury questioning, the President was asked with regard to \nhis relationship with Ms. Lewinsky: ``Had you told anyone?'' The \nPresident answered: ``Absolutely not.'' Question: ``Had you tried, in \nfact, not to let anyone else know about this relationship?'' Answer: \n``Well, of course.'' Question: ``What did you do?'' Answer: ``Well I \nnever said anything about it, for one thing. And I did what people do \nwhen they do the wrong thing. I tried to do it where nobody else was \nlooking at it.''\n  Thus, if the President was hiding his intimate encounters with Ms. \nLewinsky, how would Ms. Currie have been capable of refreshing his \nmemory on details of his secret relationship? The truth is that the \nPresident was fully aware of the fact he touched Ms. Lewinsky. \nLikewise, the President was fully aware that there had been instances \nwhen he was alone with Ms. Lewinsky. The only reason the President \nasked Ms. Currie those five infamous rhetorical questions was to \nprovide a false and misleading account of the events to Ms. Currie in \nthe hope Ms. Currie would substantiate the false testimony he gave in \nhis deposition. The President's grand jury testimony that he was trying \nto refresh his memory was simply a story concocted to cover up the fact \nthat he obstructed justice. Thus, his grand jury testimony was \nperjurious.\n  In addition to making false statements with regard to the potential \ntestimony of Betty Currie, the President also made false statements \nwith regard to tampering with the potential testimony of his aides. The \nPresident testified to the grand jury that he said to his aides things \nthat were true about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. ``I said, I \nhave not had sex with her as I defined it.'' This statement is, \nhowever, patently untrue, as White House\n\n[[Page S1517]]\n\nDeputy Chief of Staff John Podesta's testimony indicates. Mr. Podesta \ntestified that the President was explicit in stating that no sexual \ncontact of any kind occurred between the two parties.\n  Furthermore, during the grand jury proceedings, the President \ntestified that when he was asking Ms. Currie about the times he was \nalone with Ms. Lewinsky, he was referring to 1997. The President \nstated: ``Keep in mind, sir, I just want to make it--I was talking \nabout 1997. I was never, ever trying to get Betty Currie to claim that \non the occasions when Monica Lewinsky was there when she wasn't \nanywhere around, that she was. I would never have done that to her, and \nI don't think she thought about that. I don't think she thought I was \nreferring to that.'' The President was then asked: ``Did you put a date \nrestriction? Did you make it clear to Ms. Currie that you were only \nasking her whether you were never alone with her after 1997?'' The \nPresident responded: ``Well, I don't recall whether I did or not, but I \nassumed--if I didn't, I assumed she knew what I was talking about, \nbecause it was the point at which Ms. Lewinsky was out of the White \nHouse and had to have someone wave her in, in order to get in the White \nHouse.'' In my view, this is just one more example of the President \ncreating a false story to cover up the fact that his conversation with \nBetty Currie constituted witness tampering.\n  The President also provided perjurious, false, and misleading \ntestimony to a Federal grand jury regarding his knowledge that the \ncontents of an affidavit executed by Ms. Lewinsky were untrue. \nAttorneys for Paula Jones were seeking evidence of sexual relationships \nthe President may have had with other state or federal employees. In \nthis process, Ms. Lewinsky was subpoenaed as a witness. The President \nsuggested that Ms. Lewinsky should file an affidavit to avoid having to \ntestify. If the truth had been told in this affidavit, and if Ms. \nLewinsky had been honest about the nature of her relationship with the \nPresident, Ms. Lewinsky indisputably would have been an important \nwitness.\n  The President stated before the grand jury, when asked about the \nLewinsky affidavit: ``Did I hope [Monica Lewinsky would] be able to get \nout of testifying on an affidavit? Absolutely. . . Did I want her to \nexecute a false affidavit? No, I did not.'' The President's testimony \nis not credible and is misleading in light of the fact that it was \nvirtually impossible for Ms. Lewinsky to file a truthful affidavit that \nwould have permitted the President to achieve his objective of not \nhaving Ms. Lewinsky testify. This is just one more instance were the \nPresident lied, misled, and violated his solemn oath to tell the truth.\n\n  In addition, the President gave perjurious testimony in regard to \nfalse and misleading statements he allowed his attorney Bob Bennett to \nmake to a federal judge in the Jones case. When asked during his grand \njury testimony how he could have lawfully sat silent while his attorney \nmade a false statement, the President explained that he was not paying \n``a great deal of attention.'' As I stated earlier, from reviewing the \nPresident's videotaped deposition numerous times, I believe that it is \napparent that the President was indeed paying attention when his \nattorney made these false statements.\n  Finally, in his grand jury testimony, the President stated he told \nMs. Lewinsky that if the attorneys for Paula Jones asked for the gifts, \nshe had to provide them. In light of the fact that all of the gifts the \nPresident gave Ms. Lewinsky were never produced and some of the gifts \nwere found under Ms. Currie's bed, I do not believe that the \nPresident's grand jury testimony regarding his conversation with Ms. \nLewinsky was truthful.\n  Accordingly, after considering all of the evidence, I believe that \nthe President is guilty of both Article I and Article II.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. Chief Justice, the President of the United States has put the \nSenate in a difficult position. His actions have caused all of us to \nexamine the uncomfortable details surrounding his reckless affair with \na young White House intern. But it was not his unfortunate actions with \nthe White House intern that brought us to this moment. Rather, it was \nhis wilful and deliberate attempt to cover it up in a judicial \nproceeding and then lie under oath to a Federal grand jury. We are not \nhere because we disagree with the President's politics. In fact, I \nhappen to consider the President a very capable man, who has, by his \nown actions, destroyed his place in history. For me to watch someone \nstrategically dismantle all they have worked for is disturbing, to say \nthe least. However, in spite of the human side of this tragedy, there \nis no escaping that we are here simply because of the President's \nintentionally deceptive behavior and his unwillingness to abide by the \nlaw.\n  We were handed very serious charges against the President by the \nHouse of Representatives. In disposing of this matter, we have followed \nthe only template we have: the Constitution and the precedent of \nprevious Senates. We have followed the Founders to the best of our \nabilities. Despite cries all around to end the trial and ignore our \nConstitutional mandate, the Senate allowed for a process rooted in the \nsearch for truth. All sides had an opportunity to make their case, \nquestion witnesses, and answer inquiries posed by individual Senators.\n  Although this journey was less than perfect, we did not fail in this \nendeavor. We did not fail our Founders, we did not fail the House of \nRepresentatives or the President, and we did not fail the American \npeople. I attended the meetings of the Senate, reviewed the material in \nthe record, asked questions of the House Managers and White House \ncounsel, and reviewed the depositions of witnesses. I am satisfied that \nour proceedings over the past month allowed me sufficient information \nto arrive at my decision.\n  I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that William Jefferson \nClinton is guilty of the charges levied by the House of Representatives \nand should be removed from office. By employing that standard I do not \nwish to influence others who find a different standard to be more \nappropriate.\n  I am proud of the United States Senate and how it conducted itself \nduring this process. Despite extraordinary difficulty, we did our job \naccording to the Constitution and to the best of our ability. I am \nhopeful that through this process we have provided future generations \nwith enough information to make an informed judgement of this \nPresident's actions. In the end, however, history will be the final \narbiter.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. As a freshman Senator, I am saddened that the first \nissue I confront in my service to the people of Illinois is the \nimpeachment of a President of the United States. It is difficult to \nimagine a task less welcome and more awesome to me. As a newly elected \nSenator, I have barely begun to know the Senate, my colleagues, our \nrules and procedures, our precedents, or, finally, even our duty. I \nhave watched you all so carefully--looking for examples, and guidance--\nand wondering at the gravity of these days.\n  On a personal note, before I begin, I want to thank those on both \nsides of the aisle--Senators who, in difficult days, have been so \ngracious to a newcomer. Thank you for taking the time, and making the \neffort, to welcome the newest among you. Through these hours, I have \ndeveloped a deep respect for my new colleagues, for the Senate as an \ninstitution, and for the Constitution that has anchored our Republic \nfor over two hundred years. I thank God for the wisdom of the Framers, \nand their ability to construct enduring institutions that allow us to \nconfront, peacefully, the question of whether our President should be \nremoved from office. We now come to the conclusion of this \nConstitutional process, itself an extraordinary example of the rule of \nlaw that makes our nation the envy of the world.\n  The people of Illinois have entrusted me with the duty to uphold the \nConstitution, a duty I share with all of you. In addition, we share the \nresponsibility of abiding by the separate oath which we took in this \nproceeding to ``do impartial justice according to the Constitution and \nthe laws.''\n  As a trier of fact and law, I find that the President has committed \nperjury and obstruction of justice as charged in the two Articles of \nImpeachment, and that those offenses constitute ``high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.'' I will vote for conviction on both counts.\n\n[[Page S1518]]\n\n  I reach this decision after detailed examination of the evidence \npresented, the arguments of counsel, Senate precedents, and the \nimpeachment clause of the Constitution.\n\n\n                         The Standard of Proof\n\n  The initial decision I made was to determine the appropriate burden \nof proof. Failure to impose a burden of proof on the House Managers \nwould severely weaken the Presidency, a result the Founders feared and \nsought to avoid. The precedents of the Senate make it clear that there \nis no single standard that each of us must apply.\n  The President has argued that we should apply the criminal standard \nof ``proof beyond a reasonable doubt.'' In recent impeachment trials of \nfederal judges, a number of Senators also argued that conviction was \nonly appropriate if the proof met this standard. Some commentators have \nsuggested that Senators could use the preponderance-of-the-evidence \nstandard typically applied in civil cases, or some standard in between.\n  I have concluded that, to support a conviction, allegations must be \nproven by ``clear and convincing'' evidence. The criminal standard is \nnot warranted, because the relief in this instance, i.e., the removal \nof the President, is not punitive, but remedial. In contrast, the civil \nstandard would place the Presidency at too great a risk. The ``clear \nand convincing'' evidence standard strikes a prudent balance, providing \nsufficient protection for the authority of the Presidency and the \nexpression of popular will represented by the President's election, \nwhile avoiding the risk of a President remaining in office despite \nclear and convincing evidence of impeachable offenses.\n\n\n             Article I: Perjury Before A Federal Grand Jury\n\n  The House has presented clear and convincing evidence that the \nPresident committed perjury when he testified before a Federal grand \njury on August 17, 1998.\n  On January 17, 1998, President Clinton testified in a civil \ndeposition in the Jones v. Clinton lawsuit, after the Supreme Court had \nruled unanimously that a civil suit against a sitting President could \nproceed. After the deposition, the Independent Counsel secured the \napproval of the Attorney General, and the three-judge Federal court \nwhich superintends the Independent Counsel law, to expand his \njurisdiction to inquire into whether the President testified truthfully \nin his deposition. On August 17, 1998, the President, as the target of \nthe investigation testified by video to a Federal grand jury in \nWashington, D.C.\n  The President's deposition testimony in the Jones case was false in \nnumerous respects, and his grand jury statements that he had sought to \nbe completely truthful in his deposition testimony cannot be accurate. \n[Grand Jury Testimony of President Clinton, 8/17/98, H. Doc. 105-311, \npp. 458-59] The falsehoods are of such a quantity and kind that a \nreasonable reading of the evidence suggests the President had to know \nat the time he gave his deposition in the Jones case that he was not \nbeing truthful. His testimony to the grand jury that he intended to be \ntruthful at his deposition is false.\n  Example: the President had testified in his deposition that he \nbelieved that, in the preceding two weeks, no one had reported to him \nany conversations with Ms. Lewinsky about the Jones suit. [Jones \nDeposition of President Clinton, 1/17/98, S. Doc. 106-3, Vol. 22, p. \n22] In testifying to the grand jury that he was truthful in his \ndeposition, the President reaffirmed this portion of his deposition \ntestimony. [Grand Jury Testimony of President Clinton, 8/17/98, H. Doc. \n105-311, p. 458] We know, however, that Vernon Jordan had, within the \ntwo weeks prior to the President's deposition, told the President that \nMs. Lewinsky had signed her affidavit. [Deposition Testimony of Vernon \nJordan, 2/2/99, 145 Congressional Record S1241 (daily ed. Feb. 4, \n1999)] The President's grand jury testimony was material to the issue \nof whether the President had sought to influence the content of Ms. \nLewinsky's affidavit and thereby obstruct justice.\n\n  The President again committed perjury before the Federal grand jury \nwhen he tried to explain why he made a series of false statements to \nhis secretary, Betty Currie, on two separate occasions. At his \ndeposition, the President was questioned about Ms. Lewinsky. The \nPresident attempted to employ Ms. Currie as an alibi witness. In the \nwake of the deposition, the President asked Ms. Currie to come to the \noffice on a Sunday. Once there, the President asked Ms. Currie a series \nof leading questions concerning her recollection of events regarding \nMs. Lewinsky. [Grand Jury Testimony of Betty Currie, 1/7/98, H. Doc. \n105-316, pp. 559-60] A few days later, the President again queried Ms. \nCurrie with leading questions. [Id. at p. 561]\n  When questioned during his grand jury testimony about the series of \nleading questions he had directed to Ms. Currie, the President \nresponded: ``I was trying to figure out what the facts were. I was \ntrying to remember.'' [Grand Jury Testimony of President Clinton, 8/17/\n98, H. Doc. 105-311, p. 591] He also claimed that he was only trying to \n``ascertain what the facts were, trying to ascertain what Betty's \nperception was.'' [Id. at p. 593]\n  While Ms. Currie would not say she felt pressured by the President, \nshe did testify that she believed that the President was seeking her \nagreement with those statements. [Grand Jury Testimony of Betty Currie, \n1/7/98, H. Doc. 105-316, p. 559] It is unreasonable to conclude that \nthe President was trying to refresh his recollection by making patently \nfalse statements to Ms. Currie, in the days immediately following his \ndeposition for the Jones case. Ms. Curry could not possibly have known \nthe answers to some of the President's ``questions,'' and the President \nclearly already knew the answers to others.\n  We took an oath to do impartial justice. We did not take an oath to \ncheck our common sense at the door of this Chamber. The President's \nproffered explanation of the questions he directed to Ms. Currie defies \ncommon sense. I believe he sought, instead, to influence Ms. Currie's \nanticipated testimony by imparting to Ms. Currie his preferred version \nof the events. His false explanation was material to the grand jury's \ninquiry and constitutes perjury.\n  The President also committed perjury when he testified and then \nreiterated before the Federal grand jury, in answer to a question about \nfalse accounts he gave to his aides regarding Ms. Lewinsky, that ``I \nsaid to them things that were true.'' [Grand Jury Testimony of \nPresident Clinton, 8/17/98, p. 106, H. Doc. 105-311, pp. 557-58]\n  In fact, the President said to his aides things that were false. \nPresidential aide Sidney Blumenthal testified in his Senate deposition \nthat the President had told him that Ms. Lewinsky had threatened him, \nand that she was called ``the stalker.'' [Deposition Testimony of \nSidney Blumenthal, 2/3/99, 145 Congressional Record S1301 (daily ed. \nFeb. 6, 1999)] Mr. Blumenthal testified he now knows that the President \nlied to him. [Id. at S1302] The President knew what he said to Mr. \nBlumenthal was false because the President knew the facts. The one fact \nthe President did not know was that Ms. Lewinsky would produce DNA \nevidence that would provide incontrovertible physical evidence to \ncontradict him.\n  The President's statements before a Federal grand jury regarding \naccounts he gave to his aides of Ms. Lewinsky were false, and the \nfalsehoods were material to the grand jury's investigation into whether \nthe President had testified falsely in the Jones deposition.\n\n\n                   Article II: obstruction of justice\n\n  The House has presented clear and convincing evidence that President \nClinton obstructed justice by engaging in a course of conduct designed \nto impede, cover up, and conceal evidence and testimony related to the \nFederal civil rights action brought against him.\n  The evidence shows that the President improperly influenced Ms. \nLewinsky to file a false affidavit in the Jones suit. I believe that \nthe only version of the evidence that makes sense is that offered by \nthe House. Thus, I conclude that the President influenced the entire \nprocess that led to the filing of the false affidavit, from its \ninception to its conclusion. He did so through direct conversations \nwith Ms. Lewinsky,\n\n[[Page S1519]]\n\nand through his close friend, Mr. Jordan, who was able to monitor the \nprocess through an attorney that he, Mr. Jordan, procured for Ms. \nLewinsky.\n  Ms. Lewinsky admitted that on December 17, 1997, the President \ninformed her by telephone at 2 a.m. that she was on the witness list in \nthe Jones case, and suggested that she might avoid testifying by filing \nan affidavit. [Deposition Testimony of Monica Lewinsky, 2/1/99, 145 \nCongressional Record S1218 (daily ed. Feb. 4, 1999)] And the President \ntold Ms. Lewinsky to call Betty Currie if she was subpoenaed. [Id.]\n  The President's assertion that he thought Ms. Lewinsky could have \navoided testifying by filing a truthful affidavit is unbelievable. I \nbelieve that the President knew that a truthful affidavit by Ms. \nLewinsky would have ensured that she would have been called as a \ndeposition witness, and that her subsequent truthful testimony would \nhave been legally damaging to the President. In fact, in the very \nconversation in which the President suggested that Ms. Lewinsky file an \naffidavit, they discussed the cover stories they could use to avoid \npublic knowledge of the truth. [Id. at S1219]\n  Vernon Jordan testified in his Senate deposition that he ``was acting \non behalf of the President to get Ms. Lewinsky a job.'' [Deposition \nTestimony of Vernon Jordan, 2/2/99, 145 Congressional Record S1293 \n(daily ed. Feb. 6, 1999)] Mr. Jordan confirmed in the deposition that \n``The President was obviously interested in her job search.'' [Id. at \nS1314] It was Mr. Jordan --one of the President's closest friends--whom \nMs. Lewinsky called when she was subpoenaed. Mr. Jordan met with Ms. \nLewinsky and arranged a lawyer for her. [Deposition Testimony of Vernon \nJordan, 2/2/99, 145 Congressional Record S1234-36 (daily ed. Feb. 4, \n1999)] Mr. Jordan delivered Ms. Lewinsky to her lawyer's office. [Id. \nat S1238] Mr. Jordan monitored the drafting and content of Ms. \nLewinsky's affidavit. [Grand Jury Testimony of Monica Lewinsky, 8/6/98, \nH. Doc. 105-311, p. 920] Ms. Lewinsky herself delivered a copy of her \nfirst signed affidavit to Mr. Jordan's office. Ms. Lewinsky testified \nthat she and Mr. Jordan conferred about the contents of the affidavit \nand agreed to delete one portion inserted by her lawyer and make other \nchanges. [Id. at pp. 921-22, 1229-30 (Exhibit 3)]\n  Mr. Jordan kept the President informed throughout the affidavit-\ndrafting process. He personally notified the President that Ms. \nLewinsky had signed the false affidavit. [Deposition Testimony of \nVernon Jordan, 2/2/99, 145 Congressional Record S1241 (daily ed. Feb. \n4, 1999)]\n  The evidence also clearly and convincingly demonstrates that after \nMs. Lewinsky's name appeared on the witness list in the Jones case, the \nPresident, through Mr. Jordan, provided intensified assistance to Ms. \nLewinsky in finding a job in order to encourage her to file the false \naffidavit. Mr. Jordan accepted responsibility for the job search and \nhas admitted that he and Ms. Lewinsky discussed both the job search and \nher affidavit in most conversations. [Id.] Mr. Jordan attempted to \nseparate each aspect of his work with Ms. Lewinsky. He testified that \n``[t]he affidavit was over here. The job was over here.'' [Id.] \nWhatever Mr. Jordan's belief, it cannot have been lost on Ms. Lewinsky \nthat she had a very prominent and powerful lawyer soliciting job offers \nfor her at the same time she was being asked to help that lawyer's \nfriend, the President, who had first suggested that she file an \naffidavit.\n  On the day after Ms. Lewinsky signed the false affidavit, Mr. Jordan \npersonally called the CEO of a Fortune 500 company to secure a job for \nher, a job she was offered on the subsequent day. [Id. at S1241-42] On \nthe day that Ms. Lewinsky received the job offer, Mr. Jordan called the \nPresident, through Ms. Currie, and left the message ``mission \naccomplished.'' [Grand Jury Testimony of Vernon Jordan, 5/28/98, S. \nDoc. 106-3, p. 1898] The President's own testimony in his deposition \nfor the Jones case followed exactly the false claims of Ms. Lewinsky's \nfalse affidavit. While the President's lawyers encouraged the \nperception that this convergence was a coincidence, I do not buy it.\n  The evidence is clear and convincing that the President continued to \ninvolve Ms. Currie in his lies and obfuscation. Ms. Lewinsky testified \nthat on December 28, 1997, she met with President Clinton and informed \nhim that she had been subpoenaed, and that the subpoena required her to \nproduce all gifts she had received from the President. She testified \nthat the subpoena specifically requested a hat pin, which alarmed her. \n[Grand Jury Testimony of Monica Lewinsky, 8/6/98, H. Doc. 105-311, p. \n852] The President responded that the subpoena ``concerned'' him. [Id. \nat p. 872] When Ms. Lewinsky asked him what she should do in response \nto the subpoena for the gifts, the President answered, ``I don't \nknow,'' or ``Let me think about that.'' [Id.] He never gave the only \nappropriate answer, which was to comply.\n  Ms. Lewinsky testified that later that same day, Ms. Currie \ntelephoned her, saying, ``I understand that you have something for \nme,'' or ``the President said that you have something to give me.'' \n[Id. at pp. 874-75] Ms. Currie had an unclear memory about this \nincident, but said that ``the best [she] remembered,'' Ms. Lewinsky \ncalled her. [Grand Jury Testimony of Betty Currie, 5/6/98, H. Doc. 105-\n316, p. 581]\n  Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that Ms. Currie instigated the retrieval of \nthe gifts is credible and convincing. In contrast, Ms. Currie's \ntestimony that Ms. Lewinsky instigated the retrieval is not persuasive. \nI do not believe that the President's personal secretary would have \nacted upon a request from Ms. Lewinsky to retrieve the gifts without \nasking the reason for such an exchange or informing the President of \nthe request. It is too bizarre that she would simply pick up a box of \ngifts and deposit them under her bed. It defies a common-sense reading \nof the evidence and the evidentiary narrative.\n  The evidence is also clear and convincing that the President \nobstructed justice by coaching Ms. Currie, a potential witness in the \nJones case, to provide false testimony in the Jones case, and by \narranging for the concealment of gifts subpoenaed by the Jones lawyers.\n  On Saturday, January 17, 1998, a few hours after completing his own \ndeposition in the Jones case, the President called Ms. Currie and asked \nher to come to the White House on Sunday, January 18, 1998. [Id. at p. \n558] The President's assertions and leading questions to Ms. Currie on \nJanuary 18 and January 20 or 21, 1998, were indisputably false. The \nPresident knew that Ms. Currie was a potential witness when he made \nthese false statements to her. In his deposition in the Jones case, the \nPresident brought Ms. Currie's name up, without prompting, in at least \nsixteen different answers to questions, clearly anticipating and \ninviting the Jones attorneys to subpoena her to back up his account.\n  I am unable to conclude that the President was attempting to \n``refresh his recollections'' by calling Ms. Currie and requesting her \nto come to the White House on a weekend and making false statements to \nher. Simple common sense tells us that he was letting her know what he \nhad said in his deposition and that he was hoping that she would later \ncorroborate his false account.\n\n\n                      High crimes and misdemeanors\n\n  Although I have determined that the House has proven the acts alleged \nin both Articles of Impeachment by clear and convincing evidence, the \ninquiry does not end here. I must also consider whether the acts \nconstitute ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' as required by the \nConstitution. This has been a singularly difficult question for this \nbody, but I conclude that the President's offenses rise to the level of \n``high crimes and misdemeanors'' within the meaning of the \nConstitution.\n  The Framers of our Constitution provide that the Senate can only \nconvict a President for ``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.'' The Framers relied, in part, on William Blackstone for \ntheir understanding of the common law they inherited from England. In \nthe fourth book of his Commentaries on the Laws of England, Blackstone \naddressed the criminal law. He distinguished between crimes that ``more \ndirectly infringe the rights of the public or commonwealth, taken in \nits collective capacity,'' and ``those which in a more peculiar manner \ninjure individuals or private subjects.'' [IV William Blackstone, \nCommentaries on the Laws of England 74, 176 (special ed., 1983)]\n  Within the latter category, Blackstone included crimes such as \nmurder,\n\n[[Page S1520]]\n\nburglary, and arson. The former category of ``public'' crimes included \noffenses that were counted as ``offenses against the public justice.'' \nBlackstone included within this category the crimes of perjury and \nbribery side-by-side. [Id. at 127, 136-39] Blackstone's formulation \nequating perjury and bribery as ``public'' offenses suggests that, \nwithin the definition of the Constitution, perjury may also be a high \ncrime and misdemeanor.\n  Because perjury, at its core, involves an effort to obstruct justice, \nother acts that obstruct justice may very well be considered ``public'' \noffenses as the Framers would have understood them. Indeed, Blackstone \nwrites that ``impediments of justice'' are ``high misprisions'' and \n``contempts'' of the King's courts. [Id. at 126-28]\n  The intent of the Framers and subsequent interpretation of this \nclause show that impeachment and conviction of the President is a \nConstitutional remedy for serious offenses against our system of \ngovernment. Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist No. 65, explained that \nimpeachable offenses, ``relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to \nthe society itself,'' and arise ``from the abuse or violation of some \npublic trust.''\n  Certainly, perjury before a grand jury and obstruction of justice are \noffenses against the American system of government, as they strike at \nthe rule of law itself. These acts subvert the truth-seeking process \nthat is the very essence and foundation of the judicial branch. These \nacts, when committed by a President, are a repudiation of our judicial \nsystem by the Chief Executive of the country, undermining the checks \nand balances and disturbing the delicate balance between the branches \nof the Federal government that is at the heart of our Constitutional \nform of government.\n  The President's counsel attempted to diminish the severity of the \ncrimes of perjury before a Federal grand jury and obstruction of \njustice. But the Founding Fathers understood that these crimes are \noffenses against the public trust. Perjury was among the few offenses \noutlawed by statute by the First Congress, in 1790. And today, perjury \nis punishable by up to five years imprisonment in a federal \npenitentiary. [18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  1621-23] The Supreme Court, in a \n1976 plurality opinion, wrote, ``[p]erjured testimony is an obvious and \nflagrant affront to the basic concepts of judicial proceedings.'' \n[United States v. Mandujano, 425 U.S. 564, 576]\n  We do not need to decide whether the President's perjury before the \ngrand jury would have risen to the level of a ``high crime and \nmisdemeanor'' had the target of the grand jury been someone other than \nthe President, nor do we need to decide whether a President's perjury \nin a civil trial in and of itself rises to the level of an impeachable \noffense. I have reservations about considering such acts ``high \ncrimes'' or ``high misdemeanors.'' But where, as here, the President \ncommitted perjury in a Federal grand jury investigation of which he was \nthe target, I am convinced that his acts fall into the category that \nwarrants removal from office.\n  Further support for this conclusion comes from Senate precedent in \nthe impeachment, conviction, and removal from office of two Federal \njudges in the 1980s--Walter Nixon and Alcee Hastings. Judge Nixon was \nimpeached and convicted for lying to a grand jury that was \ninvestigating him, and Judge Hastings was impeached and convicted for \nmaking numerous false statements under oath in testimony in his own \ncriminal trial.\n  Obstruction of justice is particularly serious. Two federal criminal \nstatutes, Sections 1503 and 1512 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, \nspecifically prohibit corruptly influencing or obstructing the due \nadministration of justice or the testimony of a person in an official \nproceeding.\n  Federal appellate courts have applied these statutes to individuals \nwho provide misleading stories to a potential witness without \nexplicitly asking the witness to lie. For example, in 1988, a Federal \nappellate court upheld the conviction of an individual for attempting \nto influence a witness even though that witness was not scheduled to \ntestify before the grand jury nor ever appeared before a grand jury. \nThe court held that a conviction under Section 1503 is appropriate so \nlong as there is a possibility that the target of the defendant's \nactivities will be called upon to testify in an official proceeding. \n[United States v. Shannon 836 F. 2d 1125, 1127 (8th Cir. 1988)]\n  The Supreme Court has called the President's responsibility to \nenforce the laws, ``the Chief Executive's most important Constitutional \nduty.'' [Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 577 (1992)] A \nPresident who obstructs the very laws he is called upon to enforce has \ncommitted high crimes and misdemeanors as set out in the impeachment \nclause of the United States Constitution.\n\n\n                           Impartial Justice\n\n  Some argue that the Senate, sitting as a court of impeachment, should \nallow public opinion polls to influence its judgment, claiming that \nthese proceedings are not judicial, but political in nature. I believe \nthe Constitution, the intent of the Framers, and the Senate's own \nimpeachment procedures show that when the Senate convenes to fulfill \nits obligation to ``try all impeachments,'' as Article I of the \nConstitution prescribes, it takes on a judicial role quite distinct \nfrom its normal legislative proceedings. The Constitution also states, \nin Article III, that ``the trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of \nImpeachment, shall be by Jury. . .,'' implying that an impeachment \ntrial is a trial similar to all others. When a President stands \naccused, the Constitution requires the Chief Justice of the Supreme \nCourt to preside, explicitly introducing the judicial branch into the \ntrial by the Senate. And Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist No. 65, \ndiscusses ``the judicial character of the Senate'' when it meets as ``a \ncourt for the trial of impeachments.''\n  We are required to take a special oath for impeachments, above and \nbeyond our oath of office, to ``do impartial justice according to the \nConstitution and the laws.'' What can this oath mean if it does not \nplace on us a special, judicial burden, unique among our Senatorial \nduties, to apply rules of impartiality and independence in pursuit of a \nverdict that is just? If an innocent President can be convicted, or a \nguilty President can be acquitted, even in part because of the polls \nthat purport to reflect the will of the moment, then we violate our \nConstitutional duty and assault the very foundations of our system of \njustice.\n  Carved into the West Pediment of the U.S. Supreme Court building in \nWashington are four simple words: ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' Standing \nwatch in front of that building is a statue of Justice, blindfolded \nbecause justice must be blind. Even the President must respect the laws \nof the land. To the extent that we allow the popularity or unpopularity \nof a particular President to inform our votes for either conviction or \nacquittal, we undermine the principle of ``Equal Justice Under Law,'' \nand we chip away at the blindfold that covers the eyes of Justice.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  As a trier of fact and law, I find that the President has committed \nperjury and obstructed justice as charged in the two Articles of \nImpeachment, and that those offenses constitute ``high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.'' I will vote to convict on both counts.\n  For me, this is not an easy verdict to reach, and comes after great \ndeliberation. I am 38 years old. Today is my 38th day as a Senator. \nThose 38 days feel like they have lasted my entire life. As a freshman, \nI have had to confront, very suddenly, difficult truths that at the \nvery least have challenged the idealism that propelled me here in the \nfirst place. But through the din of argument and counter-argument, it \nhas occurred to me that the President's acts, however serious, are not \nnearly as consequential as our response. I have listened to those who \nassert that perjury before a grand jury and obstruction of justice are \nnot removable offenses--or that if they are, removal of a President, in \nthis time, is too disruptive to contemplate.\n  And truly, the call to do nothing is seductive. I hear it, too. We \nare so comfortable--so prosperous--that it is difficult to be bothered \nwith unpleasantness. But as the youngest member of this body, I believe \nwe must hold firm to the oldest truths. The material blessings of peace \nand prosperity are but the fruit of liberty that does not come without \na price --a liberty sustained, only and finally, by the rule of law, \nand those willing to defend it. Our\n\n[[Page S1521]]\n\ncommitment to impartial justice, now and forever, is an abstraction \nmore profound and precious than a soaring Dow and a plummeting deficit. \nI vote as I do because I will not stand for the proposition that a \nPresident can, with premeditation and deliberation, obstruct justice \nand commit perjury before a grand jury. It cannot be.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. Chief Justice, the House of Representatives presented \nto the Senate two Articles of Impeachment alleging that the President \nof the United States committed ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' in the \nform of perjury and obstruction of justice. These are serious offenses, \nnot unlike those which in the past have been sufficient to remove other \nfederal officials from office.\n  In deciding how to vote on the Articles of Impeachment, each Senator \nhad to undertake a two-step analysis: first, to determine the facts--\nthe conduct in which the accused engaged; and second, to determine \nwhether that conduct constituted ``treason, bribery, or other high \ncrimes and misdemeanors'', which, under the Constitution, require \nremoval from office. This second step calls for the Senate to determine \nthe facts and evaluate the effect of the conduct on the office and on \nthe operations of government.\n  Having listened to the presentations made to the Senate by the House \nManagers and by Counsel for the President, it is my opinion that the \nPresident committed perjury and obstructed justice, and that this \nmisconduct--based on constitutional definitions and historical \nprecedents--meets the standard for convicting an official of an \nimpeachable offense.\n  As the impeachment process is not a criminal proceeding, it is not \nnecessary that the evidence shows that the accused is guilty of a \ncriminal offense under the United States Code. The Framers wrote the \nConstitution before Congress wrote, and then amended, the criminal \ncode. Nor is it required that relevant facts be established to the same \nstandard as in a criminal trial, as Congress cannot punish the \nPresident, other than to remove him from office. Simply put, the \nFramers' objective was to provide a remedy to protect the American \npeople and their institutions of government from an unfit officeholder. \nIn view of this, I believe that such remedy is to be available if there \nis clear and convincing evidence to establish the underlying facts \nwhich demonstrate that an officeholder is unfit to serve.\n  In determining whether alleged conduct is a ``high crime and \nmisdemeanor'', Senators must examine each case individually. They must \nconsider the officeholder's position in government and look at the \neffect of the officeholder's conduct in light of the particular \nposition he or she holds. The fact that the Senate has convicted and \nremoved federal judges for committing perjury does not necessarily mean \nthat it should automatically remove a President who commits perjury. \nThe precedents regarding federal judges are instructive, but they are \nnot conclusive.\n  The 1974 House Judiciary Committee Staff Report during the Nixon \nImpeachment Inquiry, drawing on two centuries of precedents, explains \nthis concept in connection with a presidential impeachment. The report \nstates that the impeachment of the President should be ``predicated \nonly upon conduct seriously incompatible with either the constitutional \nform and principles of our government or the proper performance of \nconstitutional duties of the presidential office.'' In other words, \nCongress must determine whether the particular misconduct in which \nPresident Clinton engaged is serious enough to warrant removal from \nthat particular office. This is what I call the ``incompatibility'' \ntest.\n  The ``incompatibility'' test requires Senators to exercise their \nexpertise in, and knowledge of, government and to use their best \njudgment, focusing on the offenses committed and the effect of those \noffenses on the office and on the operation of government. It is this \nkind of threat to the republic which we must evaluate in applying the \n``incompatibility'' test. Accordingly, under this test we should focus \non the unique nature of the Presidency and the offenses the President \ncommitted.\n  The Constitution created three separate branches of government in \norder to limit the powers of government and to enhance the liberty of \nthe American people. Each branch is supreme in its own area but must \nrespect and defer to the others, when they are operating in their \nassigned areas. Reduced to the simplest characterization, the \nlegislature makes the laws, the executive executes the laws, and the \njudiciary interprets the laws and dispenses justice. As the head of the \nexecutive branch, the President stands alone as the official \nresponsible for executing the laws of our country.\n  The duty of a branch to respect the other branches is a duty that can \nonly be carried out by federal officeholders. It cannot be borne by \nprivate citizens. And it is fundamental to the operations of the \nfederal government. Our government could not function if the branches \ndid not respect one another. I believe President Clinton violated this \nfundamental duty to respect the judicial branch by subverting its \nfunction.\n  When a private citizen sued President Clinton under our civil rights \nstatutes, the President took the position that he was unique in our \nsystem of law and could not be sued while President. When the Supreme \nCourt ruled 9-0 that the President could be sued, the President decided \nto frustrate the judicial process while appearing outwardly to comply \nwith the requirement of our constitutional plan. As a practical matter, \nhe sought to veto this Supreme Court decision.\n  The evidence shows that he undertook a deliberate and multifaceted \nplan to thwart the Supreme Court ruling. That plan included the \ncommission of perjury and obstruction of justice, which are very \nserious and fundamental wrongs. Even worse is that his conduct was \nconscious and calculated. It was not a mistake of the moment. Rather he \ndeliberated and chose to commit perjury. He deliberated and chose to \nobstruct justice. In making these conscious and calculated choices, he \nplaced his personal and political interests above his presidential duty \nto respect the judicial branch.\n  This is what concerns me greatly. If the President is willing to \nplace his personal and political interests above his duties as \nPresident, he is not fit for the office he holds.\n  The President has, as one branch of the federal government, a duty to \nrespect the requirements of the judicial branch and its proceedings. \nThe President has, as the chief executive, an express duty to take care \nthat the laws be faithfully executed. In committing perjury and in \nobstructing justice, he exhibited an attitude dangerous to the \noperation of government--an attitude where he viewed himself as more \nimportant than the rule of law, where his personal and political \ninterests took precedence over the public interest in administering \nequal justice under law.\n  Ours is a nation ruled by law, not by men, and not by personalities. \nThe judgment that we render here will set a precedent for the ages. If \nCongress concludes that the office of the Presidency should remain \noccupied by one who has sullied it with premeditated criminal conduct \nin violation of constitutional and legal duty, then it will have \ndiminished America's right of self-defense against unfit officeholders, \nsomething that the Framers specifically provided for in the \nConstitution.\n  A President who commits perjury before a federal grand jury and \nobstructs justice poisons the well from which justice is administered. \nAs far as I know, this President has the dubious distinction of being \nthe first and only President in the history of the United States to lie \ndirectly to a federal grand jury. After taking an oath to tell the \ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, he deliberately \nviolated that oath. The first Chief Justice of the United States, John \nJay, accurately stated that there is no crime more extensively \npernicious to society than perjury. If the President commits perjury \nand we conclude that nevertheless he may remain in office, by what \nauthority does any judge ask any litigant to swear under oath?\n  As far as I am concerned, this is not just an empty question that has \nno relevance in today's society. Every day, in courtrooms and grand \njury rooms across the country, witnesses are asked to hold up their \nright hand and take an oath to tell the truth. The judicial process in \nthe United States depends on the sanctity of that oath. The \nprosecutorial function of the United States depends on the sanctity of \nthat oath. It\n\n[[Page S1522]]\n\nis the cornerstone of our system of justice. We simply cannot allow \npeople across the country to look at the conduct of our President and \nraise legitimate questions about whether they need to comply with their \nsolemn oaths.\n  Moreover, how can judges refer violations of perjury or obstruction \nof justice to the executive branch for prosecution, when the chief \nexecutive himself has committed these offenses? On prior occasions, the \nSenate has removed judges for perjury because it was ``incompatible'' \nto ask litigants not to commit perjury in a courtroom presided over by \nsomeone who had himself committed perjury. A similar \n``incompatibility'' exists where the sanction for perjury or \nobstruction of justice must be applied by the executive branch presided \nover by someone who has likewise committed these violations.\n  The President must be removed before the corrosive effect of his \nconduct eats away at the rule of law and undermines the legal system. \nTo imagine this President remaining in office brings to mind Alexander \nPope's troubling question: ``If gold should rust, what will iron do?'' \nIf our President commits perjury and obstruction of justice, what can \nwe expect of our citizens?\n  The Senate should seek to protect the legal system from that threat. \nAnd that is why I voted to convict and remove William Jefferson Clinton \nfrom office.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. Chief Justice and my Senate colleagues, we now close \none of the most serious chapters in the history of this Senate. While \nsome may not agree with the outcome, and others may not like the way I \nvoted, I'm satisfied the Constitution has been followed. We must now \naccept this verdict and try to work together without talk of revenge or \ngloating.\n  In reaching my conclusions, I asked myself two questions: Were the \narticles of impeachment proven, and if so, should the president be \nremoved from office?\n  I believe the president perjured himself before a grand jury. He put \nthe protection of his presidency ahead of the protection of the \ninstitution of the presidency. He gave false testimony about his \nefforts to keep other witnesses from telling the truth. We have already \nlearned in our history that lies lead to more lies, and the pattern in \nthis case led to perjury.\n  I also feel strongly that a case for obstruction of justice was \nproven conclusively. The Senate heard the many actions and motives of \nthe president, and it was easy to connect the dots. Those dots reveal a \nclear and convincing case against the president.\n  I believe the president tampered with the testimony of witnesses \nagainst him; that he allowed his lawyers to present false evidence on \nhis behalf; that he directed a job search for a witness in exchange for \nfalse testimony; and that he directed the recovery and hiding of \nevidence under subpoena.\n  Does this warrant the president's removal from office? I agree with \nmy respected colleague, Senator Byrd, that this reaches the level of \nhigh crimes and misdemeanors, for a number of reasons: The president's \nactions crossed the line between private and public behavior when those \nactions legally became the subject of a civil rights lawsuit against \nhim, and when he tried to undermine that lawsuit. His actions were an \nattack on the separation of powers between the executive and judicial \nbranches when he abused his power in an effort to obstruct justice. \nRemember, he impeded a lawsuit the highest court in our land allowed to \nproceed on a 9-0 vote.\n  It's clear even to some of the president's supporters that he \ncommitted many of the offenses he has been charged with. But given this \noutcome, I hope for our system of justice and for our character as a \nnation that these votes are never seen as treating actions such as \nperjury and obstruction of justice lightly, whether by a president or \nby any citizen.\n  Our new world of communications has made more information available \nto us than ever before. But it also contributed to the media overkill \nthat jaded the American people to this process long ago. When the \nLewinsky story became public, the president conducted a poll in which \nhe learned that Americans would tolerate a private affair, but not \nperjury or obstruction of justice. His goal from that point on to was \nto poison the well of public opinion. Once the focus shifted away from \nthe facts and toward opinion, once the clatter and clutter echoed on \n24-hour talk television, the president's goal was reached. But the \nfacts remain, and they are not in dispute.\n  Montanans didn't send me to the Senate to be a weathervane, shifting \nin the wind, but to be a compass. It may be common to say the \npresident's offenses don't ``rise to the level of high crimes and \nmisdemeanors,'' but I believe that would ignore our history and what we \nstand for as a nation.\n  That's why I also oppose censuring the president. The Constitution \ngives us one way to deal with impeachable offenses: a yes or no vote on \nguilt. Anything else would be like amending the Constitution on the fly \nand infringing on the separation of powers between the branches of \ngovernment.\n  As we accept this outcome and move forward, we have plenty of time \nleft ahead to help out Montana's farm and ranch communities, which is \nmy top priority. We have time to save Social Security in a way that \nfixes the program without raising taxes. We have time to give control \nof education back to parents and teachers, and to give federal funds to \nclassrooms, not bureaucrats. We have time to cut the record burden of \ntaxation on Montanans, many of whom are forced to take more than one \njob to make ends meet.\n  We should all roll up our sleeves and get to work.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. Chief Justice, in the absence of hearing something \nthat I haven't heard or seeing something that is unforeseen up to now, \nit is my plan to vote for conviction on the two Articles of \nImpeachment.\n  I think this is probably the most important vote I will cast during \nthe course of my lifetime. I say it very sincerely. I believe we are \ngoing to rise to the occasion.\n  I had an experience back in 1975, 24 years ago. I was a member of the \nState Senate in Oklahoma. I can remember being called for jury duty, \nand I was very happy to find myself assigned to a murder case about \nwhich I had already expressed a definite opinion. I said I believed \nthis defendant was surely guilty, and besides, I was the author of the \ncapital punishment bill in the state legislature. So I thought for sure \nI wasn't going to be qualified as a juror.\n  Well, I went through the qualification procedure and somehow they \nqualified me. Five days later, I was the foreman of the jury that \nacquitted that accused murderer. This can happen. It is an experience \nthat taught me a lot about our judicial system.\n  I sometimes say one of the few qualifications I have for the U.S. \nSenate is I am not a lawyer. So that when I read the Constitution, I \nknow what it says; when I read the oath of office, I know what it says; \nwhen I read the law, I know what it says. I don't have to clutter up my \nmind with what the definition of ``is'' is. So it makes it a little \neasier for me.\n  From a nonlawyer perspective let me share a couple of observations.\n  First, insofar as perjury is concerned--lying under oath--I might be \nwrong, but I don't think there is a Senator in this Chamber who doesn't \nbelieve the President lied under oath.\n  I quote from the White House counsel, Charles Ruff, himself who said: \n``Reasonable people can believe the President lied under oath.''\n  I quote from Senator Chuck Schumer who said: ``He lied under oath \nboth in the Paula Jones deposition and what he said in the grand \njury.''\n  I quote from Representative Robert Wexler, a strong supporter of the \nPresident, who serves on the House Judiciary Committee, who said: ``The \nPresident did not tell the truth. He lied under oath.''\n  I quote from former U.S. Senator Paul Simon, one of my favorite \nDemocrat colleagues, who appeared with me on a television program \nbefore the trial, who said: ``You have to be an extreme Clinton zealot \nto believe perjury was not committed.''\n  Second, as a non-attorney, I have a hard time reconciling the idea \nthat there might be certain permissible exceptions to telling the truth \nunder oath. Maybe you who are attorneys, and have a different \nbackground than mine, see it differently. But how can you reconcile \nthis idea that under some\n\n[[Page S1523]]\n\nconditions--if the subject matter is sex or something else--you can lie \nunder oath? I really have a hard time with this.\n  I know that morality is not supposed to be the issue here. We are \nsupposed to concentrate on the two specific Articles of Impeachment. \nHowever, I don't think anyone can completely compartmentalize himself \nand totally disregard other things going on.\n  All of us get many, many letters from young children, parents, \nteachers, and others who are deeply distressed about the President's \nbehavior and its impact on the moral health of the Nation. I think I am \nvery fortunate because my kids are all in their upper thirties and my \neight grandchildren (make that nine--I count them when they are \nconceived) are all under 6, so I don't get those embarrassing \nquestions. But I know many parents are struggling with this.\n  The other thing that concerns me is the reprehensible, consistent \nattitude this president has displayed over the years against women. \nTake Paula Jones as just one example. She may not win a popularity \npoll, but her civil rights have just as much standing as anyone else's, \ndo they not? Is not our country based on the principle that even the \nleast among us is entitled to equal treatment under the law?\n  It amazes me how these feminist organizations continue to hold this \nPresident in such high regard--groups such as the National Organization \nof Women. I went back and read their bylaws. They claim to want to \nprotect women with regard to ``equal rights and responsibilities in all \naspects of citizenship, public service, employment . . . including \nfreedom from discrimination.''\n  And here we have a president who not only misused his power to seduce \na college-age intern, but who has also engaged in extensive similar \nmisconduct outside of his marriage. It is not just Monica Lewinsky. \nThere is Gennifer Flowers, Elizabeth Ward Gracen, Paula Jones, Kathleen \nWilley, Dolly Kyle Browning, Beth Coulson, Susan McDougal, Cristy \nZercher--the list goes on and on.\n  This President has a consistent pattern of using and abusing women. \nYou know that. I imagine most of you watched the Monica Lewinsky tapes \nas I did. I don't know why the House managers didn't pick this up--\nsomehow they let it slip through--about when she told this story \nconcerning the two security badges. She came here to Washington, this \nwide-eyed kid, and there is a blue badge that lets you get into the \nWhite House proper and a pink badge that lets you only into the Old \nExecutive Office Building. And she wanted to be in there--in the West \nWing--where she could see what was going on.\n  She had the pink badge so she had to be escorted to the West Wing by \nsomeone else. So the very first day she meets and talks to the \nPresident in person, he begins the relationship we're talking about. He \ndidn't even know her name. And then he reached across and grabbed her \npink badge, yanked it down, and said, ``This is going to be a \nproblem.'' I don't think there is anyone in the room who doesn't know \nwhat he was referring to. He was preparing to use this girl and abuse \nher and discard her like an old shirt. But I know that these are not \nthings the lawyers expect us to consider.\n  I do want to give another observation, though. I thought the playing \nfield would be very uneven when this trial started. The members of the \nJudiciary Committee who are the House managers are all lawyers. But \nmostly, they are Congressmen first. Many of these Congressmen-lawyers \nhad not been in a courtroom for literally years. And here they were \ntaking on the most prestigious, the most prominent, the most skilled, \nthe most experienced, the highest priced lawyers anywhere in America. \nAnd yet when they finished with their opening statements, there was no \ndoubt the House managers had risen superbly to the occasion, and I \nbelieve they have done a great job throughout.\n  The White House lawyers are very skilled, very persuasive people. I \nwould make this observation--again, a non-lawyer observation: I felt \nthat three or four of them should have quit their opening remarks about \n5 minutes sooner than they did. They had a tendency to close their \npresentations with arguments that undermined their credibility.\n  Cheryl Mills, for example, was really doing well, and she was very \npersuasive until she started at the very last talking about the \nPresident's record on civil rights, as if the civil rights of a person \nhis associates had dubbed as ``trailer park trash'' were not \nsignificant, or the dignity of the intern he had branded ``a stalker'' \nwas not significant. I really think she destroyed her otherwise very \npersuasive presentation.\n  I think the same thing was true with Gregory Craig. He ended by \ntalking about how conviction in this case would somehow ``destroy a \nfundamental underpinning of democracy'' by overturning the results of \nan election, as if Bob Dole would come in if that were to happen.\n  Even our good friend, Dale Bumpers--I knew Dale Bumpers long before I \ncame here to the U.S. Senate--did a great job. But I think he should \nhave quit early, too, because at the very last it sounded like he was \npredicating the innocence of this President on his foreign policy. And \nas I just look at Iraq and what is going on over there, I think if that \nhad been the test for this, I could have made up my mind a lot earlier.\n  Another perspective I bring to this is as chairman of the Armed \nServices Subcommittee on Readiness. Having been in the service myself, \nand knowing how important discipline is, I am very disturbed that we \nhave so many cases where severe punishment is dealt to individuals who \nhave engaged in conduct far less serious than that of the President. \nConsider:\n  Captain Derrick Robinson, an Army officer, was caught up in the \nAberdeen sex misconduct case and is serving time in Leavenworth for \nadmitting to consensual sex with an enlisted person who was not his \nwife.\n  Delmar Simpson is serving 25 years in a military prison because a \ncourt-martial found that, even though his relationship with a female \nrecruit was consensual, the power granted him by his rank made such \nconsensual sex with a subordinate unacceptable. Think of the power \ngranted this President by his rank.\n  Remember Kelly Flinn. She is not flying B-52s anymore. She was forced \nout the Air Force for lying about an adulterous affair.\n  Sergeant Major Gene McKinney, the Army's top enlisted man, was tried \nfor perjury, adultery, and obstruction of justice--all concerning \nsexual misconduct. He was convicted of obstruction, but not before his \nattorney asserted at the trial how people in uniform rightly ask: ``How \ncan you hold an enlisted man to a higher standard than the President of \nthe United States, the Commander in Chief?''\n  So I have looked at this and studied it. I think anyone who votes to \nacquit has to say that we are going to hold this President to a lower \nstandard of conduct and behavior than we hold other people. I do not \nunderstand how they can come to any other conclusion.\n  My wife and I have been married 40 years. I have a thing called the \nwife test. You go home and when you want to get an opinion that is \ntotally apolitical, you ask your wife. So I went home and I presented \nthe case--as explained so eloquently by the White House lawyers and \nothers--on why we could have a lower standard of conduct for a \nPresident than we have for a judge. And I know the argument. And I \nexpressed the argument to my wife in the kitchen. I said, there are a \nthousand judges, only one President. I went through the whole thing. \nThen she looked up and said, ``I thought the President appointed the \njudges.'' You know, my wife is so dumb, she is always asking me \nquestions I can't answer.\n  But I really believe that in this case we are getting at the truth. I \nreally believe that the President of the United States should be held \nto the very highest of standards.\n  You know, Winston Churchill said: ``Truth is incontrovertible. \nIgnorance may deride it, panic may resent it, malice may destroy it, \nbut there it is.''\n  I think we have seen the truth. And I think the final truth is that \nthis President should be held to the very highest of standards.\n  Sometimes when I am not really sure I am right, I consult my best \nfriend. His name is Jesus. And I asked that\n\n[[Page S1524]]\n\nquestion. Now I will quote to you the response that is found in Luke: \n``From one who has been entrusted with more, much more will be asked.''\n  Mr. Chief Justice, I think Jesus is right.\n  Mr. CLELAND, Mr. Chief Justice, inasmuch as the impeachment trial of \nthe President has focused on the importance of oaths, I have begun to \nreflect on the oaths I have taken in my life. In terms of affirming my \nallegiance to this nation and the United States Constitution, I have \ntaken an oath four times. I have followed up each oath with my \nsignature.\n  The first such oath I took was when I was 21 years old. I was sworn \nin to the United States Army as a young Second Lieutenant. Later I \nfollowed my flag and my Commander-in-Chief in being a part of the armed \nmilitary forces in the Vietnam War.\n  After the war, I took another oath. This time I was sworn in as head \nof the Veterans' Administration under President Carter. I still \nremember that turbulent time after the Vietnam War when so many of my \nfellow veterans were returning from that conflict. The words from \nAbraham Lincoln's second inaugural address seemed to constantly echo in \nmy mind: ``. . .to care for him who has borne the battle and for his \nwidow and his orphan.'' Having been wounded in Vietnam myself I felt a \ngrave responsibility to carry out my oath on behalf of my fellow \nveterans.\n  The next time I took an oath it was January, 1997. It was on the \noccasion of being sworn into the United States Senate. As Vice \nPresident Al gore swore the new Senators in, I placed my right elbow on \nmy Bible and raised my left hand in an oath to defend the Constitution \nagainst ``all enemies, foreign and domestic.'' Once in the Senate, I \nwas fortunate to have been selected to follow distinguished former \nGeorgia Senators Richard B. Russell and Sam Nunn in service on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. I fully expected that any threat to \nour Constitution, our electoral process, or our delicately-honed system \nof checks and balances would come from outside our country, not from \nwithin.\n  I was wrong.\n  This leads me to my most recent oath to do ``impartial justice'' in \nthe Senate in the impeachment trial of the President of the United \nStates. In my personal view, this final oath, sealed with my signature \nin a book which will become part of the archives of American history, \nis a culmination of the other three oaths I have taken.\n  I have sworn to defend this country.\n  I have sworn to take care of its defenders.\n  I have sworn to uphold the Constitution for which my fellow defenders \nhave suffered and died.\n  How can I now turn my back and ignore the challenge to that \nConstitution posed by this precedent-setting, first-time ever \nimpeachment of an elected President of the United States?\n  I cannot.\n  When my name is called in regular order for my vote on the articles \nof impeachment, I will vote ``not guilty.''\n  I have reached my decision after much effort. I have tried to keep an \nopen mind and an open heart. I have attempted to search the depths of \nAmerican history and the lore of our English forebearers for insight \nand guidance. I have counseled privately with experts on American \nhistory and constitutional law. I have met with knowledgeable sources \ninside and outside the government. I have personally listened to \nconstituents in my state and throughout the nation. I have talked to \nthem on the phone, read their letters and scanned their e-mail. I have \ntried to weave an appropriate course through the barrage of media talk \nand the system of political reporters doing their duty.\n  I have given it my best shot.\n  I understand now what Alexander Hamilton meant when he predicted 212 \nyears ago that individual Senators faced with an impeachment trial had \nthe ``awful discretion'' of removing a President. Yet, I believe \nHamilton was correct when long ago he advocated placing his faith in \nthe Senators, where he hoped to find, ``dignity and independence.'' I \nbelieve that under the circumstances the Senate has conducted itself \nappropriately, and has complied with Hamilton's standards of conducting \nan impeachment trial with ``dignity and independence.'' I also believe \nthe Senate should continue to follow the standards set by our Founding \nFathers regarding the use of impeachment power. According to the \nFounders as articulated in the Constitution, the impeachment clearly \nshould be reserved for ``bribery, treason or other high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.'' This language did not just turn up in the Constitution \novernight. The language grew and evolved over a period of months in \nPhiladelphia in 1787.\n  One of the Founding Fathers who especially impressed me is George \nMason. Mason had an interesting background. Like many of our country's \nearly statesmen, he was from Virginia. For me, Mason is a bridge of \ninsight into what the impeachment clause in the Constitution is all \nabout.\n  Mason was a soldier. Indeed, he was an officer, a colonel. He, too, \nunderstood the grave responsibility of military leadership, of leading \nmen in combat and in caring for them afterwards. He certainly knew \nabout the gravity of his own personal oath. It was Mason, then, who \narticulated during the Constitutional Convention that the phrase in the \nConstitution regarding impeachment must be more fully fleshed out and \nshould more appropriately read ``. . . and other high crimes and \nmisdemeanors against the state.''\n  Here was a soldier of the American Revolution. Here was an officer in \nthat Revolution working with his fellow statesmen charting out a course \nfor the Nation's future. Here was a brother of the bond from Northern \nVirginia who wanted to make sure the actual Constitutional language was \nclear that any impeachment must rise to a high level. According to the \nthrust of Mason's argument, for an impeachment of the President to be \nlegitimate, the impeachable offenses must pose a threat to the nation \nitself. The Committee which reviewed the language believed that the \nphrase ``against the state'' was redundant, and, in effect, assumed.\n\n  President Clinton has committed serious offenses. His personal \nconduct in this matter was, as I have said before, wrongful, \nreprehensible and indefensible. He has admitted to personal offenses, \nand will be appropriately judged for his misconduct elsewhere. In my \njudgement, under all the others I have taken under the United States \nConstitution, his offenses do not rise to the required level for \nimpeachable offenses under the United States Constitution.\n  I will be voting against conviction and removal from office of the \nPresident on both articles because I do not believe that these \nparticular charges reach the high standard for impeachment which I \nbelieve that George Mason and the other Founders intended: that such an \noffense must be conduct which threatens grievous harm to our entire \nsystem. I provided more detail about the reasons for these conclusions \nin an earlier statement I submitted for the Record, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that those remarks be inserted following this statement.\n  As the Senate concludes this trial, I am reminded of other words from \nAbraham Lincoln's second Inaugural Address: ``with malice toward none, \nwith clarity for all, let us bind up the nation's wounds . . .'' If \nLincoln can say that as the nation was concluding the most divisive \ntime in our history, which ultimately resulted in the first impeachment \ntrial of an American President, surely we can say that to each other \nand to our nation as we conclude this historical second impeachment \ntrial.\n  It is time to end this trial.\n  It is time to let the President conclude the term he was elected to \nby the American people.\n  It is time to put an end to partisan bickering about the motives and \nconduct of all of those who have become involved in this sad episode.\n  It is time for us all to bind up the nation's wounds.\n  It is time to get on with the business of the American people we were \nelected to conduct.\n  I ask that a supplement of my statement be printed in the Record.\n  Thank you.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The Impeachment of President William Jefferson Clinton\n\n       Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, let me begin by saying that the \n     reason we are here today, the reason the United States Senate \n     is being asked to exercise what Alexander Hamilton\n\n[[Page S1525]]\n\n     termed the ``awful discretion'' of impeachment, is because of \n     the wrongful, reprehensible, indefensible conduct of one \n     person, the President of the United States, William Jefferson \n     Clinton. Indeed, I believe it is conduct deserving of the \n     censure of the Senate, and I will support such a resolution \n     when it comes before us.\n       The question before the Senate, however, is not whether the \n     President's conduct was wrong, or immoral, or even \n     censurable. We must decide solely as to whether or not he \n     should be convicted of the allegations contained in the \n     Articles of Impeachment and thus removed from office. In my \n     opinion, the case for removal, presented in great detail in \n     the massive 60,000 page report submitted by the House, in \n     many hours of very capable but often repetitive presentations \n     to the Senate by the House Managers and the President's \n     defense team, and in many additional hours of Senators' \n     questioning of the two sides, fails to meet the very high \n     standards which we must demand with respect to Presidential \n     impeachments. Therefore, I will vote to dismiss the \n     impeachment case against William Jefferson Clinton, and to \n     vote for the Senate resuming other necessary work for the \n     American people.\n       To this very point, I have reserved my judgment on this \n     question because of my Constitutional responsibility and Oath \n     to ``render impartial justice'' in this case. Most of the \n     same record presented in great detail to Senators in the \n     course of the last several weeks has long been before the \n     public, and indeed most of that public, including editorial \n     boards, talk show hosts, and so forth, long ago reached their \n     own conclusions as to the impeachment of President Clinton. \n     But I have now heard enough to make my decision. With respect \n     to the witnesses the House Managers apparently now wish to \n     depose and call before the Senate, the existing record \n     represents multiple interrogations by the Office of the \n     Independent Counsel and its Grand Jury, with not only no \n     cross-examinations by the President's counsel but, with the \n     exception of the President's testimony, without even the \n     presence of the witnesses own counsel. It is difficult for me \n     to see how that record would possibly be improved from the \n     prosecution's standpoint. Thus, I will not support motions to \n     depose or call witnesses.\n       In reaching my decision on impeachment, there are a number \n     of factors which have been discussed or speculated about in \n     the news media which were not a part of my calculations.\n       First of all, while as political creatures neither the \n     Senate nor the House can or should be immune from public \n     opinion, we have a very precise Constitutionally-prescribed \n     responsibility in this matter, and popular opinion must not \n     be controlling consideration. I believe Republican Senator \n     William Pitt Fessenden of Maine said it best during the only \n     previous Presidential Impeachment Trial in 1868:\n       ``To the suggestion that popular opinion demands the \n     conviction of the President on these charges, I reply that he \n     is not now on trial before the people, but before the Senate \n     . . . The people have not heard the evidence as we have heard \n     it. The responsibility is not on them, but upon us. They have \n     not taken an oath to ``do impartial justice according to the \n     Constitution and the laws.'' I have taken that oath. I cannot \n     render judgment upon their convictions, nor can they transfer \n     to themselves my punishment if I violate my own. And I should \n     consider myself undeserving of the confidence of that just \n     and intelligent people who imposed upon me this great \n     responsibility, and unworthy of a place among honorable men, \n     if for any fear of public reprobation, and for the sake of \n     securing popular favor, I should disregard the convictions of \n     my judgment and my conscience.''\n       Nor was my decision premised on the notion, suggested by \n     some, that the stability of our government would be severely \n     jeopardized by the impeachment of President Clinton. I have \n     full faith in the strength of our government and its leaders \n     and, more importantly, faith in the American people to cope \n     successfully with whatever the Senate decides. There can be \n     no doubt that the impeachment of a President would not be \n     easy for the country but just in this Century, about to end, \n     we have endured great depressions and world wars. Today, the \n     U.S. economy is strong, the will of the people to move beyond \n     this national nightmare is great, and we have an experienced \n     and able Vice President who is more than capable of stepping \n     up and assuming the role of the President.\n       Third, although we have heard much argument that the \n     precedents of judicial impeachments should be controlling in \n     this case, I have not been convinced and did not rely on such \n     testimony in making my decision. After review of the record, \n     historical precedents, and consideration of the different \n     roles of Presidents and federal judges, I have concluded that \n     there is indeed a different legal standard for impeachment of \n     Presidents and federal judges. Article II, Section 4 of the \n     Constitution provides that ``the President, Vice President, \n     and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed \n     from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, \n     Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Article \n     III, Section I of the Constitution indicates that judges \n     ``shall hold their Offices during good Behavior.'' Presidents \n     are elected by the people and serve for a fixed term of \n     years, while federal judges are appointed without public \n     approval to serve a life tenure without any accountability to \n     the public. Therefore, under our system, impeachment is the \n     only way to remove a federal judge from office while \n     Presidents serve for a specified term and face accountability \n     to the pubic through elections. With respect to the differing \n     impeachment standards themselves, Chief Justice Rehnquist \n     once wrote, ``the terms `treason, bribery and other high \n     crimes and misdemeanors' are narrower than the malfeasance in \n     office and failure to perform the duties of the office, which \n     maybe grounds for forfeiture of office held during good \n     behavior.''\n       And my conclusions with respect to impeachment were not \n     based upon consideration of the proper punishment of \n     President Clinton for his misdeeds. During the impeachment of \n     President Nixon, the Report by the Staff of the Impeachment \n     Inquiry concluded that ``impeachment is the first step in a \n     remedial process--removal from office and possible \n     disqualification from holding future office. The purpose of \n     impeachment is not personal punishment; its function is \n     primarily to maintain constitutional government.'' Regardless \n     of the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial, President \n     Clinton remains subject to censure by the House and \n     Senate, and criminal prosecution for any crimes he may \n     have committed. Whatever punishment President Clinton \n     deserves for his misdeeds will be provided elsewhere.\n       Finally, I do not believe that perjury or obstruction of \n     justice could never rise to the level of threatening grievous \n     harm to the Republic, and thus represent adequate grounds for \n     removal of a President. However, we must approach such a \n     determination with the greatest of care. Impeachment of a \n     President is, perhaps with the power to declare War, the \n     gravest of Constitutional responsibilities bestowed upon the \n     Congress. During the history of the United States, the Senate \n     has only held impeachment trials for two Presidents, the 1868 \n     trial of President Johnson, who had not been elected to that \n     office, and now President Clinton. Although the Senate can \n     look to impeachment trials of other public officials, \n     primarily judicial, as I have already said, I do not believe \n     that those precedents are or should be controlling in \n     impeachment trials of Presidents, or indeed of other elected \n     officials.\n       My decision was based on one overriding concern: the impact \n     of this precedent-setting case on the future of the \n     Presidency, and indeed of the Congress itself. It is not Bill \n     Clinton who should occupy our only attention. He already \n     stands rebuked by the House impeachment votes, and by the \n     words of virtually every member of Congress of both political \n     parties. And even if we do not remove him from office, he \n     still stands liable to future criminal prosecution for his \n     actions, as well as to the verdict of history. No, it is Mr. \n     Clinton's successors, Republican, Democrat or any other \n     Party, who should be our concern.\n       The Republican Senator, Edmund G. Ross of Kansas, who \n     ``looked down into my open grave'' of political oblivion when \n     he cast one of the decisive votes in acquitting Andrew \n     Johnson in spite of his personal dislike of the President, \n     explained his motivation this way:\n       ``In a large sense, the independence of the executive \n     office as a coordinate branch of the government was on trial \n     . . . If . . . the President must step down . . . upon \n     insufficient proofs and from partisan considerations, the \n     office of President would be degraded, cease to be a \n     coordinate branch of government, and ever after subordinated \n     to the legislative will. It would practically have \n     revolutionized our splendid political fabric into a partisan \n     Congressional autocracy.''\n       While our government is certainly on a stronger foundation \n     now than in the aftermath of the Civil War, the basic point \n     remains valid. If anything, in today's world of rapidly \n     emerging events and threats, we need an effective, \n     independent Presidency even more than did mid-19th Century \n     Americans.\n       While in the history of the United States the U.S. Senate \n     has never before considered impeachment articles against a \n     sitting elected official, we do have numerous cases of each \n     House exercising its Constitutional right to, ``punish its \n     Members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of \n     two-thirds expel a Member.'' However, since the Civil War, \n     while a variety of cases involving personal and private \n     misconduct have been considered, the Senate has never voted \n     to expel a member, choosing to censure instead on seven \n     occasions, and the House has rarely chosen the ultimate \n     sanction. Should the removal of a President be subject to \n     greater punishment with lesser standards of evidence than the \n     Congress has applied to itself when the Constitution appears \n     to call for the reverse in limiting impeachment to cases of \n     ``treason, bribery and other high crimes or misdemeanors?'' \n     In my view, the answer must be NO.\n       Thus, for me, as one United States Senator, the bar for \n     impeachment and removal from office of a President must be a \n     high one, and I want the record to reflect that my vote to \n     dismiss is based upon a standard of evidence equivalent to \n     that used in criminal proceedings--that is, that guilt must \n     be proven ``beyond a reasonable doubt''--and a standard of \n     impeachable offense which, in my view, conforms to the \n     Founders' intentions that such an offense must be one which \n     represents official misconduct threatening grievous harm to \n     our whole system of government. To quote Federalist No. 65, \n     Hamilton defined as impeachable, ``those offenses which \n     proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other \n     words, from the abuse or\n\n[[Page S1526]]\n\n     violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which \n     may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as \n     they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the \n     society itself.'' As I have said before, I can conceive of \n     instances in which both perjury and obstruction of justice \n     would meet this test, and I certainly believe that most, \n     if not all, capital crimes, including murder, would \n     qualify for impeachment and removal from office. However, \n     in my judgment, the current case does not reach the \n     necessary high standard.\n       In the words of John F. Kennedy, ``with a good conscience \n     our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our \n     deeds,'' I believe that dismissal of the impeachment case \n     against William Jefferson Clinton is the appropriate action \n     for the U.S. Senate. It is the action which will best \n     preserve the system of government which has served us so well \n     for over two hundred years, a system of checks and balances, \n     with a strong and independent chief executive.\n       In closing, I wish to address those in the Senate and \n     House, and among the American public, who have reached a \n     different conclusion than have I in this case. I do not \n     question the sincerity or legitimacy of your viewpoint. The \n     process itself pushes us to make absolute judgments--yes or \n     no to conviction and removal from office--and the nature of \n     debate yields portraits of complex issues in stark black-and-\n     white terms, but I believe it is possible for reasonable \n     people to reach different conclusions on this matter. Indeed, \n     I recognize that, while my decision seeks to avoid the \n     dangers of setting the impeachment bar too low, setting that \n     bar too high is not without risks. I believe the House \n     Managers spoke eloquently about the need to preserve respect \n     for the rule of law, including the critical principle that no \n     one, not even the President of the United States, is above \n     that rule. However, I have concluded that the threat to our \n     system of a weakened Presidency, made in some ways \n     subordinate to the will of the legislative branch, outweighs \n     the potential harm to the rule of law, because that latter \n     risk is mitigated by: an intact, independent criminal justice \n     system, which indeed will retain the ability to render final, \n     legal judgment on the President's conduct; a vigorous, \n     independent press corps which remains perfectly capable of \n     exposing such conduct, and of extracting a personal, \n     professional and political price; and an independent Congress \n     which will presumably continue to have the will and means to \n     oppose Presidents who threaten our system of government.\n       By the very nature of this situation, where I sit in \n     judgment of a Democratic President as a Democratic Senator, I \n     realize that my decision cannot convey the non-partisanship \n     which is essential to achieve closure on this matter, one way \n     or the other. Indeed, in words which could have been written \n     today, the chief proponent among the Founding Fathers of a \n     vigorous Chief Executive, Alexander Hamilton, wrote in 1788, \n     in No. 65 of The Federalist Papers, that impeachments ``will \n     seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, \n     and to divide them into parties, more or less friendly or \n     inimical, to the accused. In many cases, it will connect \n     itself with the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all \n     their animosities, partialities, influence and interest on \n     side, or on the other; and in such cases there will always be \n     the greatest danger, that the decision will be regulated more \n     by the comparative strength of the parties than by real \n     demonstration of guilt or innocence.''\n       I have, however, in making my decision laid out for you the \n     standards which I believe to be appropriate whenever the \n     Congress considers the removal from office of an elected \n     official, whether Executive Branch, or Legislative Branch. I \n     will do my best to stand by those standards in all such cases \n     to come before me while I have the privilege of representing \n     the people of Georgia in the United States Senate, regardless \n     of the party affiliation of the accused. I only hope and pray \n     that no future President, of either Party, will ever again \n     engage in conduct which provides any basis, including the \n     basis of the current case, for the Congress to consider the \n     grave question of impeachment.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I rise to explain my decision to convict President William \nJefferson Clinton on two Articles of Impeachment charging him with High \nCrimes and Misdemeanors. I have heard from thousands of fellow \nTennesseans during this trial, and their opinions were deeply split. \nWhile I looked to the people of Tennessee for guidance, responsibility \nfor my final vote ultimately turned on my own conscience. I am sure \nthat this will be one of the most important votes I cast as a United \nStates Senator, and I am honored to explain fully my vote.\n\n\n                  Introduction and the Burden of Proof\n\n  I sought throughout President Clinton's trial to be true to my oath \nto do ``impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States.'' When I raised my right hand and swore that oath on \nJanuary 7, I accepted a solemn responsibility. I did not approach this \ntrial with some preordained outcome in mind; I carefully listened \nduring the five weeks of this trial to the evidence and the arguments, \nand sought to do justice.\n  In considering the allegations against President Clinton, I believed \nthat I should apply a ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' burden of proof--\neven though the Constitution does not specify a particular burden of \nproof in impeachment trials. The Constitution entrusts the decision to \nconvict an impeached officer to the individual judgment of each \nSenator; however, I wanted to give the President the benefit of the \nsame high standard of proof applied in criminal trials. I would remove \na President from office only if the House Managers met this rigorous \nburden of proof.\n  The jury instructions used in federal courts explain what must be \nestablished to meet this burden of proof:\n\n       Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond \n     all possible doubt. Possible doubts or doubts based purely on \n     speculation are not reasonable doubts. A reasonable doubt is \n     based on reason and common sense. It may arise from evidence, \n     the lack of evidence, or the nature of the evidence.\n       Proof beyond a reasonable doubt means proof which is so \n     convincing that you would not hesitate to rely and act on it \n     in making the most important decisions in your own lives.\n\n  In the end, I concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that President \nClinton repeatedly lied under oath before a federal grand jury. I also \nconcluded beyond a reasonable doubt that he engaged in a calculated, \npremeditated campaign to obstruct justice. I now wish to address each \nof those articles of impeachment in turn.\n\n\n                           Grand Jury Perjury\n\n  The circumstantial and direct evidence demonstrates beyond a \nreasonable doubt that President Clinton committed perjury during his \ngrand jury appearance. The criminal law of the United States forbids \nperjury before a grand jury. To prove a case of grand jury perjury, a \nprosecutor must demonstrate: (1) that the defendant testified under \noath before a grand jury; (2) that the testimony so given was false in \none or more respects; (3) the false testimony concerned material \nmatters; and (4) the false testimony was knowingly given. There are \nthree instances during the President's August 17, 1998 grand jury \ntestimony in which these four elements were established.\n  First, he lied when he denied that he had ``sexual relations'' with \nMs. Lewinsky, even under his own interpretation of the definition of \nthat term. Quite simply, Ms. Lewinsky offered a detailed account of \nnumerous times when they did engage in such relations, even under \nPresident Clinton's interpretation of that term. Her testimony is \ncorroborated by contemporaneous accounts she offered to a number of \nfriends and professional counselors. President Clinton conjured up a \ntortured definition of the term ``sexual relations'' to explain the \nblue dress (and its physical evidence corroborating sexual relations) \nto the grand jury--while still asserting the truthfulness of his \nearlier denial of ``sexual relations'' in his deposition in the Paula \nJones sexual harassment suit. This attempt to have it both ways, in \nturn, forced him to lie before the grand jury about the details and \nnature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. There is no doubt in my \nmind that President Clinton lied about this matter. Moreover, this lie \nwas material; that is, it had the tendency to affect the grand jury's \ninvestigation. That investigation focused on President Clinton's \npossible perjury and obstruction of justice in the Jones case. Lying to \nthe grand jury to attempt to deny the earlier perjury in the Jones \ndeposition was clearly material to that investigation.\n  Second, President Clinton lied to the grand jury about his attempt to \ncoach Ms. Currie immediately following the deposition. This coaching, \nwhich I will discuss in more detail later, was explicitly denied by the \nPresident before the grand jury. His testimony that he made a series of \nfalse statements to Ms. Currie and sought her agreement with them \nmerely in an attempt ``to refresh [his] memory about what the facts \nwere'' and that he was ``trying to get as much information as quickly \nas [he] could'' is false. He did not ask her what she recalled; he made \nfalse declarations and sought her agreement with them. One cannot \nrefresh one's recollection by making knowingly false statements to \nanother. This is a classic example of why courts instruct juries to use \ntheir common sense in resolving factual disputes. Moreover, President \nClinton coached her twice in\n\n[[Page S1527]]\n\nthe exact same manner: Once on January 18, 1998, and again on January \n20 or January 21. He had just finished lying in his civil deposition on \nJanuary 17, and he wanted to enlist her support for his lies if she was \ncalled by Paula Jones' lawyers--as she was on January 22. Again, this \nissue was plainly material to an investigation into President Clinton's \npossible obstruction of justice.\n  Third, President Clinton lied to the grand jury about attempting to \ninfluence the testimony of his aides whom he knew would be called \nbefore the grand jury. These allegations are discussed later. For now, \nit is only important to note that he testified that he ``said to them \nthings that were true about this relationship. . . . So, I said things \nthat were true. They may have been misleading. . . .'' In fact, he lied \nto his aides, as even Sidney Blumenthal stated in his videotaped \ndeposition testimony. It is understandable that President Clinton would \nnot admit to the grand jury that he lied to these aides, because to do \nso would admit that he obstructed justice. He could have asserted his \nfifth amendment right against self-incrimination; however, he chose to \nlie. He denied that he had lied to these aides. The Supreme Court has \naddressed just this sort of a lie, stating: ``A citizen may decline to \nanswer the question, or answer it honestly, but he cannot with impunity \nknowingly and willfully answer with a falsehood.''\n\n\n                         Obstruction of Justice\n\n  The evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that President \nClinton obstructed justice. He suggested that Ms. Lewinsky submit a \nfalse affidavit in a civil case. He coached a potential witness (Ms. \nCurrie) in the civil case and the grand jury investigation by repeating \na series of assertions to her that he knew to be false in the hope that \nshe would adopt those assertions as her own. Last, he made false \nstatements to his top advisors, knowing that they would then repeat \nthose statements to a federal grand jury.\n  The United States criminal code makes it illegal for one to obstruct \njustice. The precise wording of the general obstruction of justice \nstatute--Title 18, section 1503 of the United States Code--provides: \n``Whoever . . . corruptly . . . influences, obstructs, or impedes, or \nendeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of \njustice, shall be punished. . . .'' Courts have interpreted the word \n``corruptly'' to mean that the defendant had an intent to obstruct, \nimpair, or impede the due administration of justice. In other words, \none need not use threats of force or intimidation to obstruct justice. \nThus, one who merely proposes to a potential witness that the witness \nlie in a judicial proceeding is guilty of obstructing justice.\n  Also, an additional federal statute, section 1512 of Title 18, deals \nspecifically with witness tampering. It provides: ``Whoever . . . \ncorruptly persuades another person, or attempts to do so, or engages in \nmisleading conduct toward another person with intent to . . . \ninfluence, delay, or prevent the testimony of any person in an official \nproceeding . . . shall be fined under this title or imprisoned. . . .'' \nUnlike section 1503, section 1512 has been interpreted as applying to \nmore than just ``pending'' judicial proceedings; courts have found it \nadequate that a defendant ``feared'' that such a proceeding might begin \nand sought to influence the testimony of those who may be witnesses in \nsuch a proceeding.\n  With this statutory backdrop in mind, I turn first to the allegation \nthat President Clinton urged Ms. Lewinsky to submit a false affidavit \nand deny their sexual relationship. The evidence establishes that he \ntelephoned her between 2:00 and 2:30 a.m. on December 17, 1997. \nAccording to Ms. Lewinsky, President Clinton informed her that she was \non the witness list in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. He \nthen suggested that, if she were subpoenaed to give a deposition, ``she \ncould sign an affidavit to try to satisfy [Ms. Jones's] inquiry and not \nbe deposed.'' As has been pointed out, a truthful affidavit about their \nrelationship would not have prevented her deposition; in fact, a \ntruthful affidavit would have encouraged the deposition. \nNotwithstanding this obvious fact, President Clinton's lawyers \nvigorously asserted at trial that a ``limited but truthful'' affidavit \ncould have misled the Jones lawyers sufficiently to avoid her being \ndeposed.\n  The problem with this defense is that President Clinton on December \n17, in the very same telephone conversation in which he suggested the \naffidavit, also encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to continue with the ``cover \nstories'' they had used to hide their relationship. According to Ms. \nLewinsky, he told her that she ``should say she visited [the White \nHouse] to see Ms. Currie and, on occasion when working at [the White \nHouse] she brought him letters when no one else was around.'' Of \ncourse, Ms. Lewinsky was going to the White House to see President \nClinton, and the only time she ``brought him letters'' was to cover \ntheir illicit rendezvous. These cover stories, hatched as explanations \nto prevent co-workers from discovering their sexual relationship, \namounted to obstruction of justice when the President suggested their \nuse in judicial proceedings. These cover stories ultimately found their \nway into drafts of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit. The evidence establishes \nbeyond a reasonable doubt that President Clinton was urging Ms. \nLewinsky to file a false and misleading affidavit in the Jones case.\n  As one court has observed, conduct amounting to less than an explicit \ncommand to lie can nonetheless form the basis for an obstruction \nconviction: ``The statute prohibits elliptical suggestions as much as \nit does direct commands.'' There is no reasonable doubt that President \nClinton was suggesting that Ms. Lewinsky file an affidavit consistent \nwith their previously-agreed upon cover stories. Ms. Lewinsky testified \nthat she understood after that conversation that she would deny their \nrelationship to Paula Jones' lawyers.\n  The evidence also establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that \nPresident Clinton sought to tamper with the testimony of his secretary, \nMs. Currie. Within a few hours of completing his deposition in the \nJones case on Saturday, January 17, 1998, President Clinton called \nBetty Currie and made an unusual request: She should come to work to \nmeet with him the following day, Sunday. Sunday afternoon, she met with \nhim at her desk outside the Oval Office. Ms. Currie testified that he \nseemed ``concerned.'' He told her that he had been asked questions the \nprevious day about Ms. Lewinsky. According to Ms. Currie, he then said, \n```There are several things you may want to know.''' After that, he \nmade a series of statements:\n\n       ``You were always there when she was there, right?''\n       ``We were never really alone.''\n       ``Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?''\n       ``You can see and hear everything, right?''\n       ``Monica wanted to have sex with me, but I told her I \n     couldn't do that.''\n\n  Ms. Currie further testified that, although President Clinton did not \n``pressure'' her, she observed from his demeanor and the way he said \nthese statements that he wanted her to agree with those statements. She \ndid agree with each statement, though she knew them to be false or \nbeyond her knowledge.\n\n  There is no reasonable doubt that this meeting was an attempt by \nPresident Clinton to coach Ms. Currie's probable testimony. In fact, \nduring the previous day's deposition, President Clinton invoked Ms. \nCurrie's name in relation to Ms. Lewinsky on at least six different \noccasions, even going so far as to tell Ms. Jones' lawyers that they \nwould have to ``ask Betty'' whether he was ever alone with Ms. Lewinsky \nbetween midnight and 6:00 a.m. Simply put, he made her a potential \nwitness in the Jones case. One who attempts to corruptly influence the \ntestimony of a prospective witness has obstructed justice. (In fact, \nthe Jones lawyers issued a subpoena for Ms. Currie a few days after \nPresident Clinton's deposition.)\n  President Clinton's assertion that he posed these statements to Ms. \nCurrie merely to refresh his recollection and test her own memory of \nthe events is undercut by his repetition of the coaching exercise a few \ndays later. According to Ms. Currie, either two or three days later he \ncalled her in again, presented the same statements (with which she \nagain agreed), and had the same ``tone and demeanor'' as he had during \nthe Sunday coaching session. This amounted to egregious witness \ntampering.\n  Last, the unrefuted evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt \nthat\n\n[[Page S1528]]\n\nPresident Clinton obstructed justice by giving a false account of his \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky to aides that, by his own admission, he \nknew might be called by the grand jury. John Podesta, then-Deputy Chief \nof Staff to President Clinton, testified before the grand jury about a \nconversation with President Clinton on January 23, 1998:\n\n       [H]e said to me he had never had sex with her [Ms. \n     Lewinsky], and that--and that he never asked--you know, he \n     repeated the denial, but he was extremely explicit in saying \n     he never had sex with her.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Well, I think he said--he said that--there was some spate \n     of, you know, what sex acts were counted, and he said that he \n     had never had sex with her in any way whatsoever--that they \n     had not had oral sex.\n\n  This, as we now know, was false. Yet, according to Mr. Podesta, \nPresident Clinton ``was very forceful. I believed what he was saying.''\n  More important, on January 21, 1998, President Clinton told aide \nSidney Blumenthal the following utterly false story:\n\n       He said, ``Monica Lewinsky came at me and made a sexual \n     demand on me.'' He rebuffed her. He said, ``I've gone down \n     that road before, I've caused pain for a lot of people and \n     I'm not going to do that again.''\n       She threatened him. She said that she would tell people \n     they'd had an affair, that she was known as the stalker among \n     her peers, and that she hated it and if she had an affair or \n     said she had an affair then she wouldn't be a stalker any \n     more.\n\n  This story is eerily reminiscent of President Clinton's coaching of \nBetty Currie (``Monica wanted to have sex with me, but I told her I \ncouldn't do that.''). President Clinton sought to portray himself as a \nvictim of Ms. Lewinsky. At the time, Mr. Blumenthal ``certainly \nbelieved his story. It was a very heartfelt story, he was pouring out \nhis heart, and I believed him.'' Mr. Blumenthal admitted to the Senate \nthat he now knows the President's story was a lie.\n  President Clinton does not deny the testimony of either Mr. Podesta \nor Mr. Blumenthal. Their testimony establishes a clear-cut case of \nobstruction. The President admitted knowing that both were likely to be \ncalled to testify before the grand jury. According to their testimony, \nhe provided them with a false account of his relationship with Ms. \nLewinsky--and President Clinton does not deny their version of events. \nThe unrefuted evidence establishes obstruction of justice. As the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals has stated: ``The most obvious example \nof a section 1512 [witness tampering] violation may be the situation \nwhere a defendant tells a potential witness a false story as if the \nstory were true, intending that the witness believe the story and \ntestify to it before the grand jury.''\n  I did not vote to convict President Clinton on every ground presented \nby the House Managers. For example, though I was concerned that the \nintensification of efforts to secure Ms. Lewinsky a private sector job \nwere undertaken to influence her testimony (and secure a false \naffidavit from her), I had reasonable doubt that there was a \nsufficiently direct nexus between the two to justify finding against \nPresident Clinton on that basis. The videotaped testimony of Vernon \nJordan nearly made the case, but fell just short. Accordingly, I did \nnot consider that element of the obstruction of justice case to be \ngrounds for removing President Clinton.\n  Another serious allegation of obstruction of justice concerned the \nmysterious fact that subpoenaed gifts from President Clinton to Ms. \nLewinsky were found underneath Ms. Currie's bed. The evidence tends to \nestablish that President Clinton directed Ms. Currie to get gifts from \nMs. Lewinsky; however, I cannot say that the proof establishes beyond a \nreasonable doubt that this occurred. In the absence of hearing directly \nfrom Ms. Currie as a witness on this issue and having the chance to \nlook her in the eye and gauge her credibility, I cannot resolve beyond \na reasonable doubt the testimonial conflict between Ms. Lewinsky and \nMs. Currie on who initiated the return of the gifts. The weight of the \nevidence suggests that Ms. Currie initiated the return on instructions \nfrom President Clinton; however, without Ms. Currie's testimony, I \ncannot say that case has been proven ``beyond a reasonable doubt.''\n  For this reason, I am disappointed that the Senate chose to cut \nitself off from hearing from whatever fact witnesses either side wished \nto call. I voted to allow live testimony, but the motion was \nunsuccessful. Although there was ample evidence upon which to convict \nfor many allegations, some allegations remain in doubt. Rather than \nhave a traditional trial, we listened to lawyers argue, then argue some \nmore, and then a bit more. The only time we actually had a chance to \nsee witnesses was when we were allowed to see the videotapes of Ms. \nLewinsky, Mr. Jordan, and Mr. Blumenthal. I learned from those tapes. \nThe presence of live witnesses in accord with Senate precedent would \nhave been helpful. I regret that the Senate chose not to allow live \nwitnesses and that we did not see their cross-examination. We did not \nuse the most powerful weapons in our truth-seeking arsenal. This \ntruncated ``trial'' may have been politically expedient, but I doubt \nhistory will judge it kindly.\n\n\n                      High Crimes and Misdemeanors\n\n  Having found that President Clinton committed the crimes of perjury \nand obstruction of justice, my duty to uphold the Constitution of the \nUnited States made it clear that these offenses were high crimes and \nmisdemeanors requiring his removal from office. There is no serious \nquestion that perjury and obstruction of justice are high crimes and \nmisdemeanors. Blackstone's famous Commentaries--widely read by the \nframers of the Constitution--put perjury on equal footing with bribery \nas a crime against the state. Perjury was understood to be as serious \nas bribery, which is specifically mentioned in the Constitution as a \nground for impeachment. Today, we punish perjury and obstruction of \njustice at least as severely as we punish bribery. Apparently, the \nseriousness of perjury and obstruction of justice has not diminished \nover time.\n  Indeed, our own Senate precedent establishes that perjury is a high \ncrime and misdemeanor. The Senate has removed seven federal judges from \noffice. During the 1980s, three judges were convicted for the high \ncrime and misdemeanor of perjury. Federal judges are removed under the \nexact same Constitutional provision--Article II, section 4--upon which \nwe remove presidents. To not remove President Clinton for grand jury \nperjury lowers uniquely the Constitution's removal standard, and thus \nrequires less of the man who appoints all federal judges than we \nrequire of those judges themselves.\n  I will have no part in the creation of a constitutional double-\nstandard to benefit the President. He is not above the law. If an \nordinary citizen committed these crimes, he would go to jail. Many \nsenators have voted to remove federal judges guilty of perjury, and I \nhave no doubt that the Senate would do so again. Those who by their \nvotes today confer immunity on the President for the same crimes do \nviolence to the core principle that we are all entitled to equal \njustice under law.\n  Moreover, I agree with the view of Judge Griffin Bell, President \nJimmy Carter's Attorney General and a former Judge of the United States \nCourt of Appeals, Fifth Circuit. Judge Bell has stated: ``A President \ncannot faithfully execute the laws if he himself is breaking them.'' \nThese offenses--perjury and obstruction of justice--are not trivial; \nthey represent an assault on the judicial process. Again, Judge Bell's \nwords are instructive:\n\n       Truth and fairness are the two essential elements in a \n     judicial system, and all of these statutes I mentioned, \n     perjury, tampering with a witness, obstruction of justice, \n     all [are] in the interest of truth. If we don't have truth in \n     the judicial process and in the court system in our country, \n     we don't have anything. So, this is serious business.\n\n  I agree. The crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice are public \ncrimes threatening the administration of justice. They therefore fit \nAlexander Hamilton's famous description of impeachable offenses in \nFederalist No. 65: ``[O]ffences which proceed from the misconduct of \npublic men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some \npublic trust.'' The electorate entrusted President Clinton to enforce \nthe laws, yet he chose to engage in a pattern of public crime against \nour system of justice. We must not countenance the commission of such \nserious crimes by the chief executive of our nation.\n  The President broke his oath to tell the truth, the whole truth, and \nnothing\n\n[[Page S1529]]\n\nbut the truth, so help him God. He likewise broke his oaths to take \ncare that the laws be faithfully executed.\n  Just how important are oaths? We take oaths to substantiate the \nsanctity of some of our highest callings. Years ago, I took the \nHippocratic Oath to become a physician. In January 1995, I took an oath \nof office as a United States Senator to preserve, protect, and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States. Then, just last month, I had to \ntake a special oath of impartial justice for this impeachment trial. \nRaising your right hand and swearing before God is meant to be serious \nbusiness. Swearing falsely is equally serious. I recall the conclusion \nof the Hippocratic Oath:\n\n       If I fulfil this oath and do not violate it, may it be \n     granted to me to enjoy life and art, being honored with fame \n     among all men for all time to come; if I transgress it and \n     swear falsely, may the opposite of all this be my lot.\n\n  President Clinton broke his oaths; the opposite of honor and fame \nshould be his lot.\n  Many of my colleagues have publicly expressed their belief that \nPresident Clinton broke his oaths and committed the crimes of perjury \nand obstruction of justice. Some have gone further and said that these \nare high crimes and misdemeanors. Yet they flinched from removing \nPresident Clinton from office, hoping that we could just move on, put \nthis behind us, and ``heal'' the Nation.\n  Although our acquittal of President Clinton may bring initial relief \nat the end of this ordeal, it will also leave unfortunate, lasting \nlessons for the American people: Integrity is a second-class value; the \nhard job of being truthful is to be left to others; and virtue is for \nthe credulous. Though we do not know how these lessons will manifest \nthemselves over time in our society, they will not be lost. Thus, I do \nnot believe the acquittal of President Clinton will heal the wounds of \nthis ordeal; rather, acquittal regrettably will inject a slow-acting \nmoral poison into the American consciousness.\n\n\n                          Concluding Thoughts\n\n  There is one aspect of the case that made me uncomfortable: The \nperjury and obstruction of justice arose out of an illicit sexual \nrelationship between President Clinton and a young White House intern. \nPresident Clinton no doubt sought to shield the knowledge of that \nrelationship from his family and staff, and that impulse is \nunderstandable. However reprehensible his affair might be, both it and \nhis efforts to hide it were originally of no concern to the public or \nthe Senate. None of us can claim to be free from sin.\n  What began as an attempt to keep an affair secret from family and co-\nworkers, however, escalated into illegal activity when keeping that \naffair secret trumped the civil rights of Paula Jones to seek redress \nin court, and, in turn, thwarted the investigation of a federal grand \njury. President Clinton chose to cheat. Cheating the judicial process, \nwhether to keep an ordinary citizen from having her day in court or to \navoid criminal indictment, is wrong.\n  Dr. William Osler was a late 19th century physician and is regarded \nas the father of modern surgery. In a lecture to his medical students \nabout the pursuit of truth, he said:\n\n       Start with the conviction that absolute truth is hard to \n     reach in matters relating to our fellow creatures, healthy or \n     diseased, that slips in observation are inevitable even with \n     the best trained faculties, that errors in judgment must \n     occur in the practice of an art which consists largely in \n     balancing probabilities.\n       Start, I say, with this attitude of mind, and mistakes will \n     be acknowledged and regretted; but instead of a slow process \n     of self-deception, with ever-increasing inability to \n     recognize truth, you will draw from your errors the very \n     lessons which may enable you to avoid their repetition.\n\n  President Clinton's repetition of wrong, often illegal choices most \ndisturbs me. He faced a series of choices about his affair once our \nsystem of justice became concerned with it. He could have come clean in \nthe civil deposition and urged Ms. Lewinsky to do the same. He did not. \nWhen the story became public, he could have then come clean to the \nAmerican public and revised his deposition testimony. Instead, he took \na poll. Having learned that the American people would forgive him for \nadultery, but not for perjury or obstruction of justice, he declared \nthat he would just have to ``win.'' He then wagged his finger at us on \nnational TV and chided us for believing what has since proven true. He \nembarked on a quiet smear campaign against Ms. Lewinsky, calling her a \n``stalker'' and sending aides into the grand jury to repeat that mean-\nspirited falsehood. Above all else, he could have come clean when he \nwent before the grand jury. Indeed, the discovery of the infamous blue \ndress served as a powerful reminder to tell the truth. But he continued \nto lie.\n  The pattern of behavior is disturbing. That pattern is driven by \nPresident Clinton's choice, on every occasion in this saga, to put his \nself-interest above the the public interest. Indeed, President Clinton \nis well down the dangerous road Dr. Osler described to his students: \n``A slow process of self-deception.''\n  To me, his perjury before the grand jury was defining. Some of my \nfellow senators urged him not to lie in that grand jury, lest he be \nimpeached. He had a chance to try to set matters right by the American \npeople and by our system of justice. Instead, he lied. It has been \nsaid, ``Character is what we know about ourselves. Reputation is what \nothers know about us.'' What we now know about President Clinton's \nconduct before the bar of justice illuminates his integrity: We learned \nthat he always cheated and put himself above the law. We can pray that \nGod forgive President Clinton for his sins, but we cannot ignore the \nconsequences of his behavior to our society.\n  We in the Senate faced the difficult choice of deciding whether to \nremove President Clinton. To find him ``not guilty'' of perjury and \nobstruction of justice and leave him in office would corrode the \nrespect we all have for the Office of President. More troubling, the \nexample to our youth would be destructive. I have three sons, 15, 13, \nand 11 years old. As anyone with children knows, President Clinton's \nconduct has undermined all our efforts to instill in our children two \nessential virtues: truthfulness and responsibility. If we allow a known \nperjurer and obstructor of justice to continue in the Office of \nPresident and lead us into the 21st Century, we set a sad example for \nfuture generations.\n  In a recent sermon on the topic, ``What Do I Tell My Children about \nthe Crisis in Washington?'' a minister quoted from Michael Novak's book \nThe Experience of Nothingness:\n\n       The young have a right to learn a way of discriminating \n     right from wrong, the posed from the authentic, the excellent \n     from the mediocre, the brilliant from the philistine, the \n     shoddy from the workmanlike. When no one with experience \n     bothers to insist--to insist--on such discrimination, they \n     rightly get the idea that discernment is not important, that \n     no one cares either about such things--or about them.\n\n  President Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice. In so \ndoing, he broke his oath of office and his oath to tell the truth. He \nbroke the public trust. I took an oath to do impartial justice by the \nConstitution and laws of our country. I had a duty to the Constitution \nand laws of this nation to convict President Clinton, so I voted to \nremove him from office and restore the trust of the American people in \nthe high Office of President. Prosperity is never an excuse to keep a \nPresident who has committed High Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n  Though many of my colleagues agreed with these conclusions, two-\nthirds of the Senate did not. I am concerned about the message this \nacquittal will send to our youth. So, I am convinced that you and I now \nhave a shared duty: Rather than give in to easy cynicism, we should \nwork toward integrity and responsibility in all that we do. We must \nremind our children that telling the truth and accepting responsibility \nfor wrongdoing are virtues with currency. Our nation's future depends \non how earnestly we fulfill that shared duty.\n  Mr. BUNNING. This is my first speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate. \nI had hoped my opening speech would be about Social Security. This \nyear, in my opinion, we have a golden window of opportunity to reform \nand strengthen this vital program and I had hoped to use my first \ncomments on the Senate floor to help open the debate on real Social \nSecurity reform.\n  Unfortunately, it didn't turn out that way. Of necessity, my opening \nspeech in this body is about the Articles of Impeachment against \nPresident Clinton. It was not my choice!\n\n[[Page S1530]]\n\n  In fact, none of us have much choice in this matter. Here in the U.S. \nSenate, we have been charged with the responsibility of looking at the \nfacts as presented by the managers from the House of Representatives. \nEach of us took an oath to do impartial justice.\n  And the Constitution doesn't give us much wiggle room when it comes \nto choices. The Framers were pretty explicit about out options. If we \ndetermine that the President is guilty of the charges as outlined in \nthe two Articles of Impeachment, the penalty is removal from office. We \nhave no other choice.\n  Because we are all political animals, I think it is natural that the \nlegitimacy of this process and the outcome of this debate will be \nclouded to some degree by the perception that it is a partisan \nexercise.\n  Many of the President's defenders and many of our friends in the \nmedia, in fact, have insisted all along that the whole process has been \ndriven by partisan Republicans who are intent to removing a Democrat \nPresident they do not like from office.\n  The difficulty you run into when you start throwing around the term \n``partisan'' politics is that is seldom a one-way street.\n  Is it any more ``partisan'' to blindly support the impeachment of a \nPresident of the other party than it is to blindly support a President \nof your own regardless of the facts? Of course not. Just as each of us, \nin keeping with our oath to do impartial justice, must strive to avoid \na partisan, knee-jerk solution to the process, we must also not let \nourselves be deterred from doing what we feel is right simply to avoid \ncharges of partisanship.\n  So, hiding behind the charge that the process has been tainted by \npolitical partisanship gives us no relief from our responsibility to \nlook at the facts nor does it expand our choices.\n  So, it is the facts that matter. And each of us must weigh them \nindividually. We are not taking about public opinion polls. They should \nhave no bearing on the case at this point. It is a question of facts \npure and simple.\n  Each of us must weigh those facts individually. We might reach \ndifferent conclusions. But if I determine that the president is guilty, \nand if you determine that the president is guilty, based on those facts \nwe don't have any options. We must vote to convict and to remove the \nPresident from office.\n  I am personally convinced that the President is guilty under both of \nthe Articles of Impeachment presented to us by the House Managers.\n  The managers from the House have presented a strong case that \nPresident Clinton committed perjury. The circumstantial and supporting \nevidence is overwhelming that Bill Clinton did lie under oath to the \ngrand jury when he testified about his attorney's use of a false \naffidavit at his deposition. He lied under oath to the grand jury when \nhe testified about the nature of his relationship with Miss Lewinsky. \nHe lied under oath about what he told his aides about his relationship \nwith Miss Lewinksky. He lied under oath to the grand jury when he \ntestified about the nature of his relationship with Miss Lewinsky. He \nlied under oath about what he told his aides about his relationship \nwith Miss Lewinsky. He lied under oath to the grand jury about his \nconversations with Betty Currie.\n  That is perjury. That is a felony. We cannot uphold our reverence for \nthe rule of law and ignore it.\n  The circumstantial and supporting evidence is also overwhelming that \nthe President did willfully obstruct justice when he encouraged Miss \nLewinsky to file a affidavit in the Jones case; when he coached Betty \nCurrie on how to respond to questions about his relationship with Miss \nLewinsky.\n  When he lied to aides whom he knew would be called as a grand jury \nwitnesses, when he promoted a job search for Miss Lewinsky, and when he \nencouraged Miss Lewinsky to return the gifts he had given her, he was \nattempting to obstruct justice.\n\n  After listening to the facts and the evidence, and after listening to \nthe President's defense team try to refute the charges, I have \ndetermined that he is guilty as charged.\n  I have tried to the best of my ability to reach this determination \nimpartially without being biased by my political affiliation. Have I \nbeen successful? I believe so.\n  I am encouraged in the belief that I have reached the proper \nconclusion for the proper reasons by the harsh wording of the \nresolution being circulated by some of the defenders of the President, \nsenators who oppose impeachment but support a censure resolution.\n  The most recent version of a censure resolution that I have seen \nadmits that the President engaged in shameless, reckless and \nindefensible conduct. It goes on to say that the President of the \nUnited States deliberately misled and deceived the American people and \nofficials of the United States government.\n  It also says that the President gave false or misleading testimony, \nand impeded discovery of evidence in judicial proceedings and that, as \na result, he deserves censure.\n  These are the people who are opposed to the Articles of Impeachment.\n  The Constitution doesn't really give us that kind of choice. If the \nPresident is guilty of these charges, he must be convicted and he must \nbe removed from office. Censure is not an option.\n  I would rather be speaking about Social Security but I wasn't given a \nchoice in the matter.\n  I would prefer not to vote to convict any President of Articles of \nImpeachment. But I don't have a choice in that matter either.\n  If he is guilty, he must be convicted. And I believe he is guilty as \ncharged.\n  There is one central, elemental ingredient that is necessary to the \nsuccess of our ability, as a nation, to govern ourselves. That is \ntrust.\n  Before a President takes office, he swears a solemn oath, to \n``preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.''\n  We accept his word on that.\n  When the Vice President, United States Senators and members of the \nHouse of Representatives take office, they are required to take an oath \n``to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against \nall enemies, foreign and domestic.''\n  We trust that they will live up to that oath.\n  We administer these oaths and we accept them as binding because \ngovernment, at least in this nation, is, above all else, a matter of \ntrust. Trust is the glue that holds it all together. If that trust is \ndestroyed or tarnished, it seriously undermines the basic foundations \nof our government.\n  The President's defenders try to excuse him by saying that if he did \nlie under oath and obstruct justice, he did it to protect himself and \nhis family from personal embarrassment about sexual indiscretions, and \nsomehow this makes the lies all right.\n  It doesn't. When he lied and when he tried to hide his lies from the \ngrand jury, he broke trust with the nation's justice system. He broke \nfaith with the American people.\n  Not only did he break the law, he also violated the sacred trust of \nthe office of the President. And in so doing, he violated his oath of \noffice.\n  And that raises the two Articles of Impeachment to a level that \ndefinitely justifies his removal from office.\n  It is a matter of trust. And it leaves us no choice but to vote for \nconviction.\n  Mr. DURBIN. From the opening statement to the closing argument, \nChairman Henry Hyde and the House managers stated repeatedly that what \nis at stake in this trial is the rule of law.\n  In a compelling reference to the life of Sir Thomas More, Mr. Hyde \nquoted from ``A Man for All Seasons'' by Robert Bolt to remind us that \nMore was prepared to die rather than swear a false oath of loyalty to \nthe King and his church.\n  But Mr. Hyde did not read my favorite passage from that work. Let me \nshare it with you and tell you why I think it is important to us in \nthis deliberation.\n\n       MORE. The law, Roper, the law. I know what's legal not \n     what's right. And I'll stick to what's legal.\n       ROPER. Then you set Man's law above God's!\n       MORE. No far below; but let me draw your attention to a \n     fact--I'm not God. The currents and eddies of right and \n     wrong, which you find such plain-sailing, I can't navigate, \n     I'm no voyager. But in the thickets of the law, oh there I'm \n     a forester. I doubt if there's a man alive who could follow \n     me there, thank God.\n       ALICE. While you talk, he's gone!\n       MORE. And go he should if he was the devil himself until he \n     broke the law!\n       ROPER. So now you'd give the Devil benefit of law!\n       MORE. Yes. What would you do? Cut a great road through the \n     law to get after the Devil?\n\n[[Page S1531]]\n\n       ROPER. I'd cut down every law in England to do that!\n       MORE. Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil \n     turned round on you--where would you hide, Roper, the laws \n     all being flat? This country's planted thick with laws from \n     coast to coast--Man's laws, not God's--and if you cut them \n     down--and you're just the man to do it--d'you really think \n     you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? \n     Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's \n     sake.\n\n  Sir Thomas More's words remind us the law must be followed not only \nby the accused but also by the accusers.\n  And every day in America many who are accused of crimes are released \nbecause this government has violated their constitutional rights--\ndenied them due process--forsaken the rule of law.\n  How American of us--we are prepared to release an accused because the \naccuser has not played by the rules * * * the rules of law.\n  The House managers built their case on one key question: Did the \nPresident respect the rule of law?\n  But the same managers who exalted the rule of law from their opening \nwords would have us ignore the process which brought us to this moment:\n  An independent counsel in name only whose conduct before the House \nJudiciary Committee led Sam Dash, former Watergate counsel and Mr. \nStarr's ethics advisor, to resign in protest.\n  Listen to Dash's words to Kenneth Starr in his letter of resignation \nconcerning Starr's appearance and testimony:\n\n       In doing this you have violated your obligation under the \n     Independent Counsel Statute and have unlawfully intruded on \n     the power of impeachment, which the Constitution gives solely \n     to the House. . .. By your willingness to serve in this \n     improper role (advocating for impeachment) you have seriously \n     harmed the public confidence in the independence and \n     objectivity of your office.\n\n  Much has been made about the so-called pep rally which some House \nDemocrats held for President Clinton at the White House after the \nimpeachment vote. If you wonder how those members could act in such an \napparently partisan manner after the historic vote on December 19, \n1998, I hope you will recall that the Republican members of the House \nJudiciary Committee gave Mr. Starr nothing less than a standing ovation \nwhen he completed testimony which Mr. Dash characterized as \n``unlawful'' and ``improper''.\n  Is it any wonder why the American people think this whole impeachment \nprocess reeks of partisanship and the excesses of the Independent \nCounsel have created a bipartisan sentiment to amend if not abolish \nthat statute?\n  Did Mr. Starr respect the rule of law?\n  And the House Judiciary Committee--so anxious to complete its work in \na lame-duck session that it would vote for impeachment without calling \na single material witness. Then those same managers came to the Senate \nand argued justice cannot be served without live witnesses on the \nSenate floor.\n  When I listen to Paul Sarbanes recount the painstaking efforts to \navoid partisanship during the impeachment hearing on President Nixon, \nit is a stark contrast to the committee process which voted these \narticles of impeachment against President Clinton.\n  Did the House Judiciary Committee respect the rule of law?\n  And the House of Representatives, an institution which I was proud to \nserve in for 14 years, was so hellbent on impeachment that it bent the \nrules, denied the regular order of business and refused the House a \nvote to censure this President so the Majority would have a better \nchance to visit the disgrace of impeachment on his record.\n  Did the House of Representatives respect the rule of law?\n  But it would be too facile to dismiss this case simply because the \nprocess which brought us to this point is so suspect--too easy to \ndiscard the fruit of this poisoned tree.\n\n  Justice and history will not give us this easy exit. We must ignore \nthe birthing of this impeachment and judge it on its merits.\n  First, let me stipulate the obvious. The personal conduct of this \nPresident has been disgraceful and dishonorable. He has brought shame \non himself and his Presidency. No one--not any Senator in this Chamber \nnor any person in this country--will look at this President in the same \nway again.\n  I have known Bill Clinton for 35 years. I remember him as a popular \nstudent when we both attended Georgetown. And I know despite all of the \ntalk about ``compartmentalization'' that this man has suffered the \ngreatest humiliation of any President in our history. I hope his \nmarriage and his family can survive it.\n  But our job is not to judge Bill Clinton as a person, a husband, a \nfather. Our responsibility under the Constitution is to judge Bill \nClinton as a President, not whether he should be an object of scorn but \nwhether he should be removed from office.\n  Did William Jefferson Clinton commit perjury or obstruct justice, and \nfor these acts should he be removed from office?\n  When this trial began I believed that President Clinton's only refuge \nwas in a strict reading of ``high crimes and misdemeanors''--that James \nMadison, George Mason and Alexander Hamilton would have to serve as his \ndefense team and save this President from removal.\n  The managers' case was compelling, but as the defense team rebutted \ntheir evidence I saw the charges of perjury crack, obstruction of \njustice crumble and impeachment collapse.\n  The managers failed in Article I on perjury to meet the most basic \nrequirement of the law: specificity. In the Andrew Johnson impeachment \ntrial, Senator William Fessenden of Maine pointed out the unfairness of \nfailing to name specific charges:\n\n       It would be contrary to every principle of justice to the \n     clearest dictates of right, to try and condemn any man, \n     however guilty he may be thought, for an offense not charged, \n     of which no notice has been given to him, and against which \n     he has had no opportunity to defend himself.\n\n  Senator Fessenden understood the rule of law.\n  And by what standard should the President be judged?\n  When the House managers discussed the gravity of the case for \nimpeachment, they said repeatedly: ``These are crimes.'' But when asked \nwhy they failed to meet the most basic criminal procedural requirements \nof pleading and proof, Mr. Canady said: ``This proceeding is not a \ncriminal trial.''\n  And what is the difference between charging a crime and proving \nsomething less than a crime? The difference is known as the rule of \nlaw--a rule which requires fair notice and due process whether the \naccused is President or penniless.\n  How many times have we seen the House managers run into the brick \nwall of sworn testimony contradicting their charges. On gifts--Monica \nLewinsky said hiding them was Betty Currie's idea--Betty Currie claimed \nit was Lewinsky's idea--neither of them claimed it was the President's \nidea. On the affidavit issue--the House Managers could not produce one \nwitness--not Lewinsky, not Jordan and not the President to support \ntheir charge of obstruction.\n  Time and again the House managers failed to prove their case--failed \nto produce testimony or evidence and at best played to a draw. I don't \nneed to remind my colleagues in the Senate that playing to a draw on \nthis field comes down in favor of the President.\n  The House managers failed to meet their burden of proof.\n  And let me say a word about witnesses.\n  We have spent a lot of time on this issue. I do not know who came up \nwith the limitation of three witnesses for the managers. But is there \nanyone in this chamber who believes that Sidney Blumenthal was a more \nvaluable witness to this case than Betty Currie?\n  Surely my colleagues in the Senate remember that the House managers \nspent three solid days building their obstruction of justice case on \nconcealing gifts and tampering with witnesses. And Betty Currie was \ncritical to the most credible charges against the President.\n  Then when the House managers were given a chance to call this key \nwitness, they refused.\n  And what can we conclude from this tactical decision? Let me read \nRule 14.15 from Instructions for Federal Criminal Cases.\n\n       If it is peculiarly within the power of either the \n     government or the defense to produce a witness who could give \n     relevant testimony on an issue in the case, failure to call \n     that witness may give rise to an inference that this \n     testimony would have been unfavorable to that party. No such \n     conclusion should be drawn by you, however, with regard to a \n     witness who is equally available\n\n[[Page S1532]]\n\n     to both parties or where the testimony of that witness would \n     be merely cumulative.\n       The jury must always bear in mind that the law never \n     imposes on a defendant in a criminal case the burden or duty \n     of calling any witnesses or producing any evidence.\n\n  Betty Currie was no help to the House managers in her deposition and \nthey clearly concluded she was more likely to hurt than help their case \nif called as a witness. The key witness in the obstruction of justice \ncharge never materialized and neither did the proof the House managers \nneeded.\n  How will history judge this chapter in our history?\n  The House managers and many of my colleagues believe an acquittal \nwill violate the basic American principle of equal justice under the \nlaw--they argue that acquitting the President will cheapen the \nPresidency--and imperil our nation and its values.\n  I have heard my colleagues stand in disbelief that the American \npeople could still want a man they find so lacking in character to \ncontinue as their President. William Bennett and his pharisaical \nfollowers have profited from books and lectures decrying the lack of \nmoral outrage in our nation against Bill Clinton.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will pause and reflect on this conclusion that \nthe American people have somehow lost their moral compass--that the \npolls demonstrate our people have lost their soul--and that we, their \nelected leaders, have to impeach this President to remind the American \npeople of the values--the integrity--the honor which is so important to \nour nation.\n  May I respectfully suggest that those who appoint themselves as the \nguardians of moral order in America risk the vices of pride and \narrogance themselves. Before we don the armor and choose our side in \nwhat Manager Hyde calls a ``cultural war,'' let us not give up on the \nwisdom and judgement of the people we represent.\n  Like Abraham Lincoln, I am a firm believer in the American people. If \ngiven the truth they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis.\n  And the American people have this right. The President's personal \nconduct was clearly wrong. He has endured embarrassment and will spend \nthe rest of his natural life and forever in the annals of history \nbranded by this experience. The American people clearly believe that \nthe process which brings him before us in this trial was too partisan, \ntoo unfair, too suspect.\n  What has occurred here is a personal and family tragedy--it is not a \nnational tragedy which should result in the removal of this President \nfrom office.\n  In 1798, Thomas Jefferson wrote to James Madison: ``History shows \nthat in England, impeachment has been an engine more of passion than \njustice.''\n  Jefferson feared that even our process for impeachment could be a \nformidable partisan weapon. He feared that a determined faction in \nCongress would use it ``. . .for getting rid of any man whom they \nconsider as dangerous to their views, and I do not know that we could \ncount on one-third in an emergency.''\n  In 1868, with the suffering and death of our Civil War still fresh in \neveryone's mind, this Senate came within one vote of impeaching a \nPresident who was viewed as too sympathetic to the vanquished South.\n  In 1999, after six years and millions of tax dollars spent in \ninvestigation of this President, I believe the Senate will once again \ncool the political passions, preserve the Presidency, protect the \nConstitution, and prove to Thomas Jefferson that his trust in this body \nand that great document was not misplaced.\n  I will vote to acquit William Jefferson Clinton on both Articles of \nImpeachment and support a strong resolution of censure to bring this \nsad chapter in American politics to a close.\n  Mr. KYL. This case is about the rule of law--specifically, whether \nactions and statements of President Clinton in federal court \nproceedings have done such harm to the rule of law that he should be \nremoved from office. I conclude in the affirmative, and reluctantly \nvote to convict on both Articles of Impeachment.\n  Chairman Henry Hyde observed that the House of Representatives had \ncome to the Senate ``as advocates for the rule of law, for equal \njustice under law, and for the sanctity of the oath.'' (145 Cong. Rec. \nS221 (January 14, 1999).)\n  These are not just grand words.\n  The rule of law refers to our judicial process, which is governed by \nuniform standards and procedures that we say will always be guaranteed \nand applied fairly and equally. We are willing to submit ourselves to \nthis process because we have worked hard for 210 years to ensure that \nit produces impartial justice for all.\n  Equal justice means that each of us, including the least among us, \nhas rights that the state is bound to protect; and it surely includes \nthe requirement that those who make the laws (including the President) \nmust live under them like anybody else.\n  And oaths are essential to the rule of law because the judicial \nprocess is about seeking the truth; and that requires that we be able \nto trust what is said. The oath formalizes the commitment to tell the \ntruth, and the whole truth--a commitment so important that its \nviolation is itself a crime.\n  I believe there are two questions to be answered.\n  The first is whether the President impermissibly took the law into \nhis own hands in a federal civil rights case and seven months later \nbefore a federal grand jury in order to suppress the truth. The second \nquestion is whether, if the President did engage in the impeachable \nconduct, it is a breach serious enough to warrant removal from office.\n  The Constitution permits only one vote: to acquit or convict. This \nleaves some in the anomalous position of determining guilt on an \nimpeachable offense, but having to vote to acquit because they deem the \noffense insufficiently serious to warrant removal. While the fact that \nthe offense is impeachable should itself resolve the issue of \n``proportionality,'' I would not consider it impermissible to reach a \ncontrary conclusion, as some will do in this case.\n  For my part, I answer both questions in the affirmative. The \nPresident ``wilfully provided perjurious, false, and misleading \ntestimony'' under oath to a grand jury and he ``prevented, obstructed, \nand impeded the administration of justice.'' (H. Res. 611).\n  While the House of Representatives asserted that the President's \nactions were criminal, violations of specific criminal statutes are not \nessential for wrongful conduct to constitute the ``high crimes and \nmisdemeanors'' that demonstrate unfitness to continue as Chief \nExecutive. Most authorities agree a President cannot be prosecuted \nwhile in office for crimes allegedly committed during his term. So, for \nexample, whether a lie under oath would necessarily later result in a \ncriminal perjury conviction cannot be known with certainty, and an \nimpeachment trial is not an effective forum for establishing criminal \nguilt. It is conduct, not a proven crime, that is the basis for \nimpeachment.\n  This is one of the reasons why it is clear that each Senator may \napply his or her standard of proof--it need not be the criminal \nstandard ``beyond a reasonable doubt.'' (See Senate Proceedings in the \nImpeachment Trial of Judge Claiborne, S. Doc. No. 99-48, at 150.) \nMoreover, because the Senate constrained the House of Representatives \nas it did--by limiting the number of witnesses that could be deposed, \nby effectively foreclosing other discovery, and by precluding ``live'' \ntestimony--it would be unfair to impose a ``beyond reasonable doubt'' \nstandard.\n  The President's counsel argued that the Senate should not consider \nArticle I because the House of Representatives defeated a perjury count \nrelating to the Jones civil action. But Article I also included \nallegations of ``perjurious, false, and misleading'' statements in the \nJones case; so the argument is meritless. Moreover, the President's \nfalsehoods in the Jones civil suit also formed part of his strategy to \nobstruct justice.\n\n  What is striking about this case is the President's persistent, \nsustained, carefully calculated, deliberate, and callous manipulation \nof the judicial process for over a year.\n  Without attempting to summarize all of the evidence, I conclude that \nthe President lied before the federal grand jury about (1) the nature \nof details of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky; (2) his assertion \nthat he told the truth in the Jones deposition; (3) the false and \nmisleading statements that he allowed his lawyer to make to a federal \njudge\n\n[[Page S1533]]\n\nin the Paula Jones civil case; and (4) his corrupt efforts to influence \nthe testimony of his aides who were potential grand jury witnesses.\n  And it seems clear to me that the President obstructed justice--that \nhe corruptly: (1) encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to execute a false affidavit; \n(2) encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie if called as a witness; (3) \nencouraged Ms. Lewinsky to conceal gifts; (4) encouraged cooperation of \nMs. Lewinsky through job assistance; (5) allowed his attorney to make \nfalse and misleading statements about the affidavit; (6) attempted to \ninfluence the testimony of his secretary, Ms. Currie; and (7) attempted \nto influence the testimony of other aides.\n  The final question is whether the President should be removed for his \nactions.\n  As a preliminary matter, there can be no doubt that perjurious, \nfalse, and misleading statements made under oath in federal court \nproceedings are indeed impeachable offenses. The fact that the House of \nRepresentatives reached this conclusion, of course, establishes the \nprecedent as to the kind of conduct in this case. But, it is also \nconfirmed by the impeachment and conviction of federal judges--of Judge \nHarry Claiborne, removed in 1986 for filing a false income tax return \nunder penalty of perjury, of Judge Walter Nixon, removed in 1989 for \nperjury before a grand jury, and of Judge Alcee Hastings, removed in \n1989 for perjury related to financial misconduct. I cannot agree with \nthose colleagues who assert that there is a different standard for a \nPresident--that it would require a more egregious kind of perjury to \nremove a President than a judge. Nothing in the Constitution suggests \nsuch a double standard.\n  John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the United States, said ``there \nis no crime more extensively pernicious to society'' than perjury, \nprecisely because it ``discolors and poisons the streams of justice.'' \n(Grand Jury Charge (C.C.D.N.Y. (Apr. 5, 1792)) (Jay, C.J.), in 2 The \nDocumentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-\n1800: The Justices on Circuit: 1790-1794, at 253, 255 (Maeva Marcus \ned., 1988).)\n  As to obstruction of justice, on which there is no other direct \nprecedent, Chief Justice Rehnquist, our presiding officer, in his \nhistory of impeachment, Grand Inquests, wrote that ``the counts \nrelating to the obstruction of justice and to the unlawful use of \nexecutive power [by President Nixon] were of the kind that would surely \nhave justified removal from office.''\n  The House mangers pointed out, accurately, that even though perjury \nand obstruction of justice are not specifically listed as impeachable \noffenses in the Constitution, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines treat \nthese offenses more seriously than they do the crime of bribery--one of \ntwo specifically enumerated impeachable offenses. Significantly, where \nbribery is committed in connection with a judicial proceeding (such as \nbribing a witness in a case), its seriousness under the Guidelines \nrises to that of perjury and obstruction. When misdeeds, in other \nwords, take place in connection with a judicial process, to try to \naffect or control that process, they get extra attention in our legal \nsystem. They are not simply brushed aside. Far from it. Perjury and \nobstruction are like bribery; they are ``other high crimes'' by any \nreasonable construction.\n  The President's counsel argued that the President's conduct could not \nbe impeachable because he did not abuse the power of his office in \nconducting ``matters of state,'' and did not violate the public trust. \nBut impeachable offenses are not limited to the President's conduct of \n``matters of state.'' If this were so, Richard Nixon could never have \nbeen impeached. If this were so, a twenty dollar bribe for a Senator to \nvote for a bill would be impeachable, while a million dollar bribe to \ncover up political dirty tricks would not be.\n\n  It simply cannot be, as some have argued, that the only impeachable \noffenses are those that can only be committed by the President. If a \nPresident commits murder, can he not be removed? Must we wait until his \nterm is over to deal with his crime? It is clear that seriously \nwrongful official conduct is impeachable. But it is just as clear that \nimpeachment cannot be limited to that.\n  It is not only the exercise of presidential power but also the \nviolation of a public duty that can constitute impeachable conduct. As \nthe head of the Executive Branch, the President has the duty under \nArticle II of the Constitution to ``take Care that the Laws be \nfaithfully executed.'' The 1974 House Judiciary report on the \n``Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment'' summarized that \nimpeachment of a President can ``be predicted only upon conduct \nseriously incompatible with either the constitutional form and \nprinciples of our government or the proper performance of \nconstitutional duties of the presidential office.'' (Staff of House \nComm. on the Judiciary, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. (Comm. Print 1974), \nConstitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment, at 24.) Surely the \nviolation of constitutional obligations can constitute high crimes or \nmisdemeanors for which the President may be impeached. And surely, such \nviolation would constitute an abuse of trust by the Chief Executive.\n  By his oath of office and Article II responsibilities, President \nClinton is supposed to see that the sexual discrimination laws are \nfaithfully executed. But he thought the Jones case was illegitimate, so \nhe took the law into his own hands. His conduct in this case clearly \nviolated his public duties, his oath, and the public trust. And it \ninterfered with the proper functioning of another branch of the \ngovernment.\n  The same is true for his deliberate efforts to impede legitimate \ndiscovery efforts in federal court proceedings. Such action ``is \nincompatible with . . . the constitutional form and principles of our \ngovernment,'' as the 1974 House Judiciary report said. It simply cannot \nbe that a President who wrongfully interferes with the proper \nfunctioning of another branch of our government by attempting to \nsubvert justice in federal court proceedings cannot be impeached \nbecause he did not do it as President, but, rather, as a citizen.\n  That the underlying conduct covered up is sexual, is, if anything, \nan aggravating not a mitigating factor. In sex-discrimination \nlitigation, where there is frequently no corroboration for the \nplaintiff, a defendant who lies can easily subvert justice. Had the \nblue dress not been found, with its incontrovertible tangible evidence, \nI doubt Paula Jones would have gotten a dime in settlement.\n\n  Judgements about the severity of the impeachable conduct in this case \nwill lead different Senators to reach different conclusions. That is \nwhy some of us are willing to say reasonable people can differ. For \nthose who fear the long-term consequences to the rule of law, however, \nI believe there can be only one result. Anyone who so willfully, \ncallously, and persistently connived to deny the federal court and \ngrand jury the truth, and who used and abused the highest office in the \nland to advance his personal cover-up is not only no longer worthy of \ntrust--which all agree is essential to the conduct of his office--but \nalso must be removed to avoid the perpetuation of a legal double \nstandard. If federal judges (such as Judges Clairborne, Nixon, and \nHastings) are removed for similar conduct; if average Americans are \nimprisoned for it, can the rule of law long survive ``special \nexceptions'' for powerful people we like, or who are doing a good job, \nor who hold elective office? None of these rationalizations are \ndefenses to illegal or impeachable conduct.\n  As I said, sexual harassment cases are precisely the kind of judicial \nproceedings that demand the maximum cooperation of and truth-telling by \nthe defendant, because of the lack of third-party witnesses or \ncorroborating evidence. In these cases, justice is denied if \nobstruction, witness tampering, or perjury prevent the truth from \ncoming out. Can anyone say this is not serious? To what standard of \nseriousness does it not rise? How many plaintiffs will have to lose \ntheir sexual harassment, domestic violence, or sexual assault cases \nbecause defendants lie and obstruct justice (and there is no blue dress \nto keep them honest) before it becomes serious?\n  An acquittal in this case will make it harder to deal properly with \nsimilar conduct in the future. We will be hard pressed to perpetuate a \ndouble standard, so the lowest common denominator of conduct will be \nestablished as the permissible norm. And this cannot help but weaken \nthe ability of courts\n\n[[Page S1534]]\n\nto enforce truth-telling and prevent obstruction of justice.\n  The precedent set by this case may not change the law overnight, but \nthis unforgettable episode is now part of the institutional life of our \ncountry. The chief magistrate perverted justice and remained in power. \nThe lesson is corrosive. Like water dripping on a rock, it eventually \nmakes a deep hollow in the American justice system.\n  It is true the President could be sent to jail later. How does that \nvalidate his right to appoint judges and be head of U.S. law \nenforcement now? How does that square with his leadership of the armed \nforces right now, as our Commander-in-Chief? Should the standard for \nthe President not be at least as high as for those he appoints and \nleads?\n  In the end, my colleagues who would censure rather than convict the \nPresident are right about one thing: the President's conduct is \n``unacceptable.'' But, if conduct is unacceptable, we cannot accept \nit--meaning, we have to do something about it that does not leave it \nstand. And under our Constitution that means removal of the President \nthrough conviction on the Articles of Impeachment.\n  Henry Hyde closed the House case by warning that public cynicism is \nthe greatest threat we face. Our failure to remove the President will \nonly fuel the cynicism of Americans such as Louie Valenzuela of \nGlendale, Arizona. He was quoted recently in a man-on-the-street \ninterview about this case. ``They talk about justice,'' he told the \nArizona Republic. ``They talk about doing the right thing,'' said Mr. \nValenzuela. ``But they always look the other way when someone rich, \nfamous or powerful does something wrong. Look at O.J. Simpson. Clinton \nwill be next. Asi es. (That's just the way it is.)''\n  That is not the way it has to be. But how it is, is up to us.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, colleagues, a great deal has been \nspoken in the Chamber about separation of powers and tomes have been \nwritten on it. And in reading the Constitution, article I, creating the \nCongress; and article II, the executive branch; and article III, the \njudiciary, we have seen the wisdom of limiting power.\n  The one provision of the Constitution--the impeachment provision--\nreaches across that divide. It is my thinking that before the Congress \ncan exercise the power of removal, there has to be a very, very heavy \nburden of proof.\n  I had occasion, fairly recently, to go very deeply into the issue of \nseparation of powers when I argued the Base Closing Commission case \nregarding the Philadelphia Navy Yard case, which was unfairly closed--a \nsubject that I will not amplify on--and I had an opportunity to appear \nbefore the Supreme Court. I will end on time, as I did on my other two \nspeeches, but I will say that the Chief Justice is a good deal more \ntolerant here than in the Supreme Court. In the Supreme Court, I was \ncut off in midsyllable. I didn't know that was possible. But with the \nforcefulness of the Presiding Officer, I did not do well in that case. \nI had done better on my previous appearances in the Supreme Court when \nI was representing the district attorney's office on law and order.\n  But that sojourn into that case brought me into 200 years of \nreflection and analysis on case law on separation of powers, something \nthat is not often done by practicing lawyers, and certainly not \nSenators. It instilled in me a very, very deep appreciation of \nseparation of power.\n  So when I approached this case--and it has been the toughest case I \nhave ever seen, and I think it has been a very, very intense drain on \nthis body and all of us individually--the focus I had was, What is the \nburden that you ought to have to show if the Senate is going to remove \na President? As I reviewed the evidence, I am not satisfied at all that \nthat burden was met.\n  The definition of perjury is a very tough one by the Supreme Court of \nthe United States in the famous case called Bronston. Bronston was \ngiving testimony in a bankruptcy proceeding in New York and was asked \nabout bank accounts in Zurich, and said, ``My company had a bank \naccount for about 6 months,'' leading to the implication that he did \nnot have a personal bank account when in fact he did. He was convicted \nand upheld by the Second Circuit, but reversed by a unanimous Supreme \nCourt because the interrogator, the prosecutor, has to go further. You \nhave to ask the last questions.\n  And the President was very artful, very careful, and full of guile as \nhe wound his way through the grand jury proceedings. We heard the \ntestimony again and again. The President said he told his aide. ``I \ntold them things that were true.'' Well, he didn't comment about the \nthings that he told them that were false. But nobody said, ``Did you \ntell them things that were false as well?'' to give him a chance to \nperjure himself on that. When asked about Monica Lewinsky--was he alone \nwith her--well, on a series of rambling answers he wasn't alone with \nher in the hallway. But that is not the end of the question. He wasn't \nalone with her in the hallway. But nobody followed up, and said, ``Were \nyou alone with her somewhere else?'' which he was not asked and, \ntherefore, did not deny and, therefore, on this record did not commit \nperjury under the Bronston case.\n  The testimony of Betty Currie we heard again and again and again. \nHere in late January 1998, Betty Currie testified that when the \nPresident gave her that series of questions, she thought the President \nwas trying to lead her, to mold her testimony. Then she came back on in \nJuly, she said, Well, it was different on that occasion. She testified \nthat the President gave her the option of either agreeing or \ndisagreeing.\n  Betty Currie was not a witness in this proceeding--didn't even have \nher deposition taken, and was not a witness; did not have her \ndeposition taken because of very, very restrictive rules which the U.S. \nSenate said what the House managers could do. The House managers were \non very, very sharp notice that if they asked for too many depositions \nthey might get none at all. They made their selection of witnesses, and \nthey left off Betty Currie.\n\n  But had House managers been able to present their case in the normal \ncourse of events, I dare say the proceeding would have been even \nfaster; that we heard some 12 days of speeches, 6 days of opening \nspeeches; 3 and 3. We could have done that in 2 hours. We then spent 2 \ndays propounding questions through the Chief Justice; learned very, \nvery little. We heard arguments on the motion to dismiss, and on \ndepositions, and arguments on what to do about the witnesses, on those \nvideotapes. Again and again, we heard legal arguments, but we did not \nhear from witnesses.\n  We are burdened by this record. It is my view that on this record, \nthe burden of proof has not been met, the kind of a burden that would \nhave to be sustained, in my judgment, for the Senate to remove an \nAmerican President.\n  One comment about mindset. The Senate really approached this matter \nas if it were a waste of time from the outset. There was an early \neffort to structure a vote to show that one-third plus would not be for \nconviction and, therefore, to end it. And then when we had the vote on \nthe motion to dismiss, and 44 Senators voted to dismiss, it confirmed \nwhat we all knew; and that is that there would not be a two-thirds \nvote. I think that put a mindset in this body really not to conduct a \ntrial.\n  The Constitution calls for a trial. The proceeding we had does not \nmeasure up in any way, shape, or form to a trial. It is true that there \nare some few cases submitted on a record where judges are going to \ndecide it. But a trial customarily requires witnesses. Had witnesses \nappeared on the floor of the U.S. Senate with examination and cross-\nexamination, you would have gotten a feel for what happened here. If \nBetty Currie had appeared on the floor of the U.S. Senate, or even if \nher deposition had been taken, there could have been a clarification of \ninconsistencies in her two lines of questioning.\n  A word for the future: It would be my hope that if, as, and when the \nSenate has to revisit impeachment that it would be done differently. \nSenator Lieberman made a suggestion on a December 20 television show \nthat there ought not to be party caucuses, that there only ought to be \njoint caucuses. I have passed that recommendation on. I realized that \ngiven the history of the Senate and our party caucuses, that would be a \nvery, very abrupt change. But I came out of some of our party caucuses \nand walked over and talked to my friends on the other side of the \naisle, the people that I had agreed with on many, many, many issues. We \nwere\n\n[[Page S1535]]\n\njust irreconcilably opposed, just totally opposed. My only conclusion \nwas that it was the kind of argument and the kind of discussion on what \nhappened in the caucuses--really choosing sides and having teams--as \nopposed to trying to make an analytical, judicial decision as to what \nwas involved here.\n  So it is my hope that if we ever have to undertake this again we will \ndo it differently.\n  My position in the matter is that the case has not been proved. I \nhave gone back to Scottish law where there are three verdicts: guilty, \nnot guilty, and not proved. I am not prepared to say on this record \nthat President Clinton is not guilty. But I am certainly not prepared \nto say that he is guilty. There are precedents for a Senator voting \npresent. I hope that I will be accorded the opportunity to vote not \nproved in this case.\n  We really end up, colleagues, very much, in my judgment, where at \nleast I started on the matter. I had thought at the outset that this \nwas not an appropriate case for impeachment because the requisite two-\nthirds would not be present, and had hoped that impeachment would be \nby-passed, but instead we would allow the President to finish his term \nof office, which I thought an inevitability, just as it has worked out \nthat way, and that the criminal process would do whatever is \nappropriate; if indicted, if convicted, whatever a judge would have to \nsay. I am still hopeful that the rule of law will be vindicated in that \nprocess.\n  We obviously have learned much from this proceeding. It is my hope \nthat we will leave a mark to guide future Senates if we ever have to \nrepeat this very, very trying sort of an experience.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that a full text and \nexhibits A, B, and C be included in the Record as if read on the Senate \nfloor.\n  The removal of an American president through impeachment carries a \nhigh burden of proof and persuasion. For conviction in the criminal \ncourts on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, the proof must \nbe beyond a reasonable doubt. An extra measure of certainty is \nnecessary to persuade the Senate that the national interest mandates \ninvoking the extraordinary remedy of removing the President.\n\n\n                The Constitutional Standard for Removal\n\n  The starting point is Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution:\n\n       The President . . . shall be removed from Office on \n     Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or \n     other High Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n\n  From that language, there is reason to interpret ``other High Crimes \nand Misdemeanors'' as relating back to specific categories of offenses \nearlier enumerated, such as ``Treason and Bribery''; but I think that \nis too limited. Nor do I agree with the simplistic definition that \nperjury and obstruction of justice, being felonies and therefore more \nserious than misdemeanors in the criminal law, are automatically \nimpeachable offenses.\n  The Framers did not foresee the circumstances before us. The omission \nof ``perjury'' and ``obstruction of justice'' from the enumerated \noffenses probably reflected the Framers' thought that it would be \nunlikely that a President would be testifying under oath or be a \nparticipant in a judicial proceeding. Yet, it is equally clear that \nperjury and obstruction of justice are serious crimes. For the \nPresident to commit either, he would be placing his own interest above \nhis public duty and the people's interest in due process.\n  In 1970, then-Congressman Gerald R. Ford offered this definition:\n\n       . . . an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the \n     House of Representatives considers to be at a given moment in \n     history . . .\n\n  While that may state the raw power of Congress, it is too subjective \nto provide any real guidance. Instead, I look to the Framers at the \nConstitutional Convention, the Federalist papers, and the English and \nUnited States impeachment cases.\n  Commenting on impeachment at the Constitutional Convention James \nWilson said:\n\n       . . . far from being above the laws, he (the President) is \n     amenable to them in his private character as a citizen, and \n     in his public character by impeachment\n\n  The President's attorneys have argued that the charges arise from \nprivate conduct unrelated to his official duties. The issue then arises \nwhether his conduct is ``in his public character'' by virtue of his \nConstitutional duty:\n\n       . . . he (the President) shall take care that the Laws be \n     faithfully executed . . .Article II, Section 3--\n\n  Such a public duty may be insufficient for impeachment under \nAlexander Hamilton's definition of impeachment in Federalist No. 65:\n\n       . . . those offences (sic) which proceed from the \n     misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse \n     or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which \n     may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they \n     relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society \n     itself.\n\n  From Hamilton's statement, the conventional wisdom has evolved that \nimpeachment is essentially a political question. The Framers, cases and \ncommentaries have not articulated a handy definition of ``high crimes \nand misdemeanors.''\n  Whether to impeach and convict transcends the facts and law to what \nis in the national interest at a specific time in the nation's history \non the totality of the circumstances.\n  Consideration of the national interest may include whether there is a \nclear and present danger to the integrity or stability of the national \ngovernment; or whether the conduct is so vile or reprehensible as to \nestablish unfitness for office; or whether the electorate has lost \nconfidence in the President to the extent that he cannot govern.\n  The precedents and commentaries leave substantial latitude for \nSenators to establish their own standards. The ultimate definition may \nbe analogous to Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart's struggle to \ndefine obscenity when he concluded: '' . . . perhaps I could never \nsucceed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it.''\n\n\n                       Partisanship In The House\n\n  The extreme partisanship of the impeachment proceeding in the House \nprejudiced the matter before it came to the Senate. While it takes two \nto tango or be partisan, somehow the House Republicans bore the brunt \nof the public disdain on the partisan charge. It was more than the \nparty line votes. The whole process was filled with rancor, acrimony \nand bitterness which contributed significantly to the public view that \nit was all politics without real substances.\n  It has been widely noted that there must be significant bi-partisan \nsupport to remove a president. President Nixon's forced resignation \noccurred only when Republican elders like Senators Goldwater and Scott \njoined Democrats in urging his resignation.\n  In an early Sunday TV talk show on December 20, 1998, the day after \nthe House sent the Articles to the Senate, Senator Joseph Lieberman and \nI appeared together on ``Face the Nation'' where he urged that there be \nno party caucuses but only joint caucuses. I recommended that to \nSenator Lott in my memorandum of December 29 and urged that policy to \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. Perhaps, it was too much to \nexpect or even hope that would be done given the Senate's history and \npractice of party caucuses.\n  As noted in this floor statement, the Senate struggled to achieve bi-\npartisanship, mostly without success, but we did avoid the rancor and \nbitterness which prevailed on the House side.\n\n\nThe Improbability of Two-Thirds for Conviction Overshadowed the Process\n\n  From the outset, the conventional wisdom was there would not be two-\nthirds of the Senate in favor of conviction. That pervasive view has \ncast a long shadow over the impeachment proceedings. When the Senate \nconvened on January 6th, there was immediate informal consideration on \ntaking a test vote to determine if there were 34 Senators opposed to \nconviction which would end the matter. There appeared to be even more \nthan that number so opposed who based their judgments on news media \naccounts. That trial balloon was abandoned when many Senators objected \non the ground that the Constitution called for a trial and the Senate \nowed the House the Constitutional deference to give the House Managers \na chance to prove their case.\n  In mid-November, I wrote in a New York Times ``op ed'' article that \nimpeachment should be bypassed and the President should be held \naccountable through the criminal process after his\n\n[[Page S1536]]\n\nterm ended. When the House of Representatives returned Articles of \nImpeachment in mid-December, I felt at that stage the Senate had a \nconstitutional duty to proceed to a trial.\n\n\n               The Constitutional Requirement for a Trial\n\n  The Constitution explicitly provides for a trial:\n\n       The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all \n     impeachments (emphasis added). Article I, Section 3, Clause 6\n\n  The same clause refers to being convicted and the next clause refers \nto judgment, so the constitutional mandate for a trial is plain. Senate \nImpeachment Rules 6 and 17 deal with witnesses.\n  The Senate was schizophrenic in wanting to avoid what many considered \nto be a pointless trial. Others considered it to be our Constitutional \nduty to hold a trial and give appropriate deference to the House's \naction on the Articles. In a series of halting half-steps, the Senate \nstumbled through a ``pseudo-trial'', a ``sham trial''--really no trial \nat all. In the end, it would have taken less time to let the House \nManagers put on their case with a full White House defense than the \nhelter-skelter procedures adopted by the Senate.\n\n\n                      The Adverse Public Reaction\n\n  From the time the Senate reconvened on January 6, 1999, the public \npressure to conclude the trial promptly was palpable. The improbability \nof a two-thirds vote for conviction was only one factor although the \ntotality of the other factors contributed to that improbability.\n  The adverse public reaction was reflected in consistent polling data \nand the feel on the streets in our various states. Notwithstanding the \nserious charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, Democratic \nSenators argued and many people agreed that a private sexual liaison \nshould not have caused a multi-year, multi-million dollar \ninvestigation. If the Independent Counsel, they argued, could establish \nno wrongdoing in Whitewater, Travelgate and Filegate, why elevate a \ncharge based on sex to an impeachable offense?\n  I think it is a significant distinction that President Clinton, \nunlike President Nixon, was not charged with covering up an underlying \ncrime. President Clinton had the option of not answering deposition \nquestions and/or simply not defending the Paula Jones lawsuit. At worst \nthat would have resulted in a default judgment being entered against \nhim with an assessment of damages. As it worked out, a non-defense \nmight still have led to dismissal of the case as a matter of law and on \nthe eventual settlement. In any event, the President would have avoided \nhis present predicament by not responding.\n  Once the President undertook his course of action, then he must \nanswer to the serious charges of perjury and obstruction of justice \neven though he was not covering up criminal activity.\n  Attorney General Reno made a major mistake in acting to expand Judge \nKenneth Starr's jurisdiction to include the Lewinsky matter. In mid-\nJanuary 1998, contemporaneously with the Attorney General's action, I \ncommented that the public would suspect a vendetta on the part of Judge \nStarr because there had been so many apparently unproductive \ninvestigations going on for so long. This was not a criticism of Judge \nStarr, but an inevitable public reaction. The public's suspicion of \nJudge Starr carried over to impeachment.\n  When I challenged Attorney General Reno in the Judiciary Committee \noversight hearing on July 15, 1998 about why she acted to expand Judge \nStarr's authority, she refused to answer the question saying only:\n\n       The application speaks for itself, Senator.\n\n\n                            The Witness War\n\n  The failure of the House to call witnesses during their hearings \ninjected a Trojan Horse into the Articles. The House had good reason \nnot to call witnesses because of its concern to finish its work before \nthe 106th Congress convened to take up the nation's important pending \nbusiness. But, that set the stage for the witness issue to haunt the \nSenate from the outset.\n  Early in January, there was a strenuous effort for bi-partisanship on \nwitnesses and procedures. At a joint caucus on January 8th, by almost \nspontaneous combustion, agreement was reached 100-0 on preliminary \nprocedures leaving depositions and witnesses until later.\n  Immediately thereafter, bi-partisanship broke down. While this may \nseem self-serving from the Republican point of view, Republicans had \nmore to gain from bi-partisanship than Democrats to avoid the rancor of \nthe House proceedings and give legitimacy to impeachment. Many \nDemocrats openly said the President would be helped by party line votes \nmaking the Senate look like the House.\n  The Democrats then lined up solidly behind the President with a \nnumber of Republicans, sometimes more than six, teetering on joining \nthe Democrats. There are obviously limits to what elected officials \nwill do to vote a straight party line if it puts their seats in \njeopardy. The Senate Democrats had the effective cover of a popular \nPresident and their party line votes followed while a significant \nnumber of Republicans faced constituents opposed to impeachment in \ntheir election cycles.\n\n  The sequence of partisan maneuvering on witnesses is important to \nunderstanding how the House Managers were precluded from presenting \ntheir case in a fair way. Appendix A describes those events in some \ndetail. The ultimate result was a sharply limited number of deposition \nwitnesses, three, with videotaped depositions only and no live witness \nat trial.\n  In my Senate tenure, I have not seen a more contentious issue than \nthe calling of witnesses either live or videotaped. It goes beyond the \npublic pressure to terminate or at least abbreviate the Senate \nproceeding. The argument that the well of the Senate should not be the \nstage for lewd and lascivious testimony was answered by the commitment \nof the House Managers to avoid such testimony. The argument that Monica \nLewinsky should not appear on the Senate floor once occupied by Daniel \nWebster and John F. Kennedy has to give way to the Senate's duty to try \nthis President. The Senate did not choose the President's consorts and \npotential witnesses, but the Senate is duty bound to ``try'' the case \nas mandated by the Constitution and do ``impartial justice'' as the \nSenators' oath specified.\n\n\n                           The Live Witnesses\n\n  I was one of three Senator presiders/observers designated by Senator \nLott, the Majority Leader, for the depositions of Monica Lewinsky, \nVernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal. Observing these live witnesses \nconfirmed my thinking that the full senate should have seen and heard \ntheir testimony in the tradition of trial practice. While a videotape \nis very informative, there is no substitute for the more precise \nevaluation of demeanor and its many nuances which comes across fully \nonly through live testimony.\n  When the videotapes were played in the Senate chamber, the contrast \nwas stark with the same live testimony I saw and heard. On a number of \noccasions, the sound was inaudible and the tape could not be rewound. \nThere was a far superior opportunity in person to observe the \nwitnesses' facial responses, their reactions and their general \ndemeanor. In addition, only a portion of their videos was played. \nAlthough senators had a chance for full private viewings, it is \ninevitable that many Senator-jurors did not utilize that opportunity to \nobserve all the videos.\n  Ms. Monica Lewinsky was a very impressive witness: poised, \narticulate, well-prepared. Seeing her testify in person, I understand \nwhy the President's counsel had fought so strenuously to keep her away \nfrom the well of the Senate. Had she told her whole story in the well \nof the Senate, a rapt national TV audience would have been watching and \nthe dynamics of the proceeding might have been dramatically changed.\n\n\n                Lawyers' Arguments Instead of Testimony\n\n  Instead of hearing testimony from live witnesses, the Senate listened \nto twelve days of lawyer's arguments. Six days were consumed with \nopening statements which should have taken a few hours. For two days, \nSenators submitted questions through the Chief Justice for responses \nfrom attorneys which added little illumination to what was already on \nthe record. Two more days were spent arguing the motion to dismiss and \nthe resolution on depositions where the lawyers essentially repeated \nearlier arguments with an additional day for votes on those issues.\n  Finally, limited evidence was presented with three videotaped \ndepositions--Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal. \nAnother\n\n[[Page S1537]]\n\nday was consumed on votes rejecting live witnesses and permitting use \nof the videotapes. On the day designated for presentation of those \ndepositions, only snippets were shown with most of the time consumed by \nlawyers' arguments. A final day for closing arguments was held with \nlawyers again presenting arguments which had been repeated on eleven \nprior days.\n  So, in place of a traditional trial with live witnesses such as \nMonica Lewinsky, Betty Currie, Vernon Jordan, Erskine Bowles, John \nPodesta, Sidney Blumenthal, possibly Kathleen Willey or whomever the \nHouse Managers chose to call, the Senate heard days of repetitious \nlawyers' argument from a grand jury record.\n\n\n                          The Perjury Article\n\n  The President's version was limited to his deposition in the Paula \nJones case on January 17, 1998 and his grand jury testimony on August \n17, 1998. In their totality, those two cameo appearances raised more \nquestions by far than they answered. As expected, the President was \nexceptionally well prepared on the law and exceptionally adroit and \nmanipulative on the facts or, more accurately, on evading the facts.\n  The law on perjury is set forth in the case of Bronston versus United \nStates, 409 U.S. 342 (1973), where the Supreme Court of the United \nStates established a rigorous standard for proving perjury. Bronston, \nunder oath in a 1966 bankruptcy hearing, was asked whether he ever had \nbank accounts in Swiss banks and he replied: ``the company had an \naccount there for about six months, in Zurich.''\n  His answer that the company had an account there for about six months \nwas accurate. It was not accurate that was the only account the company \nhad. The Supreme Court exonerated Bronston on the charge of perjury \nbecause the questioner did not press further to get a specific answer \non whether the company had an account in addition to the one responded \nto by Bronston.\n\n  Utilizing the holding in Bronston to the utmost, the President \ncouched his answers with great care relying on the questioner not to \npursue the unanswered issues. For example, the President did not deny \nlying to his aides, but rather evaded the question and there was no \nfollow-up. John Podesta, President Clinton's Deputy Chief of Staff at \nthe time, testified that on January 23, 1998:\n\n       He [President Clinton] said to me he had never had sex with \n     her [Monica Lewinsky], and that--and that he never asked--you \n     know, he repeated that denial, but he was extremely explicit \n     in saying he never had sex with her--[H]e [President Clinton] \n     said that he never had sex with her [Monica Lewinsky] in any \n     way whatsoever--that they had not had oral sex.\n  In a Senate deposition, Sidney Blumenthal, an assistant to the \nPresident, testified that the President lied to him. In testimony \nbefore the grand jury, Mr. Blumenthal testified that the President told \nhim that he had ``rebuffed'' Ms. Lewinsky's advances. Mr. Blumenthal \nfurther testified that the President told him the following:\n\n       She [Monica Lewinsky] threatened him. She said that she \n     would tell people they'd had an affair, that she was known as \n     the stalker among her peers, and that she hated it and if she \n     had an affair or said she had an affair then she wouldn't be \n     the stalker any more.\n       He [President Clinton] told me that she [Monica Lewinsky] \n     came on to him and that he had told her he couldn't have \n     sexual relations with her and that she threatened him. That \n     is what he told me.\n  In his testimony before the grand jury, President Clinton stated,\n\n       I told them [his aides] things that were true about this \n     relationship. They [things the President said to his aides] \n     may have been misleading, and if they were I have to take \n     responsibility for it, and I'm sorry.\n  Note that the President does not deny lying but only that:\n\n       I told them things that were true about this relationship.\n  The President did say some things which were true. The questioner did \nnot then pursue the line of interrogation by asking if, in addition to \nsaying some things which were true, the President told his aides other \nthings which were lies. On that clever, ambiguous record, the President \nescapes the perjury net.\n  Similarly, President Clinton dodged the perjury charges on his \ntestimony on being alone with Monica Lewinsky. She testified they were \nalone when they had eleven sexual encounters either in the President's \npersonal office or the adjacent hallway. In his January 17th \ndeposition, the President was asked if he was ever alone with Monica \nLewinsky in any room of the White House. The President responded,\n\n       I have no specific recollection, but it seems to me that \n     she was on duty on a couple of occasions working for the \n     legislative affairs office and brought me some things to \n     sign, something on the weekend.\n  Further, when the President was asked if he was ever alone with Ms. \nLewinsky in the hallway between the Oval Office and the kitchen area, \nthe President responded,\n\n       I don't believe so, unless we were walking back to the back \n     dining room with the pizza. I just, I don't remember. I don't \n     believe we were alone in the hallway, no.\n  The President again gets away with vague, unresponsive replies. When \nthe President says ``I don't believe we were alone in the hallway, \nno'', there is then no pursuit as to whether they were alone in other \nplaces. He succeeds in avoiding and misleading, but does not make the \nunequivocal false statement required by Bronston to constitute perjury.\n  The President was treated differently than other witnesses before a \ngrand jury when he was permitted to read from a prepared statement:\n\n       I engaged in conduct that was wrong. These encounters did \n     not consist of sexual intercourse. They did not constitute \n     sexual relations as I understood that term to be defined at \n     my January 17th, 1998 deposition. But they did involve \n     inappropriate intimate contact.\n  The President then declined to respond to Monica Lewinsky's specific \ncharges and was not pressed for answers. He made a blanket denial of \nhaving sex with Monica Lewinsky relying on a tortured interpretation of \nJudge Wright's definition of sexual relations:\n\n       I thought the definition included any activity by the \n     person being deposed, where the person was the actor and came \n     in contact with those parts of the bodies with the purpose or \n     intent of gratification, and excluded any other activity. For \n     example, kissing is not covered by that, I don't think.\n  He further stated that:\n\n       My understanding was, what I was giving to you, was that \n     what was covered in those first two lines was any direct \n     contact by the person being deposed with those body parts of \n     another person's body, if the contact was done with an intent \n     to arouse or gratify. That's what I believe it means today.\n  The question was not pursued whether there was a sexual relationship \nwhere Ms. Lewinsky was the actor who made contact with the President's \nbody with an intent to arouse or gratify. When asked specifically about \noral sex, the President responded,\n\n       . . . (Y)ou asked me did I believe that oral sex performed \n     on the person being deposed was covered by that definition, \n     and I said no. I don't believe it's covered by the \n     definition.\n  And there is the curious contention by the President on what the \nmeaning of the word ``is'' is. A videotape of his deposition shows the \nPresident sitting quietly and listening to his attorney, Robert \nBennett's arguments to Judge Wright based on Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit \nwhich the President knew to be perjurious.\n  In his grand jury testimony, the President defended his silence \nduring this statement:\n\n       I was not paying a great deal of attention to this \n     exchange. I was focusing on my own testimony.\n  The President also told the grand jury that Mr. Bennett's statement \nthat there ``is'' no sex of any kind was not necessarily false, but \nrather:\n       It depends on what the meaning of the word ``is'' is. If \n     the--if he--if ``is'' means is and never has been, that is \n     not--that is one thing. If it means there is none, that was a \n     completely true statement.\n  On this state of the record, the Senate should have pressed the \nPresident for responses to so many important unanswered questions. \nSince the President was, in effect, asking the Senate to leave him in \noffice, why was the Senate not justified in, at least, insisting on \nanswers to key questions. When Senators submitted interrogatories to \nthe Chief Justice for responses from the attorneys, I submitted the \nfollowing question:\n\n       Would the President honor a request by the Senate to \n     testify? If not, why not? If he declined to testify either on \n     his own initiative or a Senate invitation, would the Senate \n     be justified in drawing an adverse inference from his failure \n     to testify?\n  With so many other questions submitted, this one was not asked. \nDuring the trial, White House Counsel said the President would respond \nto written questions, but that offer was rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1538]]\n\n On January 25th the President refused to answer ten written questions \nsubmitted by Republican Senators.\n  On February 3rd, twenty-six Republican Senators sent the President a \nletter requesting a deposition. As expected, he declined. In a context \nwhere the Senate voted against live witnesses and permitted only three \ndeposition witnesses, it was not surprising that there was no political \nwill to press the President for his testimony. I believe that was a \nserious mistake. In the context where the Senate could not even \nconsider exercising the political will to ask, let alone compel, the \nPresident to leave the Oval Office for a day or a few days to testify \nat his impeachment trial or even to give a deposition, how could the \nSenate be expected to exercise the much greater political will to \nremove the President from office?\n  In her civil lawsuit, Paula Jones had been able to compel the \nPresident to give a deposition. In the grand jury proceeding, the \nIndependent Counsel, in effect, compelled the President to testify. \nWhy, then, shouldn't the Senate exercise the commensurate power in an \nimpeachment proceeding to obtain the President's testimony when there \nwere so many open questions.\n  In my legal judgment, the Senate has the power to subpoena the \nPresident. (My memorandum to Senator Lott dated December 10, 1998, \nattached as Appendix B, discusses the Senate's legal authority to \nsubpoena the President at pages 8 through 11. My memorandum to Senator \nLott dated December 29, 1998, attached as Appendix C, discusses \npossible testimony by the President at pages 12 and 13.) Senate \nImpeachment Rule 6 gives the Senate the subpoena power. The Supreme \nCourt of the United States held President Nixon was subject to subpoena \nto turn over the famous tapes under the established principle ``That \nthe public * * * has a right to every man's evidence.'' President \nNixon's case, although not dealing with impeachment, is further \ninstructive in the Supreme Court's sweeping language on the need for \nall the facts even where the President is subject to subpoena:\n\n       The need to develop all relevant facts in the adversary \n     system is both fundamental and comprehensive. The ends of \n     criminal justice would be defeated if judgments were to be \n     founded on a partial or speculative presentation of the \n     facts. The very integrity of the judicial system and public \n     confidence in the system depend on full disclosure of all the \n     facts, within the framework of the rule of evidence. To \n     ensure that justice is done, it is imperative to the function \n     of the courts that compulsory process be available for the \n     production of evidence needed either by the prosecution or \n     the defense.\n\n\n                 the article on obstruction of justice\n\n  Following President Clinton's deposition in the Paula Jones case on \nJanuary 17, 1998, the President called his personal secretary, Betty \nCurrie, at home and asked her to come into the office on the following \nday. On Sunday, January 18, President Clinton met with Ms. Currie and, \naccording to Ms. Currie, made the following statements to her, one \nright after the other:\n\n       You were always there when she was, right?\n       We were never really alone.\n       Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?\n       You can see and hear everything, right?\n\n  Ms. Currie testified at first (1/27/98) that, based on his demeanor \nand the way he made the statements, the President wanted her to agree \nwith them.\n  Six months later (7/22/98) when she testified for the second time, \nMs. Currie said that although the President stated ``right?'' at the \nend of the statements, she understood that she could agree or disagree \nwith them.\n  I find the testimony of Betty Currie on January 27, 1998 most \ntroubling. Why would the President ask a series of questions when he \nknew the answers unless he sought to influence her testimony? But then, \nMs. Currie undercut her January 27th testimony when she testified on \nJuly 22, 1998 that she understood from the President that she could \ndisagree with him on those questions.\n  In order to make a finding on an important issue like this which \ncould lead to the removal of the President, the Senate should have \nheard Ms. Currie in person to clarify her testimony. In the absence of \nsuch clarification on this state of the record, there is at least a \nreasonable doubt on this issue.\n  Monica Lewinsky testified that she met with the President in the Oval \nOffice on December 28, 1997 and that the President gave her several \nChristmas presents at this meeting. Ms. Lewinsky further testified that \nat some point in the conversation, she said to the President, ``Maybe I \nshould put the gifts away outside my house somewhere or give them to \nsomeone, maybe Betty.'' Ms. Lewinsky recalled that the President \nresponded either, ``I don't know'' or ``Let me think about that.''\n  The President testified that he has no distinct recollection of \ndiscussing the gifts with Ms. Lewinsky on December 28. He told the \ngrand jury that:\n\n       My memory is that on some day in December, and I'm sorry I \n     don't remember when it was, she said, well, what if they ask \n     me about the gifts you have given me. And I said, well, if \n     you get a request to produce them, you have to give them \n     whatever you have.\n\n  In the afternoon of December 28, 1997, Betty Currie drove to Ms. \nLewinsky's Watergate apartment and collected a box containing most of \nthe President's gifts. Ms. Currie then drove home and placed this box \nunder her bed. According to Ms. Lewinsky, the transfer originated in a \nphone call from Ms. Currie in which Ms. Currie stated, ``I understand \nyou have something to give me,'' or, ``The President said you have \nsomething to give me.''\n\n  Betty Currie testified that it was Ms. Lewinsky who first raised the \nidea of the gift transfer, either in person or over the telephone. Ms. \nCurrie testified that she did not remember the President ever telling \nher to call Ms. Lewinsky or to pick something up from Ms. Lewinsky.\n  Monica Lewinsky testified that Ms. Currie came over to pick up the \ngifts at ``around 2:00 pm or so''. Cellular phone records reveal that \nMs. Currie phoned Monica Lewinsky's home at 3:32 on December 28th and \nhad a conversation of one minute or less.\n  The evidence against the President on the gifts issue is equivocal \nwhere the idea returning the gifts in the conversation between the \nPresident and Monica Lewinsky originates with Ms. Lewinsky; Ms. Currie \nsays she does not remember the President telling her to call or pick up \nsomething from Ms. Lewinsky; the time of the call as shown on the cell \nphone records conflicts (3:32 pm) with Ms. Lewinsky's version of the \nsequence of events and the President gave Monica Lewinsky more gifts on \nDecember 28, 1997, the same day that efforts were made for the return \nof some of the gifts.\n  In December, 1997 and January, 1998, the President's close friend, \nWashington attorney Vernon Jordan, helped find Monica Lewinsky a job in \nNew York City. On Friday, December 5, 1997, the President's attorneys \nreceived a witness list for the Paula Jones case. Monica Lewinsky was \nincluded on this list.\n  On December 11, 1997, Judge Susan Webber Wright issued an order which \nstated that Paula Jones was entitled to ``information regarding any \nindividuals with whom the President had sexual relations or proposed or \nsought to have sexual relations and who were during the relevant time \nframe state or federal employees.'' This order made it clear that Ms. \nJones would be able to subpoena Monica Lewinsky.\n  On December 11, 1997 Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky met and Mr. Jordan \ntook concrete actions to help Ms. Lewinsky find a job. Mr. Jordan \nplaced calls on her behalf to three business contacts. Mr. Jordan also \ntold her to send letters to three additional business contacts that he \nprovided to her. This meeting and the phone calls took place prior to \nthe issuance of Judge Wright's order of the same day.\n  On January 7th, Ms. Lewinsky signed an affidavit denying a sexual \nrelationship with the President. On January 8th, Ms. Lewinsky had an \ninterview with McAndrews and Forbes in New York. Afterwards, she phoned \nVernon Jordan to report that the interview had gone poorly. Vernon \nJordan immediately phoned Mr. Ron Perelman, the CEO of McAndrews and \nForbes, and asked for this help. The next day, Ms. Lewinsky was given \nanother interview and was extended an offer to work for Revlon, a \nsubsidiary of McAndrews and Forbes.\n  Vernon Jordan defended his efforts to help Monica Lewinsky get a job \nas a payback for help he secured as a young lawyer in getting a job \nwhen he was a victim of racial discrimination. Jordan testified that he \ntold no one at Revlon\n\n[[Page S1539]]\n\nthat Monica Lewinsky was a witness in a case involving the President \nand that Revlon offered Monica Lewinsky a job because she was \nqualified.\n  If the Revlon job offer was part of a plan or conspiracy to obstruct \njustice, then Vernon Jordan would have had to be part of that. The \nHouse Managers raise no such contention.\n  An important piece of evidence on this issue was the uncontradicted \ntestimony of Monica Lewinsky that she intended to deny her relationship \nwith the President from the outset before she was subpoenaed or the \nPresident coached her or Vernon Jordan helped her get a job.\n\n\n                   Limitations on the House Managers\n\n  The signals to the House Managers from the Senate were unmistakable \nthat the Senate was unlikely to approve depositions if the list was too \nlong. Responding to that advance notice, the House Managers submitted \nonly three names for depositions necessarily leaving off potentially \nimportant witnesses like Ms. Currie. Given the absence of live \nwitnesses and limitations on depositions, the House Managers have been \ncompelled to rely on transcripts from questioning by the Independent \nCounsel in grand jury proceedings. Those transcripts have left many key \nissues unresolved.\n\n\n                            tv and the trial\n\n  The Senate proceeding posed a curious dichotomy with one hundred \nsitting silent Senators in the Chamber and non-stop Senators' \ninterviews in the corridors and media galleries. The case was really \nnot being tried in the Senate Chamber, but in a sense was being tried \nin the Senate corridors, on the evening TV interview shows and on the \nSunday talk shows.\n  I declined TV interviews after the day the trial began on the ground \nthat my oath to do ``impartial justice'' was in jeopardy by interviews \non the day's proceedings which might conflict with my juror's \nfunctions. Again, oddly, on the occasions when Senators were permitted \nto speak on the Senate floor on the motion to dismiss and the \nResolution on depositions, the sessions were closed so that the public \ncould not hear our debate.\n  Efforts to open the Senate proceeding during final deliberations also \nfailed to get the two-thirds vote to overturn the Senate rule closing \nthe Chamber. I thought the public and posterity should know the reasons \nfor our votes as a guide for today and the future. The informal, seat-\nof-the pants, corridor comments may be found in the CNN or MSNBC files, \nbut there will be no Senate videotape to record what could be important \nSenators' views.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Each Senator individually and the Senate collectively took an oath to \ndo ``impartial justice''.\n  The Senate has done only ``partial justice'', a double entendre, both \n(1) in the sense of not doing ``impartial justice'' to the House \nManagers by unduly restricting them in the presentation of their case; \nand, (2) ``partial justice'' in the sense of hearing only part of the \nevidence.\n  When the Senate prohibited live witnesses and permitted only three \nvideotaped depositions, the House Managers had one hand tied behind \ntheir back. There has been no ``trial'' but only a ``pseudo-trial'' or \na ``sham trial''. The best the House Managers could do was to cut, \npaste and glue together transcripts from the Independent Counsel's \ngrand jury proceedings. Ms. Lewinsky testified briefly on videotape and \nthe President gave two vague, evasive depositions.\n  The House Managers could not meet the heavy burden of proof beyond a \nreasonable doubt. That is the only appropriate statement where the \nunderlying charges are the crimes of perjury and obstruction of \njustice.\n  Had the House Managers sustained that burden under these Articles, \nthere was a further burden of persuasion, as I see it, to establish \nthat the national interest warranted removal from office.\n  Perjury and obstruction of justice are serious offenses which must \nnot be tolerated by anyone in our society. However, I remain \nunconvinced that impeachment is the best course to vindicate the rule \nof law on this offensive conduct. President Clinton may still be \nprosecuted in the Federal criminal courts when his term ends. His \nlawyers have, in effect, invited that prosecution by citing it as the \npreferable remedy to impeachment.\n  A criminal trial for the President after his term ends may yet be the \nbest vindicator for the rule of law.\n  If the full weight of the evidence with live witnesses had been \npresented to the Senate instead of bits and pieces of cold transcript, \nit is possible that the Senate and the American people would have \ndemanded the President's appearance in the well of the Senate. Under \nfirm examination, the President might have displayed the egregious \ncharacter described harshly by his defenders in their proposed censure \npetitions. That sequence might have led to his removal.\n  But on this record, the proofs are not present. Juries in criminal \ncases under the laws of Scotland have three possible verdicts: guilty, \nnot guilty, not proven. Given the option in this trial, I suspect that \nmany Senators would choose ``not proven'' instead of ``not guilty''.\n  That is my verdict: not proven. The President has dodged perjury by \ncalculated evasion and poor interrogation. Obstruction of justice fails \nby gaps in the proofs.\n  Many Senators have sought to express their gross displeasure by \nfindings of fact or censure. I reject both. The Constitution says \njudgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend beyond removal and \ndisqualification from future office. Under the crucial doctrine of \nseparation of powers, the Congress is not and should not be in the \nbusiness of censuring any President. We are properly in the business of \nexamining our own conduct as Senators. On that score, on the record of \nthis ``pseudo-trial'', it is my view that the Senate failed to fulfill \nthe Constitutional mandate to ``try'' this case.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Appendices A, B and C be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the appendices were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                               Appendix A\n\n  When the Republican and Democratic caucuses could not agree on the \npreliminary procedures and witness issue, including depositions, a vote \nwas set for late afternoon on January 7th. That vote was canceled in an \neffort to achieve a bi-partisan compromise. A joint caucus was then \nheld in the Old Senate chamber at 9:30 am on January 8th where the \noutline of a procedural agreement was reached for the first stage \nwithout resolving the witness or deposition issues, but deferring them \nuntil we knew more about the opposing parties' cases.\n  While a resolution of agreement was being drafted in the early \nafternoon fleshing out the compromise, Senator Lott asked Senator Kyl, \nSenator Sessions and me to explore the case to determine what \nwitnesses, if any, the Senate should hear to make its decision. In mid \nafternoon, Senators Kyl and Sessions and I met with Chairman Henry Hyde \nand some of the House Managers to inform them of the joint discussions, \nto get a preliminary idea of their thinking on witnesses and to set up \na meeting for the afternoon of January 11 to get their specification on \nwhat witnesses they believed necessary for the Senate trial. Later on \nthe afternoon of January 8th, Resolution 16 was agreed to 100 to 0.\n  In an effort to carry out a bi-partisan approach, I called Senator \nLieberman on the morning of January 11th to invite him and/or other \nSenate Democrats to an afternoon meeting with House Managers. He said \nhe would check with Senator Daschle and then called back to decline. \nSenators Kyl, Sessions and I met with the House Managers that afternoon \nto review their witness list. We advised them that the Democrats were \nopposed to witnesses and there was opposition among Republican Senators \nto a lengthy trial with many witnesses. We said their best opportunity \nfor witnesses would be to show conflicts in the record testimony which \ncould establish the need for seeing and hearing the witnesses to \nevaluate their demeanor. They responded they needed witnesses beyond \nconflicts to show the tone and tenor of their case. We said they might \nconsider using their 24 hours of opening statements to develop the \nneed, as they saw it, for specific witnesses.\n  I called White House Counsel Charles Ruff on January 12th advising \nhim of\n\n[[Page S1540]]\n\nthe meeting with House Managers stating that Senators Kyl, Sessions and \nI were interested in meeting with the President's attorneys. Mr. Ruff \ncalled back on January 13th declining the invitation.\n  On January 25th, in advance of consideration of Senator Byrd's motion \nto dismiss and Senator Lott's resolution on taking depositions, Senator \nLott requested Senator Kyl and me to talk again to House Managers to \ndetermine how many witnesses they would need and for what purpose. \nSenator Lott had extended an invitation to join in those discussions to \nSenator Daschle who declined. Before that meeting was held on January \n25th, I advised Senator Lieberman of the scheduled meeting and told him \nSenator Daschle declined Senator Lott's invitation.\n  Between our January 11 and January 25th meetings with House Managers, \nthere had been numerous public comment by Republican Senators opposing \nmany witnesses even for depositions with some expressing possible \nopposition to any deposition witnesses. When Senator Kyl and I met with \nHouse Managers on January 25th, we said it was problematic whether \nthere would be 51 or more votes for a lengthy witness list.\n  In arguments before the full Senate, House Managers complained about \nthe limitations on deposition witnesses and expressed their interest in \ncalling live witnesses with latitude to develop their cases as they saw \nfit in accordance with regular trial practice.\n  Late in the evening on January 26th after closed door Senate debate \non calling witnesses for depositions, Senator Carl Levin and I \ndiscussed a bi-partisan compromise. We continued that discussion early \nthe next morning and presented our views to our respective caucuses on \nJanuary 27th. While Senator Levin and I did not agree on all points, we \nwere closer together than our caucuses. At mid-day on January 27th on \nan almost straight party line vote, the Senate decided to take \ndepositions of only three witnesses.\n  For the balance of the afternoon of January 27th and all day on the \n28th, there were strenuous efforts to agree on deposition procedures. \nDemocrats were adamant that the depositions should not be videotaped; \nor, if videotaped, on the commitment that they could be viewed only by \nSenators and limited staff. Republicans insisted that the depositions \nshould be videotaped deferring the decision on whether they would be \nused as a substitute for live witnesses. Late in the afternoon Senator \nLott's resolution was adopted to videotape the depositions without \nspecifying their use after defeating Senator Daschle's amendment to \nlimit the depositions to a typed transcript without videotapes.\n  After those depositions were taken, on February 4, 1999, the Senate \nvoted to exclude live witnesses and to see the videotapes of the three \ndeposed witnesses after the defeat of Senator Daschle's amendment to \nlimit the depositions to the typed transcript only without videotapes.\n\n                               Appendix B\n\n                                                December 10, 1998.\n     To: Senator Trent Lott, Majority Leader.\n     From: Senator Arlen Spector.\n\n       As a follow up to our recent meeting, this memorandum sets \n     forth my thinking on how to handle the impeachment proceeding \n     if it reaches the Senate and my analysis on some of the legal \n     issues as follows:\n       1. May the Senate consider in the next Congress articles of \n     impeachment passed by the House in this Congress?\n       2. Must the Senate trail begin the day following the House \n     presentment?\n       3. Is censure authorized in an impeachment proceeding?\n       4. Must/should the Senate hear testimony from live \n     witnesses?\n       5. How long will the Senate impeachment trail take?\n       6. Possibility of conviction\n       7. Concluding observations\n\n\n may the senate in the 106th congress consider articles of impeachment \n     passed by the House of representatives in the 105th congress?\n\n       Yes. Precedents hold that the Senate may carry an \n     impeachment over into a subsequent Congress. As noted in the \n     addenda to the Rules on Senate Impeachment Proceedings:\n       ``Articles of impeachment against Harold Louderback, a \n     United States district judge for the northern district of \n     California were exhibited on March 3, 1933, at the end of the \n     second session of the 72d Congress, and the trail occurred \n     during the first session of the 73d Congress, . . .\n       ``At the end of the 100th Congress, the Senate adopted a \n     resolution to continue into the 101st Congress the \n     proceedings in the impeachment of Alcee L. Hastings, a United \n     State judge for the southern district of Florida''.\n       Notwithstanding a contrary opinion given at the House \n     proceeding, it is my judgment that these practical precedents \n     would virtually certainly be upheld if any judicial challenge \n     was attempted because of the decision of the United States \n     Supreme Court in the case involving Judge Nixon where the \n     Court held the Senate had the authority to establish \n     procedures under the impeachment clause.\n\n\n  must rule iii on senate impeachment procedure be read literally to \nrequire continuous consideration by the senate the day following house \n                presentation of articles of impeachment?\n\n       No. While Rule III appears to impose such a rigid \n     requirement on its face, the Rules taken on the whole and \n     prior practice show the Senate may establish a more flexible \n     schedule.\n       The specific language of Rule III provides: ``Upon such \n     articles of impeachment being presented to the Senate, the \n     Senate shall, at 1 o'clock afternoon of the day (Sunday \n     excepted) following such presentation, or sooner if ordered \n     by the Senate, proceed to the consideration of such articles, \n     and shall continue in session from day to day (Sundays \n     excepted) after the trial shall commence (unless otherwise \n     ordered by the Senate) until final judgment shall be \n     rendered.''\n       Other Rules provide for intervening action between the time \n     the articles are presented by the House to the Senate and \n     subsequent proceedings before the Senate. For example, Rule 8 \n     provides for a writ of summons to be issued to the person \n     impeached with a date to appear before the Senate.\n       The impeached party is given a date to answer the Articles \n     and the House is then given a date to reply.\n       For example, in the trial of President Andrew Johnson, the \n     President was given 17 days to prepare his answer (his \n     counsel had requested 47 days to prepare). The House managers \n     took one day to file their brief reply to the President's \n     answer. In the 1989 trail of Judge Walter Nixon, the Judge \n     was given 29 days to prepare his answer, and the House was \n     given 12 days to file its response.\n       These rules and that prior practice demonstrate that there \n     is a necessary time lapse between the presentation of the \n     Articles to the Senate and the commencement of further Senate \n     hearings or proceedings.\n\n\n   is censure an authorized consequence or remedy in an impeachment \n                              proceeding?\n\n       No. The specific language in the Constitution Article 1, \n     Section 3, Clause 7 contains the clear implication that \n     judgment in an impeachment proceeding shall not include \n     censure or any consequence or remedy other than that \n     specified in the Constitution: ``Judgement in Cases of \n     Impeachment shall not extend further that to removal from \n     Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of \n     Honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.'' The \n     language ``shall not extend further'' than the enumerated \n     consequences or remedies precludes any judgment beyond \n     ``removal from office'' and ``disqualification to hold and \n     enjoy any Office of Honor, Trust or Profit under the United \n     States''.\n       Further support for the conclusion that impeachment does \n     not contemplate penalties like censure is contained in the \n     historical references. Of the fifteen individuals impeached \n     by the House of Representatives, all seven convicted by trial \n     in the Senate were removed from office.\n       Contrasted to censure, impeachment and removal from office \n     are not intended to be a punishment. In his ``Commentaries on \n     the Constitution of the United States,'' Justice Joseph Story \n     notes that impeachment ``is not so much designed to punish an \n     offender as to secure the state against gross political \n     misdemeanors. It touches neither his person nor property but \n     simply divests him of his political capacity.''\n       Consequently, the impeachment process does not contemplate \n     Congress imposing any penalty, including censure, as part of \n     an impeachment proceeding. Once the impeachment proceeding is \n     concluded, it is a different issue as to whether Congress can \n     pass a resolution of censure in the same manner Congress \n     enacts resolutions generally.\n\n\n    would the constitutional requirements of the senate impeachment \nproceeding be satisfied by the factual recitations in the starr report \n   or is the senate obligated to hear testimony from live witnesses?\n\n       While the Constitution provides no explicit answer, \n     inferences from the Constitution, the Senate Rules on \n     Impeachment and the prior practice strongly suggest that live \n     witnesses were contemplated by the framers instead of merely \n     a hearsay report.\n       The Constitution explicitly provides for a trial in the \n     provision of Article 1, Section 3, Clause 6: ``The Senate \n     shall have the sole Power to try all impeachments'' (Emphasis \n     added). The seriousness and magnitude of removal of a Federal \n     official, especially the President, suggests that the jury \n     (senators) should have the best evidence and that would \n     require something more than a hearsay document no matter how \n     extensive and explicit the Starr Report may be.\n       That clause further provides: ``and no person shall be \n     convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the \n     Members present'' (Emphasis added). The use of the word \n     ``convicted'' again refers to a phase or the consequence of \n     trial and the analogy to a criminal proceeding. While the \n     Senate is not\n\n[[Page S1541]]\n\n     bound by traditional rules of evidence so that we might \n     consider matters not admissible in a court of law, it would \n     seem questionable or appear unseemly to base our judgment \n     exclusively on hearsay on such an important proceeding.\n       The provisions of Article 1, Section 3, Clause 7 carry \n     forward the analogy of trial referring to the ultimate \n     ``judgment'': ``Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not \n     extend further . . .'' (Emphasis added).\n       The Senate Rules on Impeachment further contemplate, \n     although do not necessarily mandate, a proceeding with live \n     witnesses and opportunities for the examination and cross-\n     examination of such witnesses. For instance, Rule 6 provides \n     that: ``The Senate shall have power to compel the attendance \n     of witnesses. . . .'' Rule 17 provides that: ``Witnesses \n     shall be examined by one person on behalf of the party \n     producing them, and then cross-examined by one person on the \n     other side.''\n       Although the Rules never explicitly give the parties the \n     right to call witnesses, the language ``on behalf of the \n     party producing them'' in Rule 17 implies that the parties do \n     have such a right. The practice of the Senate confirms this \n     implication that the parties have the right to call \n     witnesses. For example, in the trial of Andrew Johnson, \n     witnesses for the President were called and heard over a \n     period of one week. In the trial of Alcee Hastings, both \n     sides were allowed to call a total of 55 witnesses.\n       The foregoing analysis does not conclusively rule out the \n     propriety of proceeding on the Starr Report.\n       The House of Representatives relied upon the Starr Report \n     for the facts even though the practice of the House in prior \n     impeachment hearings has been to take testimony from \n     witnesses. ``Hinds' Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives'' notes that witnesses were called during the \n     House impeachment hearings on Senator Blount and Judge Perry. \n     More recently, during the House deliberations on the \n     impeachments of President Nixon, Judge Claiborne, Judge \n     Hastings and Judge Nixon, numerous witnesses were called to \n     lay a factual basis for the impeachment charges. In the case \n     of Judge Nixon alone, witnesses provided testimony to the \n     House committee for over a month.\n       As a practical matter, it is obvious the House did not take \n     the time to hear witnesses because the House proceedings were \n     structured to finish in the abbreviated time frame between \n     the election of November 3rd and the end of the year. \n     Starting in mid-November and seeking to finish shortly after \n     mid-December, that time frame was even further constricted.\n\n\n            HOW LONG WILL THE SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL TAKE?\n\n       It depends entirely on what the Senate seeks to do and what \n     parameters are established.\n       If the Senate peremptorily chooses to dismiss the House \n     articles without consideration, there is authority that could \n     be accomplished at the outset by a majority vote on a motion \n     to adjourn. Since there is no specific Rule relating to the \n     adjournment of an impeachment trial, the general rules of the \n     Senate would apply. A motion to adjourn the Senate requires \n     only a majority vote and is not subject to debate. The Senate \n     impeachment proceeding could be concluded by adjournment \n     with, in effect, a dismissal which would be the equivalent of \n     a nol pros in a criminal case. That is the equivalent of a \n     judgment of acquittal. The Senate would then resume its \n     normal business.\n       There is historical precedent to concluding the Senate \n     impeachment proceeding by passing a motion to adjourn. In the \n     impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson, the Senate voted on \n     three of the eleven articles of impeachment. After failing to \n     secure a conviction on these three articles, Senator Williams \n     moved that the Senate sitting as a court of implement adjourn \n     sine die. The motion carried and the trial of Andrew Johnson \n     ended prior to a vote on the remaining eight articles.\n       If the Senate chose to accept the facts of the Starr \n     Report, the entire trial could be relatively brief if the \n     President did not put on a factual defense.\n       An adequate Senate trial need not necessarily be long. The \n     key witnesses would be Monica Lewinsky, Betty Currie and \n     Vernon Jordan and possibly Kathleen Willey. There may be a \n     few other peripheral witnesses such as Judge Susan Webber \n     Wright. It is hard to calculate but it will probably be a \n     matter of weeks, not months. That estimate would be expanded \n     if President Clinton testifies and/or if he puts on a factual \n     defense.\n\n\n                       Possibility of conviction\n\n       This matter has had unprecedented and unpredictable turns \n     of events. The President's August 17th short speech was a \n     bomb. The House's release of the President's grand jury \n     deposition reversed the tide. The President's answers to the \n     House questions reversed the reversal.\n       It is entirely conceivable that a Senate trial could defy \n     conventional wisdom and find the two-third votes for \n     conviction if the evidence is properly presented focusing on \n     abuse of power and obstruction of justice instead of lying \n     about sex. While impossible to quantify with precision, it \n     may be that there are now about fifty votes for conviction, \n     perhaps a half dozen open minds and maybe another dozen \n     senators might be persuadable if they think there is \n     insufficient political cover to acquit.\n       Monica Lewinsky has the potential to be a strong witness \n     because her recollection is so extraordinary. She was able to \n     pinpoint with precision the two dates when, as she put it, \n     the President received telephone calls from a congressman \n     with a nickname and a sugar grower in Florida with a name \n     something like ``Fanuli''. It was later confirmed that the \n     President had talked on those two dates to Congressman Sonny \n     Montgomery and a Florida sugar grower named Alfonso Fanjul.\n       Although Betty Currie's testimony was watered down as the \n     investigation proceeded, questioning her from her first \n     statement might provide highly incriminating testimony on the \n     obstruction charge. Vernon Jordan's testimony has substantial \n     potential on the abuse of power issue. Jordan testified he \n     reported to the President ``mission accomplished'' after \n     Monica Lewinsky's perjurious affidavit was obtained and \n     Jordan secured a job for Ms. Lewinsky with Revlon. When her \n     initial interview went badly, Jordan called Ronald Perelman, \n     head of Revlon's holding company, and Ms. Lewinsky was \n     recalled the next day for another interview and given a job \n     on the spot.\n       The case is also reportedly strong on the perjury charge \n     against the President on the incident involving Kathleen \n     Willey. Judge Susan Webber Wright's testimony, in observing \n     the President's attentiveness at this deposition in the \n     Jones' case, could undercut the President's contention that \n     he wasn't paying attention when his lawyer strenuously argued \n     for the President's innocence at his deposition based on the \n     Lewinsky affidavit. At that time, the President \n     conclusively knew it was perjurious.\n\n\n                        concluding observations\n\n       As you know, my own initial preference was for both Houses \n     to abandon impeachment proceedings and to then hold the \n     President accountable through the judicial criminal process \n     once his term was over leaving the Congress free to attend to \n     the nation's other business: social security, health, \n     education, etc.\n       My view on waiting to hold the President accountable after \n     he leaves office was based on the blunt proposition that it \n     was more trouble to get rid of him than to keep him. It may \n     well be that the public opposition to impeachment had the \n     same basis. Once we get to the Senate trial, my view may \n     change if it is no more trouble to get rid of him than to \n     keep him. Perhaps the public will have a similar change of \n     heart.\n       If the House returns Articles of Impeachment, the Senate \n     should proceed with a dignified trial with the calling of \n     witnesses because the seriousness of the issue and the \n     historical impact call for an unhurried, deliberative trial. \n     To the maximum extent possible, we should make the proceeding \n     non-partisan. Concessions to the minority on some procedural \n     matter would be worthwhile. As the majority party in charge, \n     we should take the lead on non-partisanship. We should avoid \n     the House bickering at all reasonable costs.\n       The Senate prides itself on being the world's greatest \n     deliberative body. This trial will be by far the highest \n     visibility for the Senate in its history to date and for the \n     foreseeable future. While the President will be on trial, the \n     Senate will also be on trial.\n\n                               Appendix C\n\n                                                December 29, 1998.\n     To: Senator Trent Lott, Majority Leader.\n     From: Senator Arlen Specter.\n\n       Supplementing my memorandum of December 10 and our \n     telephone conversation of December 22, this memo suggests \n     procedures to deal with the Senate trial in light of the \n     public dissatisfaction with the House proceedings, public \n     impatience with impeachment generally and ways to achieve a \n     judicious, non-partisan Senate trial. Since this memorandum \n     was written while I have been traveling, the rules and case \n     citations could be checked only by long-distance telephone.\n\n\n    can procedures be structured to shorten the length of the trial?\n\n       Yes. While it is impossible to say with certainty the \n     duration of any trial, procedures can be put into place to \n     abbreviate the trial with a reasonable likelihood of reaching \n     a verdict within a few weeks (perhaps even three weeks as \n     earlier predicted by you--Senator Lott) as contrasted with \n     some assessments that the trial would take months or the \n     better part of a year.\n       The Senate already is under pressure and will probably be \n     under greater pressure to finish at an early date which \n     accounts for the call for short-circuiting the trial through \n     a plea-bargained censure. It is obviously in the national \n     interest to end the trial as soon as possible without rushing \n     to judgment and it would doubtless meet with public approval \n     to announce at the outset a plan to accomplish that.\n       Several steps could be taken to abbreviate the trial time:\n       (1) Require submission of pre-trial memoranda by the \n     parties followed by a pre-trial conference with the Chief \n     Justice to establish the parameters of the trial;\n       (2) Organize the House Managers' case, with input from the \n     Senate, to focus on only the key witnesses and indispensable \n     lines of questions; and\n       (3) Establish long trial days and Saturday sessions.\n       Without management and limitations, the lawyers could take \n     a long, indeterminate time. By analogy to Federal court \n     litigation, this trial could be managed by having the parties \n     submit pre-trial memoranda which\n\n[[Page S1542]]\n\n     would identify any pre-trial motions, list prospective \n     witnesses and lines of questions, etc., and approximate the \n     time involved at each stage.\n       The Chief Justice would then meet with the parties and \n     issue a pre-trial order establishing the trial parameters \n     just as the presiding judge does in Federal court trials.\n\n\n                     an activist, bipartisan senate\n\n       In an impeachment trial, Senators function in a very \n     unusual way in that we are both jurors and judges. A majority \n     of Senators may overrule the Chief Justice's rulings. We \n     decide individually for ourselves what is the burden of proof \n     and what evidence on what conduct is sufficient for a guilty \n     verdict.\n       The Senate will be proceeding without precedent on most \n     issues. The Senate has broad latitude as noted by the Supreme \n     Court of the United States in the case of Judge Nixon where \n     the Court held the Senate had authority to establish its \n     procedures under the Impeachment Clause.\n       This case and these times call for a more activist approach \n     by the Senate than prior impeachment trials. While it was not \n     inconvenient or problemsome to allow the House managers to \n     set the pace for the Hastings, Nixon or Claibourne trials, \n     this is obviously a very different matter. The impeachment \n     trials of President Johnson and those which occurred earlier \n     offer little guidance on how the Senate should proceed today.\n       The existing Senate rules on impeachment are a starting \n     point. They can be changed by a majority vote unless there is \n     disagreement in which case proposed changes are debatable and \n     subject to a two-thirds vote.\n       It is only through bipartisanship that the Senate can \n     succeed in having a judicious, non-partisan trial which can \n     gain public acceptance. So, all significant procedures must \n     have the concurrence of most Senators from both parties.\n       In my judgment, it would be appropriate and practical to \n     structure the presentation of the evidence by having a small \n     bipartisan Senate committee work with the House managers and \n     President's lawyers on what the Senate wants presented in a \n     tightly focused case, taking into consideration any \n     differences with the House managers which could then be \n     worked out.\n       Arguments in appellate courts customarily take the form of \n     the appeals judges focusing on the questions they want \n     addressed by counsel as opposed to having the lawyers decide \n     how to use their allotted time. It would be analogous to such \n     appellate proceedings to have the Senate direct, or work out \n     collaboratively with the House the evidence the Senate wants \n     to hear.\n       I suggest that a small committee, perhaps five Senators \n     with three Republicans and two Democrats, work up a trial \n     format and trial brief. It will be helpful for the Senators \n     to have prosecution or criminal defense experience. This \n     Senate committee, or perhaps one Republican and one Democrat, \n     should participate in preparation of the pre-trial memorandum \n     and pre-trial conference.\n\n\n                          Long Trial Sessions\n\n       Substantial evidence could be presented with trial days \n     from 9:30 am to 5 pm or even 9 am to 6 pm with Saturday \n     sessions. The Philadelphia criminal courts had the minimum \n     trial day established from 9:30 am to 5 pm. Senate \n     Impeachment Rule 3 provides for Saturday sessions in \n     impeachment trials.\n       I recommend against the so-called double track with the \n     Senate sitting half days on the trial and half on other \n     Senate business. There is too much legitimate public concern \n     to have the trial proceed expeditiously and end as soon as \n     possible. Even with the trial ending at 5 pm or 6 pm, some \n     Senate business could be conducted in the evenings on \n     confirmations or other business which can be handled by \n     unanimous consent.\n       We might consider canceling our February and March recesses \n     for the trial, which would likely produce significant public \n     approval.\n\n\n                    The Importance of Live Witnesses\n\n       I strongly recommend live witnesses on the key issues \n     although there is no prohibition against use of hearsay such \n     as the Starr Report. Prior impeachment cases establish the \n     precedent for live witnesses and the Senate rules provide \n     procedures for live witnesses. Live witnesses have \n     customarily testified in House impeachment proceedings. In \n     the Senate, for example, live witnesses testified in cases \n     involving President Johnson and in the most recent \n     impeachment case on Judge Alcee Hastings. Senate Rules 6 and \n     17 establish procedures for dealing with witnesses.\n       The dignity, tenor and stature of the Senate Trial call for \n     live witnesses on an impeachment of this magnitude. \n     Everything the Senate does will be subjected to a microscope \n     both contemporaneously and historically. While it is a \n     sweeping generalization, I think it is fair and accurate to \n     say that no trial in history to date has been or will be so \n     closely watched.\n       We have some gauge as to how closely this trial will be \n     scrutinized from the work of the Warren Commission which has \n     been the most closely dissected investigation in history. \n     Notwithstanding constant pressure from Chief Justice Warren, \n     who wanted the inquiry concluded at an early date, the staff \n     lawyers insisted on extended tests and extensive \n     interrogation knowing the record would be closely examined. \n     At that time, we couldn't conceive of the extent of the \n     scrutiny, but we had some inkling of what was coming. At this \n     time, the Senate should be on notice to cross every ``t'' \n     and dot every ``i'' twice.\n       It may be sufficient to use the Starr Report to establish \n     some of the lesser proofs for the record.\n       Without attempting to be dispositive on who are all the key \n     witnesses and what are all the indispensable lines of \n     questioning, a suggested focused strategy would be to call:\n       (1) Monica Lewinsky to testify on the perjury issue by \n     covering the numerous times she and the President were alone \n     (he claimed they were never alone) and the specifics of their \n     conduct on the issue as to whether they had sex.\n       It may be wise to have her testify in a closed session on \n     the details of their sexual relationship. In retrospect, the \n     Judiciary Committee might have been wise to hear some of the \n     testimony by Prof. Hill and Justice Thomas in a closed \n     session. In the confirmation hearing of Justice Breyer, \n     testimony was taken in a closed session on his finances.\n       Even though most, if not all, of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony \n     has already been made public, it would be less offensive to \n     public taste and arguably less prejudicial or more \n     considerate of the President to avoid the spectacle of \n     television on the specifics of their sex. Any objection to \n     the closed or secret hearing could be largely answered by \n     releasing a transcript to the public at the end of each daily \n     session.\n       If the President testifies, consideration should also be \n     given to a closed session on the specifics of their sexual \n     activities. It is arguably, and perhaps realistically, \n     different to have a closed session with the President, but \n     these questions will have to be thrashed out at the time \n     depending on the feel of the case if, as and when they arise.\n       In order to have a closed session, there would have to be a \n     modification of Rule 20 which requires the Senate doors to be \n     open except during deliberation.\n       (2) Vernon Jordan to testify about contacts with the \n     President including his telephone call where he reported \n     ``mission accomplished'' after arranging with another lawyer \n     to get Ms. Lewinsky's perjurious affidavit and getting her a \n     job with Revlon.\n       (3) Betty Currie to testify on the President's efforts to \n     alter and mold her version of what happened. Even though Ms. \n     Currie gave several statements, the essential elements of her \n     testimony could be put on the record at trial by going \n     through her first statement to the FBI.\n       The President's possible testimony is considered later in \n     this memorandum.\n\n\n should the Senate trial be terminated by an arranged disposition for \n                                censure?\n\n       No, for several reasons:\n       (1) The Constitution specifies the two remedies or \n     consequences in cases of impeachment which necessarily \n     excludes censure: ``Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall \n     not extend further than to removal from Office, and \n     disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust \n     or Profit under the United States''--Article 1, Section 3, \n     Clause 7. The language ``shall not extend further'' \n     specifically precludes censure or any other remedy not \n     enumerated in the Constitution.\n       The argument is now being strenuously advanced by many, \n     including some Senators, that the impeachment trial should be \n     ended at an early stage by a motion to adjourn the Senate and \n     then, by pre-arrangement, taking up a Resolution of Censure \n     to be approved by the Senate and House. In my judgment, that \n     would be a perversion of and at variance with the \n     Constitution or, simply stated, unconstitutional.\n       (2) Censure would be meaningless for this President--not \n     worth a ``tinker's dam.''\n       (3) Censure would be a bad precedent which could be used \n     whenever the Congress of one party wanted to express \n     displeasure or embarrass the President of the other party. \n     Simply stated, the Congress is not in the business of \n     censuring the President under our Constitutional separation \n     of powers.\n       (4) Censure would prejudice a possible later criminal \n     prosecution of the President after he leaves office. There \n     will be an inevitable sense that censure will constitute a \n     form of punishment or final judgment, although not \n     technically double jeopardy, which would preclude a later \n     prosecution, as a practical matter.\n       The prospects for censure have been dampened by Vice \n     President Gore's statement that the President would not \n     accept censure conditioned on the President's admitting to \n     lying under oath even if that admission could not to be used \n     against him in any criminal proceeding. Even if the \n     President would admit to lying under oath, he would most \n     certainly object to the procedures necessary to rule out \n     use of that admission in a criminal prosecution.\n       Only a court, not the Senate or Congress, can grant \n     immunity from future criminal prosecution. The Senate can \n     take steps to have immunity granted by the Court. But that \n     action can be taken only after the President or any witness \n     asserts the privilege against self-incrimination under the \n     Fifth Amendment. The Court then grants immunity and the \n     testimony cannot be later used against that person in a \n     criminal prosecution.\n       Since the President has announced his unwillingness to \n     admit to lying under oath, it is fruitless to suggest the \n     Fifth Amendment course.\n\n\n                 president clinton's possible testimony\n\n       For the Senate to have all the facts--or all versions of \n     the facts from which Senator-jurors must determine what the \n     facts are, the\n\n[[Page S1543]]\n\n     Senate should hear from the President. It may be that the \n     President will choose to testify; and as a matter of comity, \n     the Senate should await the President's decision.\n       If the President elects not to testify, the Senate will be \n     faced with a difficult legal question and perhaps an even \n     more difficult political question. On its face, Impeachment \n     Rule 6 gives the Senate the authority to compel the President \n     to testify:\n       ``The Senate shall have the power to compel the attendance \n     of witnesses'' and ``to enforce obedience to its orders, \n     mandates, writs, precepts and judgments.''\n       Notwithstanding that express language, some doubt has \n     arisen as to whether the President is subject to compulsory \n     process (subpoena) because of Rule 8 which provides:\n       ``A writ of summons shall issue to the person impeached \n     reciting said articles and notifying him to appear before the \n     Senate upon a day and at a place to be fixed by the Senate . \n     . . and file his answer to said articles of impeachment. . .\n       ``If the person impeached, after service, shall fail to \n     appear, either in person or by attorney, on the day so fixed \n     therefore as aforesaid, or appearing, shall fail to file his \n     answer to such articles of impeachment, the trial shall \n     proceed, nevertheless, as upon a plea of not guilty.''\n       Some have cited President Johnson's refusal to appear at \n     the Senate trial as authority for the proposition that the \n     President cannot be compelled to attend and testify. That \n     inference is unsound because Rule 8 refers to responding to \n     the summons and filing an answer ``either in person or by \n     attorney.'' So the attorney's action satisfies the rule \n     without the appearance or other action by the President. \n     Accordingly, the impeached party complied with the Senate \n     rules in President Johnson's case which did not raise the \n     issue of the Senate's power to compel the President to \n     testify.\n       There is no precedent for a case where the impeached \n     official declined to testify and the Senate attempted to \n     compel his testimony. The other impeachment cases offer no \n     close analogy where, as here, critical facts are known to \n     only two people, one of whom is the impeached official.\n       Analogies from other, although dissimilar, trials suggest \n     the President would be subject to being subpoenaed. The \n     Supreme Court of the United States held President Nixon was \n     subject to compulsory process to turn over the famous tapes \n     under the established principle: ``That the public . . . has \n     a right to every man's evidence.''\n       President Nixon's case, although not dealing with \n     impeachment, is further instructive in the Supreme Court's \n     sweeping language on the need for all the facts:\n       ``The need to develop all relevant facts in the adversary \n     system is both fundamental and comprehensive. The ends of \n     criminal justice would be defeated if judgments were to be \n     founded on a partial or speculative presentation of the \n     facts. The very integrity of the judicial system and public \n     confidence in the system depend on full disclosure of all the \n     facts, within the framework of the rules of evidence. To \n     ensure that justice is done, it is imperative to the function \n     of the courts that compulsory process be available for the \n     production of evidence needed either by the prosecutions or \n     the defense.''\n       Since this is not a criminal trial, there would be no rule \n     that a defendant has the right not to testify. Although not a \n     controlling analogy, a party in a civil case may be called \n     involuntarily to the witness stand by his/her opponent ``as \n     on cross'' which means he/she may be cross-examined.\n       In my legal judgment, President Clinton could be compelled \n     to testify based on Senate Rule 6, analogies to compulsory \n     process in President Nixon's case and civil litigation and \n     the fact that President Clinton was subject to compulsory \n     process in the Paula Jones case and Starr grand jury. \n     Consideration of enforcing such a subpoena can be left to a \n     later day if, as and when the issue arises.\n       If the President did testify, it could have a profound \n     effect on the public's view of the case and on the Senator-\n     jurors. The President's lawyers could not shield him from \n     cross-examination and he could not avoid the specifics on his \n     contacts with Ms. Lewinsky as he did in his abbreviated grand \n     jury testimony.\n       If the President sticks to his story that he did not have \n     sex with Ms. Lewinsky and did not lie under oath at his \n     deposition in the Paula Jones case, his credibility could be \n     severely impugned by pointed cross-examination and he could \n     be viewed very negatively by the public and the Senator-\n     jurors. Or, it may be that the public and many Senator-jurors \n     would not be any more adversely affected by his Senate trial \n     testimony than they were by the videotapes of his grand jury \n     testimony.\n       At this moment, it is impossible to judge what the feel or \n     tenor of the trial would be on subpoenaing the President if, \n     as and when he declined to testify after serious \n     incriminating evidence was presented against him. If subpoena \n     sentiments formed along party lines, it would be the most \n     severe test of acting only with a bipartisan consensus.\n       Over several centuries, litigation experience has \n     demonstrated the unpredictability of trials. That is why they \n     are called trials. A two-thirds majority may not appear out \n     of thin air, as noted by Congressman DeLay, but it could \n     appear from forceful presentation of the key evidence \n     including cross-examination of the President. If the trial \n     turned heavily against the President, it is conceivable, \n     although highly unlikely at this point, that a plea bargain \n     could be structured with the Independent Counsel's \n     concurrence that the President would resign with his pension, \n     his law license and immunity from prosecution.\n       Once a trial starts, the genie is out of the bottle and \n     anything can happen. Emotions in all directions are at an \n     all-time high with Republicans, the President, Democrats or \n     anybody else in the line of fire at risk for the ultimate \n     public scorn. An the public's other business would not be \n     attended to forever how long the trial took.\n       That is why I continue personally to favor putting off \n     holding the President accountable until after his term ends \n     through the criminal process. That accommodates the public's \n     short-term desires for the Congress, the President and the \n     Supreme Court to focus on the nation's business and the long-\n     term national interest to later hold the President \n     accountable for the serious charges through indictment if the \n     grand jury so decides, and to sentencing by a judge if a jury \n     convicts.\n\n\n                          The Public Reaction\n\n       Prospects are reasonably good that the public would not \n     react unfavorably to a non-partisan, judicious, focused, \n     relatively brief Senate trial. In addition, the public would \n     likely understand the Senate has an explicit Constitutional \n     duty to hold a trial after Articles of Impeachment are passed \n     by the House. There has already been a bipartisan recognition \n     of this duty by Senators who are Democrats.\n       Public reaction, as gauged by the polls, was adverse to the \n     House proceedings, at least in part, because of their highly \n     partisan, strident tenor; and because the House never zeroed \n     in or highlighted the highly incriminating evidence. There \n     may even be some grudging public approval that Congress is \n     willing to take action on a significant matter contrary to \n     the polls.\n       A favorable public reaction will depend largely if not \n     exclusively on the public's feeling that the proceedings are \n     bipartisan, so the Senate must take extreme care to make the \n     trial bipartisan. As the majority party, we Republicans \n     should bend over backwards to avoid even the appearance of \n     seeking partisan advantage which marred the House \n     proceedings.\n       I strongly support the suggestion that there should be no \n     separate party caucuses on impeachment issues. It would be \n     useful to convene all Senators at an early date, such as \n     January 8, 1999, when we will all be in town, to discuss \n     ideas on how to proceed. I recollect one such meeting of all \n     Senators from both parties a couple of years ago on \n     appropriations or budget issues near the end of the session.\n\n\n                               Concluson\n\n       History will cast a long shadow on what the Senate does in \n     this impeachment proceeding.\n       The Senate should not, in effect, sweep the matter under \n     the rug by relying on the hearsay Starr Report for the key \n     facts. Some say the Starr Report is a sufficient factual \n     basis for Senate action because the facts are not in dispute. \n     That is not true. A close reading of the President's grand \n     jury testimony and his famous 82 answers to interrogatories \n     demonstrate that he has not conceded the accuracy of the key \n     incriminating evidence.\n       As detailed above, the Senate can leave it to the criminal \n     courts to put the facts on the historical record and have the \n     indicting grand jury, trial jury and presiding judge hold the \n     President accountable to whatever extent warranted after his \n     term ends.\n       A rush-to-judgment censure plea bargain would complete the \n     trifecta of inappropriate action by the Senate as well as the \n     House and President.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chief Justice, colleagues, first a personal note to \nour leaders: How proud I am of them, and we all are of you, for holding \nus together during this very, very difficult time. We will all be \ncloser for having come through this, regardless of what this vote is or \nhow we individually vote.\n  The burden of proof on the House that the President has committed \nhigh crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from office is a \nheavy burden, because the effect is so dire in a democracy that depends \nupon the election of the President. In my judgment, the House of \nRepresentatives has not carried that burden of proof as to the specific \nallegations against the President. The House repeatedly relies on \ninferences while ignoring direct testimony to the contrary. There is \nnothing unusual about the reliance on inferences. It happens in trials \nall the time. What is unusual here is that the House's case relies on \ninferences from the testimony of people whose direct testimony \ncontradicts the inference. Let me just cite some examples in the \nobstruction of justice article.\n  First, the House managers in their report, in their brief, made the \nfollowing statements: ``As evidenced by the testimony of Monica \nLewinsky, the President encouraged her to lie.'' That is the words of \nthe House brief. Second, ``The testimony of Monica Lewinsky\n\n[[Page S1544]]\n\nleads to the conclusion that it was the President who initiated the \nretrieval of the gifts and the concealment of the evidence.'' Third, \n``The President needed the signature of Monica Lewinsky on the false \naffidavit and that was assured by the efforts to secure her a job.''\n  Those are all direct quotes. Each one of those relies on inferences. \nEach one of them is contradicted by the explicit testimony of people \nfrom whom those inferences are drawn.\n  Let's just take them one by one. The House managers' inference that \nthe President ``encouraged''--that is their word--Monica Lewinsky to \nlie was contradicted by Monica Lewinsky's proffer, which was then \nincorporated into her grand jury testimony, that the President \n``never'' encouraged her to lie. That is her word. They say by \ninference the President encouraged her to lie. She says, ``The \nPresident never encouraged me to lie.''\n  The House managers' inference that it was, ``President Clinton who \ninitiated the retrieval of the gifts and the concealment of the \nevidence on December the 28th,'' was contradicted by Monica Lewinsky's \ndirect testimony that she initiated the concealment of the gifts. It is \nuncontested that on December 22 she took some of the gifts and \nconcealed the rest--some of the gifts to her lawyer's office. She \ndecided on her own that she would not turn over the gifts in response \nto that subpoena because they would embarrass her, or they would, in \nher words, disclose that there was a special relationship. So on the \n22nd she decided on her own to withhold some of the gifts. And yet we \nare told by the managers by inference that somehow or other it is the \nPresident who initiated the withholding and the concealment of the \ngifts.\n  And then on the 28th, when they met at the White House, it was Monica \nLewinsky who said, ``Maybe I should get some of the gifts to Betty.'' \nShe initiated the issue. And then the President said either nothing or, \n``Let me think about it.'' And then the question came up: Well, who \nthen made the phone call relative to the pickup of the gifts? Was it \nMonica Lewinsky calling Betty Currie or was it Betty Currie calling \nMonica Lewinsky?\n  And here is where another inference is drawn, that if in fact it was \nBetty Currie who initiated the call, then the inference is that the \nPresident told Betty Currie to call Monica Lewinsky. There is a \nconflict there between Betty Currie and Monica Lewinsky.\n  But one of the most intriguing issues in this whole matter, one that \nI have really given a lot of thought to, is the question: Why would the \nPresident give Monica Lewinsky gifts on December 28 if he was concerned \nabout it and wanted to withhold and hide the gifts? It is one of the \nquestions that didn't get a lot of focus up here, by the way.\n  The President gave Monica Lewinsky at least three things that day: \nThat bear carving that Dale Bumpers referred to that came from \nVancouver, a small blanket, and a stuffed animal.\n  Now, here is the way the House addressed that issue. They asked \nthemselves in their brief the question: Why would the President give \nMs. Lewinsky gifts at the same time he was asking her to conceal others \nthat he had already given her? Answer from the House in their brief: \nThe only logical inference--only logical inference--is that the gifts, \nincluding the bear, symbolizing strength, were a tacit reminder to Ms. \nLewinsky that they would deny the relationship even in the face of a \nFederal subpoena. That is the inference that they say is the only \nlogical inference from giving three gifts to Monica Lewinsky, including \na bear.\n  Now, there is a real problem with that. First of all, that bear was \nobtained by the President in Vancouver weeks before there was a witness \nlist. We are not even offered speculation as to how the President could \nforesee that Monica Lewinsky would be on a witness list and pick up a \nsymbol of strength while in Vancouver so that he could give it to her \nas a reminder to deny their relationship in the face of some future, \nunforeseen Federal subpoena.\n  But even more to the point, Monica Lewinsky was asked directly at the \ngrand jury--directly--this question as to whether or not she \ninterpreted the gift of that bear as a signal to her to ``be strong in \nyour decision to conceal the relationship.'' Her direct, one-word \nanswer was ``No.'' And yet the managers come here saying the only \nlogical inference that can be drawn from three gifts being given from \nthe President on the 28th is that the President was signaling to her to \nbe strong in the face of a Federal subpoena. That is the kind of \ninference we are asked to draw.\n  Now, I was raised on the burden of proof, both as a prosecutor in \ncivil rights cases and as a defense lawyer. The House cannot carry the \nburden of proof on the critical allegations of criminal misconduct that \nthey have made when they depend on those kinds of inferences, a pile of \ninferences that run directly contrary to direct testimony on critical \npoints. Impeachment and removal should be based on sturdier foundations \nthan that kind of a heap of inferences. They would have us overlook the \nforest of direct testimony while getting lost in the trees of their \nmultiple inferences.\n\n  The December 11 issue has been discussed here. It was extraordinary \nto me, listening here as both factfinder and judge, that it could be \nrepresented to us that on December 11 the first activity calculated to \nactually help Monica Lewinsky get a job occurred. That is what they \nalleged on the floor of the Senate. The first activity--these are their \nwords--calculated to help Ms. Lewinsky actually get a job took place on \nDecember 11, and that something happened on that day to trigger Vernon \nJordan's meeting and real activity. Something happened that day. What \nwas it? Judge Wright's order.\n  In their House brief, it is said that that order came in the morning, \nwhich was wrong, and in the presentation here in the opening arguments \nManager Hutchinson said the following: ``The witness list came in, the \njudge's order came in. That triggered the President to action. And the \nPresident triggered Vernon Jordan into action. That chain reaction here \nis what moved the job search along.''\n  Wrong. It disintegrated here. Vernon Jordan's meeting was before the \njudge's order. And yet that is what we are asked to base the removal of \na President on. And then the thinking shifts to another theory. Removal \nof an elected President from office has got to be made of sturdier \nstuff than those kinds of inferences.\n  Finally, on the double standard issue--and I think we all must be \nconcerned about that--a former prosecutor who appeared in front of the \nHouse said the following. And Senator Sarbanes quoted one line of this, \nand I want to repeat that, because it is so important, and then add one \nother thing that they said. ``In conversations with many current and \nformer Federal prosecutors in whose judgment I have great faith, \nvirtually all concur that if the President were not involved, if an \nordinary citizen were the subject of the inquiry, no serious \nconsideration would be given to a criminal prosecution arising from \nalleged misconduct in discovery in the Jones civil case having to do \nwith an alleged coverup of a private sexual affair with another woman \nor the follow-on testimony before the grand jury. I believe the \nPresident should be treated in the criminal justice system in the same \nway as any other United States citizen.\n  ``If that were the case here,'' these former prosecutors said, ``it \nis my view that the alleged obstruction of justice and perjury would \nnot be prosecuted by a responsible U.S. attorney.''\n  I know this is not a criminal case, this is an impeachment trial, but \nI would think that our standards should be at least as high as would be \nin a criminal case, and that if this President would not be prosecuted, \nmuch less convicted for these specific charges--and these were criminal \ncharges that were very specifically made by the managers against the \nPresident--if that prosecution and conviction would not take place in a \ncriminal case, we should be loathe, I believe, and very, very cautious \nand careful before we remove an elected President from office.\n  I learned about the burden of proof and presumption of innocence as a \nyoung boy, long before law school, when my father, who was a lawyer, \ntaught me that American justice is dependent on these principles. As I \ngrew up and became a lawyer myself, I experienced firsthand the \nsignificance of these bedrock principles and learned that it applies to \nall Americans accused of crimes, including the President. These \nprinciples of the burden of\n\n[[Page S1545]]\n\nproof and the presumption of innocence help guide me now as we exercise \nour constitutional duty to judge the specific accusations of criminal \nbehavior lodged against the President of the United States.\n  The burden of proof on the House of Representatives that the \nPresident has committed serious crimes and should be removed from \noffice is a heavy one, because overturning an election in a democracy \nis a drastic and dire action. The House has not carried that burden of \nproof as to the specific accusations against the President.\n  The arguments of the House Managers in support of the Articles suffer \nfrom fundamental weaknesses. They repeatedly rely on inferences while \nignoring direct testimony to the contrary; they omit key materials \nwhich contradict their charges; and they contain serious misstatements \nof key facts. In a matter of such consequence as the removal of an \nelected President from office, such a case should not lead to \nconviction.\n  Let me cite some key examples from Article II, the allegation of \nobstruction of justice. First, the House Managers in their report, \nbrief, and arguments to the Senate repeatedly rely on inferences to \nprove key points and ignore direct testimony to the contrary. In \nopening arguments, House Manager Hutchinson made the following claims:\n\n       As evidenced by the testimony of Monica Lewinsky, [the \n     President] encouraged her to lie.\n       . . . (T)he testimony of Monica Lewinsky . . . leads to the \n     conclusion that it was the President who initiated the \n     retrieval of the gifts and the concealment of the evidence.\n\n       . . .The President needed the signature of Monica Lewinsky \n     on the false affidavit, and that was assured by the efforts \n     to secure her a job.\n  Mr. Hutchinson's arguments rely on inferences. Relying on inferences \nis not unique to proving a case. What is unique is that in this case, \nthe House Managers use inferences primarily from bits and pieces of \ntestimony of people who explicitly deny those inferences in their \ndirect testimony. The House Managers' inference that the President \nencouraged Monica Lewinsky to lie was contradicted by Monica Lewinsky's \ndirect testimony that the President never ``encouraged'' her to lie.\n  The House Managers' inference that ``it was President Clinton who \ninitiated the retrieval of the gifts and the concealment of the \nevidence on December 28, 1997,'' was contradicted by Monica Lewinsky's \ndirect testimony that she initiated the concealment of gifts. Not only \nis it an uncontested fact based on direct testimony that it was Monica \nLewinsky who on December 22, 1997, following the receipt of a subpoena \nfor gifts and having decided on her own to withhold gifts which would \n``give away any kind of special relationship,'' brought to her attorney \nonly those gifts that were ``innocuous'' and typical of the kind of \ngifts an intern might receive. It is also an uncontested fact based on \ndirect testimony that it was Monica Lewinsky who, on December 28, 1997, \nexpressed her interest in wanting to hide the gifts when she said to \nthe President that maybe she should transfer the gifts to Betty Currie. \nMs. Lewinsky testified that the President either didn't respond to her \ncomment or said he'd think about it.\n\n  But what makes the Managers' inference even more speculative is the \nfact that at the December 28th visit, the President gave Ms. Lewinsky \neven more gifts, including a bear carving from Vancouver, a small \nblanket and a stuffed animal. Why would the President give Ms. Lewinsky \ngifts at the same time he is asking her to conceal others he had \nalready given her? I was struck by the House's answer. ``The only \nlogical inference,'' according to the House Managers, ``is that the \ngifts--including the bear symbolizing strength--were a tacit reminder \nto Ms. Lewinsky that they would deny the relationship--even in the face \nof a federal subpoena.''\n  That inference, called ``the only logical inference,'' is not only \nthe rankest form of speculation, it is also contrary to the direct \nevidence.\n  The undisputed grand jury testimony was that the bear carving was \nbrought back by the President from Vancouver, a trip which occurred \nweeks before Monica Lewinsky's name appeared on any witness list. We're \nnot even offered speculation as to how the President could foresee that \nMonica Lewinsky would be on a witness list, and pick up a symbol of \nstrength while in Vancouver so that he could give it to her as a \nreminder to deny their relationship in the face of some future, \nunforseen federal subpoena. But even more to the point, when Ms. \nLewinsky was asked the direct question at the grand jury whether she \ninterpreted the gift of the Vancouver bear carving as a signal to her \nto ``be strong in your decision to continue to conceal the \nrelationship,'' her direct, one-word answer was ``no.''\n  The Managers' reliance on inferences from testimony of persons whose \ndirect testimony contradicts the inferences was a recurring pattern \nduring this trial. The Managers alleged that the signing of the \naffidavit and the obtaining of the job for Ms. Lewinsky were linked, \nbased on inference from bits and pieces of testimony of Monica Lewinsky \nand Vernon Jordan. But Vernon Jordan and Monica Lewinsky explicitly \ndenied any such linkage. Ms. Lewinsky said, ``There was no agreement \nwith the President, Jordan, or anyone else that [I] had to sign the \nJones affidavit before getting a job in New York.'' Mr. Jordan told the \ngrand jury in answer to the question whether the job search and \naffidavit signing were linked, ``unequivocally, indubitably, no.''\n  Impeachment and removal should be based on sturdier foundations than \nthe heap of inferences that have been placed before us, when those \ninferences are pieced together from bits of testimony of witnesses \nwhose direct, explicit testimony contradicts the inferences. The House \nManagers would have us overlook the forest of direct testimony while \ngetting lost in the trees of their multiple inferences.\n\n  The House Managers' case also omitted directly relevant, \ncontradictory material and misstated key facts. For instance, the House \nManagers argued in their brief that relative to the job search \nassistance for Ms. Lewinsky, ``nothing happened in November of 1997.'' \nBut, in fact, our Ambassador to the United Nations, at the request of \nthe Deputy Chief of Staff of the White House, offered Ms. Lewinsky a \nU.N. job on November 3rd.\n  The House Managers' report explicitly represented that ``(t)he first \nactivity calculated to help Ms. Lewinsky actually get a job took place \non December 11,'' and that ``(s)omething happened that changed the \npriority assigned to the job search.'' What happened, the Managers \nargued, was a court order ``on the morning of December 11'' by Judge \nWright requiring President Clinton to provide information about prior \nrelationships involving state and federal employees. The Senate was \ntold by the House Managers that ``(s)uddenly, Mr. Jordan and President \nClinton were now very interested in helping Ms. Lewinsky find a good \njob in New York'' and that Vernon Jordan got active on the afternoon of \nDecember 11 when he and Ms. Lewinsky met.\n  Manager Hutchinson said in his argument to the Senate:\n\n       The witness list came in. The judge's order came in. That \n     triggered the President to action. And the President \n     triggered Vernon Jordan into action. That chain reaction here \n     is what moved the job search along.\n\n  But that key argument disintegrated before our eyes when it turned \nout that Judge Wright's December 11 order came late in the day, well \nafter the meeting between Vernon Jordan and Monica Lewinsky, and in \naddition, the meeting had been scheduled many days before.\n  With respect to the perjury article, the House Managers failed to \nmeet their burden as well. The President admitted to the grand jury \nthat he did have ``inappropriate intimate contact'' with Monica \nLewinsky when he was alone with her, and the House Managers failed to \nidentify specific statements that would meet the requirements of a \nperjury charge.\n  The lack of substantive evidence supporting the charges explains why \na panel of five highly regarded former Democratic and Republican \nfederal prosecutors, who appeared before the House Judiciary Committee, \ntestified that this case against the President would not have been \npursued by a responsible federal prosecutor. Thomas Sullivan, who \nserved for four years as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of \nIllinois, and whom Chairman Hyde described as having ``extraordinarily \nhigh'' qualifications had this to say:\n\n\n[[Page S1546]]\n\n\n       . . . (I)n conversations with many current and former \n     Federal prosecutors in whose judgment I have great faith, \n     virtually all concur that if the President were not \n     involved--if an ordinary citizen were the subject of the \n     inquiry--no serious consideration would be given to a \n     criminal prosecution arising from alleged misconduct in \n     discovery in the Jones civil case, having to do with an \n     alleged coverup of a private sexual affair with another woman \n     or the follow-on testimony before the grand jury . . . I \n     believe the President should be treated in the criminal \n     justice system in the same way as any other United States \n     citizen. If that were the case here, it is my view that the \n     alleged obstruction of justice and perjury would not be \n     prosecuted by a responsible United States Attorney.\n\n  Finally, I have had a deep concern about the impeachment process \nwhich formed the basis of this trial. While my decision to reject the \narticles is based on the inadequate proof of the crimes alleged, the \nprocess which brought this matter to trial was deeply flawed.\n  The articles of impeachment before us are based on materials, the so-\ncalled Starr Report, compiled by an outside prosecutor, not by the \nlegislative branch itself, which has under the Constitution the \n``sole'' responsibility for impeachment. Instead of doing an \nindependent investigation, the House of Representatives unwisely \ndelegated, in my judgment, the critically important investigative \nfunction to an outside prosecutorial foe of the President and an actual \nadvocate of his impeachment. The House took that prosecutor's record \nand his testimony and made them the basis of articles of impeachment \npresented to us.\n  The contrast to the Watergate investigation and the impeachment of \nPresident Nixon is stark. In the Watergate investigation, the Senate \nconvened a select committee in February 1973 to investigate the \nWatergate break-in and other campaign irregularities in the 1972 \nelection. That committee took testimony for a year. In February 1974, \nthe House voted to direct the House Judiciary Committee to conduct an \ninquiry into impeachment. The Committee conducted its own \ninvestigation, including subpoenaing the White House tapes and calling \nnumerous fact witnesses. The Committee also obtained the report of the \ngrand jury meeting under the authority of Leon Jaworski, the Watergate \nprosecutor. In deciding to allow the grand jury report to be forwarded \nto the House Judiciary Committee, Judge Sirica found that the report:\n       `` draws no accusatory conclusions. . . contains no \n     recommendations, advice or statements that infringe on the \n     prerogatives of other branches of government. . . . (and) \n     renders no moral or social judgments. The Report is a simple \n     and straightforward compilation of information gathered by \n     the Grand Jury, and no more. . . .'' (In re Report and \n     Recommendation of June 5, 1972, Grand Jury Concerning \n     Transmission of Evidence to the House of Representatives, \n     U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, March 18, 1974.)\n\n  The report sent to the House of Representatives in the matter before \nus violated almost every standard followed by Judge Sirica. The Starr \nReport didn't present the evidence in an impartial manner as \ncontemplated in the independent counsel law. It drew a host of \n``accusatory conclusions'' and rendered judgments. The report contained \na large volume of needlessly salacious detail and omitted or dismissed \nimportant exculpatory evidence. The impeachment process has suffered as \na result.\n  Moreover, the House made a significant and irreparable mistake in the \nactual drafting of the articles. Each article alleges multiple acts of \nwrongdoing. Thus, it would be impossible to determine after a vote on \nthe articles whether a 2/3rds majority of the Senate actually agreed on \na particular allegation. Article I, for example, charges that President \nClinton committed one or more of the 4 possible acts of perjury; \nArticle II charges that President Clinton committed one or more of 7 \npossible acts of obstruction. Without separate votes on each of the \nalleged acts, it would be impossible to determine whether 2/3rds of the \nSenate agreed that the President had committed any of the actions \nalleged. Since the Constitution requires conviction upon a vote of 2/\n3rds of the Senate, the articles as drafted do not allow us to \nguarantee to the American people that we are complying with the \nrequirements of the U.S. Constitution. This is a flaw that cannot be \nfixed, because the Senate does not have authority to amend the \narticles.\n  Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers asked this question, \n``Where else than in the Senate could have been found a tribunal . . . \n[which] . . . would be likely to feel confidence enough in its own \nsituation to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary \nimpartiality between an individual accused and . . . his accusers ?''\n  Each of us, however we vote, will soon answer that question, as we \nstand between the accuser and the accused, weighing the evidence. The \nissue before us is not whether the President's conduct was \nreprehensible; that is clear beyond any reasonable doubt. The issue is \nwhether the President committed the alleged crimes for which he should \nbe removed from office, a proposition which places on his accusers a \nheavy burden of proof. It is a burden the House Managers have not met, \nand I will, therefore, vote against the articles of impeachment.\n  I would like to add my thoughts on censure as well, since this may be \nthe only appropriate opportunity to do so. I support the censure \nresolution authored by Senator Feinstein, and I commend her for her \nopenness, diligence and hard work in bringing to fruitition a \nbipartisan product. The President should know, the American people \nshould know, and history should know that by voting to acquit on \nimpeachment, we did not vote to acquit the President for his egregious \nconduct. I know of no Senator who is not deeply troubled by the \nPresident's conduct. While I do not believe the President's conduct in \nhis private, consensual sexual relationship should have become the \nbusiness of the American public, it did in fact become so, and when it \ndid the President had the duty to tell the truth. And no matter how \nwrong or improper that disclosure of the President's private life was, \nit does not justify the lies the President told to the American people, \nhis family and his staff.\n  I hope that our votes today on impeachment will conclude this \nunfortunate chapter in our political history and that the President, \nthrough a forthright acknowledgment of the wrongfulness of his \nbehavior, will lead the nation toward healing the wounds these events \nhave opened. I believe the American people want an end to this matter \nmore than anything, and that any further criminal investigation of the \nPresident with respect to the matters under Mr. Starr's jurisdiction \nshould be immediately concluded. While Senator Feinstein's censure \nresolution states that President Clinton remains subject to criminal \nindictment, that is in the resolution as a statement of fact and not as \na statement of encouragement. Indictment after this impeachment trial \nwould not be appropriate nor would it be in the public interest. \nToday's votes should bring this tragic episode to an end.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, now that we have come to the end of the \nprocess required by the Constitution, I feel we have arrived at an \nappropriate time to consider a measure required by the President's \nconduct.\n  I rise in support of censure because while I do not find that the \nPresident's behavior constitutes high crimes and misdemeanors requiring \nremoval, I do believe that it compels us to record for history our \nrecognition of the damage we all acknowledge he has inflicted upon the \nOffice of the Presidency and the Nation.\n  Acquittal must not be the last word. And while I have felt that it \nwould have been more appropriate for the Senate to issue findings of \nfact in the impeachment case against the President, I am now prepared \nto support censure so that there is no mixed message for posterity \nabout what the Senate thinks of the President's actions.\n  As I said yesterday, the President's behavior is indefensible, and I \nfor one have no interest in seeing another shameless ``Rose Garden \nJubilee'' after today's vote by the Court of Impeachment. Acquittal is \nnot exoneration. Nothing we do here today in any way absolves the \nPresident's responsibility for the harm he has inflicted--and the \nPresident must know this.\n  Indeed, this has been a sordid chapter in the history of the \nPresidency, and it deserves to be closed with a stern warning and a \nstrongly worded rebuke that will leave no doubt to future generations \nthat this process was not simply much ado about nothing. It was, in\n\n[[Page S1547]]\n\nfact, about something very important--the sanctity of public service.\n  That's why I worked with Senators Feinstein and Bennett to include \nlanguage expressing the will of this Senate that this resolution not be \nrevoked by a future Congress. I also want to thank them for their \nwillingness to include language that makes clear the Senate believes \nthe President should be treated like any other citizen facing criminal \nallegations once he leaves office in 23 months.\n  The fact is, even while this body has acquitted the President on \nArticles of Impeachment, the framers provided for an additional remedy \nfor his conduct in standard criminal court. Why? Because they had known \na country where some men were above the law, and some below. And they \nwere determined to create a nation where the level of justice served \nwas not proportional to a person's pocketbook, social rank or political \npower.\n  I believe acquittal, though the proper outcome, by itself could \npresent a skewed picture of the Senate's findings, and runs the risk \nthat the President will claim exoneration for his actions. Such a \nclaim, evidence of which is already apparent, is quite simply and \nobviously, wrong.\n  The President may not have committed high crimes and misdemeanors, \nbut what he has done--in my mind including unlawfully influencing a \npotential witness--deserves a formal rebuke by the Senate. Censure \nwould be an appropriate and constitutionally permissible way to do \nthis.\n  For a President who from the very beginning promised the most ethical \nadministration any of us would ever see, censure would be a well-\ndeserved legacy of a promise broken and a Presidency sullied. I will \nvote for this censure motion and I urge my colleagues to do likewise.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. Chief Justice, throughout this process my colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle have conducted themselves with decency and \ndignity, exactly the qualities President Clinton's conduct lacked. But \nwe risk opening the floodgates to more party-line impeachments if we \noust a President from office for behavior that--while truly \ndeplorable--isn't truly removable. Lowering the standard would do as \ngreat a disservice to the Constitution as the President's behavior has \ndone to the Oval Office. So I am voting to acquit on both articles.\n  I state these conclusions with a certainty I do not feel. We have \nheard many say these votes are the most difficult they will ever cast, \nand I agree. This case is made up of many small questions, matters of \nopinion and fact: Did the President lie? Did he commit perjury? Did he \nobstruct justice? Did he weaken the judicial system? Did he undermine \nthe Constitution? Are these ``high'' crimes? Is this what the Founders \nenvisioned when they talked about removal of a President?\n  Most of us have answers for each of these questions. Most of us will \nlay them out in well-worded, well-argued statements. But the sum of the \nanswers is not the sum of this case. The sum of our opinions, our \nfindings of fact, and our legal briefs cannot sum up the deep disquiet \nI feel about the failings, lies, and weakness displayed by the \nPresident. Under the cold body of evidence before us runs the bad blood \nof bad character, and that deeply disturbs me.\n  The evidence does not prove high crimes, but it does prove low \ncharacter in our highest office--and that matters, it is relevant, it \nis material. This nation is not defined merely by demographics, \nboundaries, geological features, and government regulations; it is also \nabout families and individuals who struggle to be larger, braver, and \nstronger than their circumstances. It is a nation that has a history of \nputting lives, faith, and hope in causes bigger than any one person: \njustice, democracy, freedom. Similarly, the office of the Presidency is \nnot just a set of protocols, formalities, and policies. It is the human \nface we put on our country, and that face ought to be as honest, just, \nstrong and brave as we all aspire to be--and as our history demands \nthat we be.\n  That's why character matters. I cannot find a way to fit my concern \nfor that spirit into these very formal, legal proceedings, but I also \ncannot, in good conscience, let go of my deep concern for the harm and \nthe loss this President has caused. I will not vote for either article \nof impeachment, but I also will not let go of my firm belief that this \nPresident has done real damage to the Office of the Presidency. And I \nwill not let go of a commitment to do everything I can to restore and \nprotect the idea that good character is essential in those who ask to \nserve and represent this country.\n  Let me explain in more detail why I am voting against both articles. \nFirst, removing a President is a drastic measure, called for in only \nthe most extraordinary circumstances. And our Founding Fathers clearly \nwanted it to be used sparingly: that's why they limited impeachment to \nonly ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' involving abuse of power, \nincapacity to hold office, or a serious threat to our Constitution or \nsystem of government.\n  But the President's conduct, however reprehensible, related to purely \npersonal matters. He lied to the American people. He lied to his \nfamily, his friends and his staff. He lied under oath and evidence \nsuggests that he may have obstructed justice. Simply put, his conduct \nwas disgraceful and, possibly, illegal.\n  However, his actions did not relate to abuse of power. They had \nnothing to do with his official acts or his capacity to hold office. \nThey did not threaten our Constitution or system of government. Though \nserious offenses to our American values and decency, they do not rise \nto the level of constitutional ``high\" crimes.\n  Some of my colleagues have a different view, and I respect their \nposition. But even the House prosecutors respect mine. In response to \none of my questions, House Manager Graham acknowledged that \n``reasonable people can disagree'' about whether the President should \nbe removed. In fact, he went on to say:\n  ``[I]f I was sitting where you're at, I would probably get down on my \nknees before I made that decision, because the impact on society is \ngoing to be real either way. And if you find the President guilty in \nyour mind from the facts, that's he a perjurer and he obstructed \njustice, you've got to somehow reconcile continued service in light of \nthat event. And I think it's important for this body not to have a \ndisposition plan that doesn't take in consideration the good of this \nnation. . . . [Y]ou've got to consider what's best for this nation.''\n  Representative Graham deserves credit for putting candor above \npartisanship, and inviting us to decide ``what's best for this \nnation.'' To do that, it makes sense to consider the views of the \nAmerican people. Most of them know what this case is about and most of \nthem oppose this impeachment. Nothing we've heard clearly justifies \nrejecting the overwhelming weight of their opinion and removing a \ntwice-elected President.\n  Indeed, if ``reasonable people can disagree,'' as the House \nprosecutors concede, have we really met the high threshold established \nfor removal?\n  To ask that question is to answer it.\n  It is true, of course, that we have removed judges for lying under \noath; for example, ten years ago the Senate removed Judge Nixon on that \nbasis. But impeaching the President, our highest elected official, is \nfar different. Judge Nixon was appointed. He held office during ``good \nBehaviour.'' At the time of his Senate trial, he was already convicted \nand sitting in jail. He lied about bribery, not sex. And most \nimportantly, the only way a judge can be removed is by impeachment. A \nPresident, on the other hand, can be removed every four years through \nan election, and is automatically removed after eight years by the 22nd \nAmendment.\n  Second, in addition to the constitutional problems, the prosecution \nhas not proved its allegations by clear and convincing evidence. This \nis especially true on the ``obstruction of justice'' charge, which is \nby far the more serious allegation. The House Managers argue that more \nwitnesses would have made a difference in bolstering their case, and \nthey may be right. But why then did the House choose not to call \nwitnesses in its own proceedings, even though it had called ``fact'' \nwitnesses in nearly every other impeachment?\n  Third, as many of us told the House in the Judge Nixon impeachment \ntrial, lumping together a series of charges in each article--at least \nfour perjury charges and seven obstruction of justice charges here--\nisn't fair or responsible. Alarmingly, the President could be found \nguilty without a two-thirds\n\n[[Page S1548]]\n\nmajority believing any single charge. For example, in theory, even if \neach obstruction charge were rejected by a 90 to 10 margin, the \nPresident could be convicted--because ten different Senators convicting \non each of seven separate charges adds up to 70--more than a two-thirds \nmajority.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, this kind of ``one from column A and two from \ncolumn B'' approach may work for a Chinese restaurant, but not for \nremoving a President--or a judge. And this lack of specificity \nshortchanges the American people, who may never understand which \ncharges were believed and which ones weren't.\n  Still, President Clinton is not ``above the law.'' His conduct should \nnot be excused, nor will it. The President can be criminally \nprosecuted, especially once he leaves office. In other words, his acts \nmay not be ``removable'' wrongs, but they could be ``convictable'' \ncrimes. Moreover, the House vote of impeachment--and the President's \nmisconduct with Monica Lewinsky--will forever scar this President's \nlegacy. Finally, the Senate can and should censure the President, and \nwe ought make our condemnation of his conduct as strong as possible.\n  In sum, Mr. Chief Justice, President Clinton's conduct was wrong, \nreckless and indefensible. Under the Constitution it does not justify \nremoval. But for those who love this country, it demands outrage and \ndisappointment. It demands a commitment from this President and future \nPresidents, this Congress and future Congresses--not now, and not ever \nagain, to let personal weakness and personal failing stain or shake our \ndemocracy. Thank you.\n\n\n                                 facts\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. In 1994, Paula Corbin Jones sued President Clinton for \nsexual harassment which she alleged he committed against her in 1991, \nwhen he was Governor of Arkansas. The Supreme Court of the United \nStates permitted the lawsuit to proceed in 1997.\n  Monica Lewinsky began work as a White House intern on July 10, 1995. \nAt the time, she was twenty-one years old. She later worked in the \nOffice of Legislative Affairs at the White House. In 1996, she left the \nWhite House for a job at the Department of Defense.\n  The first day that Ms. Lewinsky spoke with President Clinton, \nNovember 15, 1995, she and the President engaged in sexual relations. \nTheir sexual relationship lasted until 1997. The two also engaged in \ntelephone sex at least seventeen times, and they exchanged numerous \ngifts. The two agreed to keep their relationship secret through the use \nof cover stories. Ms. Lewinsky, if discovered in the Oval Office, was \nto say that she was delivering papers, although her job duties never \nincluded delivering papers. Once she left the White House, her visits \nto the President were disguised as visits to Presidential secretary \nBetty Currie.\n  The President told Ms. Lewinsky that she could return to the White \nHouse after the 1996 election had concluded. Although Ms. Lewinsky \ntried numerous times to regain employment at the White House, she was \nnever able to do so. After being informed by a friend, Linda Tripp, \nthat she would never be permitted to return to the White House, Ms. \nLewinsky decided to seek employment in New York, initially receiving \nand rejecting a job offer with the United States Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations. She then decided to seek employment in New York in the \nprivate sector. On November 5, 1997, she met with Vernon Jordan, a \nprominent Washington lawyer and friend of President Clinton, to seek \nhis assistance in securing such a position. This meeting was arranged \nby Ms. Currie. Mr. Jordan took no action to help her in November, and \ndoes not remember meeting her at this time.\n  On December 5, 1997, attorneys for Ms. Jones notified the President's \nattorneys of their list of witnesses. That list included Ms. Lewinsky. \nAlthough she was unaware at the time that her name was on the Jones \nlitigation witness list, Lewinsky coincidentally decided to terminate \nher relationship with the President the following day, but was unable \nto see him at the White House. President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky \ninitially exchanged angry words that day over the telephone, but later \nthat day, she came to the White House at his invitation. During this \nmeeting, Ms. Lewinsky told the President that Mr. Jordan had not \nappeared to have done anything to help her in her job search. In a \nconversation Ms. Lewinsky described as ``sweet'' and ``very \naffectionate,'' he told her that he would speak to Mr. Jordan about her \njob situation. The President did not at that time inform Ms. Lewinsky \nthat her name was on the witness list.\n  Ms. Currie again called Mr. Jordan, and on December 8, 1997, Ms. \nLewinsky called to set another appointment with Mr. Jordan for December \n11. Although Ms. Lewinsky provided Mr. Jordan with a list of \ncorporations in which she was interested in obtaining employment, Mr. \nJordan determined based on his own contacts which companies he would \npursue on Ms. Lewinsky's behalf. Following his meeting with Ms. \nLewinsky, acting by his own admission at the behest of the President, \nJordan called three corporate executives in New York. He also called \nthe President to report on his efforts on behalf of Ms. Lewinsky.\n  December 11, 1997 was also the date on which Judge Susan Webber \nWright, the presiding judge in the Jones litigation, issued an order \npermitting Jones' attorneys to pursue discovery concerning the names of \nany state or federal employees with whom the President had had sexual \nrelations, proposed sexual relations, or sought to have sexual \nrelations.\n  On December 17, 1997, between 2:00 and 2:30 a.m., the President \ntelephoned Ms. Lewinsky. He informed her that Ms. Currie's brother had \nbeen killed, as well as that her name was on the Jones witness list. \nThe President indicated that if Ms. Lewinsky were subpoenaed, she \nshould let Ms. Currie know. He also told her that she might be able to \nsign an affidavit in that event to avoid testifying. In addition, he \nsuggested that she could say that she was coming to see Betty or was \nbringing him papers. Ms. Lewinsky says that she understood implicitly \nthat she was to continue to deny their relationship.\n  Ms. Lewinsky was subpoenaed to testify in the Jones litigation on \nDecember 19, 1997. The subpoena also required Ms. Lewinsky to produce \nall gifts that she had received from the President, and enumerated one \nspecific gift that the President had given Ms. Lewinsky, a hatpin. \nBecause Ms. Currie was in mourning, Lewinsky called Jordan, who invited \nher to his office. She was in a highly emotional state, and that fact, \ncombined with her statements in the conversation that demonstrated her \npersonal fascination with the President, prompted Jordan to ask whether \nshe, a person for whom he was providing job assistance, had had sexual \nrelations with the President. He says she denied such relations. Jordan \ntook a telephone call from the President during that meeting, and made \nplans to see him that night. Jordan later called Frank Carter, a \nWashington lawyer, to arrange a meeting at which he would refer Ms. \nLewinsky to Mr. Carter as a client.\n  Notwithstanding Ms. Lewinsky's denial of sexual relations with the \nPresident, Jordan asked President Clinton that same evening the same \nquestion. The President also denied having had sexual relations with \nMs. Lewinsky. Jordan also conveyed a number of Lewinsky's statements to \nthe President, and informed Clinton that Lewinsky had received a \nsubpoena to testify in the Jones case. Following a discussion in which \nLewinsky informed Jordan of the nature of the telephone calls she had \nhad with the President, Jordan drove Lewinsky to a meeting at Mr. \nCarter's office on December 22.\n  The President met with Ms. Lewinsky on December 28, 1997, at which \ntime they again exchanged gifts. They discussed the subpoena, and she \nexpressed concern, which the President shared, about the specific \nenumeration of the hatpin, since that suggested that someone knew \ndetails of their relationship. Ms. Lewinsky then suggested taking the \ngifts out of her apartment or giving them to Ms. Currie. The President \nresponded, ``I don't know'' or ``Let me think about that.'' Later that \nsame day, Ms. Lewinsky's consistent recollection is that Ms. Currie \ncalled her and stated, ``I understand you have something to give me'' \nor ``the President said you have something to give me.'' Ms. Currie \nlater drove to Ms. Lewinsky's apartment, picked up a box containing \ngifts the President had given Ms. Lewinsky, and hid that box under her \nbed without asking any questions.\n\n[[Page S1549]]\n\n  On December 31, 1997, Jordan and Lewinsky had breakfast. Lewinsky, \nfearing that her relationship with the President would become known and \nwanting to ensure that she not appear responsible for its becoming \nknown, told Jordan that she possessed notes she had addressed to the \nPresident that suggested the nature of their relationship. According to \nLewinsky, Jordan told her to dispose of those notes. Jordan initially \ndenied that he ever had breakfast with Lewinsky, but later recalled \nhaving done so when shown the receipt. But he denied ever telling \nLewinsky to destroy any notes.\n\n  Ms. Lewinsky pursued filing an affidavit to obviate the need for her \nto testify in the Jones case. On January 6, 1998, she communicated to \nMr. Jordan concerns she had about the affidavit that Mr. Carter had \ndrafted for her. Jordan telephoned Carter with her suggestions. \nAlthough Mr. Jordan denies the allegations, Ms. Lewinsky contends that \nshe informed Jordan about the details of Carter's proposed affidavit, \nand that she and Jordan made changes to it prior to her signing it. \nLewinsky also spoke with the President about Carter's questions to her \nabout how she obtained her Pentagon job. The President told her that \nshe ``could always say that the people in Legislative Affairs got it \nfor you or helped you get it.''\n  On January 7, 1998, Lewinsky signed an affidavit denying sexual \nrelations with the President. She later testified that the affidavit \nwas false. She showed Jordan the affidavit, and Jordan spoke with the \nPresident after conferring with Ms. Lewinsky about the changes. \nLewinsky testified that she believed that the President would be \nsatisfied with any affidavit that Jordan approved.\n  The following day, Lewinsky was interviewed at a company that Jordan \nhad called on her behalf. Believing that the interview had proceeded \npoorly, she called Jordan, who then called the head of the holding \ncompany of the firm with which she had interviewed. Jordan asked that a \nsecond interview be granted Lewinsky. She interviewed again the next \nday, and was made an informal job offer. Jordan testified that his \n``magic'' was responsible for that offer. Lewinsky informed Jordan of \nher success, and he telephoned Ms. Currie to notify her: ``Mission \naccomplished.'' He later informed the President.\n  The President was scheduled to be deposed in the Jones litigation on \nJanuary 17, 1998. The President knew that one of the issues was his \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky. For the affidavit to successfully \ndeflect questions to the President concerning that relationship, the \naffidavit would have had to have been filed in time for the court to \nconsider it and for the President's lawyers to see it before the \ndeposition. The President's lawyers called Ms. Lewinsky's attorney once \non January 14, twice on January 15, and once on January 16. On the \n15th, Lewinsky's lawyer, Mr. Carter, sent President Clinton's counsel a \ncopy of the affidavit. Mr. Carter also called the court twice on that \nday to ensure that the affidavit could be filed on January 17.\n  During his deposition, President Clinton made numerous false \nstatements while under oath. These included the sexual nature of his \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and whether they had exchanged gifts. \nHe relied on the same cover stories as he had discussed with Ms. \nLewinsky. The President's lawyer used Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit in an \nattempt to deflect questions about the President's relationship with \nher, specifically stating that the President had already seen that \naffidavit. As the President appeared to be paying close attention, he \ndid not contradict his attorney when he represented to the court that \n``there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form \nwith President Clinton. . . .'' And he testified, when asked by his \nattorney, that Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit was absolutely true. However, \nthe judge insisted that President Clinton answer additional questions \nabout his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. These questions were asked \nbased on the judge's peculiar ruling that used only one-third of a \nstandard courtroom definition of ``sexual relations'' and the \nplaintiff's attorneys' insistence in using that truncated definition as \na reference for questions they posed to the President about the nature \nof his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, rather than asking specific \nquestions concerning what had occurred. In six instances, the President \nanswered questions by referencing Betty Currie, such as in using the \ncover story that Ms. Lewinsky had come to the White House to visit Ms. \nCurrie, and on one occasion, expressly stated that his questioners \nshould ``ask Betty.'' Indeed, Ms. Jones' attorneys later placed Ms. \nCurrie's name on their witness list.\n  After the deposition, at 7 p.m. that evening, the President called \nhis secretary, Betty Currie, at home. She later testified that she \ncould not remember the President ever calling her at home so late on a \nSaturday. In that conversation, he asked Ms. Currie to see him in the \nOval Office the following day, a Sunday. This was also an unusual \noccurrence. While in the Oval Office, and contrary to the admonition \nfrom the Jones case judge not to discuss his deposition testimony with \nanyone, the President made the following statements to Ms. Currie: (1) \n``I was never really alone with Monica, right?'' (2) ``You were always \nthere when Monica was there, right?'' (3) ``Monica came on to me, and I \nnever touched her, right?'' (4) ``You could see and hear everything, \nright?'' (5) ``She wanted to have sex with me, and I could not do \nthat.''\n  Once the President met with Ms. Currie on January 18, Ms. Currie \nbegan to seek Ms. Lewinsky. She paged Ms. Lewinsky four times that \nnight. Later than 11:00 p.m. that evening, the President called Ms. \nCurrie at home to determine if she had yet reached Ms. Lewinsky. She \nhad not. In a period of less than two hours on the morning of the 19th, \nMs. Currie paged Ms. Lewinsky an additional eight times. The President \nthen called Mr. Jordan, who called the White House three times, paged \nMs. Lewinsky, and called Mr. Carter, all within twenty-four minutes of \nreceiving the President's call. Mr. Jordan called Mr. Carter again that \nafternoon and learned that Mr. Carter had been replaced as Ms. \nLewinsky's attorney. Mr. Jordan then called the White House six times \nin the next twenty-four minutes trying to relay this information. Mr. \nJordan called Mr. Carter again, and then called the White House again.\n  On January 20, the White House learned that a story about the \nPresident's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky would appear in the next \nday's edition of The Washington Post. On January 21, the President told \nhis chief of staff and two deputies that he did not have sexual \nrelations with Ms. Lewinsky. He later told one of those deputies, John \nPodesta, that he had not had oral sex with Ms. Lewinsky.\n  Later on January 21, the President told his aide, Sidney Blumenthal, \nthat Lewinsky had made a sexual demand on him, and that he rebuffed \nher. The President told Blumenthal that Lewinsky had threatened him. \nPresident Clinton also indicated that Lewinsky said that she was known \namong her peers as the stalker, that she hated it, and that she would \nsay that she had an affair with the President whether it was true or \nnot, so that she would not be known as the stalker any more. He also \ntold Blumenthal that he felt like a victim who could not get out the \ntruth. Blumenthal later testified that he believes the President lied \nto him. The President testified that he was aware at the time that he \nmade his statements that his aides might be summoned before the grand \njury.\n  The President also met with his political consultant, Dick Morris, on \nJanuary 21. The President authorized that Morris conduct an overnight \npoll measuring potential public reaction to the affair. The poll \nconcluded that the American people would forgive the President for \nadultery, but not for perjury or obstruction of justice. The President \nthen indicated that ``we just have to win, then.'' The President's \nlawyers could not answer senators' questions why such a poll had been \nundertaken if the President had not committed any of these acts.\n  Shortly after the President met with Mr. Blumenthal, press reports \nbegan to appear that, quoting White House sources, characterized Ms. \nLewinsky as a stalker, and as an ``untrustworthy climber obsessed with \nthe President.'' Although Mr. Blumenthal in his Senate deposition \ndenied any knowledge of how White House sources were attributed to \nthese stories, one journalist by\n\n[[Page S1550]]\n\nthe time of this writing has sworn to an affidavit stating that Mr. \nBlumenthal made such characterizations to him. A second similar \naffidavit has also been filed, corroborating the first one.\n  Ultimately, Ms. Lewinsky was granted immunity from prosecution by the \nindependent counsel. The independent counsel received from Ms. Lewinsky \na dress that according to DNA testing was stained by the President's \nsemen.\n  On August 17, 1998, the President testified before the grand jury \nconvened by the independent counsel. In a prepared statement, the \nPresident made a number of false statements. He stated that he engaged \nin inappropriate conduct with Ms. Lewinsky in 1996 and 1997, whereas \nthe conduct actually began in 1995, when she was an intern. Based on \nMs. Lewinsky's testimony and the dress, he appears to have testified \nuntruthfully about whether he engaged in sexual relations even as that \nterm had been defined at his deposition in the Jones case. And he also \ntestified that he was not paying attention to his attorney when the \nattorney described the affidavit; that his relationship with Ms. \nLewinsky had originally begun as a ``friendship;'' that he made the \nstatements to Ms. Currie after his deposition in an effort to refresh \nhis recollection; and that he told his aides statements that were true \nabout his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Nonetheless, when testifying \nbefore the grand jury, the President no longer made a number of the \nassertions that he had made in the deposition, including denying that \nhe was ever alone with Ms. Lewinsky. With respect to his deposition \ntestimony, the President told the grand jury that his ``goal in this \ndeposition was to be truthful, but not particularly helpful . . . I was \ndetermined to walk through the mine field of this deposition without \nviolating the law, and I believe I did.''\n  The Independent Counsel filed a report with the House of \nRepresentatives that referred allegations of possible impeachable \noffenses. The House of Representatives voted to pass two articles of \nimpeachment against President Clinton, for perjury before the grand \njury and for obstruction of justice. Two other articles of impeachment, \nwhich had been based on perjury in his deposition in the Jones case and \nmisstatements to the House in response to questions propounded to the \nPresident by the House of Representatives, failed to pass the House.\n\n\n                    ``HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS''\n\n  The most fundamental question, against which the President's actions \nmust be measured, is ``what constitutes an impeachable offense?'' The \nConstitution makes impeachable ``treason, bribery and other high crimes \nor misdemeanors.'' The Constitution also says that upon conviction in \nthe Senate the President ``shall be removed.'' Therefore, the questions \nbecomes, in effect, ``what actions constitute grounds for removal?''\n  It should be noted at the outset that what we have in effect is a \n``mandatory sentence'' wherein if there is a finding of guilt then one \nparticular sentence must be imposed--in this case removal from office. \nHowever, unlike judges in a criminal case, the Senate may take into \nconsideration the ``punishment'' in determining guilt. Some have \ncontended that the President may be guilty of high crimes and \nmisdemeanors, but his actions may not be sufficient for removal. I \nbelieve the better analysis is that the Senate may conclude that the \nPresident's conduct is not sufficient for removal and that that \ndetermination, by definition, means that the President is not guilty of \nhigh crimes and misdemeanors. I believe that this analysis is important \nin understanding the scope of our discretion and helps us get away from \nthe notion that there is an objective standard for high crimes and \nmisdemeanors if we could only find it. Historical analysis covering \nover six hundred years reveals that there is no ``secret list'' of high \ncrimes and misdemeanors, but rather our forefathers perpetuated a \nframework that allows for a certain amount of subjectivity which may \nencompass changing times and differing circumstances.\n  Such a conclusion emerges from an examination of English law, \noriginal state Constitutions, our federal Constitutional Convention, \nthe ratification debates, American impeachment precedents and scholarly \ncommentary.\n  The phrase ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' can be traced back to the \nthirteen hundreds in England. It was clear from the outset that the \nphrase covered serious misconduct in office whether or not the conduct \nconstituted a crime. Commentators say that the English impeachment \ntradition covered political crimes against the state and injuries to \nthe state. Beyond that, it is difficult to glean covered conduct from \nthe English tradition.\n  Apparently there was only one discussion during the Constitutional \nConvention that dealt with the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors and \nthat occurred on September 8, 1787. As reported out of Committee, \nimpeachable offenses included only ``treason and bribery.'' Mason \nwanted to add ``maladministration,'' which was also contained in many \nstate constitutions. Madison was under the impression that such \nlanguage would leave the President at the mercy of the Senate. Madison \nrelented and we wound up with the phrase as we have it today. The \nfounding fathers quite clearly rejected impeachment for Congressional \ndisapproval of policy. Impeachable offenses were ``political'' offenses \nand, as under English law, not necessarily criminal. Other guidance \nthat can be derived from the Convention is the fact that the founders \nwere acutely aware of their rejection of bills of attainder as existed \nin the English system and, therefore, they thought that impeachable \noffenses should be something that any reasonable man could anticipate. \nHe should not be punished for some crime made up after the fact. Also, \nthere was to be a requirement for ``substantiality.'' This mechanism \nwas not designed for trivial offenses.\n  We cannot determine the precise intent of the framers because their \ndeliberations were in secret and nothing was printed from their \ndeliberations. They intended for the ratifiers at the state Conventions \nto be the more authoritative voice for interpretation of the provisions \nin the Constitution. It is fair to conclude that the attitude of the \nratifiers was reflected to a certain extent in the Federalist papers. \nThe most definitive comments concerning impeachment were by Hamilton in \nFederalist 65 wherein he stated:\n\n       The subjects of [impeachment] are those offenses which \n     proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other \n     words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They \n     are of a nature which may be with peculiar propriety \n     denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries \n     done immediately to the society itself.\n\n  The ratifiers at the North Carolina convention spoke in terms of \nserious injuries to the Federal government. James Iredell, later to \nbecome an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court, stated that \nimpeachment was ``calculated to bring [great offenders] to punishment \nfor crimes which it is not easy to describe but which everyone must be \nconvinced as a high crime and misdemeanor against governments . . . the \noccasion for its exercise will arise from acts of great injury to the \ncommunity.'' He gave as an example of an impeachable offense the giving \nof false information to the Senate. Impeachment was not for ``want of \njudgment'' but rather to hold him responsible for ``willfully abusing \nhis trust.'' Iredell also called attention to the complexity if \nnot impossibility of defining the scope of impeachable offenses with \nany more precision than the above. And the ratifiers at the Virginia \nConvention clearly agreed that a President could be impeached for non-\nindictable offense.\n\n  There was continued discussion and debate after ratification \nconcerning the impeachment process. James Madison contended that the \nwanton removal of meritorious officers would subject a President to \nimpeachment and removal from office. Forty years later, Justice Story, \nin his Commentaries insisted that ``not every offence'' is a high crime \nand misdemeanor, that ``many offences, purely political . . . have been \nheld to be within the reach of parliamentary impeachments, not one of \nwhich is in the slightest manner alluded to in our statute book,'' that \n``the only safe guide'' in determining ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' \n``must be the common law,'' and left open the possibility that actions \na civil officer took that were unconnected to his office might be \nproperly the subject of impeachment.\n  Therefore, it seems that despite the framers' and ratifiers' \nincomplete discussion, our inability to put our hands\n\n[[Page S1551]]\n\non documentation reflecting some of their thoughts, and the fact that \nperhaps they simply did not think of some of the problems that might \narise in the future, we see a certain framework develop--certain \nperimeters within which our decision should be made.\n  The Senate's own precedents do not change this evaluation because \nthey are not terribly instructive either. In impeachment cases, the \nSenate has convicted on seven occasions, acquitted on five, dismissed \ntwo cases on jurisdictional grounds and one case was withdrawn because \nof resignation. An acquittal serves very little value as precedent \nbeyond the facts of the case since an acquittal can be based on any \nnumber of grounds (jurisdictional, failure to prove the factual \nallegations, offenses not rising to the level of impeachable conduct, \netc.) and the motivation for the vote is not reflected when the verdict \nis rendered ``not guilty.'' There is little more help derived from \nconvictions, in terms of precedential value. There has only been one \nimpeachment trial for a President, that of Andrew Johnson, and that, of \ncourse, resulted in an acquittal. A large majority of the remainder of \nthe cases have been those of federal judges.\n  The question has arisen whether judicial impeachments are to be \nconsidered by the same standards as presidential impeachments. It seems \nto me that certainly the application of the standard of ``high crimes \nand misdemeanors'' for a president must differ from that of a judge. \nRemoving the President removes the elected head of the nation. Removing \na single judge does not carry the same implications for the country. \nAnd while a President should act according to the highest standards of \nprobity, it is quite easy to imagine circumstances that would warrant \njudicial impeachment that would not justify presidential impeachment, \nsuch as making official decisions based purely on political \nconsiderations. It is also possible that certain crimes would be \nimpeachable if a judge committed them, because of the specific nature \nof the judicial office in our system of government, but would not be \nimpeachable for a President.\n  It has been argued that the standard should be different for \npresidents than judges because the former serves for a fixed term and \nthe latter serve ``during good behavior.'' I do not share that view. \nThe standard itself is the same for each category: treason, bribery, \nand other high crimes and misdemeanors. But the difference in tenure is \nrelevant in a way. Because impeachment is not punishment and is \npolitical, the Framers vested the process in the legislative branch. \nProsecution for crimes was lodged in the judiciary. Thus, a President, \nwho cannot be prosecuted while in office, can be impeached and removed \nfrom office before he faces criminal prosecution. While a judge can \nalso be impeached and removed before being convicted of a crime, it is \nalso the case that criminal punishment can be, and has been, imposed on \nsitting judges. But since courts were expressly not given the power to \nremove civil officers, federal judges who have been criminally \nconvicted and have refused to resign have continued to draw their \nsalary ``during good behavior,'' i.e., until they were impeached. That \nis the only significance with respect to impeachment of judges and of \npresidents based on their differing terms of service.\n  Scholars have looked to the purposes to be served by the impeachment \nprocess as well as history in making their own analysis as to the \nmeaning ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' For Charles Black they would \ninclude offenses (1) which are extremely serious, (2) which in some way \ncorrupt or subvert the political and governmental process, and (3) \nwhich are plainly wrong in themselves to a person of honor or to a good \ncitizen regardless of words on the statute books.\n  Also qualifying according to Professor Black would be ``serious \noffense against the nation or its governmental or political \nprocesses.'' Furthermore, he would include purely personal actions that \nwould make a President unviable as a national leader. Murder, of \ncourse, would be the prime example here. He would also include a \ntotally different category of offenses which seriously threaten the \norder of political society as to make dangerous the continuation in \npower of the President. Finally, he would include actions that would \n``undermine government and confidence in government'' such as serious \ntax fraud.\n  Professor Michael J. Gerhardt on the issue of purely personal conduct \nof the President states: ``Even if such a crime were unrelated to the \nPresident's Constitutional duties, his criminal act considerably \ncheapens the Presidency, destroys his credibility with the other \nbranches (and other nations, for that matter), and shows such lack of \nrespect for human life and disdain for the law (which he has sworn to \nenforce faithfully) that Congress could reasonably conclude that he had \nseriously breached his trust and no longer deserves to hold office.'' \nAgain, murder was the easy example.\n  However, he contends further that an official may be impeached for \nconduct in office that does not relate to his or her former \nresponsibilities if an office holder violates his public trust and \nloses the confidence of the people. Then he must forfeit the privilege \nof holding at least his or her present office. ``In this context, \nconduct that may plainly be unrelated to the responsibilities of a \nparticular office may still relate to an official's capacity to fulfill \nthe functions of that office and to hold the people's trust.'' He gives \nthe example of income tax fraud.\n  Gerhardt points out that not all statutory crimes demonstrate \nunfitness for office, but that on the other hand, there are some \nindictable offenses for which certain high level government officials \nmay be impeached. Among them are offenses which ``demonstrate serious \nlack of judgment or disdain for the law and the commission lowers \nrespect for the office.'' In other words, there are certain statutory \ncrimes, that, if committed by public officials, reflect, in Congress' \nestimation such lapses of judgment, breaches of the public trust and \ndisregard for the public welfare, the law, and the integrity or \nreputation of the office held, that the occupant may be impeached.\n  What I derive from this, is that there is no ``holy grail'' of \nimpeachable offenses. The framers provided the Senate with a framework \nwithin which to operate and history provides us with a map, but not a \ndestination. Our conclusions must depend upon the particular \ncircumstances of the case, the nature of the act or acts involved, and \ntheir effects on society or integral parts of our political structure.\n  Today we are faced with an unprecedented situation. The President \nengaged in inappropriate personal conduct. It had nothing to do with \nhis official duties, but it did involve a federal employee under his \nsupervision, government time and government facilities. In an attempt \nto conceal and cover up that activity, he lied, misled and helped \nconceal evidence both physical and testimonial in a court proceeding. \nIn doing so he elicited the help of other government employees. \nTherefore, the subject matter was essentially private, but the forum, a \nUnited States court, became public. One side says that he ``only lied \nabout sex,'' and it had nothing to do with his official duties, \ntherefore, it ``clearly does not rise to the level of an impeachable \noffense.'' The other side says that any perjury and any obstruction of \njustice ``clearly does rise to the level of an impeachable offense.'' I \ndo not think that either position is consistent with history or proper \nanalysis.\n  For example, I agree with Professor Black that not every imaginable \nact that might technically constitute obstruction of justice would \nnecessarily be impeachable.\n  On the other hand, opponents of conviction in the present case, have \nraised the bar for impeachment to unreasonable heights. Usually they \nconcede that an impeachable offense does not have to be a crime, but \noften it is maintained that the abuse of power has to come from his \npublic position such as Nixon's abuse of the CIA or FBI. Of course, \nthis immediately runs headlong into the murder hypothetical and many \nother hypotheticals of serious, although totally personal, conduct as \nwell.\n  They then make the further argument that the violation has to be ``an \noffense against the state.'' While I agree that an offense against the \nstate is one of the categories of offenses that impeachment was \nprimarily designed to cover, offenses against the state's governmental \nand political processes, including the court system, as well as\n\n[[Page S1552]]\n\nattempts to subvert them, are also impeachable. Besides, it would seem \nto me, that subversion or serious damage to our governmental \ninstitutions constitute offenses against the state.\n\n  They also point out that one of the purposes of impeachment is to \nprotect the nation from the offender President. I agree again that this \nmay be one of the purposes of impeachment. However, it is not the only \npurpose, and protection of the public is not always a requirement. If \nan offense has been laid bare and totally exposed, and the President is \ncompletely incapable of continuing his conduct, this lack of imminent \nthreat to the nation does not necessarily mean that he should not and \ncannot be impeached. President Nixon probably would not have been \nforced from office if that were the only criteria.\n  Opponents of conviction also overlook the fact that we may look to \nthe effects of the President's conduct. Actions, even private actions, \nthat serve to undermine the government or the people's confidence in \nthe government or the President, may also be impeachable. In other \nwords, opponents of impeachment rightly point out some of the \ncategories that are applicable in impeachment cases, but they set them \nforth as exclusive when, in fact, they are not.\n  The impeachment bar has been raised even higher most recently by \nrespected commentators in the media. The New York Times editorial page, \nfor example, takes a position that the President's action must \n``threaten the welfare or stability of the state.'' On another \noccasion, they stated that the President's actions must ``show some \nfundamental harm to the security interest or stability of the state or \nsome attempt to undermine the Constitution.'' The problem with this is \nthat there is absolutely no authority to support such a contention. \nSuch a theory relies exclusively upon the ``protect the nation'' theory \nof impeachment. The founders certainly did not mean that the President \nhad to be on the verge of throwing the nation into chaos or endangering \nnational security in order to be impeached.\n  It is extremely important that we refrain from latching onto a \ndefinition of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' simply because it leads \nus inexorably to a conclusion which we may desire. Clearly, a \nPresident's offense or offenses must be serious and/or have serious \nconsequences. Also, while they do not have to be crimes, my own opinion \nis that in most cases they will be crimes. They must be crimes against \nthe state, but we cannot adopt an unreasonable restriction of that \nterm. The President does not have to order tanks to move on the J. \nEdgar Hoover building. Offenses against the state can include activity \nwhich will undermine our governmental institutions. How can we say that \nbribing a judge to effect an outcome in a law suit involving a \nPresident's purely personal conduct constitutes an impeachable offense, \nbut say that insinuating perjury into that same law suit to effect the \nsame outcome is clearly not impeachable? And while it is true that the \nfounders meant to cover ``public'' behavior, I believe they also meant \nto cover behavior that has a negative effect on the public if it is of \nsufficient gravity. Furthermore, if the President's conduct poses a \nthreat and danger to a country, that certainly is a legitimate (though \nnot exclusive) consideration. If that same conduct serves to undermine \nthe President's credibility and moral authority, that could also pose a \ndanger to the country and is similarly a legitimate consideration. And, \nagain his conduct does not necessarily have to deal with his office. In \nthe Constitution, a named offense is bribery (treason, bribery or other \nhigh crimes and misdemeanors), and bribery itself does not necessarily \nhave to do with the President's official capacity, if the President is \nmaking the bribe.\n  I believe that the founders did not intend to make our job easy. They \nprovided no list of offenses. They refused to spare us from the \ndifficult analysis that we must now go through. We must take into \nconsideration the offense or offenses, the capacity in which they were \ncommitted, the effect on our public institutions, the effect on our \npeople and our people's attitude toward the Presidency and our other \ninstitutions, whether the President's conduct was one or more isolated \nevents, or a pattern of conduct, the period of time over which the \nconduct was carried out and ultimately decide whether in view of all of \nthese circumstances, it is in the best interest of the country to \nremove this President.\n  The significance of a ``pattern of conduct'' is recognized by John R. \nLabovitz in his book Presidential Impeachment.  Labovitz concluded that \nfocusing on whether the President has committed ``an impeachable \noffense'' is of limited usefulness, since few individual crimes warrant \nremoval, such as a single act of treason or a single act of bribery. \nEven in the case of President Nixon, ``[i]t was necessary to combine \ndistinct actions into a pattern or course of conduct to establish \ngrounds for removal from office.'' As he also wrote:\n       The concept of an impeachable offense guts an impeachment \n     case of the very factors--repetition, pattern, coherence--\n     that tend to establish the requisite degree of seriousness \n     warranting the removal of a president from office. Just as a \n     recidivist deserves a more stringent sentence than a first \n     offender, so presumably a repeated offender is more likely to \n     deserve removal from an office of public trust, and \n     especially the highest trust in the land. . .. [I]t is \n     necessary to take a less divided view of the charges. Because \n     the remedy is not additive, the offenses must be considered \n     cumulatively in deciding whether or not it should be imposed. \n     The House must decide whether or not to prosecute an \n     impeachment on the basis of the charges taken as a whole. \n     And, unless the Senate is to take the determination of the \n     House without question, it too must judge the combined \n     seriousness of the wrongdoing that is proved.\n  I believe that this statement is very relevant to the obstruction of \njustice charge, which I will discuss later.\n\n\n                     ARTICLE I--GRAND JURY PERJURY\n\n  Article I, after alleging generally that President Clinton violated \nhis oath of office and failed to take care that the laws be faithfully \nexecuted by manipulating the judicial process for his personal gain, \nalleges that on August 17, 1998, following taking an oath to tell the \ntruth, he\n\n     willfully provided perjurious, false, and misleading \n     testimony to the grand jury concerning one or more of the \n     following: (1) the nature and details of his relationship \n     with a subordinate Government employee; (2) prior perjurious, \n     false, and misleading testimony that he gave in a Federal \n     civil rights action brought against him; (3) prior false and \n     misleading statements he allowed his attorney to make to a \n     Federal judge in that civil rights action and (4) his corrupt \n     efforts to influence the testimony of witnesses and to impede \n     the discovery of evidence in that civil rights action.\n       In doing this, William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the \n     integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the \n     Presidency, has betrayed his trust as President, and has \n     acted in a manner subversive of the rule of law and justice, \n     to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\n       Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, \n     warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office and \n     disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, \n     trust, or profit under the United States.''\n\n  Never has the Senate convicted on an article worded such as this. \nSeveral crimes or categories of crimes (the exact number cannot be \ndetermined from reading the article) are charged in this one article. \nThe perjurious statements are not described, nor are their dates. \nIn large part, this article charges that the President committed \nperjury because he denied prior perjury.\n\n  At the outset, it is clear that a count such as this in an indictment \nwould not survive court challenge. However, it is equally clear that \nthe Senate is not bound to follow normal legal rules. Impeachment, \nHamilton wrote in Federalist No. 65, ``can never be tied down by such \nstrict rules, either in the delineation of the offense by the \nprosecutors or in the construction of it by the judges, as in common \ncases serve to limit discretion of courts in favor of personal \nsecurity.'' Nevertheless, we should examine the basis for such rules \nand determine the extent, if any, we should apply them to our \ndeliberations.\n  The reason for rules against charging several offenses in one article \nis clear. A group of senators as few as seventeen could conclude that \nthe President was guilty of one offense in the article, and a group of \nother senators could conclude that the President was guilty of another \noffense in the article and so on. This could result in the President \nbeing found guilty on one article without two-thirds of the senators \never agreeing upon a single offense that the President committed.\n  Compounding this problem, the individual items alleged in the article \nare\n\n[[Page S1553]]\n\nvague because they could reach different instances of objectionable \nconduct within a general heading. The problem with failing to \nspecifically identify the offenses charged is that it does not give the \nperson charged fair notice. Although I believe that the president had \nactual notice for the most part, what is actually being charged in this \narticle has not been without dispute.\n  The articles pending against President Clinton are unique. Never has \nthe Senate considered articles that are simultaneously omnibus, vague, \nand based upon ``one or more'' of the charges being proved.\n  Again, we have substantial leeway in considering these matters, but \nwe must be fair. We are creating precedent, and this is not good \npractice. The rule of law must apply to the President when it inures to \nhis benefit just as when it inures to his detriment.\n  The House relies on Rule XXIII of the Senate's impeachment rules as \ngranting this body's tacit approval for the drafting of impeachment \narticles in the form of those from President Nixon's impeachment \nproceedings. The House also argues that its committee report provided \nadequate notice of charges, occupying 20 pages just to list ``the most \nglaring instances of the president's perjurious, false, and misleading \ntestimony before a federal grand jury and requir[ing] 13 pages just to \nlist the most glaring incidents in the president's course of conduct \ndesigned to prevent, obstruct, and impede the administration of \njustice.'' But this argument underlines the problem. These allegations \nwere not made in the articles themselves, and even now, can it truly be \nsaid that these were the entirety of the charges that could have been \nraised at trial, or even in a later impeachment?\n  Articles of impeachment henceforth should not permit conviction based \nupon ``one or more'' findings of guilt. They should list specific \nconduct, preferably in separate articles. Removal of elected or \nappointed government officials, especially a president, should occur \nonly when the public can be sure that the process has been appropriate. \nArticles such as those before the Senate in this case do not further \nthat goal. The Senate should amend Rule XXIII to permit impeachment \narticles to be divided, so as to eliminate any incentive for the House \nto adopt duplicitous articles of impeachment.\n  In prior impeachments charging false statements, the House has always \ndelineated the date and substance of the false statement. Indeed, in \nevery impeachment proceeding since Judge Pickering in 1803, articles of \nimpeachment exhibited by the House have included allegations of \nspecific misconduct. Although the Senate has at times voted in favor of \narticles containing multiple or cumulative allegations, it has only \ndone so where specific allegations were made in other separate articles \nand where the omnibus article was written in the conjunctive. Never has \nthe Senate voted for conviction on an article that charged an \nindividual with ``one or more'' improper actions.\n  Unfortunately, instead of following precedent, the House in the case \nbefore us deviated from previous practice. In prior cases, the House \navoided lumping together several amorphous charges into one article, \nwith conviction permitted if ``one or more `` alleged offenses had been \nproved--in all cases but one: Richard Nixon. Here, the House explicitly \nfollowed the Watergate example, probably thinking that they would be on \nsafe ground. Unfortunately, the articles drafted against President \nNixon were deficient in the extreme.\n  The first article of impeachment against President Nixon charged that \nthe President had ``engaged in a course of conduct or plan designed to \ndelay, impede and obstruct investigations of [the] unlawful entry [of \nthe headquarters of the Democratic National Committee]; to cover up, \nconceal and protect those responsible; and to conceal the existence and \nscope of other unlawful activities. The means used to implement this \ncourse of conduct or plan have included one or more of the following.'' \nThe article of impeachment then listed nine separate charges, each \nextremely broad. The second Nixon article charged dozens of \nindeterminate criminal offenses within several wide-ranging categories.\n  The charges contained in the Nixon articles are alarmingly vague and \nduplicitous. The articles before us are not that deficient, but they \nrepresent a second step down a road we should not take. While these \nproblems with Article I in isolation may not be sufficient to defeat \nthis article, they are more than technicalities, and pose potentially \nserious consequences for the future.\n  The Senate, of course, did not have occasion to consider the \nimpeachment articles against President Nixon. Only once in its history \nhas the Senate actually considered an article of impeachment charging \nviolations of ``one or more'' alleged acts. Among the articles of \nimpeachment against Judge Walter Nixon in 1989 was an article alleging \nthat Judge Nixon made ``one or more\" false statements. Unlike the \narticles against Presidents Nixon or Clinton, however, the article in \nquestion in the case of Judge Nixon specifically enumerated the alleged \nmaterial false statements, including the date and nature of the \nstatement made. The Senate, though defeating a motion to dismiss the \narticle, nevertheless acquitted Judge Nixon on this article. Several \nSenators explained their votes to acquit on this article due to the \nmultiplicitous (actually, duplicitous) and disjunctive ``one or more'' \nform of the article.\n  I agree with those senators who criticized the form of the omnibus \narticle of impeachment that was brought against Judge Nixon. An article \nof impeachment charging a defendant with ``one or more'' acts is not \nonly unfair to the defendant, but it does not permit senators to \nperform adequately their constitutional duty and the American people to \nunderstand their actions. If the Senate were to convict on a ``one or \nmore'' acts count of an article of impeachment, the votes to convict \nwould obscure the real basis for each senator's vote. Ultimately, the \nAmerican people would be deprived of knowing the basis on which the \nPresident they duly elected was removed from office.\n  The Senate also has never been asked to convict someone for conduct \nthat formed the basis for an article of impeachment that was rejected \nby the House. Although in a literal sense, no such article is before \nthe Senate, in a practical sense that is the situation. The House \nfailed to pass an article of impeachment against President Clinton that \naccused him of, on January 17, 1998, ``willfully provid[ing] \nperjurious, false, and misleading testimony in response to questions \ndeemed relevant by a Federal judge concerning the nature and details of \nhis relationship with a subordinate Government employee, his knowledge \nof that employee's involvement and participation in the civil rights \naction brought against him, and his corrupt efforts to influence the \ntestimony of that employee.'' Yet, in Article I, the Senate is asked to \nconvict the President based on ``one or more'' sets of actions, one of \nwhich is the President's ``prior perjurious, false, and misleading \ntestimony he gave in a Federal civil rights action brought against \nhim.'' That portion of Article I has resulted in the House recharging \nall the allegations of perjury made by the President in his civil \ndeposition that were dismissed when the House rejected an article of \nimpeachment that was based on that deposition. The House does so \nexplicitly: ``In addition to his lie about not recalling being alone \nwith Ms. Lewinsky, the President told numerous other lies at his \ndeposition. All of those lies are incorporated in Article I, Item 2.'' \nHouse Trial Memo. at 61. The House claims that the President's \nstatement in his grand jury testimony that he intended to be unhelpful \nbut truthful in his deposition, and that he did not violate the law in \nhis deposition, amount to perjury in the grand jury if a single \nstatement in his deposition was perjurious. However, the President did \nnot broadly reaffirm the truth of all his deposition testimony. Indeed, \nbefore the grand jury, the President revised many statements he had \nmade in the Jones deposition.\n  Two perjury statutes have been enacted as part of the federal \ncriminal code. 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  1623 and 1621. The elements of \nsection 1623 are that the defendant (1) knowingly make a (2) false (3) \nmaterial declaration (4) under oath in a proceeding before or ancillary \nto any court or grand jury of the United States. Statements which are \nmisleading but literally true cannot form the\n\n[[Page S1554]]\n\nbasis for a perjury conviction. Bronston v. United States, 409 U.S. 352 \n(1973). The most difficult element of the offense is materiality. A \nstatement is said to be material ``if it has a natural tendency to \ninfluence, or is capable of influencing, the decision of the \ndecisionmaking body to whom it is addressed.'' United States v. Durham, \n139 F.3d 1325, 1329 (10th Cir. 1998); see Kungys v. United States, 485 \nU.S. 759 (1988). The Supreme Court has characterized the conduct \nprohibited by Sec.  1621 as follows: ``A witness testifying under oath \nor affirmation violates this section if she gives false testimony \nconcerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false \ntestimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty \nmemory.'' United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 94 (1993). As with \nSec.  1621, testimony that is misleading but literally true does not \nfall within the ambit of Sec.  1623.\n  A preliminary matter before consideration of these charges concerns \nthe burden of proof of the charges in the articles of impeachment which \nI believe should apply. It is well established that senators are free \nto weigh the evidence in particular cases under a standard they \nconsider appropriate. My own view is that different cases will be \nconsidered under different standards, depending on the nature of the \nparticular charge. Impeachment is neither a civil nor a criminal \nproceeding, but a hybrid. It is therefore inappropriate to always apply \none or the other of the criminal or civil burdens of proof. When the \nconsequences to the nation of the alleged conduct are most serious, \nsuch as treason, then the Senate should consider the case under a clear \nand convincing standard, for fear of leaving a likely traitor in office \nsimply because his guilt has not been established beyond a reasonable \ndoubt. By contrast, when the charges allege harms that are not \nimminently serious to the national well-being, it becomes more \nappropriate to apply the criminal burden of proof: beyond a reasonable \ndoubt. I concede that the charges alleged here, while serious, do not \nfall within the former category, and I will therefore review the facts \nunder the beyond a reasonable doubt standard.\n  With that background, I now consider the facts relating to the three \nperjury specifications concerning the President's grand jury testimony \nthat are properly before the Senate. The first is his testimony \nconcerning ``the details and nature of his relationship with a \nsubordinate Government employee.'' The President admitted in the grand \njury that he had an inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.\n  To be sure, President Clinton contended that the relationship began \nin 1996, rather than 1995. The House managers note that this is \nsignificant because Ms. Lewinsky was an intern in 1995. The House also \npoints out that the President admitted inappropriate conduct ``on \ncertain occasions,'' when, in reality, there were eleven such \noccasions, and that he had ``occasional'' telephone encounters with Ms. \nLewinsky when there were at least seventeen that contained sexual \nbanter. I do think that these statements constitute perjury. They were \nfalse, were made willfully, and were material. Something that happens \nseventeen times in a year does not occur ``occasionally.'' Given the \nsensitivity of Ms. Lewinsky's status as an intern, I believe that the \nPresident deliberately told the grand jury that his relationship with \nher began in 1996, when she no longer had that status. Finally, the \nstatement is material because it concerns a matter that the grand jury \nwas investigating as part of its work: the nature of the President's \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky. For these reasons, the statement was \nperjurious.\n  The President's statement to the grand jury that he regretted that \nwhat began as a friendship changed into an inappropriate sexual \nrelationship was also knowingly false, since the two engaged in sexual \nrelations twice on the same day that they first spoke. Thus, the \nstatement was made to deceive, and given that it related to a subject \nof the grand jury's inquiry, it was material. Therefore, I agree that \nthis statement also constitutes perjury, so that the first item of \nArticle I has been proved. The second item charged in Article I \naddresses statements the President made in the grand jury regarding the \ntruth of his deposition testimony. For the reasons above stated, I \nconsider finding perjury based on an article of impeachment that the \nHouse rejected to be questionable.\n  The third item charged in Article I concerns grand jury testimony \ninvolving ``false and misleading statements he allowed his attorney to \nmake to a Federal judge in that civil rights action.'' Before the grand \njury, President Clinton testified that he was ``not even sure I paid \nattention to what he [Mr. Bennett] was saying'' when his attorney \nrepresented to the court that Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit stated that \nthere was no sex of any kind between her and the President. As a \nfactual matter, given the videotape that shows the President \nconcentrating very carefully on his attorney's words and the great \nimportance that he placed on that affidavit and its filing in time, \nthis statement's characterization of the President's attention was \ncertainly false. However, the President said that he ``was not even \nsure\" that he was paying attention. It is possible, although unlikely, \nthat he was not sure in August that he was paying attention to that \nspecific statement in January. That would make the statement literally \ntrue and thus, by definition, not perjurious. And in any event, I \ncannot determine beyond a reasonable doubt that his statement was \nperjurious. Indeed, the real issue is whether President Clinton used \nthe affidavit to obstruct justice: whether he actually was paying \nattention to his unsuspecting attorney when the affidavit was actually \nused to obstruct justice is of questionable materiality.\n\n  The fourth item of the perjury allegations in Article I concerns \n``his corrupt efforts to influence the testimony of witnesses and to \nimpede the discovery of evidence in that civil rights action.'' The \nfirst set of facts under this category evidently concerns President \nClinton's statements to Ms. Currie on January 18, 1998, which he \ndescribed as having been made to refresh his recollection. The \nPresident's stated reason for making these statements to Ms. Currie was \nfalse. He knew that they were not true, and the President knew that Ms. \nCurrie could not testify to their truthfulness. Thus, his statement of \npurported purpose for making them, as communicated to the grand jury, \nwas made willfully, with the intent to deceive the grand jury. They \nwere material as well, since they went to the issue of whether he had \ncommitted a federal crime. They thus constitute perjury.\n  The second set of facts at issue in item four of Article I apparently \nconcerns whether the President truthfully told the grand jury that when \nthe subject of the subpoenaed gifts arose at his December 28, 1997 \nmeeting with Ms. Lewinsky, he told her ``if they asked her for the \ngifts, she'd have to give them whatever she had, that that's what the \nlaw was.'' Although Ms. Lewinsky never testified that the President \nsaid this to her, she once indicated that it sounded familiar. Thus, I \nam not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the President lied when \nhe testified that he made this statement.\n  The third set of facts in item four of Article I addresses alleged \nlies that he made to the grand jury concerning the truth of statements \nthat he made to White House aides. Before the grand jury, the President \nstated that he had told his aides that he did not have sex with Ms. \nLewinsky as he defined it, and that he told them ``things that were \ntrue about this relationship.'' In reality, the President told them \nfalse statements, such as a broader denial of sexual activity than that \ndefined as even he had defined it, and that Ms. Lewinsky was a stalker \nwho came on to him, but whom he rebuffed. The President's statements to \nthe grand jury in this regard were false, and were intended to deceive \nthe grand jury about a federal crime of obstruction of justice through \nthe telling of false statements to persons he knew might become \nwitnesses before that grand jury, and therefore committed perjury.\n  As noted above, not all impeachable offenses are crimes, and not all \ncrimes are impeachable offenses. While I conclude that one of the three \nsets of facts at issue in item four of Article I does not constitute \nperjury, I conclude that the statements concerning Betty Currie, and \nthe statements concerning what he told his aides do constitute perjury. \nI also find that the President committed perjury with respect to\n\n[[Page S1555]]\n\nitem one of Article I with respect to his statements that he and Ms. \nLewinsky's relationship began as a friendship, that it started in 1996, \nand that he had ``occasional'' encounters with her. These are the only \nexamples of grand jury perjury that I believe have been proved in the \nentirety of Article I. The question then is whether these examples of \nperjury warrant removal of the President for the commission of high \ncrimes and misdemeanors.\n  Make no mistake, perjury is a felony, and its commission by a \nPresident may sometimes constitute high crimes and misdemeanors. But is \nremoval appropriate when the President lied about whether he was \nrefreshing his recollection or coaching a witness about the nature of a \nsexual relationship? Is removal appropriate when the President lied to \nthe grand jury that he denied to his aides that he had engaged in sex \nonly as he had defined it, when in fact he had denied engaging in oral \nsex? Is removal warranted because the President stated that his \nrelationship began as a friendship in the wrong year and actually \nencompassed more telephone encounters than could truthfully be \ndescribed as ``occasional''? To ask the question is to answer it. In my \nopinion, these statements, while wrong and perhaps indictable after the \nPresident leaves office, do not justify removal of the President from \noffice.\n  In no way does my conclusion ratify the White House lawyers' view \nthat private conduct never rises to impeachable offenses, or that only \nacts that will jeopardize the future of the nation warrant removal of \nthe President. It simply recognizes how the principles the Founding \nFathers established apply to these facts.\n  I therefore vote to acquit the President of the charges alleged \nagainst him in Article I.\n\n\n                   ARTICLE II--OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE\n\n  Article II charges that President William Jefferson Clinton, in \nviolation of his oath of office, and in violation of his constitutional \nobligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed\n\n     has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of \n     justice, and has to that end engaged personally, and through \n     his subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or scheme \n     designed to delay, impede, cover up, and conceal the \n     existence of evidence and testimony related to a Federal \n     civil rights action brought against him in a duly instituted \n     judicial proceeding.\n       The means used to implement this course of conduct or \n     scheme included one or more of the following acts:\n       (1) On or about December 17, 1997, William Jefferson \n     Clinton corruptly encouraged a witness in a Federal civil \n     rights action brought against him to execute a sworn \n     affidavit in that proceeding that he knew to be perjurious, \n     false, and misleading.\n       (2) On or about December 17, 1997, William Jefferson \n     Clinton corruptly encouraged a witness in a Federal civil \n     rights action brought against him to give perjurious, false \n     and misleading testimony if and when called to testify \n     personally in that proceeding.\n       (3) On or about December 28, 1997, William Jefferson \n     Clinton corruptly engaged in, encouraged, or supported a \n     scheme to conceal evidence that had been subpoenaed in a \n     Federal civil rights action brought against him.\n       (4) Beginning on or about December 7, 1997, and continuing \n     through and including January 14, 1998, William Jefferson \n     Clinton intensified and succeeded in an effort to secure job \n     assistance to a witness in a Federal civil rights action \n     brought against him in order to corruptly prevent the \n     truthful testimony of that witness in that proceeding at a \n     time when the truthful testimony of that witness would have \n     been harmful to him.\n       (5) On January 17, 1998, at his deposition in a Federal \n     civil rights action brought against him, William Jefferson \n     Clinton corruptly allowed his attorney to make false and \n     misleading statements to a Federal judge characterizing an \n     affidavit, in order to prevent questioning deemed relevant by \n     the judge. Such false and misleading statements were \n     subsequently acknowledged by his attorney in a communication \n     to that judge.\n       (6) On or about January 18 and January 20-21, 1998, William \n     Jefferson Clinton related a false and misleading account of \n     events relevant to a Federal civil rights action brought \n     against him to a potential witness in that proceeding, in \n     order to corruptly influence the testimony of that witness.\n       (7) On or about January 21, 23, and 26, 1998, William \n     Jefferson Clinton made false and misleading statements to \n     potential witnesses in a Federal grand jury proceeding in \n     order to corruptly influence the testimony of those \n     witnesses. The false and misleading statements made by \n     William Jefferson Clinton were repeated by the witnesses to \n     the grand jury, causing the grand jury to receive false and \n     misleading information.\n       In all of this, William Jefferson Clinton has undermined \n     the integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the \n     Presidency, has betrayed his trust as President, and has \n     acted in a manner subversive of the rule of law and justice, \n     to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\n       Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, \n     warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office and \n     disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, \n     trust, or profit under the United States.''\n\n  Section 1503(a) of Title 18 of the United States Code states:\n\n       Whoever corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any \n     threatening letter or communication, endeavors to influence, \n     intimidate, or impede any grand or petit juror, or officer of \n     any court of the United States, or officer who may be serving \n     at any examination or other proceeding before any United \n     States magistrate judge or other committing magistrate, in \n     the discharge of his duty, or injures any such grand or petit \n     juror in his person or property on account of any verdict or \n     indictment assented to by him, or on account of his being or \n     having been such juror, or injures any such officer, \n     magistrate judge, or other committing magistrate in his \n     person or property on account of the performance of his \n     official duties . . . shall be punished as provided in \n     subsection (b).\n  Courts have interpreted this provision to require the government to \nprove: ``(1) that there was a pending judicial proceeding, (2) that the \ndefendant knew this proceeding was pending, and (3) that the defendant \nthen corruptly endeavored to influence, obstruct, or impede the due \nadministration of justice.'' United States v. Monus, 128 F.3d 376, 387 \n(6th Cir. 1998).\n  Here, there is no doubt that a judicial proceeding was pending and \nthat President Clinton knew that the proceeding was pending. The \nquestion is whether he corruptly intended to influence, obstruct, or \nimpede the due administration of justice. Courts have held that to act \ncorruptly means to act with the intent to influence, obstruct, or \nimpede the proceeding in question. United States v. Mullins, 22 F.3d \n1365, 1369 (6th Cir. 1994); United States v. Littleton, 76 F.3d 614, \n619 (4th Cir. 1996); United States v. Russo, 104 F.3d 431, 435 (D.C. \nCir. 1997). Because the prohibited intent is so closely related to the \nprohibited act, courts have required a nexus between the obstructing \nconduct and the target proceedings. Thus, the defendant's acts must \nhave the ``natural and probable effect'' of interfering with the due \nadministration of justice. United States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593, 599 \n(1995). But the defendant need only endeavor to obstruct justice to \ncommit this offense. There is no requirement that he actually succeed \nin obstructing justice. Id. at 599, 600.\n  Among the acts that courts have concluded violate Sec.  1503(a) \ninclude the creation of false documents to be presented in evidence, \nUnited States v. Chihak, 137 F.3d 252 (5th Cir. 1998); and instructing \na subordinate to conceal evidence, United States v. Lefkowitz, 125 F.3d \n608 (8th Cir. 1997). These actions are alleged to have occurred in \nArticle II.\n  Section 1512(b) of Title 18 prohibits witness tampering. \nSpecifically, it prohibits knowingly using one or more of the \nprohibited forms of persuasion with the intent to prevent a witness's \ntestimony from being presented at official federal proceedings or with \nthe intent to prevent a witness from reporting evidence of a crime to \nfederal authorities. United States v. Thompson, 76 F.3d 442, 452-53 (2d \nCir. 1996). Unlike Sec.  1503, Sec.  1512(b) does not require that the \ndefendant be aware of the pendency of federal proceedings. United \nStates v. Romero, 54 F.3d 56, 62 (2d Cir. 1995). Courts differ about \nthe standard of corrupt persuasion, but even the more stringent courts \nagree that it is sufficient if the defendant attempts to persuade a \nwitness ``to violate her legal duty to testify truthfully in court.'' \nUnited States v. Morrison, 98 F.3d 619, 630 (D.C. Cir. 1996). Contrary \nto the representations of White House counsel at the impeachment trial, \nit is not necessary that the defendant threaten or cause physical harm \nto a witness to fall within subsection (b). When the defendant's \nmisconduct takes the form of deceiving a potential witness with the \nintent that the witness later repeat the deception in federal \nproceedings, the crime does not require that the potential witness was \nin fact deceived, nor that there was any particular likelihood that \nthat potential witness would\n\n[[Page S1556]]\n\nin fact ever be called upon to testify. United States v. Gabriel, 125 \nF.3d 89, 102-03 (2d Cir. 1997). The prohibited intent of this \nsubsection is intent to obstruct a federal proceeding.\n  There are seven specifications of obstruction of justice in Article \nII. The first two charge that on or about December 17, 1997, President \nClinton corruptly urged a witness in a federal civil rights action to \nexecute a false affidavit and to give false testimony if called to \ntestify. That is the day he informed Ms. Lewinsky that she was on the \nJones witness list, that she should contact Ms. Currie if she were \nsubpoenaed, and that she could file an affidavit in the case to avoid \ntestifying. In this conversation, the President told Ms. Lewinsky that \nshe could ``always say you were coming to see Betty or that you were \nbringing me letters.''\n  The President conducted an improper relationship with an employee of \nthe federal government, Monica Lewinsky. He carried on that \nrelationship off the Oval Office. He engaged in sexual banter over \nunsecured telephone lines to Ms. Lewinsky's residence, compromising \nhimself and making himself susceptible to blackmail.\n  And on December 17, 1997, the President raised to Ms. Lewinsky both \nthe cover stories and filing an affidavit to prevent these facts from \nbeing disclosed. While Ms. Lewinsky testified that he did not expressly \ntell her to raise the cover stories in the affidavit, his intent was \nunmistakable: to corruptly endeavor to influence Ms. Lewinsky to file \nan affidavit that would prevent Paula Jones's attorneys from learning \nof the President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a relationship of \nthe type that the judge in her case had ruled to be relevant. And even \nif not directly linked to the affidavit, there is no question from Ms. \nLewinsky's consistent testimony that the President was asking her to \nuse those cover stories if she were ultimately asked to testify, since \nthat was the context of the conversation. The White House's repeated \nretort that the relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was consensual, while \nthe allegations by Ms. Jones were of non-consensual sex, is therefore \nirrelevant. President Clinton did not tell Ms. Lewinsky to lie, but \nneither did he need to, as she understood that she was to raise the \ncover stories. Ms. Lewinsky admitted that the affidavit was indeed \nfalse. And since Lewinsky's truthful testimony would have definitely \nled to her being called as a witness, the President clearly understood \nthat Ms. Lewinsky would file an affidavit he had strong reason to \nbelieve would be false. That is obstruction of justice, as shown by the \ncases that have held creation of false documents to be presented in \nevidence to fit within the statutory prohibition. Moreover, this charge \nmust be considered in connection with the President's discussions with \nMs. Lewinsky as her affidavit was being prepared, his conversation with \nMr. Jordan after he spoke with her, and his lawyer's deep involvement \nin ensuring that the affidavit was filed and that the President had an \nopportunity to see it before that occurred, all of which shed light on \nwhat the President intended Ms. Lewinsky to do in that affidavit and if \nshe testified.\n  The third item of Article II charges that President Clinton, on or \nabout December 28, 1997, corruptly engaged in, encouraged, or supported \na scheme to conceal evidence that had been subpoenaed in a federal \ncivil rights action against him. That is the day the President \ndiscussed the subpoenaed gifts with Ms. Lewinsky, and there is no doubt \nthat the President indicated that he was ``bothered'' by the specific \ngift, a hatpin, that the subpoena requested. In none of the many times \nthat Ms. Lewinsky testified did she ever say that the President told \nher to turn over the gifts, although once she said that the remark \nseemed familiar, and a number of times she testified that he asked to \nthink about her suggestion that she give the gifts to Ms. Currie. The \ngifts, of course, ultimately were secreted under Ms. Currie's bed, and \nthere is no doubt in Ms. Lewinsky's mind that Ms. Currie initiated the \ncall that led to that exchange of the gifts. Since only the President \nand Ms. Lewinsky were present when the subject of giving the gifts to \nMs. Currie was raised, and since Ms. Lewinsky did not call Ms. Currie, \nthe only way that Ms. Currie could have called Ms. Lewinsky and not be \nsurprised to obtain the gifts was if the President had told her to \ncontact Ms. Lewinsky to retrieve them. This is also consistent with the \nPresident's course of conduct in this matter.\n\n  The President thus corruptly acted to obstruct the Jones case by \nasking Ms. Currie to retrieve and secret the gifts. That constitutes \nobstruction of justice, as demonstrated by the cases that have \nconvicted defendants of that charge for having instructed subordinates \nto conceal evidence.\n  The White House's arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. It is \nirrelevant that the President did not initiate the subject of the gifts \nin his conversation with Ms. Lewinsky. It is also irrelevant that he \ndid not tell her to conceal the gifts. What is relevant is that the \nPresident, after thinking about the gifts, instructed Ms. Currie to \nretrieve the gifts from Ms. Lewinsky. The President's and Ms. Currie's \ndenials simply cannot be squared with the evidence.\n  Also irrelevant is the fact that Ms. Currie's cell phone call to Ms. \nLewinsky occurred at 3:30 p.m., whereas Ms. Lewinsky testified that the \ngift pickup occurred at 2 p.m. Notwithstanding the White House's \nwillingness to excuse the President's error by two or more months \nconcerning when his improper relationship with Ms. Lewinsky began, \nwhile insisting that the cell phone call's 90 minute mistiming is fatal \nto the theory that Ms. Currie instituted the gift exchange, the cell \nphone call at 3:30 does not prove that Ms. Lewinsky instituted the gift \nexchange. First, Ms. Lewinsky testified that she might have been \nmistaken about the time that Ms. Currie picked up the gifts. Second, \nthere is no evidence that the cell phone call was the one in which Ms. \nCurrie's gift pickup was proposed. Ms. Lewinsky testified that she \nreceived other telephone calls from Ms. Currie that day to learn when \nMs. Currie was coming to her apartment and also to know when she should \nactually come outside to meet Ms. Currie.\n  The White House also maintains that the President would not have \ngiven Ms. Lewinsky additional gifts on December 28 if he planned to \nhide the gifts. The facts do not support that theory. The President \ngave Ms. Lewinsky those gifts before, pondering Ms. Lewinsky's idea, he \ndetermined that he would ask Ms. Currie to retrieve them. Since he had \nno intent to retrieve the gifts at the time he gave her the gifts on \nDecember 28, there is no inconsistency with his later direction to Ms. \nCurrie to pick them up.\n  The fourth item of Article II alleges that the President, beginning \non December 7, 1997, and continuing through January 14, 1998, \nintensified and succeeded in an effort to secure job assistance to a \nwitness in a federal civil rights action brought against him to \ncorruptly prevent the truthful testimony of that witness. Following a \nmeeting with Ms. Lewinsky in November in which she sought his \nassistance, Mr. Jordan took no action and provided no help. He does not \neven remember this meeting. Thus, he made no serious effort to find her \na job until after December 7, once the President, not Ms. Lewinsky, \nasked him to conduct a job search for Ms. Lewinsky. That followed Ms. \nLewinsky's appearance on the Jones lawyers' witness list, and followed \nthe President's promise to Ms. Lewinsky that he would ask Mr. Jordan to \ndo more to help her find a job.\n  Although Ms. Currie, not the President, called Mr. Jordan, he was \naware that the request came from the President and that he acted at the \nbehest of the President. Jordan did not call the companies Ms. Lewinsky \nsuggested, but rather, the companies where he was likely to produce a \njob for her. After December 19, Jordan obviously became aware that the \nPresident may have been asking him to assist Ms. Lewinsky obtain a job \nbecause he may have had a sexual affair with Ms. Lewinsky. That \nprompted him to ask both Ms. Lewinsky and the President whether such a \nrelationship had occurred. Jordan continued to help find Ms. Lewinsky \nemployment once they both denied that this was the case. However, he \ntook no additional action until the day after Ms. Lewinsky signed the \naffidavit, when he called the CEO of McAndrews & Forbes to successfully \nobtain a second interview for her at Revlon after she told him that\n\n[[Page S1557]]\n\nthe first had proceeded badly. Thus, it is true that Mr. Jordan \nintensified his job assistance to Ms. Lewinsky at the President's \nrequest, following the President's, but not Mr. Jordan's knowledge, \nthat she appeared on the Jones witness list. Jordan took no further \naction on her behalf until satisfying himself that each had denied that \nthere had been any sexual relationship. He then obtained a job for Ms. \nLewinsky by calling the CEO of the holding company of the company that \noffered Ms. Lewinsky a job. That call was made the day after Ms. \nLewinsky signed her affidavit. Because President Clinton did ask Mr. \nJordan to intensify his job efforts to assist Ms. Lewinsky to obtain a \njob after he knew she was on the Jones witness list, the President \ncorruptly obstructed justice by attempting to influence the testimony \nof a witness in a case against him.\n  The White House responses to this charge miss the mark. That Ms. \nLewinsky had begun her job search in July, and after a few months had \nnot landed a job of her liking is irrelevant to whether, not having \nobtained a job, the President took steps to make sure she did obtain \none once her name appeared on the witness list. That Ms. Lewinsky \ntestified that no one ever promised her a job in return for her silence \ndoes not change the fact that these efforts were undertaken. That Linda \nTripp suggested that Ms. Lewinsky originally speak with Mr. Jordan \nmeans nothing because he took no action following that meeting; only \nafter the President requested that Mr. Jordan assist Ms. Lewinsky once \nher name appeared on the witness list did he do so. That Mr. Jordan \ntestified that he acted with no sense of urgency is also of no import: \nit was the President who acted with a sense of urgency, using Mr. \nJordan as his agent. Nor is it of consequence that Mr. Jordan placed no \nundue pressure on the persons he contacted in support of Ms. Lewinsky. \nThe corrupt influence in obstruction of justice that matters is \ndirected to the witness, not to the prospective employer of the \nwitness. President Clinton knew, and Mr. Jordan knew, that the ``Jordan \nmagic'' in finding people employment did not depend in any way on undue \npressure being applied. Thus, the White House's contention that there \nwas no connection between Ms. Lewinsky obtaining her Revlon offer and \nMr. Jordan's call to Mr. Perelman is denied by Mr. Jordan himself. \nPresident Clinton could be sure that Mr. Jordan would find Ms. Lewinsky \na job when her testimonial support of his denials was critical without \nhis own need to do anything. It is also irrelevant that she did not \nobtain a job offer in each company Mr. Jordan called. Nothing in the \nrecord shows that the President ever requested Mr. Jordan to find \nemployment for any White House intern who was not on a witness list in \na federal case pending against him. The President obstructed justice \nthrough using Mr. Jordan to find Ms. Lewinsky a job once her name \nappeared on the Jones witness list.\n  The fifth item of Article II claims that the President obstructed \njustice by corruptly allowing his attorney to make false and misleading \nstatements to a federal judge. In the President's presence, his \nattorney represented to the court, based on Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, \nthat the President had seen the affidavit, and that it showed that \n``there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form \nwith President Clinton,'' a statement his lawyer later retracted out of \nprofessional ethics obligations. The affidavit stated, inter alia, that \n``I have never had a sexual relationship with the President, he did not \npropose that we have a sexual relationship . . .'' and ``the occasions \nthat I saw the President after I left my employment at the White House \nin April, 1996, were official receptions, formal functions or events \nrelated to the U.S. Department of Defense, where I was working at the \ntime. There were other people present on those occasions.'' The \nPresident testified that the affidavit was ``absolutely true.'' The \nPresident knew that Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit would be used to \nperpetrate a fraud on the court, and because he was briefed on its \ncontents by his attorney in advance, he knew that his attorney \nmisunderstood the affidavit, and would inadvertently present the \naffidavit to the court in a false light. Yet, he took no action to \neither change his lawyer's understanding or to prevent the use of the \naffidavit under those conditions. Moreover, with knowledge that the \naffidavit used the cover stories that he had reminded Ms. Lewinsky to \ncontinue on December 17, he testified to those same cover stories. \nRegardless of whether he was paying attention at the moment that this \nhappened, the President clearly knew at the time the deposition \ncommenced that the affidavit would be used in a way that perpetrated a \nfraud on the court and on Ms. Jones's proceedings. He corruptly impeded \nMs. Jones's efforts to prove the fact relevant to her case that Mr. \nClinton had had a sexual relationship with another government employee. \nHe did so intentionally by allowing that affidavit to be portrayed by \nan officer of the court as proof that there was in fact no sexual \nrelationship between the President and another government employee. \nThat is obstruction of justice. The White House has addressed these \nfacts only with respect to whether the President's statement denying \nthat he was in fact paying attention to his attorney as opposed to \nlooking at him constituted perjury, but has never refuted the \nPresident's knowledge that a false affidavit would be used in the \ndeposition to obstruct the proceeding.\n\n  The sixth item of Article II concerns the President's obstruction of \njustice by relating false and misleading statements to Betty Currie in \norder to corruptly influence her testimony. The President's \nconversation with Ms. Currie followed his telephone call to her, a call \nthat she testified was made later on a Saturday than any call she had \never received from the President at home. The conversation occurred on \na Sunday, when it was rare for Ms. Currie to come to the White House. \nThe conversation occurred in the Oval Office, where the President would \nexercise the full powers and trappings of his office in the presence of \na subordinate. The conversation addressed issues from the President's \ntestimony in the Jones case, despite the fact that at the end of his \ndeposition, the presiding judge ordered him not to discuss his \ntestimony with anyone. In that conversation, the President told Ms. \nCurrie statements that he knew to be false about his relationship with \nMs. Lewinsky, and that she also knew were false. Two or three days \nlater, that is, the day the President learned that the court had \npermitted Independent Counsel Starr to expand his inquiry into the \nLewinsky matter or the day after, the President repeated these same \nstatements to Ms. Currie.\n  The President's call to Ms. Currie followed rapidly upon his \ndeposition in the Jones case, its questions concerning Ms. Lewinsky, \nand his repeated answers to such questions by invoking Ms. Currie's \nname, one of which invited the Jones attorneys to ``ask Betty.'' In \nfact, Ms. Jones' lawyers placed Ms. Currie's name on their witness \nlist. The ``questions'' that he asked were leading, and even according \nto Ms. Currie, were more like statements than questions. He asked her \nto agree that he was never really alone with Ms. Lewinsky, even though \nthey both knew that he had been alone with her. He asked her to agree \nthat she was always there when Ms. Lewinsky was there, even though she \ncould not logically know whether Ms. Lewinsky had ever been there when \nMs. Currie was absent. He asked her to agree that Ms. Lewinsky came on \nto him and that he never touched her, even though Ms. Currie would have \nhad no ability to know those ``facts.'' He asked her to agree that she \nhad seen and heard everything, when that was also not the case. And he \nsuggested to her that Ms. Lewinsky wanted to have sex with him and that \nhe could not do that.\n  These statements constitute witness tampering. The President engaged \nin misleading conduct, through the use of false statements and \nomissions to mislead, toward Ms. Currie, with intent to influence her \ntestimony in a federal court proceeding. He acted corruptly, because he \nacted with the improper purpose of obtaining false testimony from a \nwitness who would corroborate the lies he issued in the Jones \ndeposition to obstruct that case. As stated above, witness tampering \nconvictions need not rest on the defendant's actually having deceived \nthe potential witness or any particular likelihood that the potential \nwitness would in fact ever be called upon to testify. United States v. \nGabriel, 125 F.3d 89, 102-03 (2d Cir. 1997).\n\n[[Page S1558]]\n\n  The White House arguments in response to these facts is inadequate. \nIt is inadequate as a matter of law for the White House to contend that \nthe President did not know that Ms. Currie was an ``actual or \ncontemplated witness,'' and is difficult to accept that proposition \nfactually. Nor as a matter of law is it ``critical,'' as the White \nHouse contends, that Ms. Currie testified that she felt no pressure to \nagree with the President. Witness tampering under \nSec. 1512 can be accomplished through ``misleading conduct,'' which \nincludes the making of false statements or intentional omissions that \nmake statements misleading. The White House counsel repeatedly argued \nthat threats are necessary for witness tampering, even after senatorial \nquestions demonstrated the White House's misstatements of the law. The \nWhite House also misstated the law of witness tampering by claiming \nthat there ``must be a known proceeding.'' In fact, the defendant need \nnot know that there is any pending federal proceeding to constitute \nwitness tampering. United States v. Kelley, 36 F.3d 1118, 1128 (D.C. \nCir. 1994). The White House contends that the President could not have \ntampered with Ms. Currie in the proceeding in which she was ultimately \na witness, the independent counsel's investigation, since the President \ncould not have known that it existed, at least as of January 18. But \nthe statute does not require that the defendant know of any pending or \neven contemplated proceedings so long as he engages in misleading \nconduct with respect to a potential witness. United States v. Romero, \n54 F.3d 56, 62 (2d Cir. 1995).\n  The White House's factual defense to this charge is also \ninsufficient. The President could not have made these false statements \nto Ms. Currie for the purpose of refreshing his recollection. Nor could \nhe have spoken with her for the purpose of seeking information for the \nsame reason. These claims also do not explain why he simply did not ask \nher the questions over the telephone on the night of the seventeenth, \nif that was his intention, or explain why he spoke with her a second \ntime.\n  The seventh item of Article II alleges that the President obstructed \njustice by relaying false and misleading statements to his aides. On \nJanuary 21, the President told his chief of staff and two deputies that \nhe had not had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. On January 23, \nhe told one of those deputy chiefs of staff, John Podesta, that he did \nnot engage in oral sex with Ms. Lewinsky. The President on January 21 \ntold his aide, Sidney Blumenthal, that Ms. Lewinsky had threatened him. \nPresident Clinton also indicated that Lewinsky was known among her \npeers as the stalker, and that she would say that she had an affair \nwith the President whether it was true or not, so that she would not be \nknown as the stalker any more. Blumenthal later testified that he \nbelieves the President lied to him. The President testified that he was \naware at the time that he made his statements that his aides might be \nsummoned before the grand jury. These facts constitute paradigmatic \nwitness tampering. The President knowingly engaged in misleading \nconduct, as defined in the statute, towards his aides, with intent to \ninfluence the testimony of those aides in an official proceeding.\n\n  Once again, the White House's arguments to the contrary are \nunavailing. The charge is not that the President lied to his friends, \nas the White House maintains, but that he lied to potential witnesses \nabout his conduct that the grand jury was investigating. It is not \nrelevant, as the White House contends, that the President did not \nattempt to influence his aides' own personal knowledge, only their \nknowledge of the President's views, nor, as stated above, is it \nrelevant as a matter of law that the President did not know that any of \nthese individuals would ultimately become witnesses. Most surprising \nwas the claim that Mr. White House Counsel Ruff raised for the first \ntime in closing argument that the President could not be convicted of \nobstructing justice with respect to his conversations with Mr. \nBlumenthal because the fact that the President claimed executive \nprivilege with respect to his conversation with Mr. Blumenthal meant \nthat he never expected the grand jury to hear about it. The President's \nconversation with Mr. Blumenthal was not subject to a legitimate claim \nof executive privilege for two independent reasons. First, it was not a \ndiscussion that related to the President's official duties. Second, it \nconstituted evidence of crime in and of itself. There was no \npossibility that any court would have ever upheld such a personally \nself-serving and frivolous misuse of executive privilege, and the \nPresident, as a former constitutional law professor during the time of \nWatergate fully understood that, as does Mr. Ruff. Indeed, Mr. \nBlumenthal was required to testify to the grand jury about this \nconversation notwithstanding the fact that the President did invoke an \nunwarranted executive privilege claim in an attempt to prevent its \ndisclosure. Nor is there evidence that the President intended to claim \nexecutive privilege at the time that he had his conversation with \nBlumenthal. In any case, there was no reason for the President to tell \nthis tale to Mr. Blumenthal except to disseminate it to his press \ncontacts and on any occasion when he might appear before the grand \njury.\n  Each and every allegation of obstruction of justice and witness \ntampering has thus been proven. The question then arises whether the \nconclusion that the President has broken the law in this respect \nwarrants his removal from office. Since all have been proven, I am far \nless concerned that the ``one or more'' language appears in this \narticle. It is appropriate to charge an omnibus article in which a \nseries of specific charges are leveled, a finding of guilt on each of \nwhich is required for conviction.\n  President Clinton has committed a pattern of acts of obstruction of \njustice. The record demonstrates that the President, when his \nmisconduct became relevant to a civil court proceeding in which he was \na defendant, used all the methods at his disposal, including his status \nas President, to obstruct these proceedings and to keep the truth from \nemerging, including:\n  coaching and encouraging a witness, another federal employee, Betty \nCurrie, to give false testimony;\n  facilitating and encouraging Monica Lewinsky to submit an affidavit \nthat he had reason to believe would be false;\n  through Vernon Jordan, securing employment for Monica Lewinsky in \norder to keep her from divulging to the court the true nature of their \nrelationship;\n  using government employees to transfer false information to the grand \njury;\n  allowing a false affidavit to be used to perpetrate a fraud on a \nfederal court;\n  after lying in a civil deposition, authorized a poll and made a cold, \ncalculated decision based on those poll results to continue his \nobstruction;\n  attempting to speak to Monica Lewinsky before she might testify \ntruthfully to the independent counsel about their relationship;\n  following his inability to contact Monica Lewinsky, telling \ndefamatory lies about her in order to discredit her with his aides and \nwith the public;\n  facilitating the hiding of evidence in a civil lawsuit;\n  providing false and misleading testimony in both a civil deposition \nand before a grand jury in order to protect his personal interests;\n  lying to the American people in order to cover up his own personal \nmisconduct;\n  still failing to acknowledge that he committed the above actions, \nwhile admitting only as little as he has been forced to by the \ndiscovery of definitive physical evidence.\n  For at least nine months and in some respects up until today, the \nPresident has done everything within his power to bring about a \nmiscarriage of justice in both a civil court proceeding and a criminal \ncourt proceeding. He took these actions for the sole purpose of \nprotecting himself personally, politically and legally. For those who \nemphasize the private nature of his original misconduct, I would ask if \nhe should be protected because he obstructed justice for such a low \npurpose? Time and again, and with premeditation, he was willing to use \ngovernment personnel to assist in his coverup and his lies, \nacknowledging part of the truth only when confronted with physical \nevidence. And he carried his lies and cover up right on into legal \nproceedings with the grace and ease of someone who regarded a court of \nlaw as deserving of no more respect than if he\n\n[[Page S1559]]\n\nwere dealing with a stranger on the street. It is this persistent \nrelentless, remorseless pattern of conduct that requires a verdict of \nguilty. He was willing to lie, defame, hide evidence and enlist anyone \nnecessary, including government employees over and over again. At every \njuncture when he had the opportunity to stop, relent or come clean with \na forgiving public, he chose instead to go forward. And even today he \nrefuses to acknowledge the damage he has done to the Presidency and the \nJudiciary, choosing instead to rely upon his high job approval rating \nand acknowledging only what he is forced to after the production of \nphysical evidence.\n  Consider what those who oppose impeachment say about his actions:\n  Senator Bumpers, one of the counsel for the President during his \ntrial, described the President's conduct as ``indefensible, outrageous, \nunforgivable, shameless.'' The New York Times editorialized that \n``President Clinton behaved reprehensibly, [and] betrayed his \nconstitutional duty to uphold the rule of law. . ..'' A censure \nresolution offered by members of his own party in the House, including \none of the strongest opponents of impeachment in the Judiciary \nCommittee, concluded that President Clinton ``egregiously failed in \n[]his obligation'' ``to set an example of high moral standards and \nconduct himself in a manner that fosters respect for the truth;'' \n``violated the trust of the American people, lessened their esteem for \nthe office of President, and dishonored the office which they have \nentrusted to him;'' ``made false statements concerning his \nreprehensible conduct with a subordinate;'' and ``wrongly took steps to \ndelay discovery of the truth.'' Respected members of the President's \nparty in this body expressed or shared the expression of the view that \nhis actions were ``disgraceful,'' that it was ``dismay[ing]'' to \nconsider ``the impact of his actions on our democracy and its moral \nfoundations,'' that it was ``immoral'' and ``harmful'' since ``the \nPresident's private conduct can and often does have profound public \nconsequences'' and ``compromised his moral authority,'' and they \ndescribed his deception as ``intentional and premeditated.''\n\n  So we castigate the President in the most bitter terms; decry his \ndisgraceful conduct and his damage to the institutions we hold most \ndear; disgrace him with the most condemnatory language at our command \nand yet refuse to even consider his removal from office? By such action \nwe treat the loss of public office as the worst fate imaginable, \nreserved for only the most treasonous of villains. Has public office \nbecome so precious in the United States that we treat it as a divine \nright? Actually, by such treatment we cheapen it.\n  At a time when all of our institutions are under assault, when the \nPresidency has been diminished and the Congress is viewed with \nscepticism, our Judiciary and our court system have remarkably \nmaintained the public's confidence. Now the President's actions are \nknown to every school child in America. And in the midst of these \npartisan battles, many people still think this matter is just ``lying \nabout sex.'' But little by little, there will be a growing appreciation \nthat it is about much more than that. And in years to come, in every \ncourt house in every town in America, juries, judges, and litigants \nwill have the President's actions as a bench mark against which to \nmeasure any attempted subversion of the judicial process. The notion \nthat anyone, no matter how powerless, can get equal justice will be \nseen by some as a farce. And our rule of law--the principle that many \nother countries still dream about--the principle that sets us apart, \nwill have been severely damaged. If this does not constitute damage to \nour government and our society, I cannot imagine what does. And for \nthat he should be convicted.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, I speak to the matter of \nprudence. Charles L. Black, Jr. begins his masterful account \nImpeachment: A Handbook with a warning: ``Everyone must shrink from \nthis most drastic of measures. . . . [t]his awful step.''\n  For it is just that. The drafters of the American Constitution had, \nfrom England and from Colonial government, fully formed models of what \na legislature should be, what a judiciary should do. But nowhere on \nearth was there a nation with an elected head of an executive branch of \ngovernment.\n  Here they turned to an understanding of governance which marks the \nAmerican Constitution as a signal event in human history--what the \nFramers called ``the new science of politics.'' What we might term the \nintellectual revolution of 1787. The victors in the Revolution could \nagree that no one, or not many, wanted another monarchy in line with \nthe long melancholy succession since Rome. Yet given what Madison \ntermed ``the fugitive and turbulent existence of . . . ancient \nrepublics,'' who could dare to suggest that a modern republic could \nhope for anything better?\n  Madison could. And why? Because study had produced new knowledge, \nwhich could now be put to use. This great new claim rested upon a new \nand aggressively more ``realistic'' idea of human nature. Ancient and \nmedieval thought and practice were said to have failed disastrously by \nclinging to illusions regarding how men ought to be. Instead, the new \nscience would take man as he actually is, would accept as primary in \nhis nature the self-interestedness and passion displayed by all men \neverywhere and, precisely on that basis, would work out decent \npolitical solutions.\n  This was a declaration of intellectual independence equal to anything \nasserted in 1776. Until then, with but few exceptions, the whole of \npolitical thought had turned on ways to inculcate virtue in a small \nclass that would govern. But, wrote Madison, ``If men were angels, no \ngovernment would be necessary.'' We would have to work with the \nmaterial at hand. Not pretty, but something more important: \npredictable. Thus, men could be relied upon to be selfish; nay, \nrapacious. Very well: ``Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.'' \nWhereupon we derive the central principle of the Constitution, the \nvarious devices which in Madison's formulation offset ``by opposite and \nrival interests, the defect of better motives.''\n  Impeachment was to be the device whereby the Congress might \ncounteract the ``defect of better motives'' in a President. But any \nsuch behavior needed to be massive and immediately threatening to the \nstate for impeachment ever to go forward. Otherwise a quadrennial \nelection would serve to restitute wrongs.\n  Further, they had a model for this process in the impeachment of \nWarren Hastings which had begun in April of 1786 with Edmund Burke \npresenting twenty-two ``Articles of Charge of High Crimes and \nMisdemeanors.'' The debate in the House of Commons continued into 1787 \nand was reported in the Pennsylvania Gazette.\n\n  Burke was hardly a stranger to the Americans at Philadelphia. He had \nchampioned the cause of the American colonies during the Revolution, \nand was now doing much the same as regards the governance of British \nIndia. He accused the Governor General of the highest crimes possible \nagainst, inter alia, the peoples of India.\n  At Philadelphia, the standard for impeachment was discussed only \nonce--on Saturday, September 8, 1787. At that point in the convention, \nthe draft of the clause in the Constitution pertaining to impeachment \nreferred only to ``treason and bribery.''\n  Here are Madison's notes of the debate that day:\n\n       The clause referring to the Senate, the trial of \n     impeachments against the President, for Treason & bribery, \n     was taken up.\n       Col. MASON. Why is the provision restrained to Treason & \n     bribery only? Treason as defined in the Constitution will not \n     reach many great and dangerous offences. Hastings is not \n     guilty of Treason. Attempts to subvert the Constitution may \n     not be Treason as above defined. As bills of attainder which \n     have saved the British Constitution are forbidden, it is the \n     more necessary to extend: the power of impeachments. He mov.d \n     to add after ``bribery'' ``or maladministration.'' Mr. GERRY \n     seconded him.\n       Mr. MADISON So vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure \n     during pleasure of the Senate.\n       Mr. GOV.r MORRIS, it will not be put in force & can do no \n     harm. An election of every four years will prevent \n     maladministration.\n       Col. MASON withdrew ``maladministration'' & substitutes \n     ``other high crimes & misdemeanors ag.st the State.''\n\n  The convention later replaced the word ``State'' with ``United \nStates.'' And on September 12, 1787, the Committee of Style--which had \nno authority to alter the substantive meaning of\n\n[[Page S1560]]\n\nthe text--deleted the words ``against the United States.''\n  Thus the Framers clearly intended that a President should be removed \nonly for offenses ``against the United States.'' It may also be \nconcluded that the addition of the words ``high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors'' was intended to extend the impeachment power of Congress \nso as to reach ``great and dangerous offences,'' in Mason's phrase.\n  The question now before the Senate is whether the acts that form the \nbasis for the Articles of Impeachment against President Clinton rise to \nthe level of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Which is to say, ``great \nand dangerous offences'' against the United States.\n  Over the course of 1998, as we proceeded through various revelations, \nthence to Impeachment and so on to this trial at the outset of 1999, I \nfound myself asking whether the assorted charges, even if proven, would \nrise to the standard of ``great and dangerous offences'' against the \nUnited States. More than one commentator observed that we were dealing \nwith ``low crimes.'' Matters that can be tried in criminal courts after \nthe President's term expires. Early in his address to the Senate our \ndistinguished former colleague Dale Bumpers made this point:\n\n       Colleagues, you have such an awesome responsibility. My \n     good friend, the senior Senator from New York, has said it \n     well. He says a decision to convict holds the potential for \n     destabilizing the Office of the Presidency.\n\n  The former Senator from Arkansas was referring to an article in The \nNew York Times on December 25th in which I said this:\n\n       We are an indispensable nation and we have to protect the \n     Presidency as an institution. You could very readily \n     destabilize the Presidency, move to a randomness. That's an \n     institution that has to be stable, not in dispute. Absent \n     that, do not doubt that you could degrade the Republic \n     quickly.\n\n  This could happen if the President were removed from office for less \nthan the ``great and dangerous offences'' contemplated by the Framers.\n  In Grand Inquests, his splendid and definitive history of the \nimpeachments of Justice Samuel Chase in 1804, and of President Andrew \nJohnson in 1868, Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist records how narrowly we \ntwice escaped from a precedent that would indeed have given us a \nPresidency (and a Court) subject to ``tenure during the pleasure of the \nSenate.''\n  It is startling how seductive this view can be. In 1804 it was the \nJeffersonians, including Jefferson himself, who saw impeachment as a \nconvenient device for getting rid of a Justice of the Supreme Court \nwith whose opinions they disagreed. Not many years later Radical \nRepublicans sought the same approach to removing a President with whom \nthey disagreed over policy matters.\n  It could happen again. Impeachment is a power singularly lacking any \nof the checks and balances on which the Framers depended. It is solely \na power of the Congress. Do not doubt that it could bring radical \ninstability to American government.\n  We are a blessed nation. But our blessings could be our ruin if we do \nnot see how rare they are. There are two nations on earth, the United \nStates and Britain, that both existed in 1800 and have not had their \nform of government changed by force since then. There are eight--I \nrepeat eight--nations which both existed in 1914 and have not had their \nform of government changed by violence since then: the United States, \nthe United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, \nSweden, and Switzerland.\n  Senators, do not take the imprudent risk that removing William \nJefferson Clinton for low crimes will not in the end jeopardize the \nConstitution itself. Censure him by all means. He will be gone in less \nthan two years. But do not let his misdeeds put in jeopardy the \nConstitution we are sworn to uphold and defend.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men \nare created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \nunalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit \nof happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted \namong men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the \ngoverned.''\n  Those words were a radical declaration when spoken in 1776. Never \nbefore had it been asserted that the purpose of government was to \nsecure the individual freedoms and liberties of its citizens. To the \ncontrary, previous governments existed for the opposite purpose; to \ncontrol the people and suppress their aspirations.\n  Eleven years after the Continental Congress approved these \nrevolutionary sentiments--and after a violent war which severed the \ncolonies' tie to King George III--many of the same individuals who had \ndeclared independence gathered again in Philadelphia to secure those \nrights so recently and tenuously won.\n  The governmental structure they constructed during those weeks in the \noppressive summer heat was far from simple. But its complexity wasn't \nan accident, or simply a result of the diverse geographical and \neconomic interests represented at the Constitutional Convention. As our \ncolleague Senator Patrick Moynihan has so aptly observed, our \ngovernment was the first to insert conflict as a conscious element, to \nachieve inefficiency by design.\n  Our nation's founders had personal knowledge of and experience with \nEnglish history, in which both Kings and Parliaments had at times \nexerted excessive power over the people. They realized that liberty \nwould be enhanced if political power was divided instead of \ncentralized.\n  Unlike other forms of democracy, where a no confidence vote of the \nnational legislature can bring down a government at any time, the \nFramers took great pains to establish a delicate balance of powers--and \na careful system of checks and balances--between the nation and the \nstates and among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of \nthe federal government. They created a structure in which every branch \nwould have the strength needed to keep excessive power from flowing \ninto the hands of any other branch and thus threatening the liberties \nof the people.\n  This determination to achieve balance is reflected in the discussion \nof impeachment and removal from office in Article I, Section 3 of the \nConstitution. By requiring action from both houses of Congress, and \nmandating a two-thirds Senate majority for removal, the Framers \npurposely made it difficult for Congress to undo the results of a \nproperly constituted Presidential election--one of the most disruptive \nacts imaginable in a democracy--and relieve a President of his or her \nconstitutional duties. The Framers wisely recognized that impeachment, \nwhen improvidently used, could create an overbearing Congress from the \nruins of a destabilized and delegitimized Presidency.\n\n  But the Framers' attention to balance was not limited to the \nprocedures of impeachment. They also made clear their belief that \nimpeachment and removal from office should only be an option in \nsituations in which a President becomes a threat to the government and \nthe people it serves. We see this in their small number of enumerated \noffenses--Treason, Bribery, other High Crimes and Misdemeanors--and in \ntheir commentary.\n  For example, at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, George Mason \nsaid that the term ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' referred to ``great \nand dangerous offenses'' and ``attempts to subvert the Constitution.''\n  Mr. Chief Justice, the President's self-indulgent actions were \nimmoral. Disgraceful. Reprehensible. History should--and, I suspect, \nwill--judge that William Jefferson Clinton dishonored himself and the \nhighest office in our American democracy.\n  But despite their disreputable nature, President Clinton's actions \nshould not result in his conviction and removal from office. After \ncareful objective study of each article presented by the House of \nRepresentatives, I have concluded that the charges against the \nPresident do not meet the high constitutional standards established by \nthe Framers. Removal of this President on the grounds established by \nthe House Managers would upset the delicate balance of powers so \nmeticulously established 212 years ago.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, the Framers set high standards for removal because \nthey understood that the office of the Presidency would be held by \nimperfect human beings. They assembled a government that could \nwithstand personal failings.\n\n[[Page S1561]]\n\n  We should be outraged that William Jefferson Clinton's personal \nfailings debased himself and his office. But they did not cause \npermanent injury to the proper functioning of our government. He did \nnot upset the constitutional balance of powers.\n  I hope that the Chief Justice, my colleagues, and the American people \nwill not misinterpret my comments. While it has not been proven that \nPresident William Jefferson Clinton committed the high crimes and \nmisdemeanors required for removal from office, he is not above the law. \nHis acquittal in this impeachment trial is not exoneration.\n  The framers made this clear in Article I of the Constitution. They \nestablished that an impeached President, even if convicted and removed \nfrom office, would still ``be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, \nJudgement, and Punishment, according to law.'' When this President \nleaves office, he could face sanction or conviction for his actions.\n\n  Mr. Chief Justice, during the questioning phase of this trial, I \nsought assurances from the President, through White House Counsel Mr. \nCharles Ruff, that he would not attempt to circumvent this judicial \nprocess by seeking a pardon for his actions. Counsel Ruff responded as \nfollows:\n\n       I have stated formally on behalf of the President in \n     response to a very specific question by the House Judiciary \n     Committee that he would not, and, indeed, we have said in \n     this Chamber, and we have said in other places, that the \n     President is subject to the rule of law like any other \n     citizen and would continue to be on January 21, 2001, and \n     that he would submit himself to whatever law and whatever \n     prosecution the law would impose on him. He is prepared to \n     defend himself in that forum at any time following the end of \n     his tenure. And I committed on his behalf, and I have no \n     doubt that he would so state himself, that he would not seek \n     or accept a pardon.\n\n  I take Counsel Mr. Charles Ruff at his words. Once the President \nleaves office, he will be subject to the same prosecutorial and \njudicial review that all Americans face.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, now that we are at the end of this divisive and \nunpleasant experience, what have we learned?\n  We have learned that the Constitution works. The Framers made it \nclear that the President should only be impeached and removed from \noffice in cases where he becomes a threat to the government and the \ngoverned. The President's acquittal will uphold the sanctity of the \noffice and prevent a weakening of the balance of powers that protects \nour individual rights and liberties.\n  We have reaffirmed the principle that no man is above the law. While \nI believe that the President is not guilty of high crimes and \nmisdemeanors in this court of impeachment, he will be subject to legal \nsanction in other forums when he becomes a private citizen.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, the President's misdeeds will affect his standing \nin history. But they do not justify the first removal of a President of \nthe United States from the office to which he was elected by the \nAmerican people. When my name is called on the roll, I will vote ``not \nguilty'' on both articles of impeachment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. As we all know, this impeachment trial has been a \ndifficult process for the Senate and for our nation.\n  As this trial draws to a close of each of us has the solemn duty of \nvoting our conscience according to the dictates of the Constitution. I \ndo not take this responsibility lightly.\n  For me, the vote in this trial will be the second most important of \nmy Congressional career. The only other vote to rank higher was my vote \nto authorize the Gulf War and thereby send American soldiers into \ncombat.\n  My ultimate goal as we moved into this process was to maintain \nprecedent and not shatter a very thoughtful process laid out in the \nConstitution and within Senate rules.\n  At the start of this Senate impeachment trial I took an oath to do \nimpartial justice according to the Constitution and laws. I worked hard \nto adhere to that oath, and I pray that I have kept that oath.\n  This is particularly important to me since much of my thinking in \nthis case centers on my conclusion that the President has violated his \noath of office.\n  I have determined to base my decision on the facts of the case, not \nthe polls, the performance of the economy, the President's popularity \nor where he is in his term of office.\n  Finally, I have felt that if any of the parts of an article \nconstitute grounds for impeachment, then an affirmative vote on the \narticle is warranted.\n  While the Senate is clearly divided on conviction and removal, one \nthing we have all learned is the importance of the Constitution.\n  We may be separated by political party or ideology, but we are united \nin our belief in the Constitution as the governing charter of our \nrepublic.\n  Presidents come and go, and Senators come and go. The Constitution \nremains. It is the foundation of our political system.\n  The Constitution is what preserves the rule of law, and guarantees \nthat we remain a nation of laws, not of men.\n  And, as we have all learned, in the impeachment and trial of a \nPresident, the Constitution is the document that directs how we shall \nproceed as members of the Congress.\n  Some have argued that this trial has divided America. In the short \nrun, yes. But in the long run, it has united us and made us stronger.\n  We are stronger because we have once again demonstrated that we \ndetermine who shall lead this nation by democratic means, not by force \nof arms.\n  During the past month, I have listened to the evidence and I have \nweighed it carefully. It is now time for me to cast my vote and to \nexplain my reasoning to my colleagues and to my constituents.\n  We have before us two articles of Impeachment. The first deals with \nperjury, the second with obstruction of justice.\n  The first article alleges that the President violated his \nConstitutional oath and his August 17, 1998 sworn oath to tell the \ntruth before a federal grand jury.\n  He did so by willfully providing perjurious, false and misleading \ntestimony in one or more of the following: (1) the nature and details \nof his relationship with a subordinate government employee; (2) prior \nperjurious, false and misleading testimony he gave in a Federal civil \nrights action brought against him; (3) prior false and misleading \nstatements he allowed his attorney to make to a Federal judge in that \ncivil rights action; and (4) his corrupt efforts to influence the \ntestimony of witnesses and to impede the discovery of evidence in that \ncivil rights action.\n  In my view the House managers demonstrated that at least three of the \nfour provisions are true. The physical evidence is there, and the \ntestimony supports that position.\n  I realize that with enough lawyers, one can certainly cloud things, \nand confuse and distract, but I believe the facts speak for themselves.\n  To me, once you cut through all the legal details and hours and hours \nof argument, this case is very clear. The President lied under oath. He \nlied not once, but repeatedly.\n  On this article, the only question for me is whether it rises to the \nlevel of an impeachable offense. I believe that it does. And this has \ncertainly been the prior view of the Senate since it has on several \noccasions convicted and removed Federal judges for perjury.\n  Most recently in 1989, when Federal District Judge Nixon was \nconvicted and removed from office for ``knowingly and contrary to his \noath mak[ing] a material false or misleading statement to a grand \njury.''\n  Here the judge's violation of the oath ``to tell the truth, the whole \ntruth, and nothing but the truth'' was deemed an impeachable offense. I \nsimply cannot justify a different standard for the President.\n  Some have argued that the standard for him should be lower because he \nis elected by the people, while federal judges are appointed by the \nPresident and confirmed by the U.S. Senate to serve for life. While I \nrespect those who hold this view, I cannot agree with it.\n  I hold the President to a higher standard because he is the chief law \nenforcement official of the nation. If he is above the law, then we \nhave a double standard; one for the powerful, and one for the rest.\n  Now let me address the second article. The charge is that the \nPresident violated his Constitutional oath in that he prevented, \nobstructed, and impeded the administration of justice.\n\n[[Page S1562]]\n\n  Obstruction of justice is clearly an impeachable offense. History and \nprior practice support this view, and it seems that many members of \nthis body agree that obstruction does warrant removal from office.\n  The question then is whether the House managers have demonstrated \nobstruction of justice. I believe that they have.\n  When we review the witness depositions of Monica Lewinsky, Vernon \nJordan, and Sidney Blumenthal, we compare those with the depositions of \nthe President, and when we review all the evidence gathered and \npresented by the House managers, and by the independent counsel and the \ngrand jury, there are at least four areas of obstruction by the \nPresident.\n  These relate to the encouraging of a false affidavit, the concealment \nof gifts, the assistance in employment, and the attempt to refresh the \nmemory of his Secretary Betty Currie which done a second time several \ndays later is pure and simple trying to influence her testimony.\n  While we may never know with absolute certainty what occurred, the \nevidence is overwhelming that the President took numerous actions \ndesigned to impede the administration of justice.\n  I am also of the view that if the President committed perjury, then \nhe obstructed justice. Perjury is a form of obstruction of justice.\n  I will therefore vote for conviction on both articles. I don't \nbelieve I will be voting to undo an election. We have a process of \nsuccession to the Presidency which maintains control in the Vice \nPresident of the same party with the same agenda.\n  Let me now explain why I feel conviction is so important in this \ncase. It has to do with the roll of the oath in our society. This is \nwhy the President's removal is necessary to protect the republic.\n  When I was sworn in as a United States Senator I took the following \noath to uphold the Constitution as did each one of you:\n\n       I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the \n     Constitution of the United States against all enemies, \n     foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and \n     allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, \n     without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and \n     that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the \n     office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.\n\n  I took the same oath on three occasions when I served in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. The President takes a similar oath when he \nenters office:\n\n       I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the \n     Office of President of the United States, and will to the \n     best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the \n     Constitution of the United States.\n\n  Both of these oaths are required by the Constitution.\n  Article VI of the Constitution requires that all Senators, \nRepresentatives, Members of the State Legislatures, and all executive \nand judicial Officers of the United States and the States shall be \nbound by oath or affirmation to support the Constitution. The oath of \noffice lies at the center of this impeachment debate.\n  As George Washington stated in his Second Inaugural Address on March \n4, 1793:\n\n       Previous to the execution of any official act of the \n     President the Constitution requires an oath of office. This \n     oath I am now about to take, and in your presence: That if it \n     shall be found during my administration of the Government I \n     have in any instance violated willingly or knowingly the \n     injunctions thereof, I may (besides incurring constitutional \n     punishment) be subject to the upbraidings of all who are now \n     witnesses of the present solemn ceremony.\n\n  The sworn oath is central not only to our Constitution, but also to \nthe administration of justice. Our legal system would not function \nwithout it.\n  Witnesses in trials swear under oath to ``tell the truth, the whole \ntruth, and nothing but the truth.''\n  Similarly, parties in civil lawsuits answer written questions or \n``interrogatories'' put to them by their opponents. All answers are \ngiven under penalty of perjury. The answering party must sign a \nstatement attesting to the truthfulness of the answers.\n  Testimony before a federal grand jury is given under oath, with the \nwitness swearing to ``tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but \nthe truth.'' And the citizens who sit on a grand jury take an oath to \nseek the truth.\n  The Federal Rules of Evidence make reference to the importance of the \noath in our judicial system.\n  Rule 603 states that the oath is ``calculated to awaken the witness' \nconscience and impress the witness' mind with the duty'' to tell the \ntruth.\n  The Supreme Court has commented in a number of cases on the question \nof perjury. In the 1975 case of United States v. Mandujano the Court \nopinion noted:\n\n       In this constitutional process of securing a witness' \n     testimony, perjury simply has no place whatever. Perjured \n     testimony is an obvious and flagrant affront to the basic \n     concepts of judicial proceedings. Effective restraints \n     against this type of egregious offense are therefore \n     imperative.\n\n  In the much earlier 1937 case of United States v. Norris the Court \nobserved:\n\n       There is occasional misunderstanding to the effect that \n     perjury is somehow distinct from ``obstruction of justice.'' \n     While the crimes are distinct, they are in fact variations on \n     a single theme: preventing a court, the parties, and the \n     public from discovering the truth. Perjury, subornation of \n     perjury, concealment of subpoenaed documents, and witness \n     tampering are all forms of obstruction of justice.\n\n  As the House prosecutors have argued, the principle of ``Equal \nJustice Under Law'' is at the very heart of our legal system.\n  In order to survive it requires not only an impartial judiciary and \nan ethical bar, but also a sacred oath. Without the sanctity of the \noath, ``Equal Justice Under Law'' cannot be guaranteed.\n  In addition to our legal system, other sectors of our society rely on \noaths to ensure truthfulness and uphold values.\n  At a very early age we frequently ask our young people to take an \noath: The Boy Scout Oath is as follows:\n\n     On my honor I will do my best\n     To do my duty to God and my country\n     and to obey the Scout Law;\n     To help other people at all times;\n     To keep myself physically strong,\n     mentally awake, and morally straight.\n\n  And the Girl Scout Promise:\n\n     On my honor, I will try:\n     To serve God and my country,\n     To help people at all times,\n     And to live by the Girl Scout Law.\n\n  Members of our armed forces take the following oath of enlistment:\n\n       I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the \n     Constitution of the United States against all enemies, \n     foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and \n     allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of \n     the President of the United States and the orders of the \n     officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the \n     Code of Military Justice. So help me God.\n\n  Police officers, local officials and members of many civic \norganizations take an oath.\n  What is the purpose of an oath, and why do we rely on an oath in so \nmany sectors of our society?\n  The oath in legal proceedings is designed to ensure truthfulness.\n  The oath taken by public officials and the military is designed to \nuphold the Constitution and preserve the rule of law.\n  The oath taken by scouts and members of civil organizations is \ndesigned to encourage values and good citizenship.\n  A violation of these oaths is taken seriously, and is often punished \nunder the law. Why? To protect the organization, to protect the \ngovernment, to protect the republic.\n  The President's oath is the most important oath any person takes in \nour Constitutional system, If that oath can be ignored it will set a \nvery damaging precedent for our society.\n  Throughout this impeachment process there have been many proposals \nconcerning the best means of resolution.\n  At each turn however, Members of the Congress have ultimately \nrecognized that the appropriate path to take is the path laid out in \nthe Constitution. That path was a full trial in the U.S. Senate.\n  I am proud to have been among those who argued for a trial.\n  Whatever the outcome, I will leave this process confident that the \nsystem has worked. While I may disagree with the final vote, I will \nrespect that vote and I will urge that we move forward united and \ndetermined to do the people's business.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, as the senior Senator from \nKentucky, it is my distinct privilege today to rise and speak at the \ndesk formerly occupied by one of the greatest Senators in\n\n[[Page S1563]]\n\nthe history of our country and the greatest Senator from the \ncommonwealth of Kentucky: Henry Clay.\n  Henry Clay is best remembered for two things: (1) the Compromise of \n1850, and (2) a famous statement he made after being told that \nadvocating the Compromise of 1850 would doom his chances for the \npresidency. At that critical moment Clay replied: ``I had rather be \nright than be President.''\n  In many respects, William Jefferson Clinton had a similar choice over \nthe past several months. He could do the right thing. Or he could cling \nto his Presidency--regardless of the costs and regardless of the \nconsequences. Consequences to his family, to his friends, to his aides, \nto his Cabinet, and, most importantly, to his country.\n  Time after time, the President came to a fork in the road. Time after \ntime, he had the opportunity to choose the noble and honorable path. \nTime after time, he chose the path of lies and lawlessness--for the \nsimple reason that he did not want to endanger his hold on public \noffice.\n  Nowhere is the President's cold, calculated choice more clear than in \nthe private conversation he had with his confidant and long-time \nadvisor, Dick Morris, just after he raised his right hand to God and \ntestified under oath in a civil rights lawsuit that he had not had any \nsexual relations with a young intern named Monica Lewinsky.\n  After that critical denial, the President did what he does best: he \nput his finger to the wind to determine which path he should take. He \nasked Mr. Morris to conduct a poll to determine whether the American \npeople would forgive him for adultery, for perjury, and for obstruction \nof justice. Morris came back with bad news.\n  The public, in Morris's words was ``just not ready for it.'' They \nwould forgive him for adultery, but not for perjury and obstruction of \njustice.\n  The President then faced a fundamental choice. He could tell the \ntruth--and admit that he perjured himself in the Jones suit. Or he \ncould cling to public office--and deny, delay and obstruct.\n  The choice for President Clinton was clear. He told Morris: ``Well, \nwe just have to win.''\n  And, thus the course was charted. The President would seek to win at \nany cost. If it meant lying to the American people. If it meant lying \nto his Cabinet. If it meant lying to a federal grand jury. If it meant \ntampering with witnesses and obstructing justice. If it meant falsely \nbranding a young woman with the scarlet labels of liar and ``stalker.'' \nThe name of the game was winning. Winning at any cost.\n\n  Based on the evidence before the Senate, I want to walk you down the \nroad that Bill Clinton has traveled these past several months. That \ntwisted, tortured road that he has forced the American people and their \ngovernment to plod along--for what seems to many of us like an \neternity.\n\n\n       Crossroads #1: An Illicit Relationship with a Young Intern\n\n  The first fork in the President's road came on November 15, 1995, \nwhen he met a young, White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. He could \nbe her President. He could be her boss. He could even be her friend. \nOr, he could choose to be in a relationship with her that was clearly \ninappropriate.\n  The President chose the wrong path. As we heard Ms. Lewinsky testify, \non the day of their first meeting, which also happened to be the day of \ntheir first sexual encounter, President Clinton looked at Ms. \nLewinsky's intern pass, tugged on it and said, ``This is going to be a \nproblem.''\n  But the President persisted down that problematic path. He had \napproximately 10 more sexual encounters with Ms. Lewinsky over the next \n21 months.\n  It is important, however, to note that had the President stopped \nthere, we would not be here. At that point, the President's defenders \ncould have credibly argued, ``it's a private matter; it's just about \nsex.''\n  But, Bill Clinton didn't stop there.\n\n\n            Crossroads #2: A Job and an Affidavit and Gifts\n\n  In December of 1997, the President came to another fork. At that \ntime, he learned the following critical facts:\n  1. Ms. Lewinsky had been placed on the witness list in the Jones \ncase;\n  2. Judge Susan Webber Wright had ordered the President to provide \ninformation concerning any government employee with whom he had engaged \nin sexual activity; and\n  3. Ms. Lewinsky had been served with a subpoena and ordered to \nproduce any gifts she had received from the President.\n  At this point, the President had a choice. He could tell Ms. Lewinsky \nto obey the law, tell the truth, and turn over the gifts. Or, he could \nnot.\n  Again, President Clinton chose the path of lies and deceit. Let's \nagain, hear this account from Ms. Lewinsky:\n\n       ``[I]t wasn't as if the President called me and said, ``You \n     know, Monica, you're on the witness list, this is going to be \n     really hard for us, we're going to have to tell the truth . . \n     . And by him not calling me and saying that, you know, I knew \n     what that meant. . . .\n       [A]s we had on every other occasion and every other \n     instance of this relationship, we would deny it.''\n\n  The evidence indicates that the President was not interested in the \ntruth, but rather, was only interested in getting Ms. Lewinsky to sign \na false affidavit and getting her a job in New York where, from the \nPresident's way of thinking, she was less apt to be contacted by the \nJones lawyers.\n  I must say that I am baffled at how the President of the United \nStates--the leader of the free world--was intimately involved in both \nof these efforts. The evidence indisputably establishes that the \nPresident worked with his close friend Vernon Jordan to secure: (1) a \njob offer for Ms. Lewinsky in New York, and (2) a lawyer for Ms. \nLewinsky to prepare and file her false affidavit. As Mr. Jordan's \ntestimony made clear, his efforts on behalf of Ms. Lewinsky were at the \nbehest of the President.\n  The evidence also indicates that during this same time period the \nPresident participated in a scheme to conceal gifts in the Jones civil \nrights suit. Ms. Lewinsky's testimony is clear that she met with the \nPresident on December 28 and suggested to him that she could ``put away \nor maybe give to Betty or give to someone the gifts[.]'' Ms. Lewinsky \nfurther testified that later that same day the President's loyal \nsecretary, Betty Currie, initiated a call to her to pick up the gifts. \nI find Ms. Lewinsky's testimony to be credible. Moreover, it is \ncorroborated by Ms. Currie's cell phone record.\n  And, of course, the President didn't stop there.\n\n\n       Crossroads #3: False Statements in a Civil Rights Lawsuit\n\n  The President came to another fork in the road where he had to decide \nwhether to testify truthfully under oath regarding his relationship \nwith Ms. Lewinsky. And, again, the President chose the path of lies and \ndeceit.\n  He walked into the deposition room, raised his right hand, swore to \ntell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and then \nproceeded to give false statements. In a civil case about alleged \nsexual misconduct with a subordinate government employee, the President \ntestified under oath that he never had a ``sexual relationship'', a \n``sexual affair'' or ``sexual relations'' with a subordinate government \nemployee named Monica Lewinsky.\n  But, again, as egregious as those actions were, had the President \nstopped there, we still might not be here.\n\n\n            Crossroads #4: Tampering with a Loyal Secretary\n\n  The stakes for President Clinton continued to go higher and higher. \nFollowing his deposition, the President had to decide what to do with \nhis loyal secretary, Ms. Betty Currie. And, again, the undisputed \nevidence shows that the President took the path of lies and deceit.\n  Contrary to federal obstruction of justice laws and contrary to Judge \nWright's Protective Order instructing President Clinton ``not to say \nanything whatsoever about the questions . . . asked, the substance of \nthe deposition, . . ., [or] any details . . . ,'' President Clinton \nleft the deposition, went back to the White House, and called Ms. \nCurrie at home to ask her to come to the White House the next day--\nwhich, I might add, was a Sunday.\n  At that somewhat surreal Sunday afternoon meeting, the President--in \nviolation of Judge Wright's Protective Order--told Ms. Currie that he \nhad been asked several questions about Monica Lewinsky at his \ndeposition. Then the President--in violation of the federal obstruction \nof justice law--fired off a string of fundamentally declarative \nstatements to his secretary.\n\n\n[[Page S1564]]\n\n\n       ``You were always there when she was there, right? We were \n     never really alone.\n       You could see and hear everything.\n       Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?\n       She wanted to have sex with me and I couldn't do that.''\n\n  And, of course, the President didn't stop there. According to Ms. \nCurrie, the President again called her into the Oval Office a few days \nlater, and again, repeated the same false statements to her that he had \nmade under oath in his civil deposition.\n\n\nCrossroads #5: False Statements to Senior Officials and to the American \n                                 People\n\n  The winding road continued its perilous twists and turns. The \nPresident next came to a point where he had to decide whether to tell \nthe truth to his Cabinet, his top aides, and, most importantly, to the \nAmerican people.\n  Again, the President rejected the right path, telling his Cabinet and \nstaff that the allegations were untrue. He claimed to his then-Deputy \nChief of Staff, John Podesta, for example, that he ``never had sex with \n[Ms. Lewinsky] in any way whatsoever.'' Specifically, he told Podesta \nthat ``they had not had oral sex.'' And, the President admits in his \ngrand jury testimony that he knew that his aides could be called to \ntestify before the grand jury. Ultimately, his top aides were called to \ntestify, and they repeated his lies.\n  And, as everyone in America knows, the President lied to the nation. \nI do not need to recite the defiant, indignant, finger-wagging denial \nthat the President gave to 270 million Americans who had placed their \ntrust in him as the chief law enforcement officer of this land.\n  But, it didn't have to go any further. I think that there's still a \nchance that had the President stopped there at that awful, disgraceful \nmoment, we would not be here, today.\n\n\n           Crossroads #6: False Statements to the Grand Jury\n\n  On August 17, 1998, the President came to the most important \ncrossroads. He stood before a federal criminal grand jury--a federal \ncriminal grand jury that was trying to determine whether he had \ncommitted perjury and obstructed justice. He had one last chance to do \nthe right thing. He could tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing \nbut the truth to the grand jury. Or, he could commit perjury.\n  Again, President Clinton chose the wrong path. During that criminal \nprobe, the President admitted to an ``inappropriate'' relationship with \nMs. Lewinsky, but continued to falsely deny ever having sexual \nrelations with her, in the face of corroborating evidence that included \nan undisputed DNA test and the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky and two of her \ntherapists.\n  The President's strained, persistent, and--in the words of his own \nlawyer--``maddening'' denials of the obvious were blatantly and \npatently false.\n  The President also declared under oath to the grand jury that his \npost-deposition coaching of Betty Currie about his relationship with \nMonica Lewinsky was a mere attempt to refresh his ``memory about what \nthe facts were.'' This statement is also blatantly and patently false.\n  In fact, there is no reasonable interpretation that would make the \nPresident's statements about coaching Ms. Currie to be true. Ms. Currie \nwas not always there. She could not always see and hear everything. She \ncould not know whether the President ever touched Ms. Lewinsky. And, \nshe did not know whether Ms. Lewinsky ever had sex with the President. \nIt is difficult to comprehend how the President could be refreshing his \nown memory through the act of making false statements to a potential \nwitness.\n  Moreover, it is my opinion that these false statements by the \nPresident under oath were clearly material. A false and misleading \ndenial of a sexual relationship with a subordinate government employee \nand a false and misleading denial of tampering with a potential witness \ngoes to the very heart of whether the President obstructed justice or \ncommitted perjury.\n  Based on the evidence in the record, I am firmly convinced that the \nPresident has committed both perjury and obstruction of justice. He \nlied to the grand jury about the nature of his relationship with Ms. \nLewinsky. He lied to the grand jury about coaching his loyal secretary, \nBetty Currie. He obstructed justice by encouraging Ms. Lewinsky to give \nfalse testimony, by participating in a scheme to conceal gifts that \nwere subpoenaed, by tampering with his secretary on two occasions, and \nby lying to top aides that he knew could be called to testify before \nthe grand jury.\n\n\n                      High Crimes and Misdemeanors\n\n  The Senate's inquiry, however, does not end there. We must decide \nwhether perjury and obstruction of justice are high crimes and \nmisdemeanors. Based on the Constitution, the law, and the clear Senate \nprecedent, I conclude that these offenses are high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.\n\n\n                            Senate Precedent\n\n  First, Senate precedent establishes that false statements under oath \nby a public official are high crimes and misdemeanors. In 1986, I sat \non the impeachment committee that heard the evidence against Judge \nHarry Claiborne. After hearing the evidence, I, along with an \noverwhelming number of my colleagues, concluded that Judge Claiborne \nhad made false statements under the pains and penalties of perjury by \nfailing to disclose certain amounts of income on his tax forms. The \nSenate--understanding the gravity of a public official making false \nstatements under oath--voted to remove Judge Claiborne from office.\n  In 1989, the Senate held impeachment trials against Judge Hastings \nand Judge Nixon--both of whom had been accused of making false \nstatements under oath. In Judge Nixon's case, the false statements were \nmade directly to a criminal grand jury. The Senate--again understanding \nthe gravity of a public official, who has sworn to uphold the laws, \nviolating those very laws by lying under oath--voted to remove Judge \nHastings and Judge Nixon from office.\n  My colleagues on both sides of the aisle had no hesitation about \nremoving these federal officials for making false statements under \noath. As Senator Herb Kohl explained:\n\n       ``One might argue, as Judge Nixon does, that his false \n     statements were not material. . . . But Judge Nixon took an \n     oath to tell the truth and the whole truth. As a grand jury \n     witness, it was not for him to decide what would be material. \n     That was for the grand jury to decide. . . .\n       So I am going to vote `guilty' on articles I and II. Judge \n     Nixon lied to the grand jury. He misled the grand jury. These \n     acts are criminal and warrant impeachment.''\n\n  I think Senator Kohl's statements accurately reflect the sentiment of \nthe 89 Senators who voted to convict Judge Nixon for lying to a federal \ngrand jury. And, I might add, one of those senators voting to remove \nJudge Nixon for perjury was then-Senator, now-Vice President Al Gore.\n  Of those 89 Senators, 48 of us are still here in this distinguished \nbody. Will we send the same message about the corrosive impact of \nperjury on our legal system or will we simply lower our standards for \nthe nation's chief law enforcement officer?\n     Constitution and Federal Law\n  Second, Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution plainly sets forth \nthat bribery is a high crime and misdemeanor, and our federal laws tell \nus clearly that perjury and obstruction of justice are equivalent \noffenses to bribery. In fact, the federal sentencing guidelines \nactually mandate a harsher punishment for perjury than for bribery and \na harsher punishment for obstruction of justice than for bribery. So, I \nam completely and utterly perplexed by those who argue that perjury and \nobstruction of justice are not high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\n  If federal law mandates a harsher penalty for perjury and obstruction \nof justice, how can this Senate--who drafted, debated, and passed those \nfederal laws--now argue that perjury and obstruction of justice are \nlesser offenses than bribery?\n  Listen to the Supreme Court's declaration: ``[f]alse testimony in a \nformal proceeding is intolerable.'' ABF Freight System v. NLRB, 510 \nU.S. 317, 323 (1994). Moreover, the high Court has labeled perjury as \nan ``egregious offense,'' United States v. Mandujano, 425 U.S. 564, 576 \n(1976), calling it ``an obvious and flagrant affront to the basic \nconcepts of judicial proceedings.'' Id.\n  Even the President's own Justice Department understands that our \nnation of laws cannot tolerate perjury and obstruction of justice. \nPresident Clinton and his Justice Department have prosecuted \napproximately 600 cases of perjury since he came to office. And\n\n[[Page S1565]]\n\ntoday--as we debate whether perjury is a serious offense--over 100 \npeople are locked behind bars in federal prison for committing the \ncriminal act of perjury.\n  Perjury and obstruction hammer away at the twin pillars of our legal \nsystem: truth and justice. Every witness in every deposition is \nrequired to raise his or her right hand and swear to tell the truth, \nthe whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. Every \nwitness in every grand jury proceeding and in every trial is required \nto raise his or her right hand and swear to tell the truth. Every \nofficial declaration filed with the court is stamped with the express \naffirmation that the declaration is true. In the words of our nation's \nfirst Supreme Court Chief Justice, John Jay: ``if oaths should cease to \nbe held sacred, our dearest and most valuable rights would become \ninsecure.''\n  The facts clearly show that the President did not value the sacred \noath. He was interested in saving his hide, not truth and justice. I \nsubmit to my colleagues that if we have no truth and we have no \njustice, then we have no nation of laws. No public official, no \npresident, no man or no woman is important enough to sacrifice the \nfounding principles of our legal system.\n  On this point, I am proud to quote Justice Louis Brandeis--a native \nof my hometown of Louisville and the man for whom the University of \nLouisville Law school is named:\n\n       ``In a government of laws, existence of the government will \n     be imperiled if it fails to observe the laws scrupulously. \n     Our government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For \n     good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. \n     Crime is contagious. If the government becomes a lawbreaker; \n     it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a \n     law unto himself; it invites anarchy.''\n\n  William Jefferson Clinton is not and should not be a law unto \nhimself.\n\n\n                Crossroads for the United States Senate\n\n  President Clinton's decisions have led the United States Senate to \nits own critical crossroads. And, now we must choose our path.\n  We can do the right thing. Or we can lower our standards and allow \nBill Clinton to cling to public office--regardless of the consequences \nto our nation, to our system of justice, and to our future generations.\n  More than 150 years ago, Alexis de Tocqueville wisely observed that \n``man rarely retains his customary level in very critical \ncircumstances; he rises above or sinks below his usual condition, and \nthe same thing is true of nations.''\n  So what will we do this day? Will we rise above or will we sink \nbelow? Will we condone this President's conduct or will we condemn it? \nWill we change our standards or will we change our President?\n\n\n                  An Earlier Crossroads for the Senate\n\n  As most of you will recall, the Senate faced a similar choice just a \nfew short years ago. It was one of our own who had clearly crossed the \nline. It was one of our own who had engaged in sexual misconduct and \nobstruction of justice.\n  He, like President Clinton, was an intelligent and accomplished man. \nSenator Carol Moseley-Braun called him ``brilliant'' and said he was a \nman who ``ha[d] certainly been fair.'' But, that brilliant and fair man \nhad crossed the line.\n  At that critical moment in Senate history, we could have taken the \nwrong path and called it a private matter, saying ``it's just about \nsex.'' But, my friend, Senator Dianne Feinstein was right when she \nsaid: ``This is not private, personal conduct. This is conduct that \ntook place in public service, and many of the people involved are \nthemselves Federal employees.''\n  At that moment, the Senate could have said, ``He lied about his \nconduct to everybody, so lying in an official proceeding is ok.'' Or, \nwe could have said, ``He was covering it up before the investigation, \nso it's irrelevant and immaterial that he's covering it up during the \ninvestigation.''\n  The Senate could have said, ``We can't overturn a federal election. \nAfter all, he'll be out of office in a few years.'' Or: ``He may be \nprosecuted in the courts, so there's no reason for us to act.''\n  And, finally, the United States Senate could have defended its own \nmember by arguing that, ``A United States Senator should be held to a \nlower standard than others, not a higher standard. After all, there are \nonly 100 U.S. Senators in the country. Any one of them is just too \nprecious to lose.''\n  But, we didn't say any of those things. Those doubletalking defenses \nwere reserved exclusively for President Clinton.\n  During the Packwood debate, we made the tough choice. And, I have to \nsay, that decision was one of the most difficult things I have ever had \nto do in my career in public service. To recommend expelling from the \nUnited States Senate a colleague, a member of my own party, and most \nimportantly, a friend with whom I had served in the Senate for over a \ndecade.\n  We sent a clear message to the nation that no man is above the law. \nThat no man is so important to the well-being of our strong and \nprosperous nation that we have to compromise the fundamental, founding \nprinciples of truth and justice. We chose to rise above, not sink \nbelow. Rather than change our standards, we changed our Senator.\n  Let me also make a political point, here. We Republicans were aware \nduring the Packwood debate that we would likely lose that Senate seat \nif Senator Packwood was removed from office. So, we had a choice: \nRetain the Senate seat or retain our honor. We chose honor, and never \nlooked back.\n  I think that the United States Senate has a clear choice today. Do we \nwant to retain President Clinton in office, or do we want to retain our \nhonor, our principle, and our moral authority?\n  For me, and for many members in my impeachment-fatigued party, I \nchoose honor.\n\n\n                             Losing Balance\n\n  I want to close my remarks today with an insightful and fascinating \nstatement from Richard Nixon. A few years after his tragic downfall, \nPresident Nixon explained:\n\n       It's a piece of cake until you get to the top. You find you \n     can't stop playing the game the way you've always played it. \n     So you are lean and mean and resourceful, and you continue to \n     walk on the edge of the precipice, because over the years, \n     you have become fascinated by how closely you can walk \n     without losing your balance.\n\n  Ladies and gentleman of this fine and distinguished body, I submit to \nyou that William Jefferson Clinton has lost his balance. He has lost \nhis sense of right and wrong. Of truth and justice. And, by doing so, \nhe has--to paraphrase Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 65--abused \nand violated the trust of the American people.\n  Again, let me quote my esteemed colleague, Senator Dianne Feinstein, \nwho said just a few months ago: ``my trust in his credibility has been \nbadly shattered.''\n  Senator Feinstein is not an island on this issue of shattered trust. \nThere are many others who have expressed similar sentiments. A recent \npoll confirms what we all know, that is, the American people do not \ntrust their Commander-in-Chief. A majority of Americans believe \nthat President Clinton has lied to the country and that he will lie to \nthe country again.\n\n  The New York Times, which I rarely ever quote, had this to say about \nthe President's violation of the public trust:\n\n       ``The American President is a person who sometimes must ask \n     people in the ranks to die for the country. The President is \n     a person who asks people close around him to serve the \n     government for less money than their talents would bring \n     elsewhere. The President sometimes requires that people out \n     in the country sacrifice their dollars or their convenience \n     for national goals. All he is asked to provide in return is \n     trustworthiness, loyalty and judgment. . . . President \n     Clinton has failed that simple test abjectly, not merely with \n     undignified private behavior in a revered place, but with his \n     cavalier response to public concern.''\n\n  In 1829, at his home in Lexington, Kentucky, Henry Clay opined that \n``[g]overnment is a trust, and the officers of the government are \ntrustees[.]'' I believe that fundamental principle to be true, and I \nbelieve that William Jefferson Clinton has abused and violated that \npublic trust.\n  His cold, calculated actions betrayed the trust vested in him by the \nAmerican people and the high office of the presidency. The President of \nthe United States looked 270 million Americans in the eye, and lied--\ndeliberately and methodically. He took an oath to faithfully execute \nthe laws of this nation, and he violated that oath. He\n\n[[Page S1566]]\n\npledged to be the nation's chief law enforcement officer, and he \nviolated that pledge. He took an oath to tell the truth, the whole \ntruth, and nothing but the truth, and he willfully and repeatedly \nviolated that oath.\n  I firmly believe that the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable \ndoubt that William Jefferson Clinton made statements to the federal \ngrand jury regarding the nature of his relationship with a subordinate \ngovernment employee and the purpose of his post-deposition conversation \nwith a loyal secretary that were false, misleading, and perjurious, and \nwarrant removal from office. Thus, I find the President guilty under \nArticle I.\n  I believe with equal conviction that the evidence establishes beyond \na reasonable doubt that William Jefferson Clinton willfully engaged in \na deliberate course of conduct designed to delay, impede, cover up, and \nconceal the existence of evidence and testimony relating to a Federal \ncivil rights action against him, and that this conduct warrants removal \nfrom office. Thus, I find the President guilty under Article II.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Every four years, citizens of our country exercise one \nof the most important rights of our democracy--the right to vote for \nthe President of the United States. This constitutional privilege is \nvalued by all Americans and envied by millions around the world. It \nproves that the will of the majority will prevail, and that power will \nbe transferred peacefully through the election process from one \nPresident to the next, time and again.\n  The essence of our democracy is the power of the right to vote. Many \nof our greatest battles in the Senate and the country in recent decades \nhave been waged to extend and protect that right.\n  I think especially of the Voting Rights Acts, which have been at the \nheart of our civil rights debates. I think of our success in 1970 in \nlowering the voting age to 18, so that young Americans who were old \nenough to fight in the Vietnam War would be old enough to vote about \nthat war, which America never should have fought. I think of the \nSupreme Court's great decision on one person, one vote, and our efforts \nin Congress to protect it.\n  I also think of the success of democracy in other lands--in Chile and \nArgentina and other nations in our hemisphere--and in Greece, in South \nAfrica, and in many other countries.\n  The Framers of the Constitution clearly understood the fundamental \nplace of the right to vote in the new democracy they were creating. \nThey clearly did not intend the Impeachment Clause to nullify the vote \nof the people, except in the most extraordinary cases of great danger \nto the nation.\n  The entire history of the debates at the Constitutional Convention \ndemonstrates their clear intent to limit impeachment as narrowly as \npossible, to prevent a willful partisan majority in Congress from \nundermining the right to vote and the power of the President the people \nhad elected.\n  The Framers of the Constitution also made clear that the President \nwas not to be subordinate to the Senate or the House of \nRepresentatives. The new government they created was based on another \nfundamental principle as well--the principle of separation of powers \namong the three coequal branches of government--the Executive Branch, \nthe Legislative Branch, and the Judicial Branch. They specifically did \nnot create a parliamentary system of government, in which the President \nwould serve at the pleasure of Congress.\n  In their wisdom, the Framers recognized that in certain extreme \ncases, a narrow exception to the orderly transfer of Presidential power \nthrough national elections every four years was necessary to protect \nthe nation from an abusive President. And so they created the \nimpeachment process, by which the President could be removed from \noffice by the Senate and the House of Representatives in extreme cases \nwhere the President had committed ``Treason, Bribery, or other high \nCrimes and Misdemeanors''.\n  The Framers of the Constitution made clear that the orderly transfer \nof Presidential power through national elections was to be scrupulously \nfollowed. They took great care to guarantee that this transfer would \nrarely, if ever, be undermined by the impeachment of the President. \nRemoval of the President would come only after the House of \nRepresentatives--with the sole power to impeach--and the Senate--with \nthe sole power to conduct a trial--found that the President had \ncommitted ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' \na term borrowed from the English impeachment experience.\n  Clearly, the Framers intended the House and the Senate to use the \nimpeachment power cautiously, and not wield it promiscuously for \npartisan political purposes. Sadly, in this case, Republicans in the \nHouse of Representatives, in their partisan vendetta against the \nPresident, have wielded the impeachment power in precisely the way the \nFramers rejected--recklessly and without regard for the Constitution or \nthe will of the American people.\n  First, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee essentially \nswallowed the referral of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr whole, \nwithout seriously questioning it or calling any witnesses. They used \nthe referral as the foundation for Articles of Impeachment which were \nreleased to the public before the White House counsel had an \nopportunity to complete their testimony before the Committee.\n  Why were the House Judiciary Committee and the House of \nRepresentatives on the fast track to impeachment? Because, as House \nManager Hyde told the Senate, ``we were operating under time \nconstraints which were self-imposed but I promised my colleagues to \nfinish it before the end of the year. I didn't want to drag it out.'' \nIn the battle between speed and fairness, should speed have prevailed \nover fairness? Clearly not. But the lame duck Republican House of \nRepresentatives was bent on acting before the last Congress ended, \nfearful that their slimmer majority in the current Congress would not \napprove any articles of impeachment at all.\n  In their most blatant attempt of all to stack the deck against the \nPresident, the House Republican leadership refused to allow a fair vote \non censure as an alternative to impeachment an alternative that would \nhave ended this unseemly charade two months ago. Instead, Members of \nthe House were given a single choice--a vote to impeach the President \nor do nothing.\n\n  After their partisan victory in the House of Representatives, the \nHouse Managers brought their vendetta against the President to the \nSenate. They brought thousands of pages of evidence, containing 22 \nstatements by Monica Lewinsky, 6 statements by Vernon Jordan, 3 \nstatements by Sidney Blumenthal, the videotaped deposition of President \nClinton in the Jones case, and the videotaped record of his appearance \nbefore the grand jury. Their opening statements attempted to shed the \nmost favorable light on the evidence, but it was quickly apparent that \nthey had not and could not persuade two-thirds of the Senate to remove \nthe President.\n  While trying to persuade Senators to convict President Clinton, the \nHouse Managers argued relentlessly for the opportunity to examine \nwitnesses during the trial. The hypocrisy in the position of the House \nManagers on witnesses was obvious. They did not think it was necessary \nto call witnesses in the House proceedings. They demeaned the House by \ntheir partisan excesses. But they were shameless in their attempt to \nforce the Senate to wallow in witnesses.\n  Our Republican friends have desperately been trying to produce a two-\nthirds majority to remove the President from office. But their efforts \nhave succeeded only in turning a serious constitutional process into a \npartisan process that demeaned both the House and the Senate and became \na painful ordeal for the entire country.\n  In pursuing the allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice, \nthe House Managers presented an ever changing, constantly shifting list \nof charges to the Senate. Veteran prosecutors testified before the \nHouse Judiciary Committee that they would never prosecute such a case, \nand that it would be irresponsible for the Senate to attempt to use \nthese allegations as a basis to remove the President from office.\n  Some of the allegations of perjury by the House Managers were \nlaughable. Clearly, it was not perjury for the President to use the \nphrase ``certain occasions'' to describe the frequency of\n\n[[Page S1567]]\n\nhis contacts with Miss Lewinsky, or to use the word ``occasional'' to \ndescribe the frequency of his telephone conversations with her.\n  Even the few allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice that \nare arguably more serious are far from proven beyond a reasonable \ndoubt, which is the standard that I believe should be applied by the \nSenate in considering the facts of this case. Indeed, I do not believe \nthey were proved by clear and convincing evidence. But even if any such \nallegations were true, they still fall far short of the constitutional \nstandard required for impeaching a President and removing him from \noffice.\n  President Clinton's behavior was wrong. All of us condemn it. None of \nus condones it. He failed to tell the truth about it, and he misled the \ncountry for many months. But nothing he did rises to the high \nconstitutional standard required for impeachment and removal of a \nPresident from office.\n  I believe that conclusion is required by the Constitution. At the \ntime of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, the Framers engaged in a \nvigorous debate about the role of the President, the new chief \nexecutive they were creating. In addition to determining the basic \npowers of the office, many of those at the convention debated whether \nor not impeachment should apply at all to the President. As University \nof Chicago Law School Professor Cass Sunstein told the House Judiciary \nSubcommittee on the Constitution, ``Many of the framers wanted no \nimpeachment power whatsoever . . . [t]hey suggested that in a world of \nseparation of powers and election of the President, there was no place \nfor impeachment. . . . That position was defeated by reference to \negregious hypotheticals in which the President betrayed the country \nduring war or got his office through bribery. Those are the cases that \npersuaded the swing votes that there should be impeachment power.'' In \nthe end, the Framers reluctantly agreed that there might be limited \ncircumstances in which a President should be removed from office by \nCongress in order to protect the country from great harm, without \nwaiting for the next election.\n  Once the Framers concluded that the President could be removed by the \nlegislature in such cases, they debated the standard for impeachment. \nNine days before the final Constitution was signed, the impeachment \nprovision was limited only to treason and bribery. George Mason then \nargued that the provision was too restrictive, and should be amended to \ninclude the phrase, ``or maladministration.'' But, vigorous opposition \ncame from others who believed that such a vague phrase would give \nCongress too much power to undermine the President. Mason withdrew his \noriginal proposal and substituted the phrase, ``other high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors against the State''--a phrase well-known from English law.\n  The Constitutional Convention adopted the modification by a vote of \neight states to three--confident that only serious offenses against the \nnation would provide the basis for impeachment. Later, the Committee of \nStyle removed the words, ``against the State,'' but because the \nCommittee had been instructed not to change the meaning of any \nprovision, the impeachment clause should be interpreted as it was \noriginally drafted.\n  The debate surrounding the Impeachment Clause was significant. By \nfirst expanding and then narrowing the clause, the Framers clearly \nintended that the President could be removed from office for ``crimes'' \nbeyond treason and bribery, but that he could not be removed for \ninefficient administration or administration inconsistent with the \ndominant view in Congress. Impeachment was not to be the illegitimate \ntwin of the English vote of ``No Confidence'' under a parliamentary \nsystem of government. The doctrine of separation of powers was \nparamount. The President was to serve at the pleasure of the people, \nnot the pleasure of the Congress, and certainly not at the pleasure of \na willful partisan majority in the House of Representatives.\n\n  As Charles Black stated in his highly regarded work on impeachment, \nthe two specific impeachable offenses--treason and bribery--can help \nidentify both the ``ordinary crimes which ought also to be looked upon \nas impeachable offenses, and those serious misdeeds, not ordinary \ncrimes, which ought to be looked on as impeachable offenses . . .'' \nUsing treason and bribery as ``the miners' canaries,'' Professor Black \nstates that ``high crimes and misdemeanors, in the constitutional \nsense, ought to be held to be those offenses which are rather obviously \nwrong, whether or not `criminal,' and which so seriously threaten the \norder of political society as to make pestilent and dangerous the \ncontinuance in power of their perpetrator.''\n  The distinguished historian, Professor Arthur Schlesinger, told the \nHouse Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, the ``[e]vidence \nseems to me conclusive that the Founding Fathers saw impeachment as a \nremedy for grave and momentous offenses against the Constitution; \nGeorge Mason said, great crimes, great and dangerous offenses, attempts \nto subvert the Constitution.''\n  In addition to Professor Schlesinger, over 430 law professors and \nover 400 historians and constitutional scholars have stated \nemphatically that the allegations against President Clinton do not meet \nthe standard set by the Constitution for impeachment. The scholarly \nsupport for the argument that the charges against President Clinton do \nnot rise to the level of impeachable offenses--even if they are true--\nis overwhelming, and it cannot be ignored.\n  The law professors wrote, ``[i]t goes without saying that lying under \noath is a very serious offense. But even if the House of \nRepresentatives had the constitutional authority to impeach for any \ninstance of perjury or obstruction of justice, a responsible House \nwould not exercise this awesome power on the facts alleged in this \ncase.''\n  The historians wrote, ``[t]he Framers explicitly reserved \n[impeachment] for high crimes and misdemeanors in the exercise of \nexecutive power. Impeachment for anything else would, according to \nJames Madison, leave the President to serve `during the pleasure of the \nSenate,' thereby mangling the system of checks and balances that is our \nchief safeguard against abuses of power . . . Although we do not \ncondone President Clinton's private behavior or his subsequent attempts \nto deceive, the current charges against him depart from what the \nFramers saw as grounds for impeachment.''\n  The House Managers apparently made no attempt to obtain scholarly \nsupport for their opposition. It is a fair inference that they did not \ndo so because they knew they could not obtain it.\n  The House Managers argue that because the Senate convicted and \nremoved three federal judges for making perjurious statements, we must \nnow convict and remove the President. But, to determine whether or not \nPresident Clinton should be removed from office requires the Senate to \ndo more than make simplistic analogies to federal judges.\n  Removal of the President of the United States and removal of a \nfederal judge are vastly different. The President is unique, and his \nrole is in no way comparable to the role of the over 900 federal judges \nwe have today. The impact on the country of removing one of 900 federal \njudges is infinitesimal, compared to the impact of removing the only \nPresident we have. And the people elect the President for a specific \nfour year term, while federal judges are appointed for life, subject to \ngood behavior. These distinctions are obvious, and they make all the \ndifference.\n  Other precedents also undermine the House Managers' insistence that \nthe Senate is bound to remove President Clinton from office. The House \nJudiciary Committee refused on a bipartisan basis to impeach President \nNixon for deliberately lying under oath to the Internal Revenue \nService, although he under reported his taxable income by at least \n$796,000. During the 1974 Judiciary Committee debates, many Republican \nand Democratic members of the Committee agreed that tax fraud was not \nthe kind of abuse of power that impeachment was designed to remedy.\n  Finally, the House Managers argue that President Clinton must be \nremoved to protect the rule of law and cleanse the office. It is not \nenough, they say, that he can be prosecuted once he leaves office. But \nprotecting the rule of law under the Constitution is not the proper \nstandard for removal of the President. Before impeaching and convicting \nthe President, the Senate must find that he committed ``Treason, \nBribery, or other high\n\n[[Page S1568]]\n\nCrimes and Misdemeanors.'' As Professor Laurence Tribe testified before \nthe House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, ``[i]f the \nproposition is that when the President is a law breaker, has committed \nany crime, then the rule of law and the take care clause requires that \none impeach him, then we have rewritten the [impeachment] clause.''\n  The Constitution has guided our country well for two centuries. The \ndecision we make now goes far beyond this President. As we decide \nwhether President Clinton will be removed from office, the future of \nthe Presidency and the well-being of our democracy itself are at stake.\n  How will history remember this Congress? The Radical Republicans in \nthe middle of the 19th century were condemned in the eyes of history \nfor using impeachment as a partisan vendetta against President Andrew \nJohnson. And I believe the Radical Republicans at the end of the 20th \ncentury will be condemned even more severely by history for their \npartisan vendetta against President Clinton.\n  The impeachment process was never intended to become a weapon for a \npartisan majority in Congress to attack the President. To do so is a \nviolation of the fundamental separation of powers doctrine at the heart \nof the Constitution. It is an invitation to future partisan majorities \nin future Congresses to use the impeachment power to undermine the \nPresident. It could weaken Republican and Democratic Presidents alike \nfor years to come.\n  This case is a constitutional travesty. We deplore the conduct of \nPresident Clinton that led to this yearlong distraction for the nation. \nBut we should deplore even more the partisan attempt to abuse the \nConstitution by misusing the impeachment power.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. Chief Justice, my colleagues, the issue now before \nthe Senate may well be the most significant of our public careers. \nOther than declaring war, it is difficult to imagine a weightier \ndecision that could come before us than whether to remove the President \nof the United States from office.\n  Our Founders designed impeachment to protect our system of government \nagainst officials who lose their moorings in the law or who endanger \nour most basic institutions. They designed it neither as a popular \nreferendum nor as a mechanism by which--as in parliamentary systems--\nthe legislature can remove the head of government based on nothing more \nthan a policy difference. Instead, this process is a check upon rogue \nchief executives, designed equally to remove the politically popular \nmalefactor and to protect the innocent, but unpopular, official. It is \na vital, but extraordinary, remedy that should neither be shunned out \nof political expediency nor invoked for political gain.\n  The question before us is not whether President Clinton's conduct was \ncontemptible or utterly unworthy of the great office he holds. It was. \nThe question before us is whether the President has committed an \nimpeachable offense for which he should be removed from that office.\n  The Framers thought carefully about where to vest the ultimate power \nto remove a president. They chose the United States Senate. This was \nnot an obvious choice. The power to convict and remove could as easily \nhave been assigned to a court of law, where a jury would apply the law \nto the facts in the ordinary way.\n  But the Framers gave the power to try impeachments to the Senate. \nThey did so because they recognized that an impeachment trial should \nnot be an ordinary trial, requiring an ordinary application of law to \nfact. The Framers wanted the Senate to make not only a determination of \nguilt, but also a judgment about what is best for our nation and its \ninstitutions.\n  Throughout this impeachment trial, in order to lessen the ambiguity \nin this process, I have sought to find a way to allow the Senate to \nexpress its view of the facts we have so carefully considered for the \npast month. The vote we now approach is to convict or acquit. It is a \nblunt instrument that does not allow me to express clearly my belief \nthat President Clinton willfully lied to a federal grand jury, and that \nhe wrongfully tried to influence testimony and to conceal evidence \nrelated to Paula Jones' lawsuit.\n  As this case has been argued in this chamber, I have become convinced \nthat the perjury charges of Article I are not fully substantiated by \nthe record. The President's grand jury testimony is replete with lies, \nhalf-truths, and evasions. But significantly, not all evasion is lying, \nand not all lying is perjury. Even blatantly misleading testimony that \nall fair-minded people would consider dishonest may not actually \nconstitute perjury, as the law defines it.\n  Time and time again, the attorneys questioning President Clinton \nbefore the grand jury--perhaps out of a misguided sense of deference--\nneglected to pin him down as he gave nonresponsive, evasive, confusing, \nor simply absurd responses. The only remedy for imprecise answers is \nmore precise questioning. Unfortunately, this did not occur, and \nconsequently, the record is too murky to require the President's \nremoval based on Article I.\n  The evidence supporting Article II is more convincing. Indeed, the \ncase presented by the House Managers proves to my satisfaction that the \nPresident did, in fact, obstruct justice in Paula Jones' civil rights \ncase. While the circumstances surrounding Monica Lewinsky's filing of a \nfalse affidavit are unclear, there is no doubt in my mind that the \nfrantic efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky a job, the retrieval and \nconcealment of gifts under the bed of the President's secretary, and, \nmost egregious, the President's blatant coaching of Betty Currie--not \nonce, but twice--were clear attempts to tamper with witnesses and \nobstruct justice. Indeed, if I were a juror in an ordinary criminal \ncase, I might very well vote to convict faced with these facts.\n  Nevertheless, I do not think that the President's actions constitute \na ``high crime'' or ``misdemeanor'' as contemplated by Article II, \nSection 4 of the Constitution. This is, I readily acknowledge, a \njudgment that can neither be made nor explained with anything \napproaching scientific precision. But I can point to two factors that \ninfluence my conclusion.\n  First, obstruction of justice is generally more serious in a criminal \ncase, as opposed to a civil case, as it interferes with the effective \nenforcement of our nation's laws and not solely with the adjudication \nof private disputes. Consistent with this conclusion, the vast majority \nof obstruction prosecutions involve underlying criminal actions, and \nthe statutory penalties are more severe in the context of criminal \ntrials. This is not to suggest for a moment that we should tolerate \nobstruction of justice in civil cases, but only to observe that our \nlegal system treats it as a less serious offense.\n  Second, I believe that for impeachment purposes, obstruction of \njustice has more ominous implications when the conduct concealed, or \nthe method used to conceal it, poses a threat to our governmental \ninstitutions. Neither occurred in this case.\n  Therefore, I will cast my vote not for the current President, but for \nthe presidency. I believe that in order to convict, we must conclude \nfrom the evidence presented to us with no room for doubt that our \nConstitution will be injured and our democracy suffer should the \nPresident remain in office one moment more.\n  In this instance, the claims against the President fail to reach this \nvery high standard. Therefore, albeit reluctantly, I will vote to \nacquit William Jefferson Clinton on both counts.\n  In voting to acquit the President, I do so with grave misgivings for \nI do not mean in any way to exonerate this man. He lied under oath; he \nsought to interfere with the evidence; he tried to influence the \ntestimony of key witnesses. And, while it may not be a crime, he \nexploited a very young, star-struck employee whom he then proceeded to \nsmear in an attempt to destroy her credibility, her reputation, her \nlife. The President's actions were chillingly similar to the White \nHouse's campaign to discredit Kathleen Willey.\n  As much as it troubles me to acquit this President, I cannot do \notherwise and remain true to my role as a Senator. To remove a \npopularly elected president for the first time in our nation's history \nis an extraordinary action that should be undertaken only when the \nPresident's misconduct so injures the fabric of democracy that the \nSenate is left with no option but to oust the offender from the office \nthe people have entrusted to him.\n\n[[Page S1569]]\n\n  President Clinton has written a shameful and permanent chapter of \nAmerican history. He alone is responsible for this year of agony that \nthe American people have endured. I do not, however, take solace in the \nprospect of a censure, nor do I take comfort in the possibility that \nthe President may be prosecuted for his wrongdoing after he leaves \noffice. Rather, I look to the verdict of history to provide the \nultimate punishment for this president, a verdict that no public \nrelations gloss or smear campaign can obscure. As Maine's great poet, \nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow, wrote in 1874, ``Whatever hath been written \nshall remain, nor be erased, nor written o'er again.'' When the history \nof the Clinton presidency is written, every book will begin with the \nfact that William Jefferson Clinton was impeached, and that will be not \nonly the ultimate censure but also the final verdict on this sad \nchapter in our nation's history.\n  Mr. HARKIN. A few weeks ago, I used a barnyard term that is quite \nknown in Iowa to describe what I thought of this case. The longer this \ncase has gone on, the more I am convinced this characterization is \ncorrect.\n  This case should never have been brought before the Senate. I think \nit is one of the most blatant partisan actions taken by the House of \nRepresentatives since Andrew Johnson's case was pushed through by the \nradical Republicans of his time.\n  I think it is important for us to take a look at how this case got \nhere. One might ask why is it important how it got here?\n  Well, if you believe that the end justifies the means, it is probably \nnot very important. But if you believe the end doesn't justify the \nmeans, that those who are charged with enforcing the law cannot break \nthe law in order to bring someone to the bar of justice, and if you \nbelieve the rule of law applies not only to the defendant, the \nPresident in this case, but also to the prosecutors and those sworn to \nuphold that rule of law, then it is important to look at how the case \ngot here.\n  First, we have a statute, the independent counsel statute which at \nbest I believe is flawed and at worst unworkable which allows someone \nto be targeted without regard to money or time. In fact, it has \nessentially created a fourth branch of Government with no checks or \nbalances.\n  Again, the conduct, I want to point out, of Ken Starr does not excuse \nthe behavior of the President but has everything to do with our \nperspective on the case and how we approach it, how we weigh our \ndecision. We are not jurors, we are judges and the supreme Court of \nImpeachment, which has some of the elements of a court of equity. If \nsomebody approaches this court, they better do it with clean hands.\n  Where the political motivation is so blatant, as it has been in this \ncase, I think we in the Senate should have our guard up, not only on \nwhat the case is about, but how it got here. This is the sort of \npolitical impeachment case that Madison and Hamilton wanted to avoid, \nand I refer you to Federalist Paper No. 65, and Hamilton warned the \ngreatest danger would be ``that the decision will be regulated more by \nthe comparative strength of parties than by the real demonstrations of \ninnocence or guilt.'' That is why he argued for it to come to the \nSenate and have a two-thirds requirement in order to convict and \nremove.\n  So in the beginning, Ken Starr is picked by a three-judge panel to \ninvestigate Whitewater. Whitewater turns into Travelgate. Travelgate \nturns into Filegate, and then one wonders, how did Monica Lewinsky ever \ndrop in on this?\n  If we look back, when Ken Starr was a private attorney, in 1994, he \nhad dealings with Paula Jones' attorneys in terms of her then-pending \nlawsuit. So he had prior involvement himself with the Paula Jones case.\n  So the Paula Jones case proceeds forward. And in October of 1997, an \nentity called the Rutherford Institute, funded by conservative forces \nin the United States, found some new attorneys for Paula Jones and \nbecame heavily involved in the case.\n  Now some time around that time, Linda Tripp, with whom Monica \nLewinsky had shared her most intimate details of her involvement with \nthe President, begins talking with these attorneys. That is sort of the \nstatus of the case as of December 1997.\n  And here I ask unanimous consent to have printed an article from the \nNew York Times, dated January 24, which more or less documents this.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 24, 1999]\n\n  Quietly, Team of Lawyers Who Disliked Clinton Kept Jones Case Alive\n\n                (By Don Van Natta Jr. and Jill Abramson)\n\n       Washington.--This time last year, Hillary Rodham Clinton \n     described, in a now-famous appearance on the NBC News program \n     ``Today,'' how a ``vast right-wing conspiracy'' was trying to \n     destroy her husband's Presidency.\n       As it turns out, some of the most serious damage to Bill \n     Clinton's Presidency came not from his high-profile political \n     enemies but from a small secret clique of lawyers in their \n     30's who share a deep antipathy toward the President, \n     according to nearly two dozen interviews and recently filed \n     court documents.\n       While cloaking their roles, the lawyers were deeply \n     involved--to an extent not previously known--for nearly five \n     years in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit. They then \n     helped push the case into the criminal arena and into the \n     office of the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr.\n       The group's leader was Jerome M. Marcus, a 39-year-old \n     associate at the Philadelphia law firm of Berger & Montague, \n     whose partners are major contributors to the Democratic \n     Party.\n       Although Ms. Jones never met him or knew he had worked on \n     her behalf, Marcus drafted legal documents and was involved \n     in many of the important strategic decisions in her lawsuit, \n     according to billing records and interviews with other \n     lawyers who worked on the case. As much as any of Ms. Jones's \n     attorneys of record, Marcus helped keep Ms. Jones's case \n     alive in the courts.\n       Marcus recruited others to assist his efforts, including \n     several friends from the University of Chicago Law School. \n     One of those who was approached, Paul Rosenzweig, briefly \n     considered doing work for Ms. Jones in 1994, according to \n     billing records and interviews, but decided not to. In \n     November 1997, Rosenzweig joined Starr's office, where he and \n     Marcus had several telephone conversations about the Jones \n     case.\n       It was Rosenzweig who fielded a ``heads-up'' phone call \n     from Marcus on Jan. 8, 1998, that first tipped off Starr's \n     office about Monica S. Lewinsky and Linda R. Tripp. The tip \n     was not mentioned in the 445-page Starr report, even though \n     the information revived a moribund Whitewater investigation \n     that would not have produced, it now seems, an impeachment \n     referral to Congress.\n       Marcus did make his views known publicly last month when he \n     wrote an impassioned commentary in The Washington Times \n     urging the impeachment of Clinton. ``The cancer is deadly,'' \n     Marcus wrote. ``It, and its cause, must be removed.'' He \n     identified himself in the newspaper simply as ``a lawyer in \n     Philadelphia.''\n       In his long efforts to promote Ms. Jones's lawsuit, and \n     helping Mrs. Tripp find her way to Starr, Marcus found other \n     allies, including another Chicago law classmate, Richard W. \n     Porter. Porter had worked as an aide to former Vice President \n     Dan Quayle and was a partner of Starr's at the law firm of \n     Kirkland & Ellis, based in Chicago.\n       George T. Conway 3d, a New York lawyer educated at Yale, \n     shared Marcus's low view of President Clinton. When the Jones \n     case led to Ms. Lewinsky, Marcus and Conway searched for a \n     new lawyer for Mrs. Tripp. Marcus and Porter helped arrange \n     for Mrs. Tripp to take her explosive allegations to Starr.\n       Their effort are only now coming into focus, as a few of \n     their associates have begun to discuss their activities and \n     their names appear repeatedly in the final legal bills \n     submitted by the original Jones legal team. Messrs. Marcus, \n     Porter and Conway did not respond to numerous requests for \n     comment.\n       In their arguments before the Senate this week, the \n     President's lawyers said that there was collusion between \n     Starr's office, Mrs. Tripp and the lawyers for Ms. Jones in \n     the weeks leading up to the President's deposition last \n     January. If witnesses are called in the Senate impeachment \n     trial, the President's lawyers may explore the issue further, \n     several Clinton legal advisers said.\n       Charles G. Bakaly 3d, the spokesman for Starr, denied there \n     was collusion between the independent counsel's office and \n     the Jones team, including Marcus. ``There was absolutely no \n     conspiracy between the Jones lawyers and our office,'' Bakaly \n     said. ``Judge Starr has testified to the circumstances as to  \n     how this matter came to our attention, and the actions \n     that we took thereafter.''\n       Clinton said in his grand jury testimony in August that his \n     political enemies ``just thought they would take a wrecking \n     bail to me and see if they could do some damage.'' That \n     wrecking ball was wielded by Marcus and his colleagues, who \n     managed to drive Paula Corbin Jones's allegation of sexual \n     misconduct into the courtroom and beyond.\n\n\n                 three classmates at chicago law school\n\n       Marcus, Porter and Rosenzweig were classmates at the \n     University of Chicago Law School, graduating in 1986. Conway \n     met the others through the Jones case. Some of the lawyers \n     were also involved with the Federalist Society, a legal group \n     that includes conservative and libertarian luminaries like\n\n[[Page S1570]]\n\n     Starr, Robert H. Bork and Richard Epstein, a University of \n     Chicago law professor.\n       Porter was the most overtly political member of the group, \n     having worked on the staff of Vice President Quayle and on \n     the Bush-Quayle campaign, where he did opposition research.\n       Porter was also an associate of Peter W. Smith, 62, a \n     Chicago financier who was once the chairman of College Young \n     Republicans and a major donor to Gopac, a conservative \n     political group affiliated with former Speaker Newt Gingrich. \n     Beginning in 1992, Smith spent more than $80,000 to finance \n     anti-Clinton research in an effort to persuade the mainstream \n     press to cover Clinton's sex life. Among others, his efforts \n     involved David Brock, the journalist who first mentioned the \n     name ``Paula'' in an article on Clinton.\n       Smith declined an interview request.\n       In 1993, Brock said, Smith helped introduce him to the \n     Arkansas state troopers who accused Clinton of using them to \n     procure women when he was Governor of Arkansas. Brock wrote \n     an article based on the troopers' account of Clinton's sexual \n     escapades that was published in the January 1994 issue of The \n     American Spectator, a conservative magazine. According to \n     Brock, Smith wanted to establish a fund for the troopers, in \n     case they suffered retribution. Brock said he opposed \n     payments because they would undermine the troopers' \n     credibility.\n       To allay his concerns, Brock said, Smith urged him to speak \n     to Porter, who was then working at Kirkland & Ellis, the \n     Chicago law firm that employed Starr in its Washington \n     office. Brock said he had hoped his talk with Porter would \n     put an end to any planned payments to the troopers, but Smith \n     did pay them and their lawyers $22,600.\n       In 1992, Smith also paid Brock $5,000 to research another \n     bit of Arkansas sex lore regarding Clinton, a rumor that has \n     since proved to be baseless.\n       Brock did not pursue an article.\n       Brock's trooper article in The American Spectator mentioned \n     a woman identified as ``Paula,'' and in May 1994, Ms. Jones \n     filed her lawsuit against President Clinton. Ms. Jones's \n     lawyers of record were from the Washington area, Gilbert K. \n     Davis and Joseph Cammarata, whom Marcus had helped recruit.\n\n\n                 lawyers of record had help from start\n\n       The Davis and Cammarata billing records show that from \n     their earliest involvement in the case, they were consulting \n     with Marcus and Porter. Conway also helped draft briefs, \n     Cammarata said.\n       ``Marcus was involved,'' Cammarata said, ``but he insisted \n     that he not be identified. But that was fine with me. We were \n     just two guys involved in the middle of a world war. We \n     welcomed his help.''\n       No one was more important to the Jones case than Marcus. \n     Besides helping to write several important briefs, Marcus \n     spoke numerous times at the most critical moments in the case \n     with Cammarata and Davis, offering legal advice that \n     Cammarata said was ``vital.''\n       According to the billing records, Porter also offered \n     ``legal strategy'' and once wrote a memo on ``investigative \n     leads'' that might embarrass the President.\n       ``Porter was a cheerleader,'' Cammarata said. ``He used to \n     call up and say, `Maybe we can find you some money.' ''\n       One of President Clinton's legal advisers said he noticed a \n     marked difference in quality between the routine legal \n     pleadings filed by the Cammarata and Davis team, and the \n     polished, scholarly briefs written by the shadow legal team \n     headed by Marcus and Conway.\n       Marcus, meanwhile, was so successful at keeping the extent \n     of his role a secret that even Cammarata only found out \n     recently that Marcus had trouble finding lawyers to agree to \n     represent Ms. Jones. ``No one wanted to touch this case,'' \n     Cammarata said. ``No one wanted to take on the President of \n     the United States.''\n       Another friend of Marcus also briefly considered assisting \n     the Jones lawyers.\n       In June 1994, Rosenzweig, a lawyer at a small law firm in \n     Washington, with experience working in the Justice \n     Department, expressed interest in doing legal work on behalf \n     of Ms. Jones, but he did none, lawyers involved in the case \n     said.\n\n\n                law firm included influential democrats\n\n       Conway wanted his role kept hidden as well, because his New \n     York law firm, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, included \n     influential Democrats like Bernard W. Nussbaum, a former \n     White House counsel. Conway's name does not appear on any \n     billing records.\n       Although the billing records show communication between \n     Porter and the Jones lawyers from 1994 to 1997, he denied in \n     a written statement last fall doing legal work for Ms. Jones.\n       Because Porter is a partner at the firm where Starr worked \n     until he took a leave of absence last August, any role played \n     by Porter in the Jones case could have posed a conflict of \n     interest for Starr once he became independent counsel. Starr \n     has said he did not discuss the Jones case with Porter.\n       Starr has acknowledged contacts with Davis, specifically \n     six telephone discussions the two had in 1994, before Starr \n     became independent counsel. In fact, Starr has been \n     criticized for not disclosing the phone conversations to \n     Attorney General Janet Reno when he was seeking to expand his \n     investigation to the Lewinsky matter. Starr has said it did \n     not occur to him to mention the conversations because he did \n     not do work on the Jones case and simply offered his publicly \n     stated position on a point of constitutional law that \n     Presidents are not immune from civil lawsuits.\n       Before the Jones lawyers argued before the Supreme Court in \n     May 1996, paving the way to the fateful 9-0 decision that the \n     President was not immune from civil lawsuits, Conway went to \n     Washington for a practice argument. He joined Davis, \n     Cammarata, Judge Robert Bork and Theodore Olson, a Washington \n     lawyer and friend of Starr, at the Army-Navy Club here.\n       When Cammarata and Davis quit as Ms. Jone's lawyers after \n     she failed to reach a settlement with President Clinton's \n     lawyers in 1997, Marcus and his colleagues established ties \n     to her new lawyers at the Dallas law firm of Rader, Campbell, \n     Fisher & Pyke and the Rutherford Institute of \n     Charlottesville, Va., which helped pay her legal expenses.\n       In November 1997, Rosenzweig went to work as a prosecutor \n     in Starr's office. And from November to January, Rosenzweig \n     spoke several times by telephone with Marcus and discussed \n     the Jones case, a lawyer with knowledge of the conversations \n     said. But Bakaly, a spokesman for Starr, said that Rosenzweig \n     did not tell any of his colleagues about what he learned \n     about developments in the Jones case.\n       By this time, Mrs. Tripp was cooperating with the Jones \n     lawyers. She was also taping her conversations with Ms. \n     Lewinsky, which her friend, Lucianne Goldberg, a Manhattan \n     literary agent, had incorrectly assured her was legal. In \n     December, Mrs. Tripp became frantic that she might be \n     prosecuted because such taping is illegal in Maryland, where \n     Mrs. Tripp lives. Mrs. Tripp and Ms. Goldberg thought of a \n     possible solution: perhaps she could receive immunity from \n     prosecution from Starr.\n       Ms. Goldberg called Smith, the Chicago financier, and \n     Porter for advice on how Mrs. Tripp might approach Starr. In \n     a teleconference during the first week of January 1998, Ms. \n     Goldberg talked to Porter and Marcus. Meanwhile, Marcus \n     sought new lawyers for Mrs. Tripp. Conway suggested an old \n     friend, James Moody, a Washington lawyer and fellow \n     Federalist Society member, whom Mrs. Tripp retained.\n       Because he was Starr's former law partner, Porter did not \n     want to be the first one to call the independent counsel's \n     office on behalf of Mrs. Tripp. So Marcus made the call to \n     Rosenzweig.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. So now we have the involvement of Linda Tripp giving \ninformation to Paula Jones' attorneys. From about late October, early \nNovember until January 1998, a lawyer by the name of Jerome Marcus in \nPhiladelphia, who has done extensive work for the Jones legal team, had \nbeen talking to a friend of his, Paul Rosenzweig, a prosecutor in Mr. \nStarr's office, about the Lewinsky matter. We didn't know the exact \nnature of these discussions, but we do know they talked a number of \ntimes. But we do know that on January 8 Marcus contacted Rosenzweig and \ntold him about the relationship of Monica Lewinsky and the President.\n  Right after this, Linda Tripp contacts the Office of Independent \nCounsel to talk about Lewinsky and tells them about the tapes she has \nmade, the telephone tapes, the tapes of her telephone conversations \nwith Monica Lewinsky. The day after that, Tripp is wired by FBI agents \nworking with Starr, meets with Lewinsky, and records their conversation \nwithout Lewinsky's knowledge--and doing this without any authorization \nto do it. They didn't get it until 4 days later.\n  Now, all this is done prior to President Clinton ever giving a \ndeposition or testifying before a grand jury. And so Clinton has done \nnothing yet in terms of testifying. So one might ask, What was Starr \nand his team after? If, in fact, this was a consensual sexual \nrelationship between Clinton and a young woman who was an adult, what \ndid it have to do with Whitewater or anything else they were \ninvestigating?\n  Well, here is why it had something to do with it. Let me quote from \nan article written by Joseph Isenburgh, a professor of law at the \nUniversity of Chicago. I happen to have read it because he was \nsupporting this findings of fact procedure, and I wanted to see what \nhis thoughts were. But later on in his treatise he said this:\n\n       What is perverse about the impeachment of President Clinton \n     is the idiotic premise on which it rests. The President \n     wasn't forced to respond to judicial process in the Paula \n     Jones sexual harassment suit because he committed a crime of \n     paramount public concern. That case, remember, was dismissed \n     as meritless.\n\n  I am continuing to quote him:\n\n       The misconduct at issue here had no independent \n     significance. It is, itself, merely a byproduct of a judicial \n     process directed at the President, essentially of a ``sting'' \n     set-up in the courts.\n\n\n[[Page S1571]]\n\n\n  ``A `sting' set-up in the courts.'' That is what Ken Starr and the \nJones attorneys, working in tandem, were doing, setting him up. And you \ncan see this clearly when you watch Clinton on videotape in the \ndeposition before the Paula Jones attorneys. They present him with this \ndefinition of ``sexual relations'' that even the judge herself said was \nconfusing. They knew what they were going after. But President Clinton \ndid not know that they had all this information about his involvement \nwith Monica Lewinsky--a classic sting operation.\n  Also, keep in mind that Linda Tripp briefed the Paula Jones attorneys \nthe night before that deposition and gave them the tapes of her \ntelephone conversations. In light of this, it is interesting to note \nthat in today's New York Times, February 10, the conduct of the \nindependent counsel is so suspect and potentially violative of Justice \nDepartment policy and law that he now is under investigation for a \nnumber of reasons which I won't read. But I ask unanimous consent that \nit be printed in the Record. And you can read it in today's New York \nTimes.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the New York Times, February 9, 1998]\n\n        Inquiry to Ask Whether Reno Was Misled by Starr's Office\n\n               (By David Johnston and Don Van Natta, Jr.)\n\n        Washington, Feb. 9--The Justice Department has decided to \n     begin an inquiry to determine whether Kenneth W. Starr's \n     prosecutors misled Attorney General Janet Reno about possible \n     conflicts of interest when they obtained permission to \n     investigate the Lewinsky matter in January 1998, Government \n     officials said today.\n       Among other concerns, the inquiry will focus on whether the \n     prosecutors should have disclosed the contacts between Mr. \n     Starr's office and the Paula Jones legal team in the weeks \n     leading up to Mr. Starr's decision to ask Ms. Reno to expand \n     his inquiry beyond the Whitewater matter, said the officials, \n     who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n       In recent months, documentation has emerged indicating that \n     there were conversations between a prosecutor in Mr. Starr's \n     office and a lawyer working behind the scenes with the Jones \n     legal team from November 1997 to January 1998.\n       But a series of newly disclosed notes taken at the initial \n     meetings on Jan. 15 and Jan. 16, 1998, between Mr. Starr's \n     prosecutors and Justice Department officials, shows that the \n     prosecutors flatly asserted that there had been no contacts \n     with the Jones team.\n       For example, Eric H. Holder Jr., the Deputy Attorney \n     General, wrote in this three pages of notes of a Jan. 15, \n     1998, meeting with Mr. Starr's prosecutors: ``They've had no \n     contact with plaintiff's attys.''\n       Handwritten notes by two other Justice Department \n     officials, Monty Wilkinson and Josh Hochberg, corroborate the \n     statements attributed to Mr. Starr's prosecutors.\n       Moreover, notes taken by another participant in the \n     meeting, Steven Bates, a prosecutor in Mr. Starr's office, \n     indicate that Jackie M. Bennett, one of Mr. Starr's deputies, \n     told the Justice Department officials: ``We've had no contact \n     with the plaintiffs' attorneys. We're concerned about \n     appearances.''\n       The notes have become crucial evidence in the Justice \n     Department inquiry, which will be conducted by the Office of \n     Professional Responsibility, which investigates prosecutorial \n     misconduct. The lawyers' notes became public just last month \n     as part of the Senate record of documents related to the \n     impeachment trial of the President.\n       The truthfulness of Mr. Starr's prosecutors is one of \n     several issues that the department wants to examine, the \n     Government officials said. Lawyers in the ethics office also \n     intend to investigate whether Mr. Starr abused his authority \n     to convene grand juries, or improperly pressed witnesses like \n     Ms. Lewinsky, and disclosed secret grand jury information to \n     reporters, the officials said.\n       Mr. Clinton's lawyers and supporters have long contended \n     that there was collusion between Mr. Starr's office and the \n     conservative Jones lawyers, noting that Linda R. Tripp \n     found her way to the Office of Independent Counsel through \n     a group of private lawyers who performed legal work on the \n     Jones case. Mr. Starr has insisted that his office sought \n     permission from Ms. Reno to expand his jurisdiction when \n     he learned of allegations that President Clinton's close \n     friend Vernon E. Jordan, Jr. was helping Monica S. \n     Lewinsky find a job in exchange for her silence as a \n     possible witness in the Jones lawsuit.\n       Charles G. Bakaly 3d, a spokesman for Mr. Starr's office, \n     would not comment on the Justice Department's plans to start \n     an investigation. But Mr. Bakaly said the notes showed that \n     prosecutors had supplied the Justice Department with a \n     thorough status report on the then-nascent inquiry.\n       ``I don't know how else to put it,'' Mr. Bakaly said. \n     ``There was no misleading of Justice. This was a very fluid \n     evolving situation. Unlike most public corruption cases, this \n     one was ongoing; felonies were still possibly being \n     committed.''\n       This latest inquiry has exacerbated tensions that have \n     existed between the Justice Department and the Office of \n     Independent Counsel almost since the beginning of the \n     Lewinsky scandal.\n       At one point last spring, Ms. Reno asked her senior aides \n     to research whether she had the authority to discipline Mr. \n     Starr in some way that stopped short of removing him, said a \n     former Justice Department official who spoke on condition of \n     anonymity.\n       Some aides told her that it would be a mistake, comparing \n     it to the ``Saturday Night Massacre'' when President Nixon \n     ordered the firing of the Watergate special prosecutor \n     Archibald Cox in October 1973.\n       But, the official said, Ms. Reno shot back: ``I'm not \n     asking you to make a political judgment. I'm asking you to \n     make a legal judgment.''\n       Deepening hostilities between the Justice Department and \n     Mr. Starr's office delayed the start of the new ethics \n     inquiry. The ethics investigators recently wrote to Mr. Starr \n     outlining the scope and authority for the investigation, the \n     officials said. Mr. Starr's prosecutors are challenging the \n     inquiry, asserting that the Attorney General does not have \n     the authority to delve into highly sensitive grand jury \n     material or investigative decisions that led Ms. Reno to \n     refer the case to Mr. Starr.\n       Ms. Reno's aides have said that investigative authority is \n     implied by language in the independent counsel statute, which \n     gives the Attorney General the sole responsibility to remove \n     an independent prosecutor.\n       Over time, Justice Department officials, including Ms. \n     Reno, have become troubled by what they view as possible \n     violations of Justice Department guidelines. From issues like \n     calling the Secret Service before the grand jury to the \n     crossfire over leaks to reporters, Mr. Starr's prosecutors \n     and Justice Department officials have feuded privately.\n       ``As time went on, people became more and more frustrated \n     with him,'' the Justice Department official said of Mr. \n     Starr. ``He seemed less concerned with Department of Justice \n     policies.''\n       The ethics lawyers are trying to determine whether \n     prosecutors in Mr. Starr's office had a vested interest in \n     the outcome of the Jones case, an interest that would have \n     undercut their ability to impartially investigate allegations \n     related to the lawsuit. If that conflict existed, the \n     officials said, it would have been an important factor as \n     Ms. Reno weighed whether to recommend to a three-judge \n     panel that Mr. Starr take on the Lewinsky matter.\n       At this point, the ethics unit of the Justice Department \n     must determine whether Mr. Starr and his prosecutors violated \n     departmental rules and prosecutorial guidelines. Their \n     findings could lead to recommendations for disciplinary \n     action, like reprimands or suspension of employment.\n       The relationship between Ms. Reno and Mr. Starr began as a \n     wary but cordial one that a Government official compared to \n     ``Thatcher and Gorbachev.''\n       At times, Ms. Reno has expressed exasperation over Mr. \n     Starr's conduct, fuming over letters sent by Mr. Starr's \n     prosecutors accusing the Justice Department of trying to \n     undercut the inquiry.\n       Mr. Starr's prosecutors had also grown angry and suspicious \n     about Ms. Reno's aides, suggesting that the Justice \n     Department was under the control of the White House and had \n     quietly tried to squelch Mr. Starr's effort, the officials \n     said.\n       Since October, several news organizations have reported how \n     Mr. Starr's office first learned about the Lewinsky matter. \n     On Jan. 8, 1998--four days before Linda R. Tripp contacted \n     Mr. Starr's office--Jerome M. Marcus, a Philadelphia lawyer \n     who did extensive work for the Jones legal team, informed \n     Paul Rosenzweig, a prosecutor in Mr. Starr's office, about \n     the Lewinsky accusations.\n       The early tip was not disclosed in Mr. Starr's 445-page \n     referral to Congress. Nor was it disclosed to the Justice \n     Department. And The New York Times reported last month that \n     there were several conversations between Mr. Marcus and Mr. \n     Rosenzweig from November 1997 to January 1998.\n       David E. Kendall, one of the President's personal lawyers, \n     complained to Ms. Reno in October that ``very serious \n     questions'' were raised about those contacts.\n       The allegations of collusion prompted lawyers at the \n     Justice Department to turn their attention to their own \n     recollections and their own handwritten notes, of statements \n     made by Mr. Starr's representatives on Jan. 15, 1998, \n     officials said today.\n       One former Justice Department lawyer said in an interview \n     that Ms. Reno was especially disappointed in the fact that \n     the early phone call was not shared with her senior aides \n     in January 1998.\n       Last month, The New York Times reported that Mr. Marcus was \n     the leader of a small secret group of lawyers working behind \n     the scenes on the Jones case. Mr. Marcus drafted legal \n     documents and was involved in many of the most important \n     strategic decisions in the Jones lawsuit, according to \n     billing records in the Jones case and interviews with other \n     lawyers who worked with him.\n       Mr. Marcus recruited other conservative lawyers to assist \n     with his efforts, approaching among others, Paul Rosenzweig, \n     who briefly considered doing work for Ms. Jones in 1994, the \n     billing records show, but decided not to.\n       In November 1997, Mr. Rosenzweig joined Mr. Starr's office, \n     where he and Mr. Marcus\n\n[[Page S1572]]\n\n     had several conversations about the Jones case, said a lawyer \n     familiar with their discussions.\n       Mr. Bakaly, the spokesman for Mr. Starr, has adamantly \n     denied any suggestion of collusion. When Mr. Starr testified \n     before the House Judiciary Committee on Nov. 19 of last year, \n     he was asked by the chief counsel for the minority, Abbe D. \n     Lowell, about the ``substantial contacts'' that Mr. Starr had \n     had with Jones lawyers.\n       In a series of questions, Mr. Lowell tried to suggest that \n     Mr. Starr should have revealed the contacts to the Justice \n     Department in January 1998, and that Richard W. Porter, a \n     partner of Mr. Starr's at the law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, had \n     declined a request to represent Ms. Jones.\n       ``I know Richard Porter; I've had communications with him \n     from time to time,'' Mr. Starr testified. ``But in terms of a \n     specific discussion with respect to what the law firm may be \n     doing or may not be doing, I'm not recalling that \n     specifically, no.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 9, 1998]\n\n     Tracing the Past: How Legal Paths of Jones and Lewinsky Joined\n\n                   (By Tim Weiner with Neil A. Lewis)\n\n       WASHINGTON--Shortly after 10 a.m. on Jan. 17, a Saturday, \n     the president of the United States stepped out of the White \n     House into the back of a black limousine and rode a block to \n     his lawyer's office to undergo a six-hour grilling in the \n     case of Paula Jones vs. William Jefferson Clinton.\n       For six weeks, the president's lawyers had known that he \n     might be asked a startling question: Did you have a sexual \n     relationship with Monica Lewinsky? When the question came, \n     the president's body tensed and his jaw tightened, said a \n     lawyer involved in the case, and, under oath, he denied it.\n       The questions continued: Had the president been alone with \n     Lewinsky? Had he given her gifts? He said he might have been \n     alone with her briefly while she performed some clerical \n     task, and he might have given her some presidential \n     souvenirs, the lawyer recalled.\n       The deposition ended, President Clinton returned to the \n     White House, canceled dinner plans with his wife and called \n     his personal secretary, Betty Currie, asking her to meet him \n     at the White House the next morning.\n       When they met, the president asserted that he had never \n     been alone with Lewinsky at the White House, said lawyers \n     familiar with Mrs. Currie's account. But that assertion did \n     not square with Mrs. Currie's recollection.\n       In addition, Mrs. Currie had turned over to investigators a \n     hat pin, a brooch and a dress she retrieved from Lewinsky, \n     the lawyers said, items that are believed to have been given \n     to her by the president but which do not fit his description \n     of have been given to her by the president but which do not \n     fit his description of White House souvenirs. It is not clear \n     who, if anyone, instructed Mrs. Currie to retrieve the gifts.\n       Was Clinton less than truthful about his relationship with \n     Lewinsky, the 24-year-old former White House intern? Was he \n     using his trusted secretary to hide evidence from Mrs. Jones, \n     the former Arkansas state employee suing him over what she \n     says was a crude sexual advance nearly seven years ago?\n       The president's battle with the Whitewater independent \n     counsel, Kenneth Starr--and, perhaps, Clinton's place in \n     history--may depend on the answers. If he lied, or if he \n     urged others to lie or conceal evidence, he could face the \n     threat of impeachment.\n       How did Clinton become the first president forced to \n     testify under oath about his private life? How did the Jones \n     case--once demeaned by the president's lawyers as third-rate \n     ``tabloid trash''--come to threaten Clinton's presidency? The \n     answers lie in a detailed look at the recent past.\n       When Mrs. Jones' lawyers learned of Lewinsky's existence, \n     it was as if two live wires had met in an incendiary tangle.\n       The lawyers' hunt for information about Lewinsky, which \n     they sought to buttress Mrs. Jones' charge of sexual \n     misconduct by Clinton, led directly to Starr's investigation \n     into the possibility of perjury and obstruction of justice at \n     the highest levels. Now Starr is demanding that Mrs. Jones' \n     lawyers turn over everything they have learned in their \n     search for women who contend they have had sexual encounters \n     with Clinton.\n       The two cases merged that Saturday morning. As the \n     president testified, with Mrs. Jones staring him in the face \n     during the deposition, Lewinsky was at home at the Watergate, \n     recovering from the shock of her life.\n       Twelve hours earlier, she ended an intense encounter with \n     federal investigators pursuing the president on Starr's \n     behalf. The investigators confronted Lewinsky with the \n     devastating news that her colleague and confidante Linda \n     Tripp had been taping their intimate telephone conversations \n     for months.\n       Tripp had told Starr's investigators that Lewinsky lied in \n     her affidavit in the Jones case by denying that she had ever \n     had sex with Clinton. While Tripp was working undercover for \n     Starr, she was preparing to file an affidavit in Jones vs. \n     Clinton, swearing that Lewinsky ``had a sexual relationship \n     with President Clinton.''\n       The tapes presented the threat of prison for Lewinsky \n     unless she disavowed her affidavit and cooperated with Starr. \n     The tapes recorded Lewinsky saying that the president ``won't \n     settle'' the Jones case because ``he's in denial,'' according \n     to published excerpts of the tapes. If so, refusal had turned \n     that private lawsuit into a potential personal and political \n     disaster.\n       The miasma enveloping the White House began rising four \n     months ago.\n       On Oct. 1, the Rutherford Institute, a conservative legal \n     center in Virginia, publicly offered to help Mrs. Jones. The \n     institute found Mrs. Jones new lawyers from the Dallas firm \n     of Rader, Campbell, Fisher & Pyke and offered to pay her \n     legal expenses.\n       In the first week of October, a woman telephoned the \n     Rutherford Institute with an anonymous tip: a woman named \n     Monica had had sex with the president in the White House. The \n     same tipster, described by the man who took the call as ``a \n     nervous young woman,'' called back in late October, providing \n     a surname: Lewinsky.\n       Days after the first tip, the Dallas lawyers telephoned \n     Tripp. Newsweek quoted her in its Aug. 11 issue as a witness \n     to a supposed sexual encounter between the president and \n     Kathleen Willey, a White House volunteer. A lawyer involved \n     in the chain of events said Tripp later gave the lawyers \n     Lewinsky's name. Tripp's lawyer, James Moody, denies that. \n     The question is unresolved.\n\n\n                 lewinsky gets help with job interviews\n\n       On Oct. 7, Lewinsky sent the first of nine packages from \n     her office at the Pentagon to the White House and to the \n     office of Vernon Jordan, Clinton's friend and confidant. The \n     packages contained, among other things, letters and documents \n     relating to her search for a new job. A key question for \n     Starr is whether the White House and Jordan helped her find a \n     job for reasons beyond altruism.\n       Two weeks later, Lewinsky secured a job interview with Bill \n     Richardson, the chief U.S. delegate to the United Nations, \n     arranged by a White House deputy chief of staff, John \n     Podesta, at Mrs. Currie's request.\n       On Oct. 22, Richardson had a 40-minute interview with \n     Lewinsky in Richardson's living room at the Watergate \n     apartment and hotel complex, where she lives and where he \n     maintains an apartment. In November, Lewinsky was offered a \n     job on Richardson's public relations staff.\n       But Lewinsky eventually declined the offer. She wanted a \n     better-paying position in the private sector in New York.\n       In early December, Jordan talked to Lewinsky about helping \n     her find that job. The go-between for their discussions was \n     again Mrs. Currie. Jordan set up interviews for Lewinsky at \n     three companies where he had personal and corporate \n     connections: Revlon, American Express and Young & Rubicam, \n     the advertising agency.\n       Dec. 5 was the deadline for submitting witness lists in the \n     Jones case. And on that list, on that day, the president's \n     lawyers saw Lewinsky's name for the first time.\n       From that moment on, the paths of two people from two \n     different worlds--Paula Jones from Lonoke, Ark., and Monica \n     Lewinsky from Beverly Hills, Calif.--were on course to \n     collide at the White House.\n\n\n                    subpoena seeks gifts to lewinsky\n\n       Dec. 19, a Friday, Mrs. Jones' lawyers served Lewinsky with \n     a subpoena requesting information, including any gifts from \n     the president. She called a Washington lawyer, Francis \n     Carter, on Jordan's recommendation.\n       Christman Eve was Lewinsky's last day of work at the \n     Pentagon. She still did not have a new job.\n       On or about Dec. 28, a Sunday, she had a private talk with \n     Clinton at the White House, said lawyers in the case. The \n     president told her not to worry about being drawn into a \n     lawsuit and advised her to describe her earlier White House \n     visits as meetings with Mrs. Currie, the lawyers said.\n       As for the subpoenaed gifts, the president said Lewinsky \n     could not produce them if she no longer had them, according \n     to the lawyers' account. Mrs. Currie has told investigators \n     that she retrieved a box of gifts from Lewinsky--including \n     the dress, the brooch and the hat pin--and subsequently \n     turned the items over to Starr.\n\n\n                    affidavit includes denial of sex\n\n       On Jan. 7, a Wednesday, Lewinsky completed an affidavit \n     saying she never had sex with the president, said her lawyer \n     William Ginsburg. The affidavit was not immediately filed \n     with Mrs. Jones' lawyers.\n       The judge in the case had suggested that testimony be \n     limited to accounts of sexual favors received by Clinton in \n     exchange for government jobs. Lewinsky contended she knew \n     nothing of the sort, Ginsburg said; her affidavit was \n     intended to keep her out of the Jones trial.\n       Tripp has suggested to lawyers in the case that Lewinsky \n     did not intend to file the affidavit until she had secured a \n     job. That suggestion has not been independently corroborated \n     by Lewinsky or anyone else.\n       On Jan. 8, Lewinsky had a final job interview at Revlon, \n     and Jordan made telephone calls on her behalf to the company, \n     where he serves as a director. One of those calls went to \n     Revlon's chairman, Ronald O. Perelman. A few days later, \n     Revlon offered Lewinsky a job.\n       Now events approached critical mass.\n       On Jan. 12, Tripp made contact with Starr's office, saying \n     that Lewinsky had had an affair with the president and that \n     she, Tripp, had secret tapes to prove it. The same day, \n     Carter told Mrs. Jones' lawyers that Lewinsky had denied \n     any sexual relationship with the president in her \n     affidavit.\n       On Jan. 13, Tripp, with a tiny tape recorder provided by \n     Starr's office, met Lewinsky for a long lunch, during which \n     Lewinsky is said to have described her conversations about \n     her affidavit with Jordan.\n\n[[Page S1573]]\n\n       On Jan. 14 or Jan. 15, Lewinsky handled Tripp three pages \n     of ``talking points,'' aimed at persuading Tripp to deny any \n     knowledge of sexual impropriety by Clinton in the Jones \n     lawsuit. It is unclear who wrote the document.\n       On Jan. 15, Starr's office told the Justice Department \n     about Tripp's accusations. A panel of federal judges \n     authorized Starr to investigate whether Clinton and Jordan \n     had encouraged Lewinsky to lie under oath in her affidavit.\n       On Jan. 16, a Friday, the case reached an explosive state. \n     The Federal Bureau of Investigation confronted Lewinsky. That \n     day and the next, reporters began asking White House \n     officials pointed questions, including whether the president \n     had tried to influence other people's testimony in Jones vs. \n     Clinton, a former White House official said. News of Starr's \n     expanded investigation had already leaked.\n       Clinton knew none of this. Nor did he know, as he \n     confronted Mrs. Jones on Jan. 17, that he would be so \n     extensively questioned about Lewinsky. Mrs. Jones lawyers \n     appeared to know more details about Lewinsky than the \n     president's lawyers had anticipated.\n       The next morning, Clinton summoned Mrs. Currie to the White \n     House and reviewed with her some of the questions and answers \n     he had given the previous day about Lewinsky, said lawyers \n     familiar with Mrs. Currie's account. The president told her \n     he had never been alone with Lewinsky and that he had \n     resisted her sexual advances, these lawyers said.\n       If this was an effort at damage control, it failed. The \n     story of Tripp's tapes was already leaking out, and Starr was \n     already aiming this investigation directly at the White \n     House, preparing to summon a parade of aides, including Mrs. \n     Currie, to a grand jury.\n       On Jan. 21, a Wednesday, the inquiry was national news. \n     That day, Tripp signed an affivadit for Mrs. Jones' lawyers. \n     It said Lewinsky had ``revealed to me in detailed \n     conversations that she had a sexual relationship with \n     President Clinton since November 15, 1995.''\n       If that is so, the president ``committed perjury'' in his \n     sworn deposition, and ``embarked on a very aggressive cover-\n     up campaign'' afterward, one of Mrs. Jones' lawyers, Donovan \n     Campbell, said in court papers filed last Thursday.\n       Those charges are now at the heart of one of the strangest \n     investigations ever carried out against a president of the \n     United States.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. So I just want to end this part of my discussion by \nsaying we have heard a lot about the rule of law recently, about how it \napplies. Now, how about how it applies to those who are supposed to \nenforce the law, how it applies to Ken Starr and the Office of \nIndependent Counsel?\n  Mr. Hyde went on many times in his opening and closing arguments \nabout what this teaches our kids about honesty and truthfulness, that \nthe rule of law means something. Well, yes, it means something. It \nmeans something to our kids and future generations that honesty and \ntruthfulness and the rule of law also applies to those who are cloaked \nwith the authority to enforce that law. We must teach our kids that the \nends do not justify the means, that law enforcement officials cannot \nbreak the law in order to bring someone to the bar of justice.\n  So now, in this long process, the case is before the House Judiciary \nCommittee. And only Ken Starr testifies on the facts. He gives them all \nthese documents. But it is interesting to note, he does that before the \nelection. He waits until after the election to give them all the \nWhitewater, Filegate, and Travelgate charges, which he drops. That \nhappens after the election. They hear Ken Starr. And it is interesting \nto note that at the end of his long testimony, every Republican on the \nHouse Judiciary Committee gives him a standing ovation. What kind of \npolitical statement does that make? This was nothing like the kind of \nbalanced evidentiary material given the Judiciary Committee in the \nHouse by Leon Jaworski in the Watergate case concerning then-President \nNixon.\n  So in summary, what we have here is an out-of-control independent \ncounsel with his own political agenda and vendetta, a blank check to \nspend millions to look into every nook and cranny of President \nClinton's public as well as personal life. You add this to a zealous \ngroup of House Republican Judiciary Committee members who fanned the \nflames, and some Members who already, prior to this, filed a resolution \nto impeach the President. What you have here is a blatant, vindictive \npolitical case.\n  The American people figured it out a long time ago. They know the \ntruth of what happened. And the truth is very simple. The President had \na consensual, illicit affair with a young woman. He tried to cover it \nup. He misled others to cover it up. That is the truth. All this other \nstuff we are delving into is the details of about who touched who \nwhere, how many times they met, who exchanged gifts. The truth is \nsimple and straightforward, and the American people figured it out, and \nthey have a judgment about this.\n  They said it is wrong, but it's personal. And he violated his \nmarriage oath, not his oath of office. It is a sin, but not a crime. It \nis between him and his wife and his family and his God. And it is not \nan impeachable offense. I have said many times the American people can \nabide sin but not hypocrisy.\n  Throughout this entire case, hypocrisy abounds. Much has been said \nabout the rule of law and the truthfulness and honesty regarding \nPresident Clinton. How about as it applies to Starr? How about \ntruthfulness, when he doesn't include, in his presentation, that very \nimportant statement that Monica Lewinsky said: ``No one ever asked me \nto lie''? How about honesty when it comes to him not providing \nexculpatory material?\n  Having failed to get Bill Clinton on the stated reasons for the \nindependent counsel--on Whitewater, Travelgate and Filegate--they shift \nto illicit sex and a classic sting operation.\n  So we are left with two charges. Perjury. This falls far short, and \nthere is no evidence to support the fact that he perjured himself \nbefore the jury. Evasive? Yes. Dodging? Yes. But not knowingly making a \nfalse statement under oath material to the case. Doesn't fit.\n  Second article. Obstruction of justice. The House managers built \ntheir case on what they called the seven pillars of obstruction, which \nwe have seen turned out to be seven sand castles of speculation. I \nthink the most telling point was Monica Lewinsky, on her own tape last \nSaturday, when Mr. Bryant asked her, ``You didn't have a personal \nreason to file a false affidavit?'' And she said, ``Yes, I did.'' He \nsaid, ``Why?'' She said, ``Because I didn't want to get involved with \nthe Jones case. I didn't think it was any of their business.'' End of \nstory on obstruction because everything else rests on that.\n  That is why I have said, the more we look at this case, the more it \nis a counterfeit case. Like a counterfeit dollar bill, even to a \ntrained eye, you look and it may look real, but you put it under a \nmicroscope and you see it's counterfeit. That's what happened in this \ncase.\n  The House managers' case was based on inferences and conjecture. The \nWhite House's case was based on direct facts in evidence, and that is \nthe difference.\n  In closing, two wrongs don't make a right. President Clinton did have \nan illicit affair. It was wrong and demeaning. Ken Starr abused \njustice, set up a sting operation, the wiring of Linda Tripp, the \nleaks, the salacious material.\n  Clinton's wrong, I submit, was more of a sin. Ken Starr's wrong is \nmore of a crime. The damage to the rule of law is done more by Ken \nStarr than by Bill Clinton. At the beginning, I said the House had a \nheavy burden, given the history and partisanship of this case, to prove \narticles I and II and that they rise to an impeachable level. They \nnever met that burden. Accordingly, I will vote not guilty on both \ncharges.\n  Finally, as you know, there has been much talk of a censure \nresolution. As I said before, I said I believe the appropriate form is \nfor each Senator to express his or her opinion on this matter. I \npersonally see no need to join 99 others, and in doing so, set a \ndangerous precedent that could be easily abused in the future. So here \nis my censure of the President.\n  I want to state emphatically, I do not condone his behavior that has \nbeen so thoroughly exposed and seared in the American conscious ad \nnauseam. It is the sordid affair of all sordid affairs. The President \nbrought dishonor to himself. He brought tremendous pain and \nembarrassment to his family, friends and colleagues. And rather than \nennobling the Presidency, his behavior has been the butt of jokes and \nridicule.\n  This behavior was totally at odds with his many achievements and \nconduct in his official capacity as President. The President has stated \nclearly he has sinned and that he has misled his family, his friends, \nhis staff, and the American people. He has said that he is sorry and he \nhas asked for forgiveness.\n\n[[Page S1574]]\n\n  I do so now and say it is time to put this sad chapter behind us; \nmove on to the important work of this Nation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. Chief Justice, I extend to you my personal appreciation \nfor the dignity that you have extended to each of us during these \nproceedings. I also say that I have been disappointed. It appears the \nvote is going to be very comparable to the vote in the House, down \npartisan lines, even though during the break I understand two of my \ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle announced that they would \nnot vote for conviction on the articles of impeachment.\n  But in spite of this, I want to extend my appreciation to the \nRepublican leaders. Senator Nickles has been available any time that \nthere is a problem that has arisen during this proceeding. And you, \nSenator Lott, have 10 more votes than we have and you on many occasions \nduring this proceeding could have steamrolled us. You chose not to do \nthat. I think that is the reason we have had this feeling of harmony, \neven though we have had some disagreement on what is going to \ntranspire. So I, again, on behalf of all Democratic Senators, express \nour appreciation to you for the work you have done.\n  Often as I stand before this body, I am reminded of the lessons of \ngreat books. Today, though, the beginning of a novel keeps running \nthrough my mind--Charles Dickens' ``A Tale of Two Cities'':\n\n       It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\n\n  I have often felt, these last weeks, as if I were trapped in a work \nof fiction. Like all really interesting fiction, the story now before \nus reduces itself to an examination of the human soul--or, to be more \naccurate, to an examination of human souls. I use the plural because \nthis trial has been about the flaws of two people, each with the gifts \nto make them great, and of the contrast between them--one who has \nfailed to rise above his flaws and the other who has embraced them. \nMuch of what we call great literature is about the petty failings which \ndestroy great men. It is about how common sins, of which we are all to \nsome degree guilty, bring low the mighty and turn to ashes the fruits \nof victory in the mouths of monarchs.\n  We have heard much in this historic Senate Chamber about the judgment \nof history, but I daresay that, even more than by historians, the \ntruest judgment of these events will be written as novels and plays. On \nthe one level, these works will deal with some or all of the seven \ndeadly sins: Pride, anger, greed, gluttony, sloth, envy, and, yes, \nespecially lust.\n  But on another level, those plays and novels will deal with the theme \nof all literature. They will be written about conflicts between great \nmen, great men who are flawed; great men, each with their own public \nand private failings. We are here to sit in judgment of the President \nof the United States, a very public man, for his very private failings. \nBill Clinton fell from grace. Driven by the private sin of lust, he \nviolated his marriage vows and when his sins were uncovered by his \nenemies, he tried to conceal them by lying to his wife, his friends, \nand ultimately to all of us. It is a common story, the sin of lying. It \nbegins in the Old Testament with many examples--Cain, of course, is a \ngood example, who asked, ``Am I my brother's keeper?''--and with the \nlie, the kiss of Jesus by Judas Iscariot in the New Testament.\n  It may be the beginning of a great work of art, it may be the first \nchapter in a summer day's light reading, but it is not a good reason, \nit is not the beginning of a good reason, for removing an elected \nPresident of the United States.\n  The core issue is one which has apparently eluded many in this \nCapitol, but which is obvious to the American people. Great dreams are \ndreamed by people with human flaws. Great policies and actions are \nsometimes set in motion by those with broken souls. Great deeds are not \nalways done by good men. Recent history gives us many examples. Winston \nChurchill, one of my heroes, a man who initially stood alone in leading \nthe defense of Western civilization, was by most standards an \nalcoholic--at least modern standards. Franklin Roosevelt, Churchill's \nstalwart comrade and the author of policies which saved the very lives \nof families of many in this Chamber today, died in the arms of his \nlover. Each of us, each one of us in this Chamber, every human being, \nis flawed. Each of us needs all the forgiveness and forbearing we can \nbe granted by the charity of others.\n  Bill Clinton has been a friend of the State of Nevada. He has been a \nfriend to me. But he has committed grievous wrongs against his family \nand his friends. He has dishonored his high office and lowered the \nstandard of public behavior. I have no doubt that he has strayed from \nthe path of goodness. But I do have very real doubts as to whether he \nperjured himself or suborned perjury. But I have no doubt whatsoever \nthat, under the circumstances of this case, the crimes alleged do not \nrise to the level of an impeachable offense. Because of what the \nPresident did in public and in violation of the public trust, if I have \nthe opportunity I will vote to censure. I will not vote to impeach.\n  I said a few moments ago that great men are not always good men. But \nthere is an obvious corollary: Good men are not always capable of doing \ngreat deeds and they are not even always capable of doing good. I began \ntoday by saying this trial was about the flaws of two people. Both are \nmen with God-given gifts. Both are extraordinary in their intellect, \nperseverance, and dedication to certain core values. Both are capable \nof great goodness and even good greatness. Both have sinned. One is the \nPresident of the United States. His sins are of the flesh and of the \nspirit. About these I have already spoken. The other is the special \nprosecutor, Ken Starr, who has pursued the President beyond all bounds \nof reason and decency. His are the sins of unremitting, undiluted, \nunrepentant McCarthyism. They are the sins of pride, the sins of \nanger--they are damning sins indeed.\n  I don't use lightly McCarthy's name or accuse others of his tactics. \nI am old enough to remember how he misused and abused this sacred \nChamber. My friend and my client, the late newspaper publisher, Hank \nGreenspun, was a victim of his lies, a victim who had the courage to \nstand up and fight back. Others fought, but many also suffered \nirreparable harm because of Senator McCarthy.\n  I know McCarthy's tactics were the back room stab, the whispered \nsmear, the half-truth, the leaked calumny. I know that he subpoenaed \nwitnesses and forced them to choose between betraying their friends or \ncommitting perjury. I know he destroyed the careers of innocent men and \nwomen, drove some to suicide and sent others to jail. But at least \nMcCarthy had an excuse, of sorts. For all his lies, leaks and libels, \nthere really was a Communist threat. There really were Communist spies. \nSome of the people he accused really did commit treason. They were \nguilty of treason. At least, Mr. Chief Justice, McCarthy and his \ncohorts had that excuse. Kenneth Starr doesn't have an excuse.\n  Before I came to the national legislature 17 years ago, I was a trial \nlawyer. At various times, I prosecuted and defended people charged with \ncrimes. Long before that, I served as a police officer. I never argued \na case in the U.S. Supreme Court, but I tried more than 100 jury \ntrials, hundreds of other cases before various courts, and argued \nbefore different appellate courts. I tried criminal cases, lots of \nthem, and I know something about when a case should be pursued and when \nit should be dismissed. I know something about the impact that a \ncriminal charge has on any man or woman, about how they agonize over \ntelling their children, how they struggle to face the community. I know \nsomething about prosecutorial misconduct, and I know something about \nprosecutorial discretion.\n  Every American is entitled to equal justice, no matter their rank in \nsociety; equal justice but not equally unfair justice.\n  The independent counsel's argument throughout his tenure seems to be \nthat any U.S. attorney, any criminal prosecutor would treat any \ndefendant in the same unredeemedly savage and unfair fashion in which \nMr. Starr and his office have treated the witnesses, the defendants in \nperipheral cases and the President of the United States. Almost $60 \nmillion has been spent--Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate and now this. \nI think not.\n  No prosecutor of integrity, of principle, of fairness would have \ntried to\n\n[[Page S1575]]\n\nbootstrap a sexual affair into something criminal. A truly independent \nprosecutor would not make deals time after time with organizations \nestablished to embarrass the President, cavort with attorneys for Paula \nJones, do business with Linda Tripp and others to entrap the President. \nA fairminded prosecutor would not have leaked salacious details to the \npress in an effort to force the target to resign from office. And, most \nfervently, a principled prosecutor would have the common sense and the \ncommon decency not to misuse their office to go all out, no holds \nbarred, to ``get'' that targeted individual out of pride, anger and \nenvy.\n  I invite each of you to look at Justice Scalia's brilliant dissent in \nthe Morrison versus Olson case where he talks about the \nconstitutionality of the independent prosecutor. He predicted what we \nare now witnessing. Justice Scalia was visionary. Here is one of the \nthings he said:\n\n       The context of this statute is acrid with the smell of \n     threatened impeachment.\n\n  He was right. What else did he say? His opinion was 8 or 9 years ago. \nHe said then:\n  . . . Congress appropriates approximately $50 million annually for \ngeneral legal activities, salaries, and expenses of the Criminal \nDivision of the Department of Justice.\n  Fifty million dollars the whole year covers everything for the whole \ncivil division of the Department of Justice. We are spending more than \nthat to go after one man. Scalia could see that coming.\n  He also said, and my friend, the Senator from Vermont, earlier today \ntalked about what Justice Jackson had said, but he also quoted Scalia. \nScalia said:\n\n       If the prosecutor is obliged to choose his case, it follows \n     that he can choose his defendants. Therein is the most \n     dangerous power of the prosecutor: that he will pick people \n     that he thinks he should get, rather than cases that need to \n     be prosecuted. . . . it is not a question of discovering the \n     commission of a crime and then looking for the man who has \n     committed it, it is a question of picking the man and then \n     searching the law books, or putting investigators to work, to \n     pin some offense on him.\n\n  Justice Scalia could see this coming, and we got just what he said we \nwould get.\n  This is a bad situation. When you have someone of the brilliance of \nKen Starr and the viciousness of Ken Starr, you get what we have here \ntoday.\n  I want to use this occasion to say something to the American people, \nto the people of the State of Nevada, to leave them with the hope that \nthose in high office have not been bereft of all reason, sense and \nsensibility. What the President did was wrong. It was immoral. I don't \nbelieve it constitutes a crime justifying his removal from office. What \nMr. Starr did, and continues to do, is also wrong, and it is also \nimmoral.\n  But their conduct is not the standard to which we must hold \nourselves. We, all of us in Government, can do better. We must do \nbetter. The American people have the right to expect that or it doesn't \nmatter how great we are, how great our ideas or how powerful our \nvalues. Set the standard high and judge by that standard. That is how \nthe system is supposed to work, and in the long run it is how our \nconstitutional form of government, with a legacy of more than 200 \nyears, has worked and, with the help of a power greater than any of us, \nwill continue to work.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I add my praise, Mr. Chief Justice, for the work you \nhave done, but I would add one other thing. The last time I saw you \nbefore this impeachment trial you were leading a sing-along at the \nFourth Circuit Judicial Conference. I thought it might be a good idea \nfor this group.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. A healing device.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I have prepared remarks. \nBut I am not going to use them. I made that decision about 20 minutes \nago.\n  I have been sitting, listening to my fellow Senators speak, and I \nwant to speak to you from the heart. I want to speak to you about a \nstruggle, because I have been through a struggle. It is a real \nstruggle. And I suspect that there are an awful lot of you who have \nbeen through the same struggle--both before we voted on the motion to \ndismiss and, for me, since we voted on the motion to dismiss.\n  For me, the law is a sacred thing. And that is part of my life. I \nhave seen what the law can do. It is a powerful, powerful thing. It can \ndo extraordinary things for ordinary people. And I believe we have been \ngiven a sacred responsibility. I will tell you what that sacred \nresponsibility means to me personally. It means that when I walked in \nhere the first day of this impeachment trial I was 100 percent \ncompletely open to voting to remove this President.\n  And I have to tell you all something, my friends on this side of the \naisle, that wasn't a hard thing for me to do. I think this President \nhas shown a remarkable disrespect for his office, for the moral \ndimensions of leadership, for his friends, for his wife, for his \nprecious daughter. It is breathtaking to me the level to which that \ndisrespect has risen.\n  So I said to myself, what is the right and fair thing to do? And this \nis what I have done. I have looked--many times until 3 a.m. in the \nmorning--at the evidence in this case. Because I think that is the way \nwe need to make this decision.\n  The perjury charge, I believe, is just not there. The evidence is not \nthere to support it. I know many of you believe it is there. I respect \nyour view on that. I don't believe it is there. The obstruction charge \nis a totally different matter. And this is the way I have thought about \nthe obstruction charge.\n  I view, in my mind's eye, the scales of justice. And on one side, \nwhere the prosecution makes an allegation, I put their evidence. On the \nother side I put the defense evidence. And I do believe that for a \ncharge this serious that the proper standard is beyond a reasonable \ndoubt.\n  So after that evidence is put on both sides of the scale of justice, \nwhat happens? I want to just very briefly go through what I think are \nthe four main charges for obstruction.\n  First, the false affidavit. The prosecution side: There is, in my \njudgment, clearly a false affidavit. The President had a conversation \nwith Monica Lewinsky about filing an affidavit where he said to her, \n``You can file an affidavit; that might be a way for you to avoid \ntestifying.'' That is on the prosecution side.\n  I want to make a really important point for me personally here. I \nthink there is an enormous difference between what has been proven and \nwhat we suspect, because I have to tell you all, I suspect a lot that \nhas not been proven.\n  What is on the defense side? On the defense side: what has been \nproven in this case is that President Clinton never saw the affidavit, \nnever had a discussion with anyone about the contents of that \naffidavit. He didn't know what was in it. He never told, according to \nher, Monica Lewinsky or anyone what should be in the affidavit.\n  So that is the evidence on the scales of justice: One for the \nprosecution; that evidence for the defense. For me it is a very clear \nthing. The scales tilt in favor of the defense, and they certainly \ndon't tilt strongly enough to be beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  The second charge--and the one that bothers me the most--coaching \nBetty Currie. The evidence on the side of the prosecution: President \nClinton has a conversation with Betty Currie just after he has been \nquestioned in his deposition where he makes very declarative statements \nto her--it happens twice--very declarative statements to her about what \nhe remembers, many of which we now know to be false. And his \nexplanation for that conversation lacks credibility, to say the least, \nthat he was trying to refresh his memory. I doubt if anybody buys that. \nThat is on one side, that is on the prosecution side.\n  What is on the other side? On the other side we have Betty Currie \nsaying it had no influence on her. But that is not the most troublesome \nthing for me. The troublesome thing is this: For that conversation to \nbe obstruction of justice, it must have been proven that it was \nPresident Clinton's intent to affect her sworn testimony.\n  Now, what are the other possibilities? We have a man who has just \nbeen confronted with this problem, who is political by nature. And do \nwe really believe that the first thing he thought about is, ``I'm going \nto go protect myself legally''? I suspect the first thing he thought \nabout is ``I'm going to protect myself politically.'' He was worried \nabout his family finding out. He\n\n[[Page S1576]]\n\nwas worried about the rest of the staff finding out. He was worried \nabout the press finding out. Do I know which of these things are true? \nAbsolutely not. I don't know which of them are true. Doesn't that \nanswer the question? If we don't know which of those things are true, \nhave they been proven? If we don't know what was in his head at that \nmoment, how can we find that the prosecution has proven intent beyond a \nreasonable doubt?\n  The third charge, the job search. On the prosecution side of the \nscales of justice, we have an intensified effort to find a job for \nMonica Lewinsky. I think that has been proven. I think that has been \nproven clearly. On the other side, we have testimony from Monica \nLewinsky that she was never promised a job for her silence. We have \nevidence that the job search, although not as intense, was going on \nbefore anyone knew she would be a witness. We have Vernon Jordan \ntestifying under oath--I sat there and watched it and looked him in the \neye--that there was never a quid pro quo, that the affidavit was over \nhere and the job search was over here.\n  The reality is, when you put all that evidence on the scale--\nprosecution evidence on one side, defense evidence on the other--at \nworst the scale stays even. And the prosecution has got to prove this \ncase in order to remove the President of the United States beyond a \nreasonable doubt. They just have not proven it no matter what we \nsuspect. No matter what we suspect. So that is the false affidavit \nwhich we have talked about, coaching Betty Currie, the job search.\n  Now to the gifts. Let's see what the proof is. What is the proof--not \nthe suspicion. On the prosecution side, we know that the President's \nsecretary went to Monica Lewinsky's house, got the gifts, took them \nhome and hid them under her bed. I have to tell you, on its face, that \nis awful suspicious, and it is strong, heavy evidence. The problem is, \nthere is evidence on the other side. That evidence doesn't stand alone.\n  First, we have the testimony of Betty Currie that Monica Lewinsky \ncalled her. Second, we have the fact that President Clinton gave her \nother gifts on that Sunday, which makes no sense to me. I heard the \nHouse managers try to explain it away. I have been a lawyer for 20 \nyears, and I have been in that place of trying to explain away \nsomething that makes no sense. It doesn't make sense. Monica Lewinsky, \nherself, testified that she brought up the issue of gifts--not \nPresident Clinton--and that the most President Clinton ever said was \nsomething to the effect of ``I'm not sure. Let me think about that.''\n  Now when that evidence goes on the defense side and the only evidence \non the prosecution side is the fact that those gifts are sitting under \nthe bed of Betty Currie, what happens to the scale? At best, the scale \nstays even. In my judgment, it actually tilts for the defense. There is \nno way it rises to the level of ``beyond a reasonable doubt.''\n  Every trial I have ever been in has had one moment, one \nquintessential moment when the entirety of the trial was described, and \nin this case we have such a moment. There was a question that had my \nname on it. The reality is, Senator Kohl wrote it--I tagged on--but it \nwas a great question. The question was, Is this a matter about which \nreasonable people can differ? I will never forget Manager Lindsey \nGraham coming to this microphone and his answer was ``Absolutely.'' Now \nif the prosecution concedes that reasonable people can differ about \nthis, how can we not have reasonable doubt?\n  These things all lead me to the conclusion that however reprehensible \nthe President's conduct is, I have to vote to acquit on both articles \nof impeachment.\n  I have one last thing I want to say to you all, and it is actually \nmost important. If you don't remember anything else I said, and you \nweren't listening to anything else I have said, please listen to what I \nam about to say because it is so important to me.\n  I have learned so much during the 30 days that I have been here. I \nhave had a mentor in Senator Byrd, who has probably been a mentor to \nmany others before me. I have formed friendships with people on both \nsides. Senators Leahy and Dodd, who I worked with on these \ndepositions--wonderful, wonderful Senators. I have learned what \nleadership is about from these two men sitting right here--Senators \nLott and Daschle. I have loved working with Senators DeWine and \nThompson. And Senator Specter and I worked together on a deposition. He \nshowed me great deference and respect. I have no idea why, but he did; \nand I appreciate it. I have deep respect and admiration for my senior \nSenator from North Carolina, who has been extraordinarily kind and \ngracious to me since I arrived here.\n  Let me tell you what I will be thinking about when my name is called \nand I cast my vote, hopefully tomorrow. I will be thinking about juries \nall over this country who are sitting in deliberation in rooms that are \nnot nearly as grand as this but who are struggling, just as you all \nhave and I have, to do the right thing. I have to say, I have a \nboundless faith in the American people sitting on those juries. They \nwant to do what is right. They want to do what is right in the worst \nkind of way.\n  An extraordinary thing has happened to me in the last 30 days. I have \nwatched you struggle, every one of you. I have watched you come to this \npodium. I have listened to what you have had to say. I talked to you \ninformally; I watched you suffer. I believe in my heart that every \nsingle one of you wants to do the right thing. The result of that for \nme is a gift. And that gift is that I now have a boundless faith in \nyou.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. Chief Justice and esteemed colleagues, I rise to offer \nmy thoughts on the momentous decision we will render shortly. At the \nstart, I deeply regret that the American people have been denied the \nopportunity to hear the Senate's final deliberations on the impeachment \ncharges against President Clinton. I say this because I have been \nthoroughly impressed with the thought, tenor, and passion brought to \nthis deliberation by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I wish \nthe American people could have the opportunity to observe what I have \nhad the privilege of witnessing for the past two days. Whether seated \nin the gallery, watching on television, listening on radio, or \nfollowing on-line, the public would have benefitted tremendously from \nthe opportunity to hear, in real time and full context each of our \nremarks. The opportunity to read a transcript later this week in the \nRecord will not come close to viewing these proceedings. It lacks the \npower of the moment.\n  when I took the oath to do impartial justice on January 7, 1999, I \nknew, as one of 100 Senators, that I was assuming the unique role of \njudge and juror in the Senate impeachment trial of William Jefferson \nClinton. Over these weeks, I have listened to the presentations by the \nHouse Managers, the White House counsel, and the President's defense \nteam without prejudice. I have analyzed the video testimony of Monica \nLewinsky, Vernon Jordan, and Sidney Blumenthal, and read numerous grand \njury transcripts, the referral from the Independent Counsel, and the \nHouse report and related documents.\n  The House of Representatives approved two articles of impeachment by \nstraight party line votes after bitter and divisive partisan debate, \nforwarding to the Senate the impeachment articles to remove the \nPresident of the United States as authorized by the Constitution. At \nthe same time, the partisan nature of the House action invites \nchallenge to its legitimacy. And, although we have more often than not \nvoted along party lines during the impeachment trial, I am proud of \nthis body and its genuine effort to pursue a bipartisan course during \nour trial of the President. We have disagreed without being \ndisagreeable.\n  The body has not strayed too far from the comity and tone that marked \nour first bipartisan caucus to set the framework for this proceeding.\n  We have taken the admonition of the senior Senator from West Virginia \nto heart and avoided descending into the pit of caustic partisanship \nand recrimination.\n  After reviewing volumes of evidence and weighing weeks of \npresentations before the Senate, I have concluded that a case has not \nbeen made on either of the articles of impeachment against President \nClinton. Conviction and removal from office, as charged by the House \nManagers, is simply not warranted.\n\n[[Page S1577]]\n\n  The record does not sustain the level of proof necessary to convict \nand remove the President. Certain facts are indisputable: the President \nlied to the American people and to his wife and daughter about an \nextramarital affair; he lied to his staff; and he was misleading in his \ndeposition in the Jones v. Clinton civil suit and his grand jury \ntestimony.\n  However, impeachment is not a Constitutional means to punish a \nPresident ``when he gets out of bounds,'' as proposed by the House \nManagers. The constitutional standard is whether high crimes and \nmisdemeanors were committed, and that test has not been met.\n  In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee rejected an article of \nimpeachment against President Nixon based on the filing of a false tax \nreturn. I was reasoned that the President's misleading tax return was \nunrelated to his duties as president, although a minority believed the \ncount was unsupported by the evidence. Thus we see that all crimes that \nmay be punishable by the courts are not punishable by impeachment.\n  Rather, impeachment is narrowly limited by the Constitution to \noffenses of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and \nmisdemeanors. After listening to many presentations on this issue, I am \nconvinced that impeachment and removal from office should only be used \nfor crimes against the country or threats to our national security.\n\n  Our founding fathers carefully defined the terms of impeachment in a \nmanner that establishes a high threshold and requires the charges to be \nof an egregious nature. That is why the Senate has only once before \nheld an impeachment trial for a President.\n  The House Managers recommend impeachment because it is the only way \nin which the President's misconduct can be punished. Yet, I remind my \ncolleagues that the President remains subject to criminal and civil \npenalties after he leaves office in two years.\n  As I will point out, the facts and other evidence accumulated and \npresented to the Senate do not meet the constitutional standard for \nimpeachment and removal that our founding fathers established.\n  Article One charges the President with perjury before the grand jury \nin August 1998, for willfully giving false testimony under oath in a \njudicial proceeding. Yet to prove this charge the House Managers \nintroduced material from the Jones suit during their Senate \npresentation even though the House rejected an article of impeachment \ndealing with Paula Jones suit. Nonetheless, despite this blurring of \nthe lines between criminal and civil matters, a perjury conviction \nrequires that the testimony be material to the case at hand. Judge \nSusan Webber Wright's rulings in the Jones case specifically excluded \nevidence concerning Monica Lewinsky because it was immaterial.\n  Furthermore, Thomas Sullivan, former U.S. Attorney for the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois, testified before the House Judiciary Committee \nthat perjury ``can be particularly arcane, including the requirements \nthat the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \nknew his testimony to be false at the time he or she testified, that \nthe alleged false testimony was material, and that any ambiguity or \nuncertainty about what the question or answer meant must be construed \nin favor of the defendant.'' Mr. Sullivan also noted that generally, \n``federal prosecutors do not use the criminal process in connection \nwith civil litigation involving private parties,'' because, ``there are \nwell established remedies available to civil litigants who believe \nperjury or obstruction has occurred.''\n  Article Two charges the President with seven different instances of \nobstruction of justice. The House Managers insist that the evidence \nshows that these separate acts constitute a deliberate attempt by the \nPresident to obstruct justice. The White House argues that the \nPresident did not seek to influence witnesses nor impede discovery. \nLegal scholars have argued that the lumping together of these seven \ncharges would cause most courts to throw out the charges, and witness \ntestimony undermines the House charges. After the smoke cleared from \nthe charges and countercharges, it was evident to me that the \nconnections between the actions of the President and the actions by the \nwitnesses were circumstantial, at best.\n  Moreover, I agree with White House counsel Charles F. Ruff, who in \nhis closing arguments said of the House Managers, ``I believe their \nvision to be too dark, a vision too little attuned to the needs of the \npeople, too little sensitive to the needs of our democracy.''\n  In the obstruction of justice count, the Managers charge the \nPresident with asking Monica Lewinsky to lie, a charge that she denies \nin two dozen depositions, and testimony given under the protection of \nimmunity. There is no evidence that the President ever asked her to \nprovide a false affidavit in the Jones case or to testify falsely. \nVernon Jordan, the President's close friend and advisor, testified that \nalthough he met with Ms. Lewinsky and was given a draft of the \naffidavit, he refused to review the document and referred the young \nwoman to her attorney for advice and counsel.\n  The House Managers say the President is guilty of obstructing justice \nwhen he ordered his secretary, Betty Currie, to retrieve gifts given by \nthe President to Monica Lewinsky. However, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, on \na number of occasions, indicates that it was she who asked Mrs. Currie \nto keep the gifts, not the President.\n  The House states that the President asked Vernon Jordan to intensify \nan on-going job search in Ms. Lewinsky's behalf after Judge Webber \nWright ruled that Paula Jones's attorney could investigate the \nPresident's sexual relations with state or federal employees.\n  Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky first met in November 1997, a month \nbefore Ms. Lewinsky was listed as a witness in the Jones case. Sinister \nmotives do not appear to be involved in the inquiries by Mr. Jordan on \nher behalf that led to two job rejections and one job offer. Efforts by \nthe House Managers to link the job search and the affidavit unravel \nwhen the dates on which Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky first met, when Ms. \nLewinsky's name first appeared on the Paula Jones case witness list, \nand the drafting of the affidavit are analyzed.\n  The President, Ms. Lewinsky, and Mr. Jordan have testified that no \none was seeking Ms. Lewinsky's silence, and Ms. Lewinsky further \ntestified that she realized in October 1997 that she would not be \nreturning to the White House for employment and she renewed her job \nsearch in New York City.\n  The additional testimonies of Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Jordan, and Mr. \nBlumenthal added no new information to the case against the President. \nI voted against deposing these witnesses since they already had been \ndeposed many times.\n  Moreover, we each received thousands of pages of testimony from the \ngrand jury, various depositions, statements given under oath, and \ndocuments relating to the impeachment charges. We know that Ms. \nLewinsky had been questioned on at least 23 separate occasions, \nincluding after the President's grand jury testimony and as recently as \nJanuary 22, 1999, by the House prosecutors before testifying February \n1, 1999, on video. During arguments in favor of deposing Ms. Lewinsky, \nHouse Manager Bryant urged the deposition because he believed the \nSenate should observe her demeanor, her tone, and her tenor in \nresponding to questions.\n  I respectfully disagreed with Mr. Bryant then, as I do now. My \ndecision was bolstered when I viewed Ms. Lewinsky's videotaped \ntestimony in which she reaffirmed her grand jury testimony. I saw no \npurpose in bringing her to the witness table again, nor Mr. Jordan, who \nhad been questioned five times, nor Mr. Blumenthal, who has answered \nquestions under oath four times. These witnesses did not change their \ntestimonies, nor did they provide information that was omitted in \nprevious testimony.\n  The witnesses' statements are a matter of record, and they comprise \nthousands of pages encompassed in the volumes of testimony and sworn \naffidavits that are the basis of the House articles of impeachment. I \nconcur with House majority counsel David Schippers who said during the \nHouse Judiciary impeachment proceedings, ``As it stands, all of the \nfactual witnesses are uncontradicted and amply corroborated.''\n  In conclusion, I cannot overstate my disappointment with the actions \nof the\n\n[[Page S1578]]\n\nPresident. He deliberately misled the American people and greatly \ndiminished the public's trust in the office of the presidency. However, \nI have concluded that the two articles of impeachment, as drafted and \npresented by the House, fail to meet the level of high crimes and \nmisdemeanors, and I will vote to acquit the President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a fairly lengthy brief on this issue be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent to have my \nremarks made part of the public record.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Chief Justice, like others, I want to thank you for \nyour professionalism and good humor in these proceedings even though I \nsuspect there are days that both you and I wish we were back at our \nhomes in Vermont rather than here.\n  But I want to tell the Senators also of an extraordinary day that my \ngood friend, Senator Stevens of Alaska, and I spent. We left Sunday \nafternoon from Washington for the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan. We \ncame back at about 2 o'clock yesterday morning. The delegation was an \nextraordinary one: Two other Members of Congress, senior members of the \nPresident's staff; even the parents of the King's widow, Queen Noor of \nJordan, were with us.\n  And the airplane, Air Force One, that is so recognizable around the \nworld as a symbol of America, underscored our country's presence even \nas it landed. And Ted will recall the TV was on in the plane. We could \nsee they interrupted national television in Jordan to show our plane \nlanding. What was most remarkable to the people assembled from around \nthe world for the funeral was the dramatic appearance not only of the \nPresident of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton, but three \nformer U.S. Presidents--Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush--they \njoined with President Clinton as an extraordinary demonstration not \nonly of bipartisanship but of a united American commitment to the peace \npolicies of King Hussein, and the U.S. role in a continuing peace \nprocess.\n  The symbol of American presence and the American continuity could not \nhave been stronger with these four Presidents. It was a privilege to be \nthere, a privilege I will always cherish.\n  In the frenetic hours on the ground, I observed the leaders from the \nMiddle East and around the world.\n  I saw leader after leader making a strong effort to come to President \nClinton and to speak with him. I listened to his conversation. It was \nclear to me he had a very good understanding of the issues that faced \nnot only our country, but their country, and an understanding about how \nAmerica's interest affect all of us.\n  Probably the greatest contrast was in President Clinton's brief \nmeeting with Boris Yeltsin, the President of Russia, a country that \nlong symbolized our polar opposite during the cold war. We saw an aging \nPresident Yeltsin, unable to stand without two men helping him, a man \nwho had to leave very shortly thereafter--well before the funeral was \nover--because his strength had faded. What a contrast.\n  We saw a dynamic Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of England. We saw \nthe leaders of Israel, Japan, Syria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya, \nPakistan, India, Germany, France, Ireland, Egypt, and others coming \ntogether, brought together by their respect for King Hussein. Much of \ntheir attention was focused on the leader of the United States.\n  The questions raised by this trial came back to me. I thought, do we \nabandon our elected leader because of concern about his personal \nconduct? Now, if this question was in my mind, it was in the minds of a \nlot of people there. I have been privileged to know many of them, and \nmany asked me the question, Are we really serious about impeachment and \nremoval? They asked that because they said the United States is not a \nparliamentary system of government, and the one thing that they can \nrely on is when we elect a President, even if it is not the President \nthey wished we had elected, there are 4 years to deal with him and they \ncan determine their foreign policy with the most powerful Nation on \nEarth accordingly.\n  They said they have great respect for our strength and leadership, \nand they asked if it is really possible that partisanship in the \nCongress could destroy that heritage overnight.\n  In my notes, as I flew back throughout the dark night, I asked \nmyself, Are we going to spend our heritage of continuity and strength \nthis way? Are we going to convict the President on these charges in \nthis record? Are we going to destroy a heritage and continuity we \nearned, from our own Revolution, through a Civil War, through World \nWars, through deaths and assassinations of Presidents, through great \neconomic prosperity and devastating recession and depression. I \ncompleted my notes by writing, ``It is no longer a question of whether \nwe do this to Bill Clinton, but whether we do it to ourselves.''\n  The record of this impeachment trial is a time capsule. We leave it \nfor succeeding generations. As the trial began, we reopened the records \nof 1868. I looked at those records. I thought, someday someone will \nreview ours in the same way. We leave behind a trail of precedents. Our \nsuccessors will try to understand them. If we act wisely, they will try \nto emulate it. Our actions can stir a chord that will vibrate \nthroughout the history of our Republic.\n  So in explaining my decisions in this trial, I know that I am \naddressing myself to fellow Vermonters and fellow Senators, but also to \nfuture generations. In that future generation is my own grandson and \nperhaps even his grandchildren.\n  The conclusion I have reached on the articles of impeachment is \nimbued with this solemn knowledge and sense of duty. My conclusion is \nwe must not avenge the faults of William Jefferson Clinton upon our \nNation, our children and our Constitution.\n  Extreme partisanship and prosecutorial zealotry have strained this \nprocess in its critical early junctures. Partisan impeachments are \nlacking in credibility. The framers knew this. We all know this.\n  Socrates said: ``The greatest flood has soonest ebb; the sorest \ntempest, the most sudden calm.''\n  In many ways, I say to my friends, especially our two distinguished \nleaders who worked so hard on this, in many ways the Senate's work has \nbeen the calm after the storm. We began the 106th Congress, the last of \nthe 20th century, facing a challenge no Senate has been called upon to \naddress since the aftermath of the Civil War. We took a special oath \nadministered to Senators who must determine whether to override the \nelection by the people of the United States of their President and \nremove him from office.\n  The Constitution purposely restrains the Congress, and carefully \ncircumscribes our powers to remove the head of the executive branch of \nthe Federal Government. The Constitution intentionally makes it \ndifficult to override the electoral judgment of the American people. I \nwill cast my vote wary of the dangers posed by the House managers' \nseductive invitation to vote to remove the President for symbolic \npurposes.\n  We all agree the President's conduct was inexcusable. It was deeply \ndisappointing, especially to those who know the President and who \nsupport the many good things he has done for this country and the \nworld. His conduct in trying to keep this relationship secret from his \nwife and family, his friends and associates, from the public glare of a \npolitically charged lawsuit, may be understandable on the human level, \nbut it has had serious consequences for him personally and for the \nlegacy of his Presidency.\n  The President has admitted before a Federal grand jury terribly \nembarrassing personal conduct and has seen a videotape of that grand \njury testimony broadcast to the entire Nation, with excerpts replayed \nover and over again. This modern day version of the public stockade has \nbeen difficult to witness for those who know this man and his family \nand care about them.\n  The Jones lawsuit has now been settled and $850,000 has been paid on \na case that the District Court judge had dismissed for failing to state \na claim.\n  The Clinton Presidency has been permanently tarnished. The Senate \ntrial\n\n[[Page S1579]]\n\nprovided a forum to replay the embarrassing and humiliating facts of \nthe President's improper relationship. No one cay say the Presidency \nhas emerged unscathed.\n  For me, the most regrettable action is the nationally televised \nstatement to the American people, where he shook his finger defiantly \nand said the allegations were untrue. That was not charged in the \narticles of impeachment, but it was intended to mislead the American \npeople. That statement was wrong. And even though he later apologized \nfor his action, I feel strongly that no President should so \nintentionally deceive the American people.\n  But condemning the President is not the purpose of the impeachment \ntrial. Impeachment cannot be about punishing the officeholder. One of \nthe predecessors of mine and of Senator Jeffords, Senator George \nEdmunds of Vermont, explained in 1868, that:\n\n       [p]unishment by impeachment does not exist under our \n     Constitution. . ..[The accused] can only be removed from the \n     office he fills and prevented from holding office, not as \n     punishment, but as a means merely of protection to the \n     community. . ..\n\n  So our focus has to be on whether conduct which the House has charged \nhas been proven and warrants President Clinton's removal from office to \nprotect the public.\n  The President's indiscretions alone did not bring us to this point. \nRaising this matter to the level of a constitutional impeachment only \nbegan with the referral from the special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr. \nJustice Robert Jackson, when he was attorney general, observed that the \nmost dangerous power of prosecutors is the power to ``pick people that \nhe thinks he should get rather than cases that need to be prosecuted.'' \nI am concerned that is what has happened in the case of President \nClinton.\n  Does anyone recall after the fruitless years of investigation of this \nPresident, the past year of upheaval, that it was the talking points \ngiven to Ms. Tripp by Ms. Lewinsky which were supposed to be the \nsmoking gun that proved a vast conspiracy to suborning perjury? I don't \nthink anybody doubts Ms. Lewinsky's account that she wrote the talking \npoints based on her discussions with Ms. Linda Tripp, and she never \ndiscussed them with the President.\n  Monica Lewinsky consistently maintained that no one ever asked or \nencouraged her to lie; she was never promised a job for her silence. \nIndeed, in her 24th interview, the Senate videotaped deposition \ndemanded by the House managers, she testified to her own purposes in \nkeeping her relationship secret. She acted in what she thought was her \nown best interests. She sought to conceal this relationship because she \ndid not want to be humiliated in front of the whole world. And the \nrecord establishes it was Linda Tripp rather than President Clinton who \nacted in the conflicting roles as Ms. Lewinsky's intimate confidante \nand ultimate betrayer.\n  As a former prosecutor, one of the questions I asked is whether these \ncriminal charges of perjury and obstruction would have been brought \nagainst Bill Jones rather than Bill Clinton. Experienced prosecutors, \nRepublican and Democrat, testified before the House Judiciary Committee \nthat no prosecutor would have proceeded based on the record compiled by \nMr. Starr, and prosecutors I have talked to have said they wouldn't \neven get to a jury with it. As a former prosecutor, I agree and note \nthat during the course of the Senate proceeding, the case has gotten \nweaker.\n  The testimony in the record shows that Ms. Lewinsky had no intention \nof revealing her relationship with the President. She is the person who \noriginated and carried out the plan to hide certain gifts from the \nJones lawyers. The only crimes shown to possibly have occurred are not \nhigh crimes but those for which Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp have already \nreceived immunity from prosecution from Ken Starr. To influence our \njudgment, the managers have argued that the consequences of the \nPresident's acquittal of their unproven charges would be dire for our \nchildren, I have been married for 37 years to a woman I love; my wife \nand I have raised three wonderful children. I don't need the House of \nRepresentatives to tell me how to raise my children. I trust the \nparents of America to raise their children, to explain what the \nPresident did was wrong, to point out the humiliation and other \nconsequences brought on himself and his Presidency. That is not our the \nCongress' job. That is the job for parents in this country.\n  I don't believe the Constitution calls upon us to remove a duly \nelected President for symbolic purposes. Rather, I believe the \nprecedent set by conviction without proof and removal without \nconstitutional justification would be far more dangerous for our \nRepublic than his actions.\n  The House managers have warned that should the President be \nacquitted, it would damage the ``rule of law.'' I strongly disagree, \nbecause the supreme rule of law in this country is the Constitution; \nthat is what we have to uphold.\n  Partisan impeachment drives are doomed to fail. The Senate must \nrestore sanity to this impeachment process. We must exercise judgment \nand do justice. We have to act in the interest of the Nation. History \nwill judge us based on whether this case was resolved in a way that \nserves the good of the country, not the political ends of any party or \nthe fortunes of any person.\n  We have all talked about President Andrew Johnson's impeachment. Few \npeople will recall that after the unsuccessful effort to remove him \nfrom office, former President Johnson returned to serve this country as \na U.S. Senator. I look forward to the day when the Senate can close our \nwork as an impeachment court and that we can all return to our work--\nour important work we face as U.S. Senators representing our States.\n  I have served here with 259 Senators, including the 100 here now. I \nhave respected all of you. I have had great affection for many of you \non both sides of the aisle. I count among my best friends many Senators \non both sides of the aisle. This is a difficult time. I will not \nquestion any Senator's vote on this. But the Senator from Vermont \ncannot vote to convict and I will not.\n  Thank you.\n\n\n                              (EXHIBIT 1)\n\n       Procedural and Factual Insufficiencies in the The \n     Impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton by Senator Leahy\n\n\n                                Contents\n\n     I.

OATH OF OFFICE\n\n       On the first day of this Congress, the Vice President of \n     the United States administered the oath of office to the most \n     recently elected Members of the Senate. I was honored by the \n     people of Vermont to be among those Members and to take the \n     oath of office to serve here as a representative of Vermont. \n     With this oath I have again sworn to protect and defend the \n     Constitution of the United States.\n       We were reminded by the Majority Leader at the beginning of \n     the last Congress that the oath we take was formulated in \n     1868 to help bring the country back together. As Senator Lott \n     has noted, following the Civil War, some urged continued use \n     of an ironclad test oath that barred those who had served the \n     Confederacy from serving in the Federal Government. It took \n     ``nearly a quarter of a century of confusion and acrimony'' \n     for the Senate to settle upon the oath that we take today.\n       The same year in which our oath was developed, our country \n     experienced its first, and until now, its only presidential \n     impeachment trial. History has judged harshly the ``Radical \n     Republicans'' who pursued that impeachment against President \n     Andrew Johnson. A notable exception is William Maxwell \n     Evarts, a Vermonter who was criticized by many Republican \n     party leaders for defending a President of the opposite \n     political party.\n       I have been proud of another Vermonter, Gregory Craig, who \n     has played a critical role in the defense of President \n     Clinton. This\n\n[[Page S1580]]\n\n     Senate is the last of the 20th century. We began this first \n     session of the 106th Congress facing a challenge that no \n     other Senate in over 100 years has been called upon to \n     address. To deal with that challenge, we all took another \n     oath, an oath to do ``impartial justice according to the \n     Constitution and laws.'' That is the oath administered to \n     Senators who must determine whether to override the election \n     of the President of the United States and remove him from \n     office. That oath calls upon us to rise above partisan \n     politics and our personal feelings about President Clinton.\n       I focus first on the oaths we take to be Members of the \n     Senate and to serve in this impeachment trial since the House \n     Managers opened and closed their presentation to the Senate \n     pointing to the oaths the President swore to uphold when he \n     assumed on two occasions the office of the President.\n       The Managers have emphasized that the President's inaugural \n     oath of office imposes a constitutional duty to ``take Care \n     that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' Their argument is \n     that the presidential oath spelled out in Article II, section \n     1 of the Constitution establishes a special standard of \n     conduct for the President, and when the President violates a \n     law which he has sworn faithfully to execute, he should be \n     removed.\n       Frustrated by the restrictions placed on Congress's \n     impeachment power, which limits the grounds for removal to \n     ``Treason, Bribery or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' \n     the Managers seek to find alternative constitutional footing \n     to remove this President. But, the Constitution simply does \n     not say that a President shall be removed for ``Treason, \n     Bribery, or other conduct inconsistent with his presidential \n     oath and duties.'' Nor does it say that a President shall be \n     removed for ``Treason, Felony, or other Crime,'' which is the \n     formulation used in the Constitution's Extradition Clause.\n       The Framers purposely restrained the Congress and carefully \n     circumscribed our power to remove the head of the co-equal \n     Executive Branch of the Federal Government. As Professor \n     Laurence Tribe pointed out last November, during a House \n     subcommittee hearing on the history of impeachment, the \n     presidential oath and Take Care clause cannot properly be \n     invoked so as to make the President of the United States more \n     vulnerable to impeachment and removal from office than other \n     federal officials. ``[I]t simply cannot be the case under our \n     Constitution that removing a sitting president should be \n     easier, not harder, than removing a vice president, a cabinet \n     officer, or a sitting federal judge.''\n       The Managers have invited the Senate to lower the bar for \n     impeachment and removal of a President by distorting the \n     constitutional text and using the presidential oath in a \n     manner never contemplated by the Framers. I cast my vote \n     mindful of the dangers this seductive invitation poses not \n     only for this President but, more importantly, for the future \n     of the presidency and our constitutional framework.\n       As my oaths demand, I will work to protect and defend the \n     Constitution. I will continue to defend our constitutional \n     democracy against encroachments from all sides.\n       Over the last few years, we have seen scores of \n     constitutional amendments introduced each Congress and \n     several voted upon each year. I have spoken about the assault \n     by amendment being made against the Constitution and defended \n     the Constitution against these ``bumper sticker'' proposals \n     for constitutional edits. The impeachment of the President is \n     a matter of similar importance. What we do, in terms of the \n     standards we apply and the judgments we make, will either \n     follow the Constitution or alter the intent of the Framers \n     and lower those standards for all time. I have heard more \n     than one Senator acknowledge that in this sense it is not \n     just the President but also the Senate on trial in this \n     matter.\n       In considering what to do we cannot and must not ignore how \n     we arrived at this point lest our actions countenance \n     repetition in the future. We are now in a position to write \n     the lessons we want heeded by future Members who have the \n     privilege to serve America in Congresses into the next \n     century and millennium.\n\n\n                        II. HOW DID WE GET HERE?\n\n       When former Senator Dale Bumpers spoke to us about the task \n     before us, he posed a question that many of us have asked \n     ourselves over the course of these impeachment proceedings. \n     He asked, ``How do we come to be here?'' I raised virtually \n     the same question in an opinion editorial published on \n     December 13, 1998, in the Los Angeles Times. I noted Barbara \n     Tuchman's gripping account in The Guns of August of how the \n     world teetered into the catastrophe of World War I. She \n     recalled a former German chancellor's question to his \n     successor: ``How did it all happen?'' ``Ah, if only we \n     knew,'' was the reply.\n       Future generations may ask the same question of us as they \n     ponder not only how but also why this sorry episode of \n     admitted presidential misconduct led this great country to \n     the brink of paralysis over the possibility of removing a \n     popular President, whose leadership has given this country \n     not just a balanced budget but a surplus two years running, \n     the lowest unemployment in decades and the strongest economy \n     in the world. Our economy is in the best shape in a \n     generation in no small part because of the President's \n     economic policies. We should be working with the President to \n     make the hard choices and develop the bipartisan cooperation \n     that are needed to move the country forward into the 21st \n     Century with a secure Social Security, strong Medicare and \n     needed investments in education.\n       Instead, we find ourselves facing the first impeachment \n     trial of a duly-elected President and only the second \n     impeachment trial of a sitting President in the history of \n     this country. We find ourselves in this situation due to the \n     poor judgment of the President, whose personal conduct was \n     inexcusable; the antics of a Special Prosecutor run amok; and \n     the political posturing of partisan House Republican leaders, \n     who misconstrued the constitutional role of the House and \n     advanced a take-it-or-leave it strategy of impeachment or \n     nothing. Each step of this unfortunate process has notably \n     lacked one important element: the exercise of sound judgment.\n       That is why the country has looked to the Senate to restore \n     political sanity to this process. The demand on us is not \n     simply to uphold the ``rule of law,'' about which the \n     Managers have repeatedly lectured us. Our oath requires far \n     more than the ministerial act of applying the law to the \n     facts or accepting blindly the facts and conclusions \n     presented by either side in this trial. We are required to \n     evaluate the facts, not in isolation, but in the context of \n     our precedent and the history of impeachments, and with our \n     focus always on what is good for the country. In short, we \n     are required to do what has been missing up to now: exercise \n     judgment, and do so in an impartial fashion. The beginning \n     point in this process must start with the President.\n     A. The President's Conduct\n       We can all agree that the President's conduct with a young \n     woman who was working in the White House was wrong. It was \n     also deeply disappointing, especially to those who know the \n     President and who support the many good things he has done \n     for this country and the world. His conduct in trying to keep \n     his inexcusable relationship secret from his wife and family, \n     his friends and associates, and from the public glare of a \n     politically-charged lawsuit, though understandable on a human \n     level, has had terrible consequences for him personally and \n     for the legacy of his presidency.\n       For me, one of the President's most regrettable actions was \n     his nationally-televised statement to the American people in \n     which he shook his finger and defiantly told us that the \n     allegations were untrue. Although not charged in the Articles \n     of Impeachment, that statement was intended to mislead the \n     American people with respect to the nature of his \n     relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. While I understand the \n     pressures that he was under at the time, that statement was \n     wrong. Although the President later apologized for his \n     actions, I feel very strongly that no President should \n     intentionally deceive the American people and I condemn him \n     for having done so.\n       Senator Bumpers reminded us of the human costs that have \n     been paid by this President and his family. The President has \n     admitted before a Federal grand jury terribly embarrassing \n     personal conduct and has seen a videotape of that grand jury \n     testimony broadcast to the entire nation, with excerpts \n     replayed over and over again. This modern day version of the \n     public stockade has been difficult to witness for those who \n     know this man and his family. His punishment has also taken \n     its financial toll. The underlying lawsuit has now been \n     settled and $850,000 paid on a case that initially sought \n     only $75,000 in compensatory damages--a case that the \n     District Court judge had dismissed for failing to state a \n     claim.\n       His presidency has been permanently tarnished by \n     impeachment. The Senate trial has provided a forum to replay \n     the embarrassing and humiliating facts of the President's \n     improper relationship. No one can say this President or his \n     presidency has emerged unscathed.\n     B. Special Prosecutor Starr\n       But the President's indiscretions and conduct did not alone \n     bring us to this point. Raising this matter to the level of a \n     constitutional impeachment only began with an investigation \n     and referral from Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr.\n       Justice Robert Jackson, when he was Attorney General in \n     1940, observed that the most dangerous power of the \n     prosecutor is the power to ``pick people that he thinks he \n     should get, rather than cases that need to be prosecuted.'' \n     When this happens, he said, ``it is not a question of \n     discovering the commission of a crime and then looking for \n     the man who has committed it, it is a question of picking the \n     man and then . . . putting investigators to work, to pin some \n     offense on him.'' ``It is here,'' he concluded, ``that law \n     enforcement becomes personal, and the real crime becomes that \n     of being unpopular with the predominant or governing group, \n     being attached to the wrong political views, or being \n     personally obnoxious to or in the way of the prosecutor \n     himself.''\n       In the case of President Clinton, things became personal a \n     long time ago. When Whitewater failed to produce, the \n     President's detractors began searching for a scandal. \n     ``Travelgate'' went nowhere. ``Filegate'' was another dead \n     end. Vincent Foster's tragic death was a suicide. Last \n     summer, it was reported that the Special Prosecutor had his \n     investigators scouring the countryside looking for women who \n     may have been intimate with Bill Clinton at some point over \n     the last several years. I spoke out then, noting my concern \n     and trying to sound a cautionary note that the permanent \n     investigation of the\n\n[[Page S1581]]\n\n     President was taking yet another wrong turn.\n       Finally, after four years of fruitless investigations, \n     Special Prosecutor Starr renewed his acquaintance with Linda \n     Tripp and began the Monica Lewinsky phase of his \n     investigation. According to Mr. Starr, that contact with \n     Linda Tripp began on January 8, 1998, days before Ms. \n     Lewinsky had filed her affidavit in the Jones case and before \n     the President's deposition in that matter.\\2\\ As an officer \n     of the court, he could have immediately referred Ms. Tripp's \n     information to others with authority over such matters. But \n     he did not.\n       Most law enforcement authorities strive to prevent crimes \n     from occurring. Not so with Special Prosecutor Starr. He \n     engaged all the influence, power and authority he could \n     muster to get the President. He adopted Ms. Tripp as his \n     agent, arranged to provide her with immunity from \n     prosecution, and had her wear a wire and lunch with Monica \n     Lewinsky while surreptitiously recording her. He then tried \n     over an extended period of many hours to convince Ms. \n     Lewinsky to agree likewise surreptitiously to record \n     conversations and help him make a case against the President.\n       Does anyone recall after the past year of upheaval the \n     crimes the Special Prosecutor was seeking to find last \n     January? Recall that the ``talking points'' given to Ms. \n     Tripp by Ms. Lewinsky were supposed to be the ``smoking gun'' \n     showing that the President was involved in a vast conspiracy \n     and cover-up to suborn perjury from Ms. Tripp. No one now \n     doubts Ms. Lewinsky's account that she, and she alone, wrote \n     the talking points based on her discussions with Ms. Tripp. \n     Moreover, no one now doubts that Ms. Lewinsky never even \n     discussed those talking points with the President, the \n     President's attorneys, the President's friend Vernon Jordan, \n     or anyone associated with the White House.\n       Also recall that Mr. Starr justified his pursuit of this \n     investigation based on Vernon Jordan helping Ms. Lewinsky \n     find a job in New York. His theory, as described in his \n     referral, was that Ms. Lewinsky was influenced to lie about \n     her relationship with the President through the assistance of \n     Mr. Jordan in finding her a job. Yet it was not the President \n     but Linda Tripp who, in early October 1997, first suggested \n     that Ms. Lewinsky move to New York and first discussed with \n     Ms. Lewinsky that she enlist Mr. Jordan's help with her New \n     York job search. Indeed, Linda Tripp's role in this scandal \n     is a pivotal one.\n       Fresh from conferring with Mr. Starr's investigators, armed \n     with promises of immunity from prosecution, Linda Tripp met \n     with the Jones lawyers on the eve of the President's \n     deposition and briefed them on the President's relationship \n     with Ms. Lewinsky. Even Mr. Starr eventually admitted that \n     his office could--and should--have kept ``better control'' of \n     Ms. Tripp.\n       A number of concerns have been raised about how this \n     investigation was initiated and conducted by the Special \n     Prosecutor, including whether Mr. Starr withheld material \n     information from the Attorney General when seeking to extend \n     his jurisdiction over the Lewinsky matter, whether he \n     concealed his prior consultations with the attorneys in the \n     Jones case, threatened a potential witness with the loss of \n     the custody of her child, and subpoenaed a minor at school. I \n     have also expressed my concern over the aggressiveness and \n     lack of prosecutorial discretion of his investigation in \n     requiring the testimony of mother against daughter, attorney \n     against client, and Secret Service protectors against \n     protectee--the latter raising serious security issues that \n     could jeopardize the future safety of presidents--and \n     requiring bookstores to disclose their customers' choice of \n     reading material.\n       Finally, the persistent and politically damaging leaks of \n     secret grand jury proceedings have tarnished Mr. Starr's \n     investigation and fueled concern over his partisanship. \n     Indeed, soon after he had been appointed as special \n     prosecutor, leaks from ``law enforcement sources'' about the \n     Whitewater investigation under his supervision prompted Mr. \n     Starr to confirm publicly his understanding of the grand jury \n     secrecy rules. He issued a press release on October 20, 1994, \n     pledging that the Office of Independent Counsel (``OIC'') \n     would ``abide by all of the obligations imposed upon us to \n     protect the integrity of the grand jury process and our \n     ethical obligations as professionals, including those \n     requiring the secrecy of our proceedings.''\n       Despite this pledge by Mr. Starr, a federal judge \n     determined in June 1998 that the evidence established a prima \n     facie case that Mr. Starr's office had violated federal \n     secrecy rules prohibiting attorneys for the government from \n     disclosing confidential grand jury material. A final \n     adjudication of the matter has not been made.\n       Then we come to the matter of the referral from Mr. Starr's \n     office. The Independent Counsel statute authorizes an \n     independent counsel to ``advise the House of Representatives \n     of any substantial and credible information . . . that may \n     constitute grounds for an impeachment.'' This provision \n     should not be construed to make an independent counsel the \n     House's Grand Inquisitor, nor to require an independent \n     counsel to become an advocate for impeachment. Rather, a \n     simple, straightforward delivery of the facts collected by \n     the independent counsel, unadorned by surmise, conjecture and \n     conspiracy theories is all that is authorized.\n       Nevertheless, Mr. Starr used this statutory authorization \n     as a springboard to advocate impeachment. His conduct stands \n     in stark contrast to that of the Special Prosecutor in \n     Watergate. As Georgetown University Law Professor Robert \n     Drinan, who served with distinction on the House Judiciary \n     Committee, observed last November in testimony before the \n     House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution:\n       ``It is noteworthy that in 1974, the Special Prosecutor \n     gave information and facts to the House Judiciary Committee. \n     He did not, however, recommend impeachment. He knew that the \n     power to recommend impeachment was committed solely to the \n     House of Representatives by the Constitution itself.''\n       I am not alone in questioning Mr. Starr's conduct and his \n     misinterpretation of his role. His own ethics advisor felt \n     compelled to resign his position after Mr. Starr appeared \n     before the House Judiciary Committee as the chief cheerleader \n     for impeachment.\n       Thereafter, Mr. Starr went from chief cheerleader to chief \n     ``talking head,'' making a lengthy television appearance on \n     the news show 20/20. This was only days after he told the \n     House Judiciary Committee, ``We [the OIC] go to court and not \n     on the talk-show circuit.'' In this regard, it bears mention \n     that Mr. Starr's public relations advisor and his highly \n     touted ``career prosecutors'' have also appeared on countless \n     talk shows over the past year.\n       Even during the Senate impeachment trial, Mr. Starr has \n     overstepped his proper role and intruded into the Senate's \n     prerogatives on how these proceedings should be conducted. In \n     effect, he became the chief prosecutor for impeachment. In \n     contravention of a unanimously adopted consent resolution on \n     how the trial would proceed, the Managers enlisted Mr. \n     Starr's help to force Monica Lewinsky to meet with them as \n     part of her immunity agreement. If she did not say the right \n     things, she subjected herself and her mother and father to \n     prosecution.\n       Press accounts make clear that while Mr. Starr's \n     representatives were allowed to attend the interview of Ms. \n     Lewinsky on January 24, 1999, neither the Senate nor the \n     President's counsel were extended such courtesy. This \n     collusive move between the Managers and Mr. Starr was unfair \n     to the President's counsel and contemptuous of the Senate, \n     which had resolved to defer the issue of witnesses until \n     later in the trial.\n       Mr. Starr's continued meddling during the Senate \n     impeachment trial has been roundly criticized by both \n     Democrats and Republicans. With his appetite whetted by one \n     weekend's interference with the Senate impeachment trial, the \n     very next weekend, on Sunday, January 31, 1999, Mr. Starr's \n     office leaked word to the New York Times that he had \n     determined he could indict a sitting President. Even the \n     House Managers balked at this interference, saying Mr. \n     Starr's latest leak was ``not helpful at all.''\n     C. The House Judiciary Committee\n       The next protagonist in this constitutional saga was the \n     House Judiciary Committee. In addition to the serious \n     substantive concerns raised by the way the Committee drafted \n     the Articles of Impeachment--which I will discuss later--the \n     Committee also made at least four critical procedural errors.\n       First, the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee \n     used the muscle of the majority to force its partisan will. \n     History tells us that, to be successful, impeachments must be \n     handled in a bipartisan manner. Chairman Henry Hyde himself \n     has observed on more than one occasion that bipartisanship is \n     crucial to any impeachment proceeding because a political, \n     partisan impeachment will not be trusted.\n       The Framers anticipated that impeachments might be driven \n     by partisanship rather than real demonstrations of guilt. The \n     distinguished historian Arthur M. Schlessinger, Jr., stressed \n     the need for bipartisanship in impeachment proceedings in his \n     testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the \n     Constitution on November 9, 1998, stating:\n       ``The Framers further believed that, if the impeachment \n     process is to acquire popular legitimacy, the bill of \n     particulars must be seen as impeachable by broad sections of \n     the electorate. The charges must be so grave and the evidence \n     for them so weighty that they persuade members of both \n     parties that removal must be considered. The Framers were \n     deeply fearful of partisan manipulation of the impeachment \n     process. . . . The domination of the impeachment process by \n     `faction' would in the view of the Framers deny the process \n     legitimacy.''\n       In the 24 years that I have had the honor of serving as a \n     United States Senator, there have been three impeachments, \n     all of Federal judges. Questions have been raised about how \n     our actions as a body and as individual Members in those \n     prior judicial impeachments should serve as precedent for \n     this impeachment trial. I will address the significant and \n     dispositive factual differences between these trials later, \n     but want to stress another significant difference: Those \n     three judicial impeachments were, from beginning to end, \n     handled in a bipartisan fashion. In each case, the House of \n     Representatives was unanimous, or nearly so, in voting to \n     impeach and there was strong bipartisan support in the Senate \n     to convict. Unfortunately, this was not the model followed in \n     the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.\n       Second, the Committee skirted the important threshold \n     question whether, as a matter of constitutional \n     interpretation, the accusations set out in Mr. Starr's \n     referral stated a sufficient basis to justify the President's \n     impeachment and removal. Despite the concurrence of over 800 \n     historians and constitutional scholars that no impeachable \n     offenses\n\n[[Page S1582]]\n\n     had been alleged, the majority on the House Judiciary \n     Committee never questioned Mr. Starr's initial judgment that \n     the President had committed impeachable offenses. Had the \n     Committee addressed itself to this issue at the start, a \n     factual inquiry may have been unnecessary.\n       Third, having avoided this threshold issue, the Committee \n     then failed to conduct an independent fact-finding inquiry, \n     as it was instructed to do by House Resolution 581. This \n     resolution, adopted on October 8, 1998, directed the \n     Committee ``to investigate fully and completely whether \n     sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives'' \n     to impeach the President. For making such investigation, the \n     resolution authorized the Committee to issue subpoenas for \n     the attendance and testimony of any person, to take \n     depositions of potential witnesses, to require the production \n     of documents and other things, and to issue interrogatories.\n       House Resolution 581 was patterned from the resolution \n     adopted by the House in February 1974, directing the \n     Judiciary Committee to investigate President Nixon. That \n     Committee spent almost five months gathering its own evidence \n     and hearing testimony from multiple witnesses before debating \n     and voting to adopt articles of impeachment.\n       By contrast, the House Judiciary Committee in 1998 relied \n     entirely on the referral of Special Prosecutor Starr. The \n     Committee called not a single witness with first-hand \n     knowledge of the facts to testify about the matters contained \n     in Mr. Starr's referral. The Committee instead relied on the \n     one-sided testimony procured by Mr. Starr's lieutenants in \n     the grand jury. Though this testimony was under oath, it \n     certainly was not tested by cross-examination nor was the \n     Special Prosecutor's office interested in any information \n     that might have been exculpatory to the President.\n       The most probative testimony by Ms. Lewinsky before the \n     grand jury, for example, about no one asking her to lie or \n     promising her a job, was elicited by a diligent grand juror. \n     Yet another startling omission of exculpatory information \n     from Mr. Starr's referral was only discovered during the \n     Senate deposition of Ms. Lewinsky. She testified in response \n     to Manager Bryant's inquiry about whether the President told \n     her she should turn the gifts over to the Jones lawyers that \n     she had previously told Mr. Starr's agents that the President \n     saying, ``Well, you have to turn over whatever you have,'' \n     sounded familiar to her.\n       Nevertheless, the House Judiciary Committee gave a standing \n     ovation to this Special Prosecutor, who misconstrued his \n     statutory role on advising the House and who failed the most \n     basic of a prosecutor's duties to be fair and to disclose \n     exculpatory information in his possession.\n       Fourth and finally, the House Judiciary Committee minimized \n     the constitutional role of the House in the impeachment \n     process. The Committee erroneously relegated the House to the \n     role of mere ``accuser'', leaving to the Senate the heavier \n     responsibility of determining whether the conduct at issue \n     warranted removal of the President. Chairman Hyde said, on \n     September 11, 1998, at the beginning of the House impeachment \n     process, ``We are acting as a grand jury . . . we are \n     operating as a grand jury.''\n       This view persisted during the House floor debate on the \n     Articles of Impeachment against President Clinton. Manager \n     Buyer told his colleagues that the House served ``the grand \n     jury function.'' Yet another House Member said, ``the role of \n     the House and our duty to the American people is to act \n     simply as a grand jury in reference to the impeachment \n     charges presented.'' This erroneous view of the role of the \n     House of Representatives in the impeachment process has \n     persisted even in this trial, with one Manager telling us \n     that the House of Representatives ``operates much more like a \n     grand jury than a petit jury.''\n       Having incorrectly analogized its role to that of a grand \n     jury, the House then applied a grand jury ``probable cause\" \n     standard in reviewing the evidence. Manager Barr confirmed \n     this mistake, stating, ``the House performed admirably in \n     essentially reaching the conclusion that there is probable \n     cause to convict the President of perjury and obstruction of \n     justice.'' Manager Hyde likewise described the House as \n     having ``a lower threshold . . . which is to seek a trial in \n     the Senate.''\n       Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe warned House \n     Republicans against misinterpreting and minimizing their \n     constitutional impeachment role. He testified before the \n     House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution that, ``the \n     fallacy is that this is not, despite the loose analogies that \n     some invoke, not like a grand jury.'' His warning went \n     unheeded.\n       Minimizing the House's role has had serious consequences. \n     It explains why the majority in the House Judiciary Committee \n     forfeited the opportunity and shirked its responsibility to \n     conduct any independent examination of the facts. The House's \n     constitutional responsibility for charging the President \n     should not be misinterpreted to justify applying only a grand \n     jury's ``probable cause'' standard of proof.\n       It also amounted to giving the House a ``free vote'' since \n     they could duck any responsibility for actually removing the \n     President. On the contrary, House Members who vote to impeach \n     should also be convinced this President has so abused the \n     public trust and so threatens the public that he should be \n     removed. Sending impeachment articles to the Senate means \n     exactly what the articles say: That based on the evidence \n     reviewed by the House, the President has committed acts \n     warranting his conviction and removal.\n       Even some Republican Members of the House who voted for \n     impeachment admitted, belatedly, in a letter to the Senate \n     Majority Leader that they did not mean it. They said they \n     actually did not want this President removed and urged the \n     Senate to consider censure.\n       In spite of what the House Manager's believe, the \n     impeachment process is not a ``cause.'' It should not be \n     about partisan political pique or about sending a message. \n     Rather, along with the power to declare war, it is one of the \n     gravest constitutional responsibility of the Congress. This \n     impeachment asks the question whether the conduct charged in \n     the Articles of Impeachment passed by the House require the \n     Senate to override the judgment of the American people and \n     remove from office the person they elected to serve as \n     President.\n       That is what the impeachment process is all about--removal \n     from office. It is the Constitution's fail-safe device. It is \n     not to be undertaken lightly or without justification for it \n     has serious consequences.\n       We suffered a lengthy Senate impeachment trial because \n     House Republicans misinterpreted their constitutional role. \n     House Republican leaders mistakenly relegated the House to a \n     limited role, depreciated the function of impeachment and \n     expressly left to the Senate responsibility for reviewing the \n     charges and determining whether the charges warrant the \n     President's removal from office. Articles of Impeachment are \n     simply not an appropriate vehicle for the expression of \n     political disapproval to be punted by a partisan vote in the \n     House to the Senate for some face-saving compromise verdict.\n       Not surprisingly, given their misinterpretation of their \n     own role, the first ruling that the Chief Justice was called \n     upon to make in this trial was to correct the Managers' \n     mischaracterization of the role of the Senate. The Chief \n     Justice sustained Senator Harkin's objection and corrected \n     the Managers, stating, ``the Senate is not simply a jury; it \n     is a court in this case. Therefore counsel should refrain \n     from referring to the Senators as jurors.''\n     D. Vote by the House of Representatives\n       Proceedings in the full House were themselves a sorry \n     spectacle. On December 19, 1998, a lame duck session of the \n     House of Representatives approved two Articles of Impeachment \n     against President Clinton on the slimmest of partisan \n     margins.\n       1. Lame Duck House\n       The two Articles of Impeachment now before the Senate were \n     decided by the votes of a handful of Members who were \n     defeated in the November election or are no longer serving. \n     Article I passed with an 11-vote margin, which is the number \n     of House Republicans replaced by Democrats in the new \n     Congress due to election defeats and retirements. Article III \n     (now Article II in the Senate) passed with only a 5-vote \n     margin, which is the number of House Republicans who lost \n     their reelections in November and were replaced by Democrats. \n     There is no record of any prior impeachment reaching the \n     Senate on so slim a margin.\n       The House Republican leadership pressed an extreme, all-or-\n     nothing action through a lame duck House without allowing an \n     opportunity to vote on a censure or other alternative.\n       Those who claim that censure is unconstitutional are just \n     plain wrong. There is ample historical precedent for censure. \n     Both the House and the Senate have adopted resolutions \n     expressing disapproval of various individuals, including \n     sitting Presidents. The Senate censured Andrew Jackson in \n     1834; the House censured James Buchanan in 1860. As early as \n     1800, with ``Founding Fathers'' then serving in Congress, the \n     House debated a resolution to censure John Adams, though this \n     resolution was ultimately rejected.\n       Perhaps it should not be surprising that the final votes in \n     the divisive speakership of Newt Gingrich set the Congress \n     and the nation on this course. Mr. Starr's investigation has \n     dragged on for five years, with no end in sight. The entire \n     House impeachment inquiry lasted a short three months. Why \n     the sudden push to bring this matter to the floor? There were \n     at least five good reasons-- the five seats that the \n     Republicans had lost in the election--which might have \n     altered the outcome on at least one Article of Impeachment. \n     The sixth reason is also clear: Speaker Gingrich had said he \n     was resigning from the House, and his seat would be vacant \n     when the new House convened.\n       An impeachment resolution supported by only one political \n     party against a twice-elected incumbent of the opposing party \n     is divisive and damaging for the country. During Watergate, \n     constitutional scholar Charles L. Black, Jr., wrote that a \n     close vote along party lines ``would go to the Senate \n     tainted, or at least suspicious, and would be unlikely to \n     satisfy the country, because party motives would be \n     suspected.'' The impeachment of a President must be \n     bipartisan. A partisan impeachment cannot command the respect \n     of the American people. It is no more valid than a stolen \n     election.\n       House Republicans have permanently marked this President as \n     impeached, but I do not believe that history will judge them \n     kindly either. Instead, the manner in which these impeachment \n     proceedings were conducted in the House Committee on the \n     Judiciary and in the full House of Representatives will serve \n     as a model of mistakes that should be avoided in the future.\n\n[[Page S1583]]\n\n       2. Rejected Charges\n       In the end, the House did not approve the 11 articles \n     recommended by Special Prosecutor Starr or the 15 articles of \n     impeachment recommended by the Republican Committee staff. \n     The House rejected outright two of the four articles reported \n     along party lines by the House Judiciary Committee, and \n     authorized Managers to exhibit only two Articles of \n     Impeachment in the Senate. In considering these two Articles, \n     the Senate has been forced to sort through what is left of \n     the allegations against the President in light of the matters \n     rejected by the House.\n\n\n                          III. SECRET EVIDENCE\n\n       Before the vote, press reports indicated that wavering \n     House Members were escorted by Republican House Judiciary \n     Members to review certain ``secret evidence'' that the \n     President's counsel had never been allowed to review or given \n     an opportunity to rebut.\n       That action was fundamentally unfair. A bedrock principle \n     of our system of justice is that the prosecutor, not the \n     accused, has the burden of proof. The accused is presumed \n     innocent unless and until adequate proof of guilt is \n     presented. Such proof may take many forms--direct or \n     circumstantial, testamentary or physical. But whatever form \n     it takes, it must be introduced, admitted into evidence, and \n     subject to examination and inspection before it may be \n     considered by the fact finders.\n       I note that in 1974, the House Judiciary Committee made \n     available to President Nixon and his counsel all the \n     documents and other material considered by the Committee, \n     whether in executive or open session. In short, during the \n     House Judiciary Committee's investigation of Watergate, there \n     was no secret evidence and President Nixon and his counsel \n     were allowed to see--fully and completely--every item of \n     evidence in the possession of the House Judiciary Committee.\n       As both a judge and juror in the Senate, I take seriously \n     my responsibility to ensure that the Senate's consideration \n     of these Articles of Impeachment is fair. Part of that \n     fairness requires that the only evidence we consider relates \n     to the Articles actually approved by the House--not what the \n     House refused to charge and not matters that are not charged \n     by the Articles of Impeachment. During the depositions \n     authorized by the majority in the Senate, I and the other \n     Presiding Officers from both parties stood firm on this \n     principle and insisted that the Managers' questions remain \n     focused on the subject matters already in the Senate record \n     and on the Articles before us.\n       Certain House Republicans suggested before this trial began \n     that Senators should review the ``secret evidence'' as part \n     of their deliberative processes. This suggestion was first \n     advanced at about the time that the ``secret evidence'' began \n     leaking to the press. From what I have read about it, it \n     seems as flimsy as it is inflammatory, and completely \n     irrelevant to any issue now before the Senate. Clearly, \n     Senators should not allow themselves to be influenced by \n     shady accusations and innuendo that would be excluded from \n     any judicial proceeding in the land. Consideration of the \n     Articles must be based on only one record--the trial record--\n     and evidence that is not admitted at trial must play no part \n     in our deliberations.\n       I should note that the House Managers have selectively \n     tried to keep secret certain unfavorable evidence elicited \n     during the Senate trial. For example, they argued strenuously \n     and successfully to subpoena witnesses for depositions and \n     for permission to introduce parts of those depositions into \n     evidence. The parts they introduced do not, as the Legal \n     Times pointed out ``tell the whole story.''\n       As one of the Presiding Officers at those depositions, I am \n     well aware of the parts of those depositions intentionally \n     omitted by the Managers. In fact, following their \n     presentation of the evidence obtained from the depositions, I \n     asked unanimous consent that the record be made complete and \n     include Vernon Jordan's brief remarks at the end of his \n     deposition, ``defending his own integrity.'' There is no \n     question but that the Managers attacked and impugned Mr. \n     Jordan's word and his integrity. Senator Boxer echoed this \n     unanimous consent request at the conclusion of the Managers' \n     rebuttal presentation. Due to Republican objections, however, \n     neither request was accepted and, unfortunately, the Senate \n     trial record does not contain that moving and important part \n     of Mr. Jordan's deposition.\n\n\n                 IV. THE ARTICLES ARE UNFAIRLY DRAFTED\n\n       Close examination of the Articles exhibited by the Managers \n     reflects the underlying unfairness in the impeachment \n     proceedings in the House.\n     A. Article I is Defectively Vague\n       Article I is drafted with such vague accusations, a \n     significant question arises whether Senators can responsibly \n     and constitutionally pass judgment on it.\n       The notion that William Jefferson Clinton committed perjury \n     before the Starr grand jury has been a legal conclusion in \n     search of a basis for some time. In his referral to the House \n     of Representatives, Special Prosecutor Starr urged only three \n     allegations of possible perjury before the grand jury as \n     grounds for seeking to remove the President. Article I merges \n     those three allegations into one generalized allegation that \n     President Clinton gave false testimony ``as to the nature and \n     details of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.'' In addition, \n     the House Judiciary Committee has joined three additional \n     categories of allegedly false testimony, without specifying \n     the allegedly perjurious statements. Those additional \n     categories cover statements that the President made or \n     allowed his attorney to make during the Jones case, in spite \n     of the fact that a majority of the House of Representatives \n     rejected such statements as a basis for a separate article of \n     impeachment.\n       Since the outset of the Senate trial, the charges of grand \n     jury perjury have continued to be a moving target. In their \n     initial Trial Brief, the Managers alluded to 26 instances of \n     grand jury perjury. Manager Rogan spoke of 34 instances. In \n     their Reply Brief, the Managers tallied up 48 instances of \n     grand jury perjury.\n       Yet, Article I does not identify a single statement before \n     the grand jury that the House of Representatives alleges to \n     have been perjurious, false and misleading. All the Senate is \n     told in Article I is that the allegedly perjurious statements \n     fall into ``one or more'' of four broad categories. This is \n     wholly inconsistent with criminal law and Senate standards \n     for identifying perjury.\n       First, requiring the President to defend himself against \n     such an unspecified charge is fundamentally unfair. Vague, \n     generalized charges of perjury, such as the charge now before \n     the Senate, would never hold up in a court of law. Under \n     federal law, a perjury indictment must set forth the precise \n     falsehood alleged and the factual basis of its falsity with \n     sufficient clarity to permit a jury to determine its \n     veracity. The Justice Department's manual for Federal \n     prosecutors acknowledges this basic principle of law.\n       This is not just a technical matter of proper, lawyerly \n     pleading. It is a matter of fundamental fairness and due \n     process. As the respondent in this proceeding, the President \n     has been denied the basic fairness of having clear notice of \n     the specific charges against him and of knowing in advance of \n     the trial precisely what the House of Representatives accuses \n     him of having done that merits removing him from the office \n     to which the people of the United States have twice elected \n     him.\n       Providing specificity in perjury articles has been the \n     practice in past impeachments. Two prior impeachments before \n     the Senate, both of Federal judges, involved perjury charges. \n     In both instances, the House of Representatives identified \n     each alleged falsehood in a separate Article of Impeachment. \n     In the case of Judge Alcee Hastings, 14 of the Articles \n     alleged that he had committed perjury with respect to a \n     different specific statement. In the case of Judge Walter \n     Nixon, two of the Articles alleged perjury, again, each with \n     respect to a single discrete statement.\n       This time, however, the House of Representatives chose to \n     be unacceptably vague. Republicans on the House Judiciary \n     Committee flatly refused to pin themselves down to specific \n     statements in the resolution they drafted or in their \n     Committee debate. In fact, the only change the House \n     Judiciary Committee made to Article I had the effect of \n     making it even more ambiguous and obscure: They amended it to \n     allege that the President testified falsely as to ``one or \n     more'' of the four categories, rather than all of them. By so \n     doing, they have undermined the basic fairness of these \n     proceedings.\n       Second, the lack of specificity in Article I makes it \n     impossible to know whether the requisite majority of the \n     House of Representatives agreed that any specific statement \n     was perjurious. To impeach President Clinton under Article I, \n     House Members had only to find that he made one or more of an \n     unspecified number of unspecified false statements, broadly \n     categorized. Accordingly, it is impossible to know whether \n     the House properly exercised its exclusive, constitutional \n     power of impeachment.\n       If there are 3, 4, 7, 34 or possibly 48 allegations of \n     perjury, but only one vote by the House, how can the Senate \n     be sure, how can the President be sure, and, most \n     importantly, how can the American people be sure that a \n     majority of the House agreed on any single allegation of \n     perjury? Only a narrow majority of 228 members of the prior \n     House of Representatives voted in favor of Article I. If as \n     few as 11 members of that slim majority did not agree on \n     which of the 3 to 48 perjury allegations were to be forwarded \n     to the Senate, that Article did not have the support of a \n     majority of the House and should not be considered by the \n     Senate.\n       Third, the lack of specificity makes any Senate vote for \n     conviction on Article I similarly constitutionally suspect. \n     If, as the Managers' Reply Brief indicates, there are 48 \n     separate allegations of perjurious statements by the \n     President before the grand jury, then as few as two Senators \n     could believe any particular allegation of perjury had been \n     established and the Senate as a whole could nonetheless \n     convict and remove the President--so long as enough other \n     pairs of Senators thought alternative allegations were \n     established. This falls far short of the two-thirds of the \n     Senate required to concur before a President is removed from \n     office.\n       The Managers ignore the grave constitutional questions \n     raised by the vagueness of Article I presented to the House \n     and now to the Senate for a vote. Instead they defend the \n     fairness of this Article by asserting that if President \n     Clinton had suffered from any lack of specificity, he could \n     have filed a motion in the Senate for a bill of particulars. \n     \\10\\ Just as the Managers had to be corrected by the Chief \n     Justice about the role of the Senate, they also overestimate \n     their power to detail the particulars of the conduct \n     underlying Article I.\n\n[[Page S1584]]\n\n       The Constitution vests the sole power of impeachment in the \n     House of Representatives, not in a handful of managers \n     appointed by that body. Just as prosecutors may not save a \n     defective indictment without usurping the constitutional role \n     of the grand jury, these Managers may not save a defective \n     bill of impeachment without usurping the constitutional role \n     of the full House. Put another way, 13 Members may not take \n     it upon themselves to guess what was in the minds of over 200 \n     Members of the 105th Congress when they voted to impeach the \n     President. The full House must pass on any amendments to the \n     Articles.\n       That is how it has always been done. In 1933, for example, \n     impeached judge Harold Louderback moved the Senate to require \n     the House to make one of its articles ``more definite and \n     certain.'' In that instance, the Managers wisely consented to \n     the motion. An amendment to the articles was then approved by \n     the full House and presented to the Senate.\n       Similarly, in the case of Judge Nixon, it was the House of \n     Representatives that amended its articles in light of \n     evidence presented during the Senate proceedings. That \n     amendment was made to correct the text of one of the \n     statements that the House alleged to be false.\n       The Managers do not have the power to make the Article more \n     specific, nor have they tried. Instead, they have exploited \n     the vagueness in Article I by continuing to add to the litany \n     of alleged falsehoods by the President. Any advantage gained \n     by the House Managers by purposely crafting Article I in this \n     vague fashion diminishes the fairness of the entire \n     proceeding.\n     B. Both Articles Charge Multiple Offenses\n       Both of the Articles before us allege that the President \n     committed ``one or more'' of a laundry list of misdeeds. In \n     fact, as I already mentioned, Article I was specifically \n     amended in Committee to use this ``one or more'' formulation. \n     Manager Rogan tried to spin this as ``a technical amendment \n     only,'' but it was obviously much more.\n       With this amendment, Article I not only fails to identify a \n     single allegedly perjurious statement, it fails even to \n     identify a single broad category of statements. It lists four \n     broad categories that could allude to virtually every word \n     the President said before the grand jury and says, in effect, \n     take your pick. If you think he said something, anything, \n     that was not true, then vote to convict. Article II, which \n     lumps together seven alleged acts of obstruction, does the \n     same.\n       Manager McCollum treated the decision Senators must make on \n     Article I like a choice diners would make from a Chinese \n     take-out menu: chose some from column A and, if you like, \n     some from column B. He explained that Senators could vote to \n     remove the President if ``you conclude he committed the \n     crimes that he is alleged to have committed--not every one of \n     them necessarily, but certainly a good quantity, and there \n     are a whole bunch of them that have been charged.''\n       The Senate has made clear that it expects precision in \n     articles of impeachment. In the last two impeachments, of \n     Judges Hastings and Nixon, the House tacked on an omnibus or \n     ``catchall'' charge that included all the others. I and other \n     Senators expressed concern with this blunderbuss approach. \n     During the Hastings proceedings, I specifically asked whether \n     the catchall Article could be interpreted as requiring a \n     finding of guilt as to all the allegations in order to \n     convict. By asking the question, I hoped to avoid the \n     constitutional problem that I just described, of conviction \n     based on less than a two-thirds vote. The Presiding Officer \n     ruled that a Senator would be within his right to interpret \n     the Article as I proposed, but expressed the view that a \n     Senator could vote guilty based on any one of the alleged \n     acts of misconduct. Ultimately, the Senate rejected the \n     omnibus Articles against Judges Hastings and Nixon, while \n     convicting them of more specific charges of perjury.\n       Articles of impeachment that contain multiple allegations \n     are troubling in several respects. First, they make it \n     virtually impossible for the impeached person to prepare an \n     adequate defense. Second, they permit the House to impeach, \n     and the Senate to convict, based on less than the majority or \n     super majority vote required by the Constitution. Third, they \n     allow individual Members to avoid accountability to the \n     American people, who may never know exactly which charges \n     their representatives regarded as proven and warranting \n     removal from office.\n       President Kennedy, in Profiles in Courage, described the \n     omnibus Article against President Andrew Johnson as a \n     ``deliberately obscure conglomeration of all the charges in \n     the preceding Articles, which had been designed . . . to \n     furnish a common ground for those who favored conviction but \n     were unwilling to identify themselves on the basic issues.'' \n     The House Managers in the Johnson case called for the first \n     vote to be on that deliberately obscure Article because it \n     was thought to be the easiest way to get a conviction. \n     Today's Managers are hoping that this tactic works better in \n     1999 than it did in 1868, when President Johnson was \n     acquitted.\n       But impeachment is not a shell game. Deliberate obfuscation \n     trivializes what should be a grave and solemn process.\n       In 1989, after the Senate rejected the omnibus Article \n     against Judge Nixon, then Minority Leader Bob Dole and others \n     urged the House to stop bunching up its allegations and, from \n     there on out, to charge each act of wrongdoing in a separate \n     article. The House has unfortunately chosen to ignore this \n     plea in this matter of historic importance, contrary to \n     fundamental notions of fairness, proper notice, and justice.\n\n\n                          V. THE SENATE'S DUTY\n\n       The Senate does not sit as an impeachment court in a \n     vacuum. The fairness of the process by which the Articles \n     reached the Senate, and the specificity and care with which \n     the Articles are drafted to identify the charges fairly to \n     the respondent, are significant considerations in deciding \n     whether to vote for conviction or acquittal. Senators are not \n     merely serving as petit jurors who will be instructed on the \n     law by a judge and are asked to find facts. Senators have a \n     greater role and a greater responsibility in this trial. The \n     Senate is the court in this case, as the Chief Justice \n     properly observed. Our job is to do justice and be fair in \n     this matter and to protect the Constitution.\n       In casting our final votes on the Articles we should be \n     clear about the questions that our votes answer and equally \n     clear about the questions not before us. The question is not \n     whether Bill Clinton has suffered, for surely he has as a \n     result of his conduct, nor whether he has suffered enough. \n     The question is not even whether Bill Clinton should be \n     punished and sent to jail on a criminal charge, for the \n     Constitution does not confer that authority on this court of \n     impeachment.\n       This vote only and necessarily requires addressing the \n     following questions: has the conduct charged in each Article \n     been proven to my satisfaction; and, if so, does the charged \n     conduct amount to a high crime or high misdemeanor warranting \n     the President's conviction and removal from the office to \n     which he was elected by the American people in 1996. I will \n     address each of these questions in turn.\n     A. Standard of Proof\n       In this impeachment trial, the President starts out with \n     fewer rights than any criminal defendant in any court in this \n     country. He starts out with no clear rules of evidence, \n     conviction based on a mere two-thirds vote, rather than a \n     unanimous verdict required for any criminal conviction, and \n     no higher court of appeal. This makes the obligation imposed \n     by our oath to make this process fair and impartial that much \n     more important.\n       Fulfilling our duty in the impeachment trial involves \n     evaluating the evidence presented by the Managers and the \n     President to determine whether the allegations have been \n     proven. Juries in legal cases are asked to evaluate evidence \n     presented according to a specific ``standard of proof.'' The \n     Constitution is silent on the standard of proof to be applied \n     in impeachment trials, and the Senate has refused to bind \n     itself to a single standard for all impeachments. As a \n     result, each Senator may follow the burden of proof he or she \n     believes is appropriate to determine whether the House's \n     charges have been adequately proven.\n       The fact that each Senator may evaluate the evidence under \n     any standard of proof of their choice presents a remarkable \n     challenge to the Managers and to the President's counsel. One \n     commentator has noted that, ``this practice can often work . \n     . . to the disadvantage of all the participants in an \n     impeachment trial by precluding them from knowing in advance \n     what standard the Senate will actually apply.''\n       The standard of proof in criminal proceedings is ``beyond a \n     reasonable doubt'' and in civil proceedings is generally ``a \n     preponderance of the evidence.'' An impeachment trial is \n     neither a civil or criminal proceeding, leading some \n     commentators to suggest that ``a hybrid of the criminal and \n     civil burdens of proof may be desirable. . . . Too lenient a \n     proof standard would allow the Senate to impose the serious \n     punishments for impeachment `even though substantial doubt of \n     guilt remained.' Too rigid a standard might allow an official \n     to remain in office even though the entire Senate was \n     convinced he or she had committed an impeachable offense.''\n       The fact that the Senate has adopted no uniform standard of \n     proof for each Member to follow is not for lack of attention. \n     The Senate considered the standard of proof question when \n     impeachment proceedings against President Nixon were \n     contemplated, but adopted none. Thereafter, a member of the \n     Watergate impeachment inquiry staff, now a professor of law, \n     concluded that the standard of proof in impeachment trials \n     will vary with the seriousness of the charges:\n       If a president were charged with conduct amounting to \n     treason, for example, it seems highly unlikely that a senator \n     would insist on proof of treason beyond a reasonable doubt \n     before he would vote for the president's removal from office. \n     . . . On the other hand, a greater quantum of proof might be \n     required for less flagrant wrongdoing.\n       More recently, in 1986, Judge Harry Claiborne moved to \n     establish ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' as the standard of \n     proof at his impeachment trial. The Senate rejected that \n     motion by a 17 to 75 vote. I joined those Members voting \n     against adoption of a uniform standard of proof because I \n     believe, as the Presiding Officer made clear at the time, \n     that in fulfilling his or her oath each Senator is free to \n     apply any standard of proof, including reasonable doubt.\n       The charges here stem from alleged efforts by the President \n     to conceal a personal inappropriate relationship. While the \n     relationship itself may be fair game for public rebuke and \n     censure, only when questions were raised about whether his \n     conduct crossed the\n\n[[Page S1585]]\n\n     line into criminal activity did this matter become the \n     subject of an impeachment inquiry. Indeed, Manager McCollum \n     argued that the President must not be convicted and removed \n     from office except upon a finding that he committed a crime. \n     Fairness dictates that we use the exacting standard of proof \n     that is used--and that is constitutionally mandated--in \n     criminal trials.\n       I note that Majority Leader Trent Lott reached the same \n     conclusion 25 years ago, as a young Member of the House \n     Judiciary Committee considering articles of impeachment \n     against President Nixon. He joined other Republican Members \n     in writing:\n       ``Because of the fundamental similarity between an \n     impeachment trial and an ordinary criminal trial . . . the \n     standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is appropriate in \n     both proceedings. Moreover, the gravity of an impeachment \n     trial and its potentially drastic consequences are additional \n     reasons for requiring a rigorous standard of proof. This is \n     especially true in the case of a presidential impeachment. . \n     . . The removal of a President by impeachment in mid-term . . \n     . should not be too easy of accomplishment, for it \n     contravenes the will of the electorate. In providing for a \n     fixed four-year term, not subject to interim votes of No \n     Confidence, the Framers indicated their preference for \n     stability in the executive. That stability should not be \n     jeopardized except on the strongest possible proof of \n     presidential wrongdoing.''\n       Were the President accused of treason or serious public \n     corruption, the best interests of the Nation might well \n     demand a somewhat lower standard. He is not, however, accused \n     of such crimes. We hundred Senators are stand-ins for over a \n     quarter billion Americans. President Clinton has been twice \n     elected to his office, and we should only undo that choice \n     based on the charges before us on proof tested against the \n     highest standard. Under the circumstances, in evaluating the \n     evidence that could result in the impeachment and removal of \n     the President of the United States, I will use the highest \n     standard of proof used in any court of law in this country, \n     that is, proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n     B. The Charges Have Not Been Proven\n       I do not believe that the Managers proved their case beyond \n     a reasonable doubt. To reach their conclusions, they had to \n     tease inculpatory inferences from exculpatory evidence and \n     generally view the record in the most sinister light \n     possible. Having taken an oath to do impartial justice, my \n     vote must be based on the evidence in the record, not on \n     speculation and surmise.\n       1. Article I\n       The record does not come close to supporting the \n     allegations in Article I. Perjury is a complex charge, \n     requiring more than just lying or even lying under oath. To \n     constitute perjury, a lie must be both material and willful. \n     Lying under oath about trivial or inconsequential matters, \n     even if willful, is not a crime. Lying under oath as a result \n     of confusion, mistake or faulty memory, even if about \n     material matters, is also not a crime. In addition, there is \n     no crime of perjury where a witness's answers are literally \n     true, even if unresponsive, misleading or false by negative \n     implication.\n       The American people saw President Clinton's grand jury \n     testimony when the videotape was made public by the House \n     Judiciary Committee. We saw him admit that:\n       He had engaged in wrongful conduct;\n       He had been alone with Ms. Lewinsky on numerous occasions;\n       His inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky lasted \n     over a two-year period;\n       Many of their encounters involved inappropriate intimate \n     contact; and\n       He had given her a number of gifts.\n       Given these admissions, the Managers had a heavy burden to \n     prove that the President testified falsely about any material \n     matter.\n       Perhaps for this reason, the Managers repackaged the three \n     alleged falsehoods identified by the Special Prosecutor in \n     their Senate presentation. In their Reply Brief, the Managers \n     claimed that the President perjured himself no less than 48 \n     times during his grand jury appearance. They hoped that the \n     sheer number of allegations would overcome the essential \n     triviality of each individual charge. It does not.\n       In this regard, the most remarkable charge leveled by the \n     Managers is that the President's prepared statement, in which \n     he made his many admissions, was itself perjurious. The \n     President said that his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky \n     ``began as a friendship''; Ms. Lewinsky disagreed, although \n     she allowed for the possibility that the President had a \n     different perception of how the relationship had evolved.\n  The President said that the inappropriate intimate contacts occurred \nin early 1996 and 1997; Ms. Lewinsky claimed the contacts began on \nNovember 15, 1995. The President described being alone with Ms. \nLewinsky only on ``certain occasions,'' and described their telephone \nconversations as ``occasional''; there is nothing in the record to the \ncontrary. Indeed, Ms. Lewinsky used the same term to describe these \nevents, since a few dozen meetings or telephone conversations over a \ntwo-year period may appropriately be described as ``occasional''.\n       Such allegations trivialize the serious business in which \n     we are now engaged. Can anyone really believe that the \n     President should be removed from office because of a six-week \n     discrepancy as to when his admittedly inappropriate affair \n     began? Or because of general statements that are allegedly \n     contrary to specific numbers? Or because he did not inform \n     the grand jury that the relationship began with a crude \n     sexual overture by Ms. Lewinsky, as she herself was compelled \n     to describe in humiliating detail, at the whim of the Special \n     Prosecutor's inquisitors and for no legitimate investigatory \n     purpose?\n       Another set of statements that the Managers consider \n     perjurious relate to the President's state of mind. The \n     Managers claim, without support, that the President did not \n     genuinely believe, for example, that Ms. Lewinsky could file \n     a truthful affidavit that might relieve her of having to \n     testify in the Jones case. Such unsupported speculation about \n     what was in the President's mind is not, as the President's \n     counsel stated, ``the stuff or fuel of a perjury \n     prosecution.''\n       Asked to identify which of the President's statements were \n     of particular importance to the perjury charge, Manager Rogan \n     pointed to the President's explanations for his attorney \n     Robert Bennett's statement, during the Jones deposition, that \n     Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit showed there ``is'' no sex of any \n     kind. Never mind that, in general, a person cannot be held \n     criminally liable for false statements or representations by \n     the person's counsel to a judge or magistrate.\n       Manager Rogan first took issue with the President's \n     argument that the statement at issue was technically accurate \n     because his intimate contact with Ms. Lewinsky had been over \n     for many months. While the President has been derided for \n     legal hairsplitting over ``what the meaning of `is' is,'' no \n     amount of derision can transform this sort of argumentative \n     testimony into a perjurious statement.\n       The President also testified that he had not paid much \n     attention to what his attorney was saying and, indeed, did \n     not focus on it until months after the deposition, when he \n     read the transcript in preparation for his grand jury \n     appearance. The Managers assert that the President was paying \n     attention, and they base this on the President's blank stare \n     at the time in question. How can we possibly know, from that, \n     what was going on in his mind?\n       Appreciating the weakness of their assertion, the Managers \n     obtained an affidavit from Barry W. Ward, law clerk to the \n     presiding judge in the Jones suit, and submitted it with \n     their motion to expand the record. Mr. Ward's affidavit \n     states that when he attended the deposition of President \n     Clinton in that case, he ``observed President Clinton looking \n     directly at Mr. Bennett while this statement was being \n     made.'' The Managers used this statement to argue in their \n     motion brief, at p. 21, that ``Mr. Ward's declaration proves \n     that Mr. Ward saw President Clinton listening attentively \n     while the exchange between Mr. Bennett and the presiding \n     Judge occurred.'' According to a Legal Times report on \n     February 1, 1999, Mr. Ward ``vigorously disputes that \n     interpretation.'' Contrary to the Managers' assertion, Mr. \n     Ward stated in a subsequent interview that, ``I have no idea \n     if he was paying attention. He could have been thinking about \n     policy initiatives, for all I know.''\n       The only explanation for the misleading characterization of \n     Mr. Ward's affidavit in the Managers' motion brief is the \n     same one offered by Senator Bumpers to explain yet another \n     unsupported inference asserted by the Managers. He said, ``I \n     am a trial lawyer and I will tell you what it is: it is \n     wanting to win too badly.''\n       As a former prosecutor, one of the questions I have asked \n     myself is whether, based on these facts, criminal charges of \n     perjury or obstruction of justice would have been brought \n     against any person other than the President of the United \n     States. If William Jefferson Clinton were Billy Blythe or \n     Bill Jones, would any prosecutor in the country have \n     successfully brought such charges? Experienced prosecutors, \n     Republican and Democratic, testified before the House \n     Judiciary Committee that no prosecutor would have proceeded \n     based on the record compiled by Mr. Starr. I agree and note \n     that during the course of these Senate proceedings, the case \n     has only gotten weaker.\n     2. Article II\n       The same is true of Article II, which charges the President \n     with obstruction of justice. The Managers repeatedly urged \n     Senators to look at ``the big picture,'' view the evidence as \n     a whole, and not to get ``hung up'' on the details. This is \n     lawyer-speak for, ``my case does withstand scrutiny.''\n       To begin with, the principal witnesses to the President's \n     alleged scheme to obstruct justice testified that there was \n     no such scheme. Monica Lewinsky has clearly and consistently \n     maintained that no one ever asked or encouraged her to lie, \n     and that she was never promised a job for her silence. Betty \n     Currie, the President's secretary, and Vernon Jordan, a \n     distinguished attorney, also exonerated the President of any \n     wrongdoing or any conspiracy with them to obstruct justice. \n     For example, Ms. Currie testified that the President did not \n     ask her on December 28, 1997, or at any time, to obtain and \n     hide gifts he had given Ms. Lewinsky, and Mr. Jordan \n     testified that his involvement in Ms. Lewinsky's job search \n     was unrelated to any participation by Ms. Lewinsky in the \n     now-settled Jones case. The Managers argue that such \n     exculpatory testimony ``may well take on a sinister, or even \n     criminal connotation when observed in the context of the \n     whole plot,'' but I fail to see why exculpatory testimony \n     cannot be viewed for what it is: exculpatory.\n\n[[Page S1586]]\n\n       The Managers do their best to transmogrify other \n     exculpatory testimony into evidence of criminality. For \n     example, Ms. Lewinsky testified that the President declined \n     to review her affidavit before she signed it and did not \n     discuss the content of the affidavit with her ``at all, \n     ever.'' Manager Rogan cited this as evidence of obstruction \n     on the theory that the President would have reviewed the \n     affidavit if he really believed it could be truthful. In case \n     we rejected this theory, Manager McCollum speculated that the \n     President had reviewed 15 prior drafts of the affidavit--\n     speculation at odds with Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that she \n     did not show the President her affidavit in final or draft \n     form. But neither Mr. Rogan's theory nor Mr. McCollum's \n     speculation can overcome or obscure the fundamentally \n     exculpatory nature of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony on this point. \n     Indeed, if the President had reviewed or discussed Ms. \n     Lewinsky's affidavit, the Managers would doubtless have \n     trumpeted the incident as proof positive of obstruction.\n       Unable to conjure inculpatory evidence out of the \n     President's refusal to review Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, the \n     Managers invited the Senate to infer guilt from the ``fact'' \n     that it was the President, not Ms. Lewinsky, who benefitted \n     from the filing of her affidavit. Manager Bryant went \n     further, arguing that Ms. Lewinsky ``had no motivation, no \n     reason whatsoever'' to want to avoid testifying in the Jones \n     case. But when Manager Bryant questioned Ms. Lewinsky on this \n     point, she corrected him:\n\n       ``Q. [Y]ou didn't file the affidavit for your best \n     interest, did you?\n       ``A. Uh, actually, I did.\n       ``Q. To avoid testifying.\n       ``A. Yes.''\n\n       This testimony should have come as no surprise, since most \n     people would want to avoid the time, expense, and \n     embarrassment of being dragged into a civil lawsuit to \n     testify about their private affairs. Moreover, Ms. Lewinsky \n     had already made clear that she had sought to conceal her \n     relationship with the President in a vain attempt to avoid \n     being ``humiliated in front of the entire world.'' On her own \n     initiative, she devised code names for use when communicating \n     with the President's secretary; deleted correspondence from \n     her computer and urged Linda Tripp to do the same; and \n     composed false and misleading ``talking points'' for Ms. \n     Tripp to use in the Jones case. In fact, Ms. Lewinsky was \n     admittedly ``so desperate'' for Linda Tripp not to reveal \n     anything about the relationship that she ``used anything and \n     anybody that [she] could think of as leverage with her.''\n       Equally unavailing was the Managers' insistence that the \n     President must have known Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit would be \n     false because no truthful affidavit could have saved her from \n     having to testify. Both the President and Ms. Lewinsky \n     testified that, in their view, it was possible to craft a \n     truthful affidavit that might have accomplished this \n     objective. The Managers have never explained why we should \n     not credit this unrebutted testimony.\n       The Managers have stretched the facts in other ways as \n     well, most notably with respect to the timing of Ms. \n     Lewinsky's job search. In their Trial Brief, in their opening \n     presentations, and in their charts, the Managers posited that \n     Mr. Jordan intensified his efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky a job \n     on December 11, 1997, only after, and because, the judge in \n     the Jones case ordered the President to answer far-ranging \n     questions about other women. The same theory appeared at page \n     11 of the Majority Report prepared for the House of \n     Representatives.\n       The President's counsel, in their opening presentations to \n     the Senate, made clear beyond any doubt that Mr. Jordan met \n     with Ms. Lewinsky before the judge issued her ruling, and \n     that the meeting had been scheduled several days before that. \n     Without acknowledging their error, the Managers retreated to \n     the argument that Mr. Jordan's assistance on December 11 was \n     triggered not by Judge Wright's order, but rather by the \n     appearance of Ms. Lewinsky's name on the witness list six \n     days earlier. But the Managers themselves refuted this \n     argument in their Trial Brief, which states that there was \n     ``still no urgency to help Ms. Lewinsky'' after the witness \n     list arrived on December 5. Moreover, although Manager \n     Hutchinson later insinuated that Mr. Jordan and the President \n     discussed Ms. Lewinsky's job search during their meeting on \n     December 7, the Managers' Trial Brief acknowledges that the \n     December 7 meeting was ``unrelated'' to Ms. Lewinsky.\n       More generally, the Managers failed to show any connection \n     between Ms. Lewinsky's status as an affiant and possible \n     deponent in the Jones case and her New York job search. Every \n     witness to testify on this point, including the President, \n     Ms. Lewinsky, and Mr. Jordan, agreed that those events were \n     unrelated. Beyond this, the record is clear that Ms. Lewinsky \n     first mentioned the possibility of moving to New York in \n     early July 1997; that people other than Mr. Jordan tried to \n     help Ms. Lewinsky get a job at the United Nations in early \n     October 1997; and that Ms. Lewinsky notified her employer \n     that she would be leaving her job and moving to New York in \n     November 1997--all well before her name surfaced on the Jones \n     witness list.\n       The Managers have also stretched and distorted the evidence \n     regarding the box of gifts that Ms. Currie retrieved from Ms. \n     Lewinsky on or about December 28, 1997. The Managers have \n     argued that the Senate ``may reasonably presume'' that Ms. \n     Currie retrieved the gifts, which had been subpoenaed by the \n     Jones attorneys, at the behest of the President. In making \n     this argument, the Managers ask us to disregard Ms. \n     Lewinsky's testimony that it was her idea to give the gifts \n     to Ms. Currie; the President's testimony that he never told \n     Ms. Currie to retrieve the gifts; Ms. Currie's testimony that \n     it was Ms. Lewinsky, not the President, who asked her to \n     retrieve the gifts; and the fact that the President gave Ms. \n     Lewinsky additional gifts on the very morning that he is \n     alleged to have asked for them back. They also ask us to \n     ignore Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that she decided on her own \n     to protect her own privacy by turning over only ``innocuous'' \n     gifts to the Jones lawyers. Finally, they ask us to ignore \n     exculpatory information concealed by Mr. Starr and revealed \n     to the Senate for the first time in Ms. Lewinsky's deposition \n     that the President's statement, ``Well, you have to turn over \n     whatever you have,'' sounded familiar to her.\n       The Managers have made much of a conversation between Ms. \n     Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan on December 31, 1997, that touched \n     upon certain notes, or possibly drafts of notes, Ms. Lewinsky \n     wrote to the President. According to Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Jordan \n     suggested ``something th[e] effect'' of, ``check to make sure \n     they are not there,'' which Ms. Lewinsky interpreted to mean, \n     ``get rid of whatever is there.'' Mr. Jordan recalled having \n     discussed the notes with Ms. Lewinsky, but denied having told \n     her to destroy them. Did Ms. Lewinsky misunderstand Mr. \n     Jordan, or is one witness lying? The Senate need not decide, \n     since by either account, the President was not a party to any \n     conversation about notes and, indeed, neither the notes nor \n     the December 31 conversation between Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. \n     Jordan are mentioned in the two Articles of Impeachment \n     approved by the House.\n       Perhaps the longest stretch by the Managers is their theory \n     regarding presidential aides Sidney Blumenthal, John Podesta, \n     and Bruce Lindsey. It simply cannot be that the target of a \n     grand jury investigation obstructs justice by making false or \n     misleading denials of wrongdoing in personal conversations \n     with friends and colleagues, even if he knows that they may \n     be compelled to testify about those conversations. Indeed, \n     until recently, most federal courts held that false denials \n     of wrongdoing--even when made under oath or to a federal \n     agent--could not be a basis for criminal liability.\n       The Managers have focused particular attention on the \n     President's conversation with Sidney Blumenthal on January \n     21, 1998, the day the Lewinsky scandal erupted. According to \n     Mr. Blumenthal, the President said that Ms. Lewinsky had told \n     him that she was called ``the stalker'' by her peers, and \n     that she would claim they had an affair because then she \n     would not be known as ``the stalker'' any more. Curiously, \n     Ms. Lewinsky herself, in the now-famous ``talking points'' \n     she prepared before her relationship with the President \n     became public, encouraged Ms. Tripp to defuse questions about \n     Ms. Lewinsky by saying, ``[S]he turned out to be this huge \n     liar. I found out she left the W[hite] H[ouse] because she \n     was stalking the P[resident] or something like that.\\13\\'' \n     Ms. Lewinsky acknowledged in her original proffer to Mr. \n     Starr that she was well aware of her reputation at the White \n     House and sought a detail from the Pentagon ``so people could \n     see Ms. L[ewinsky]'s good work and stop referring to her as \n     `The Stalker.''' Regardless, we can all agree that if the \n     President tried to conceal his own misconduct by maligning \n     Ms. Lewinsky, he acted shamefully. But this is a far cry from \n     acting criminally.\n       The Managers asked us to look at the ``big picture''. The \n     ``big picture'' with respect to Ms. Lewinsky is that she had \n     no intention of revealing her relationship with the \n     President, regardless of whether he helped her find a new \n     job; she acted independently and in her own best interests in \n     filing her affidavit in the Jones case; she originated and \n     carried out her plan to hide evidence from the Jones lawyers; \n     and Linda Tripp rather than Bill Clinton was her principal \n     advisor and ultimate betrayer. In fact, the only crimes shown \n     to have possibly occurred are not high crimes but those for \n     which Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp have received immunity from \n     prosecution from Mr. Starr.\n       What remains when you sweep aside the cobwebs of \n     unsupported speculation and conspiracy theory? To my mind, \n     the case on obstruction boils down to the charge that the \n     President, in the wake of his deposition in the Jones case, \n     ``coached'' his secretary about what to say if asked about \n     Ms. Lewinsky. The President has argued that Ms. Currie was \n     not then a witness in the Jones case and was not likely to be \n     one given the approaching deadline for completing discovery. \n     Moreover, he did not know that Mr. Starr had initiated an \n     investigation. In fact, once he learned that Mr. Starr was \n     investigating and that Ms. Currie might be a witness, the \n     President told Ms. Currie, ``Don't worry about me. Just \n     relax, go in there and tell the truth.''\n       I was seriously troubled by the President's counsel's \n     initial suggestion that Ms. Currie was never subpoenaed in \n     the Jones case. Still, Mr. Ruff's candid correction and \n     apology to the Senate stands in stark contrast to the \n     Managers' refusal to correct their own misleading \n     representations.\n       In the end, reasonable minds may differ over why the \n     President spoke to Ms. Currie\n\n[[Page S1587]]\n\n     as he did in mid-January 1998. His explanation--that he was \n     ``trying to think of the best defense we could construct in \n     the face of what I thought was going to be a media onslaught \n     \\14\\''--is not implausible. Using a trusted employee as a \n     sounding board to test responses that might later be made \n     public is also not implausible nor criminal. The President \n     also had a legitimate interest in determining whether Ms. \n     Currie was the source of the Jones lawyers' apparent \n     knowledge regarding Ms. Lewinsky. In the end, in light of the \n     plausible and innocent explanations for these conversations, \n     I do not accept as proven beyond a reasonable doubt the \n     Managers' conclusion that they were criminal ``coaching'' \n     sessions. I cannot vote to overturn a national election based \n     on the ambiguous record of this discrete episode.\n       Back on March 8th of last year, one of my Republican \n     colleagues on the Judiciary Committee stated his view that no \n     impeachment proceeding should be brought unless there was \n     ``an open-and-shut case'' because ``Americans cannot stand \n     the trauma of an impeachment matter unless it is cut-and-\n     dried.'' Even more clearly, the country cannot tolerate a \n     President's being removed from office based on the shifting \n     patchwork of circumstantial evidence and surmise that the \n     Managers have concocted.\n     C. There Was No Need to Call Witnesses\n       Witnesses would not fill the holes in the Managers' case.\n       The Managers only became interested in hearing from \n     witnesses once they faced trouble obtaining a conviction in \n     the Senate. They had an opportunity to interview witnesses \n     when this matter was still before the House. But the House \n     Judiciary Committee called no fact witnesses. The House of \n     Representatives called no witnesses at all. Rather, the House \n     Republicans voted out these Articles based on what they \n     were told by Special Prosecutor Starr.\n       They took the position that witnesses were not necessary. \n     For example, in November 1998, Manager Gekas stated that \n     ``[b]ringing in witnesses to rehash testimony that's already \n     concretely in the record would be a waste of time and serve \n     no purpose at all.'' Similarly, on December 19, 1998, during \n     the floor debate on the articles, Manager Hyde stated:\n\n       ``No fact witnesses, I have heard that repeated again and \n     again. Look, we had 60,000 pages of testimony from the grand \n     jury, from depositions, from statements under oath. That is \n     testimony that we can believe and accept. We chose to believe \n     it and accept it. Why reinterview Betty Currie to take \n     another statement when we already had her statement? Why \n     interview Monica Lewinsky when we had her statement under \n     oath, and with a grant of immunity that if she lied she would \n     forfeit?''\n       Having chosen to proceed in the House without witnesses, \n     the Managers were in no position to demand that the Senate \n     hear witnesses. A Senate impeachment trial is not a make-up \n     exam for an incomplete inquiry by the House.\n       In attempting to explain his inconsistent positions on \n     witnesses, Manager Hyde said, ``we were operating under time \n     constraints which were self-imposed but I promised my \n     colleagues to finish it before the end of the year. I didn't \n     want it to drag out.'' But self-imposed time constraints do \n     not begin to explain why Mr. Hyde's Committee declined to \n     call a single fact witness. The Committee did hold two day-\n     long hearings. It heard from a panel of convicted felons who \n     testified, to nobody's surprise, that perjury is a crime. And \n     it heard from the prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, who had no \n     first-hand knowledge of any facts in the case, and had not \n     even spoken with anyone who had. Those two days could have \n     been spent hearing fact witnesses and surely they would have \n     been, if the Committee majority thought for one moment that \n     fact witnesses would have any new and incriminating evidence \n     to share.\n       Mr. Hyde's second justification for failing to call \n     witnesses in the House was grounded in his mistaken view of \n     that body's role in the impeachment process. According to Mr. \n     Hyde, ``[t]he threshold in the House was for impeachment, \n     which is to seek a trial in the Senate. . . . All we could do \n     was present evidence sufficient to convince our colleagues \n     that there ought to be a trial over here in the Senate.'' I \n     have already explained the fallacy of this position. When \n     these Articles of Impeachment fail, as I believe they must, I \n     hope it will send a clear message to the House of \n     Representatives not to do a slapdash, partisan job on \n     something as momentous and wrenching for the nation as a \n     presidential impeachment.\n       Contrary to the suggestions of some Managers, there is no \n     authority for the notion that the Senate must hear witnesses. \n     It is true, as one Manager noted, that the Senate heard \n     witnesses during the impeachment trial of President Johnson, \n     notwithstanding the House's failure to do so. As most \n     historians agree, however, the Johnson impeachment was an \n     illegitimate attempt by the Reconstruction Republicans to \n     unseat a President whose policies they disliked. It was \n     hardly a model of procedural correctness.\n       More recently, in the 1980's, the Senate removed three \n     impeached federal judges without hearing any witnesses on the \n     Senate floor. Indeed, in the impeachment trial of Judge \n     Claiborne in 1986, a majority of the Senate approved a motion \n     by then-Majority Leader Dole not to hear any live testimony. \n     Instead, in each case, the Senate reviewed a written record \n     of testimony prepared by a special committee of Senators. The \n     Senate did this over the objections of the judges being \n     removed.\n       If the President is willing to forego the opportunity to \n     cross-examine the witnesses being relied upon by the \n     Managers, that eliminates the most pressing need for further \n     discovery in this matter. After all, Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie \n     and other witnesses were interviewed multiple times by the \n     Special Prosecutor's lawyers and investigators and then \n     testified repeatedly before the grand jury. That is about as \n     one sided as it gets--no cross examination, no opportunity to \n     compare early statements with the way things are reconfigured \n     and re-expressed after numerous preparation sessions with Mr. \n     Starr's office.\n       These witnesses testified under threat of prosecution by \n     Mr. Starr. Ms. Lewinsky is still under a very clear threat of \n     prosecution, even though she has a limited grant of immunity. \n     This Special Prosecutor has shown every willingness to \n     threaten and prosecute even those who have played minor, \n     tangential roles in his investigations of the President, such \n     as Julie Hiatt Steele, and those who have already been \n     relentlessly pursued in serial prosecutions, such as Webster \n     Hubbell and Susan McDougal.\n       Thus, if the President has not initiated efforts to obtain \n     more discovery and witnesses and is willing to have the \n     matter decided on the current Senate record, the Managers \n     carried a heavy burden to justify extending these proceedings \n     further and requiring the reexamination of people who have \n     already testified.\n       During his opening remarks, Manager McCollum said, ``I \n     don't know what the witnesses will say, but I assume if they \n     are consistent, they'll say the same that's in here,'' \n     referring to the voluminous record before the Senate. \n     Nevertheless, the majority in the Senate acceded to the \n     Managers' request to conduct depositions, which only \n     confirmed that subjecting the witnesses to further \n     examination would not provide any new revelations.\n       In fact, during the deposition of Ms. Lewinsky, Manager \n     Bryant conceded, ``Obviously, you testified extensively in \n     the grand jury, so you're going to obviously repeat things \n     today. We're doing the depositions for the Senators to \n     view.'' Likewise, during Mr. Jordan's deposition, Manager \n     Hutchinson acknowledged the witness's five prior grand jury \n     appearances and conceded, ``I know that probably about every \n     question that could be asked has been asked, but there are a \n     number of reasons I want to go over additional questions with \n     you, and some of them will be repetitious of what's been \n     asked before.''\n       There was no reason to protract this process further merely \n     to hear more redundant testimony live on the floor of the \n     Senate, in light of the President's agreement to forfeit this \n     opportunity to examine the witnesses.\n     D. Removal Is Not Warranted\n       The question each Senator must address is whether the \n     conduct charged in the Articles meets the constitutional \n     standard of high crime and misdemeanor warranting conviction \n     and removal. The Managers, the President's counsel and, in \n     particular, former Senator Dale Bumpers have provided us with \n     erudite history lessons on the misconduct the Framers meant \n     to cover by this standard.\n       We have heard debate whether this standard covers only \n     conduct performed in the President's public capacity or also \n     covers private conduct. A strong case can be made that the \n     Framers never intended that a President be subject to \n     impeachment and removal for private conduct--no matter how \n     egregious. Instead, they purposely limited the ground for \n     impeachment to offenses against the state or grave abuses of \n     official power.\n       But this argument presents the proverbial ``slippery \n     slope.'' Does this mean that a President may not be removed \n     for murder? The Framers may very well have responded ``no.'' \n     In fact, during the impeachment trial of Chief Justice Samuel \n     Chase, the presiding officer was then Vice-President Aaron \n     Burr, who at the same time was under indictment in both New \n     Jersey and New York for the murder of Alexander Hamilton in a \n     duel in 1804. As Chief Justice Rehnquist notes in Grand \n     Inquests, ``This fact caused one contemporary wag to remark \n     that whereas in most courts the murderer was arraigned before \n     the judge, in this court the judge was arraigned before the \n     murderer!'' Nonetheless, Burr was not the subject of the \n     impeachment trial, Chief Justice Chase was.\n       No matter how the Framers would treat serious private \n     misconduct, I do not hesitate to conclude that heinous \n     crimes, such as murder, would warrant the remedy of removal. \n     As Professor Charles Black explained:\n       ``Many common crimes--willful murder, for example--though \n     not subversive of government or political order, might be so \n     serious as to make a president simply unviable as a national \n     leader; I cannot think that a president who had committed \n     murder could not be removed by impeachment. But the \n     underlying reason remains much the same; such crimes would so \n     stain a president as to make his continuance in office \n     dangerous to public order.''\n       The House Judiciary Committee in 1974 summed up the thorny \n     issue of how to evaluate the constitutional standard for \n     impeachable and removable conduct as follows: ``Not all \n     presidential misconduct is sufficient to constitute grounds \n     for impeachment. There is a further requirement--\n     substantiality.''\n\n[[Page S1588]]\n\n       Professor Black also addressed the ``substantiality'' of \n     the misconduct necessary to meet the constitutional standard \n     for impeachment and removal, with the following illustration:\n       ``Suppose a president transported a woman across a state \n     line or even (so the Mann Act reads) from one point to \n     another within the District of Columbia, for what is quaintly \n     called an `immoral purpose.' Or suppose a president did not \n     immediately report to the nearest policeman that he had \n     discovered that one of his aides was a practicing \n     homosexual--thereby committing `misprision of a felony.' Or \n     suppose the president actively assisted a young White House \n     intern in concealing the latter's possession of three ounces \n     of marijuana--thus himself becoming guilty of `obstruction of \n     justice.' . . . Would it not be preposterous to think that \n     any of this is what the Framers meant when they referred to \n     `Treason, Bribery, and other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,' \n     or that any sensible constitutional plan would make a \n     president removable on such grounds?''\n       In my view, the charges that the President committed \n     perjury and obstructed justice to conceal an illicit \n     relationship with Monica Lewinsky not only fail as a matter \n     of proof, but to the extent they raise legitimate questions \n     about his conduct they fail the test of substantiality. As \n     one Vermonter recently wrote to the editor of the Burlington \n     Free Press, ``If there ever was a situation in which the \n     phrase making a mountain out of a mole hill is apt, it is the \n     impeachment trial to date.''\n       The Managers tried to address the criticism that the \n     conduct underlying the Articles is so insubstantial as to \n     leave the American public scratching their heads. Manager \n     Canady conceded that no President ``should be impeached and \n     removed from office for trivial or insubstantial offenses. . \n     . . A President should not be impeached and removed from \n     office for a mistake or judgement. He should not be impeached \n     and removed from office for a momentary lapse.'' Similarly, \n     Manager Graham acknowledged ``absolutely'' that reasonable \n     people could disagree about whether the President should be \n     removed, even were the charges proven. Manager Graham further \n     opined during questioning by Senators that:\n       ``I would not want my President removed for any criminal \n     wrongdoing. I would want my President removed only when there \n     was a clear case that points to the right decision for the \n     future of the country. . . I would not want my President \n     removed for trivial offenses, and that is the heart of the \n     matter here.''\n       My decision on this matter should not be misinterpreted to \n     mean that I countenance perjury or obstruction of justice, or \n     that I do not appreciate the need for enforcement of our laws \n     prohibiting such conduct for the functioning of our judicial \n     system. If committed, these are serious crimes. Nevertheless, \n     as Manager Graham recognized, reasonable people can and do \n     disagree on the ultimate questions in this trial.\n       I do not agree with the Managers that they have proven \n     these crimes were committed or that the conduct at issue here \n     is sufficiently heinous to warrant impeachment and removal of \n     the President. Chairman Henry Hyde recognized that ``one \n     hardly exhausts moral imagination by labeling every untruth \n     and every deception an outrage.''\n       The American people understand this point instinctively. In \n     my home State of Vermont, for instance, the majority of \n     people are overwhelmingly opposed to the removal of this \n     President from office. They were against it in August 1998, \n     when the House posted Mr. Starr's salacious referral on the \n     Internet. They were against it in November 1998, when Mr. \n     Starr appeared before the House Judiciary Committee to try to \n     breath some life back into his case for impeachment. They \n     were against it in December 1998, when the House Republicans \n     made even shriller pitches for impeachment to the American \n     people. And judging from the calls and mail I have received, \n     Vermonters are more certain than ever that they want Bill \n     Clinton to serve out his term.\n       Of course, we must not be led by the polls. The Framers \n     wanted impeachments to be tried in the Senate, not in the \n     court of public opinion. This is not a referendum. Still, \n     whether the evidence is sufficient to warrant the President's \n     removal turns at least in part on whether it makes him unfit \n     to govern, and on that question, the voice of the governed \n     should be heard.\n       The Managers have eloquently expressed their concern about \n     the ``kind of message'' it would send to America should the \n     Senate refuse to convict and remove the President on the \n     Articles. Chairman Hyde expressed his view that the message \n     would be that ``charges of perjury, obstruction of justice \n     are summarily dismissed--disregarded, ignored, brushed off'' \n     and that there is a double standard for the President.\n       With all due respect for the Managers' belief on this \n     score, I disagree. First, our assessment of whether the \n     President's personal misconduct meets the constitutional \n     standard for impeachment, conviction and removal should not \n     be misconstrued to reflect our views on the seriousness of \n     perjury or obstruction of justice. Professor Tribe, in his \n     testimony last November before a House Judiciary subcommittee \n     confronted this issue directly, stating:\n       ``It is always possible to argue, when confronted by \n     serious crime, that the system would crumble if everyone \n     followed the wrongdoer's example. If everyone took President \n     Richard Nixon's allegedly false filing of tax returns under \n     oath, including backdating documents, as a model to emulate, \n     the nation's tax system, and thus its defenses, would \n     crumble. Yet there was no realistic basis to suppose that the \n     Nixon example would start any such stampede, and the simple \n     proposition that, if all did as Nixon had done, the \n     consequences would be catastrophic did not mislead the House \n     Judiciary Committee into treating the President's alleged tax \n     evasion as an impeachable offense: By a vote of 26-12, the \n     Committee soundly declined to treat it as such.''\n       Second, the Managers are also wrong that Senate acquittal \n     of the President would essentially set-up a ``double-\n     standard'' and put the President above the law. The Managers \n     ignore the fact that the Constitution itself establishes a \n     purposely high and difficult standard for the Senate to \n     remove a duly elected head of a co-equal branch of \n     government. In a court of law, not a Senate court of \n     impeachment, the President, in his personal capacity, stands \n     subject to the same standard as any American.\n\n\n              VI. PRIOR JUDICIAL IMPEACHMENTS FOR PERJURY\n\n       Just ten years ago, the Senate voted to convict two Federal \n     judges on charges of perjury. The Managers read those \n     precedents to mean that perjury, if proved, is always an \n     impeachable offense--that Presidents ought not be held to a \n     lower standard of impeachability than judges. While the \n     failure of proof in this case obviates the need to resolve \n     the precedential effect, if any, that judicial impeachments \n     may have on the impeachment of a President, the Managers' \n     simplistic, ``one-size-fits-all'' approach is unsound.\n       Perjury is not included in the impeachment section of \n     Article II of the Constitution, even though, as Manager Buyer \n     noted, the Framers were familiar with the crime. Treason is \n     the defining crime in the Constitution--it is a crime against \n     and undermining the very existence of the Government. Bribery \n     is also expressly included--no officer of the United States \n     can continue if he is corrupted by accepting a bribe to do \n     something other than faithfully execute his public duties. \n     Perjury may, if proved, provide a basis for impeachment, but \n     only if it is determined to be within ``other high Crimes or \n     Misdemeanors.''\n       In the recent judicial impeachments, the lies at issue were \n     aimed at concealing gross abuses of official power. Judge \n     Alcee Hastings lied to conceal his participation in a \n     conspiracy to fix cases in his own court. Judge Walter Nixon \n     lied to conceal his corrupt efforts to influence a state \n     prosecutor to drop a case. Significantly, Judge Nixon had \n     been convicted by a Federal jury and was serving a 5-year \n     prison sentence at the time he was impeached and removed; he \n     simply could not continue to function as a Federal judge and \n     perform his duties.\n       House Managers have also referred to the impeachment of a \n     third judge, Judge Harry Claiborne, but he was impeached for \n     filing a false tax return and not perjury per se. In any \n     event, as with Judge Nixon, Judge Claiborne had been \n     convicted after a jury trial and was serving a federal prison \n     term when he was impeached.\n       By contrast, President Clinton is not accused of lying to \n     conceal public misconduct. He is accused of lying to conceal \n     the ``nature and details'' of an extramarital affair--an \n     affair that he admitted had occurred.\n       Beyond this, there are very basic differences in terms and \n     functions between Federal judges and the President. Judges \n     are appointed for life. Presidents are elected for fixed \n     terms and accountable in political terms. A President can be \n     subject to review by the people if he runs for reelection. \n     Moreover, removing an appointed Federal judge, while \n     extremely serious, implicates none of the momentous, anti-\n     democratic consequences of removing an elected President.\n       Another difference between Federal judges and the President \n     is that, under the Constitution, only the former ``hold their \n     Offices during good Behaviour.'' The proposition, however, \n     that this clause creates a different constitutional standard \n     for removal of judges than for removal of the President or \n     other civil officers is dangerous. Such an interpretation \n     would invite attacks on the independence of the federal \n     judiciary and undermine the balance among the three co-equal \n     branches of our federal government. Indeed, Alexander \n     Hamilton opined in Federalist No. 79 that impeachment was the \n     only provision for removal ``which we find in our own \n     Constitution in respect to our own judges.''\n       The past few years have seen unprecedented attacks on \n     controversial decisions by Federal judges. Should such \n     decisions be deemed malfeasance by the party in control of \n     Congress, then impeachment proceedings against judges who \n     render unpopular decisions could provide a platform for \n     endless political posturing. More importantly, this would \n     chill the independent operation of our Federal judiciary.\n       As Professor Michael Gerhardt has explained, the good \n     behavior clause does not mean that Federal judges may be \n     impeached on the basis of a lower standard than the \n     President, but it does suggest that they may be impeached \n     ``on a basis that takes account of their special duties or \n     functions.'' A judge who lies under oath is uniquely unfit to \n     continue in an office that requires him to administer oaths \n     and sit in judgment. It is perfectly appropriate for the \n     Senate when sitting as a court of impeachment to take into\n\n[[Page S1589]]\n\n     account the type of duties that the impeached official is \n     called upon to perform and whether the charges, if proved, \n     clearly impair the official's ability to perform those \n     duties. The outcome of this analysis may very well differ \n     depending on the job of the impeached official.\n\n\n                  VII. ``FINDINGS OF FACT'' FALLACIES\n\n       As the impeachment trial wore on, without any prospect of a \n     conviction and removal, a popular Republican exit strategy \n     was to force a preliminary vote on so-called ``findings of \n     fact'' that the President committed perjury and obstructed \n     justice, to be followed by a second vote on removal. I \n     opposed this initiative because, in my view, it reflected a \n     basic misunderstanding of the Senate's constitutional \n     function when sitting as a court of impeachment.\n       The Senate's constitutional role is to determine whether to \n     convict the President of an impeachable offense and remove \n     him from office. This is a unitary question, requiring a \n     unitary answer. In recognition thereof, the Senate has rules \n     prohibiting dividing articles of impeachment.\n       A presidential impeachment trial is not an appropriate \n     forum for ``finding'' that a public official has committed a \n     crime. Crime and punishment are issues expressly reserved by \n     the Constitution to our criminal courts, where an accused is \n     entitled to due process rights far in excess of the minimal \n     procedural protections being accorded the President in the \n     Senate trial. In the current case there are also additional \n     complicating factors since the Senate made up its procedures \n     as it went along and the specific charges against the \n     President have constantly shifted.\n       Impeachment is not about punishing the officeholder but \n     about protecting the public. Senator George Edmunds of \n     Vermont explained in 1868 that ``[p]unishment by impeachment \n     does not exist under our Constitution. . . . [The accused] \n     can only be removed from the office he fills and prevented \n     from holding office, not as punishment, but as a means merely \n     of protection to the community . . . .'' Our focus must be on \n     whether the conduct with which the House has charged \n     President Clinton has been proven and warrants his removal \n     from office to protect the public.\n       Branding the President is not the function of impeachment. \n     On the contrary, a congressional finding of guilt for \n     criminal conduct would be an illegitimate exercise in shaming \n     the President and an abuse of the impeachment process in \n     support of a future criminal prosecution, which recent leaks \n     from prosecutor Starr's office confirm he is considering.\n       A preliminary vote on guilt in the form of ``findings of \n     fact'' would set the dangerous precedent that a Senate \n     impeachment trial could be used for the purpose of \n     criticizing conduct that the constitutionally-required number \n     of Senators did not believe was impeachable. The last \n     protection against impeachment by an opposing party with \n     majority control of Congress would be eviscerated. This would \n     trivialize the constitutional impeachment process and invite \n     future illegitimate impeachments.\n       ``Findings of fact'' that the President committed the acts \n     charged in the Articles would be tantamount to conviction on \n     the impeachment Articles themselves and more accurately \n     described as ``findings of guilt'' without the remedy \n     prescribed by the Constitution. As a matter of constitutional \n     law and Senate practice, such ``findings'' cannot and should \n     not be separated from the vote on removal. Article II, \n     section 4 of the Constitution provides that, upon conviction \n     by the Senate, the President ``shall be removed from \n     Office.'' By making removal mandatory upon conviction, the \n     Constitution precludes the Senate from taking the \n     politically-expedient, oxymoronic route of convicting without \n     removing.\n       Proponents of the Republican proposals pointed to \n     eighteenth century precedents long ago repudiated. In the \n     first three judicial impeachment trials that ended in \n     conviction, the Senate, having voted to convict, took a \n     separate vote on removal from office. But in each case, the \n     first vote required a two-thirds supermajority, as specified \n     by the Constitution, not a simple majority as is now \n     proposed. Moreover, the Senate rejected this early precedent \n     in 1936; since then, it has been the understanding of the \n     Senate that removal follows automatically from conviction. \n     The lack of solid precedent for ``findings of fact'' speaks \n     volumes.\n       This unprecedented exit strategy was opposed by Republicans \n     and Democrats who did not want to circumvent the Constitution \n     merely to find a convenient end to this impeachment trial. \n     Former Judge Robert Bork termed these proposals \n     ``preposterous readings of the Constitution as well as \n     utterly impractical.'' Former Reagan Attorney General Edwin \n     Meese cautioned that the Senate ``should not flirt with \n     unconstitutional action, especially where conviction and \n     removal of the President are at stake.''\n       Robert Frost said that the best way out is always through. \n     In the end, the Senate's best way out was to fulfill its \n     proper role in the impeachment process by voting on the \n     Articles.\n\n\n             VIII. EFFECT ON CHILDREN AND NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n       My consideration of the Articles would be incomplete \n     without addressing one final point raised by the House \n     Managers about the effect of our decision. They have \n     cautioned that should this President be acquitted, the \n     consequences would be dire for our children, military morale, \n     and the functioning of our judicial system. I reject these \n     doomsday scenarios and believe that the precedent set by \n     conviction without proof and removal without constitutional \n     justification would be far more dangerous for our Republic.\n       For example, when he was asked whether acquitting the \n     President would endanger the stability of our government, \n     Manager Hyde responded that it would, because it would set a \n     bad example for our children. I was surprised by this answer. \n     This is hardly the sort of danger that the Framers of the \n     Constitution were concerned with when they met in \n     Philadelphia in 1787. They had just paid a great price to \n     liberate themselves from a tyrant. They wanted to ensure that \n     their new Chief Executive could not become a tyrant. They \n     wanted to ensure that he could be removed if he posed a \n     threat to the democratic system of government that they had \n     fought so hard to establish. They were not trying to ensure \n     that the President would be a good role model for the \n     nation's children.\n       More importantly, as a father and grandfather, I work hard \n     to be a role model for my children and grandchild. They do \n     not need the President to serve that role. They do not have \n     to look to the Congress to impeach and remove this President \n     to know the difference between right and wrong.\n       I trust the parents of America to raise their children, to \n     explain what the President did was wrong, and to point out \n     the humiliation and other consequences he has brought on \n     himself and his presidency for an entire year and for as long \n     as history books are written. I do not believe that the \n     Constitution calls upon us to remove a duly elected President \n     for symbolic purposes.\n       The Managers have also struggled to raise the specter that \n     a vote of acquittal on the Articles would risk our national \n     security by undermining the morale of our military, who would \n     appear to be held to a double standard. I have more faith in \n     our military. If the Managers' position were correct then we \n     would have seen ill-effects from President Bush's pardon of \n     former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who had been \n     indicted on several counts, including for lying before a \n     grand jury. But we did not.\n       In fact, at that time, Manager Hyde applauded the decision \n     to pardon Mr. Weinberger, saying, ``I'm glad the president \n     had the chutzpah to do it.'' Far from censuring this accused \n     perjurer or deploring the bad example he had set, Mr. Hyde \n     denounced the Independent Counsel who had brought this \n     ``political'' prosecution and stated: ``I just wish [us] out \n     of this mess, this six years and this $30-40 million that has \n     been spent [by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh]. It's \n     endless and it is a bottomless pit for money, with no \n     accountability.''\n       The fact that the Constitution sets a high standard for \n     removal of a President has no bearing on the standard of \n     conduct applicable to military service. In addition, it does \n     not place the President above the law. Indeed, all of us in \n     Congress have special immunity under the speech and debate \n     clause. That has never been argued to place us above the law \n     nor undermine military morale.\n\n\n     IX. DELIBERATIONS ON DISPOSITIVE TRIAL MOTIONS SHOULD BE OPEN\n\n       Accustomed as we and the American people are to having our \n     proceedings in the Senate open to the public and subject to \n     press coverage, the most striking prescription in the ``Rules \n     of Procedure and Practice in the Senate when Sitting on \n     Impeachment Trials'' has been the closed deliberations \n     required on any preliminary question or motion, and now on \n     the final question whether the Articles of Impeachment should \n     be sustained or rejected.\n       The requirement of closed deliberation, more than any other \n     rule, reflects the age in which the rules were originally \n     adopted in 1868. Even in 1868, not everyone favored secrecy. \n     During the trial of President Johnson, the senior Senator \n     from Vermont, George F. Edmunds, moved to have the closed \n     deliberations on the Articles transcribed and officially \n     reported ``in order that the world might know, without \n     diminution or exaggeration, the reasons and views upon which \n     we proceed to our judgment.'' The motion was tabled.\n       In the 130 years that have passed since that time, the \n     Senate has seen the advent of television in the Senate \n     Chamber, instant communication, distribution of Senate \n     documents over the Internet, the addition of 46 Senators \n     representing 23 additional States, and the direct election of \n     Senators by the people in our States.\n       Opening deliberations would help further the dual purposes \n     of our rules to promote fairness and political accountability \n     in the impeachment process. I supported the motion by \n     Senators Harkin, Wellstone and others to suspend this rule \n     requiring closed deliberations and to open our deliberations \n     on Senator Byrd's motion to dismiss and at other points \n     earlier in this trial. We were unsuccessful. Now that the \n     Senate has approached final deliberations on the Articles of \n     Impeachment, I had hoped that this secrecy rule would be \n     suspended so that the Senate's deliberations would be open \n     and the American people could see them. In a matter of this \n     historic importance, the American people should be able to \n     witness their Senators' deliberations.\n       Some have indicated objection to opening our final \n     deliberations because petit juries in courts of law conduct \n     their deliberations in\n\n[[Page S1590]]\n\n     secret. Analogies to juries in courts of law are misplaced. I \n     was privileged to serve as a prosecutor for eight years \n     before I was elected to the Senate. As a prosecutor, I \n     represented the people of Vermont in court and before juries \n     on numerous occasions. I fully appreciate the traditions and \n     importance of allowing jurors to deliberate and make their \n     decisions privately, without intrusion or pressure from the \n     parties, the judge or the public. The sanctity of the jury \n     deliberation room ensures the integrity and fairness of our \n     judicial system.\n       The Senate sitting as an impeachment court is unlike any \n     jury in any civil or criminal case. A jury in a court of law \n     is chosen specifically because the jurors have no connection \n     or relation to the parties or their lawyers and no \n     familiarity with the allegations. Keeping the deliberations \n     of regular juries secret ensures that as they reach their \n     final decision, they are free from outside influences or \n     pressure.\n       As the Chief Justice made clear on the third day of the \n     impeachment trial, the Senate is more than a jury; it is a \n     court. Courts are called upon to explain the reasons for \n     decisions. Furthermore, to the extent the Senate is called \n     upon to evaluate the evidence as is a jury, we stand in \n     different shoes than any juror in a court of law. We all know \n     many of the people who have been witnesses in this matter; we \n     all know the Managers--indeed, one Senator is a brother of \n     one of the Managers--and we were familiar with the underlying \n     allegations in this case before the Managers ever began their \n     presentation.\n       Because we are a different sort of jury, we shoulder a \n     heavier burden in explaining the reasons for the decisions we \n     make here. I appreciate why Senators would want to have some \n     aspects of our deliberations in closed session: to avoid \n     embarrassment to and protect the privacy of persons who may \n     be discussed. Yet, on the critical decisions we are now being \n     called upon to make on our votes on the Articles themselves, \n     allowing our deliberations to be open to the public helps \n     assure the American people that the decisions we make are for \n     the right reasons.\n       In 1974, when the Senate was preparing itself for the \n     anticipated impeachment trial of former President Richard \n     Nixon, the Committee on Rules and Administration discussed \n     the issue of allowing television coverage of the Senate \n     trial. Such coverage did not become routine in the Senate \n     until later in 1986. In urging such coverage of the possible \n     impeachment trial of President Nixon, Senator Metcalf (D-MT), \n     explained:\n       ``Given the fact that the party not in control of the White \n     House is the majority party in the Senate, the need for \n     broadcast media access is even more compelling. Charges of a \n     `kangaroo court,' or a `lynch mob proceeding' must not be \n     given an opportunity to gain any credence whatsoever. \n     Americans must be able to see for themselves what is \n     occurring. An impeachment trial must not be perceived by the \n     public as a mysterious process, filtered through the \n     perceptions of third parties. The procedure whereby the \n     individual elected to the most powerful office in the world \n     can be lawfully removed must command the highest possible \n     level of acceptance from the electorate.''\n       Opening deliberation would ensure complete and accurate \n     public understanding of the proceedings and the reasons for \n     the decisions we make here. Opening our deliberations on our \n     votes on the Articles would tell the American people why each \n     of us voted the way we did.\n       The last time this issue was actually taken up and voted on \n     by the Senate was more than a century ago in 1876, during the \n     impeachment trial of Secretary of War William Belknap. \n     Without debate or deliberation, the Senate refused then to \n     open the deliberations of the Senate to the public. That was \n     before Senators were elected directly by the people of their \n     State, that was before the Freedom of Information Act \n     confirmed the right of the people to see how government \n     decisions are made. Keeping closed our deliberations is \n     wholly inconsistent with the progress we have made over the \n     last century to make our government more accountable to the \n     people.\n       Constitutional scholar Michael Gerhardt noted that ``the \n     Senate is ideally suited for balancing the tasks of making \n     policy and finding facts (as required in impeachment trials) \n     with political accountability.'' Public access to the reasons \n     each Senator gives for his vote on the Articles is vital for \n     the political accountability that is the hallmark of our \n     role.\n       I likewise have urged the Senate to adjust these 130-year-\n     old rules to allow the Senate's votes on the Articles of \n     Impeachment to be recorded for history by news photographers. \n     This is a momentous official and public event in the annals \n     of the Senate and in the history of the nation. This is a \n     moment of history that should be documented for both its \n     contemporary and its lasting significance.\n       Open deliberation ensures complete accountability to the \n     American people. Charles Black wrote that presidential \n     impeachment ``unseats the person the people have deliberately \n     chosen for the office.'' /22/ The American people must be \n     able to judge if their elected representatives have chosen \n     for or against conviction for reasons they understand, even \n     if they disagree. To bar the American people from observing \n     the deliberations that result in these important decisions is \n     unfair and undemocratic.\n       The Senate should have suspended the rules so that our \n     deliberations on the final question of whether to convict the \n     President of these Article of Impeachment were held in open \n     session. After this impeachment trial is over, I urge the \n     Senate to re-examine the rule on closed deliberations in \n     impeachment trials and revise the rule to reflect the open \n     and accountable government that is now the pride and hallmark \n     of our democracy.\n\n\n                             X. CONCLUSION\n\n       The House Managers have warned that should the President be \n     acquitted we will set a dangerous precedent and damage the \n     ``rule of law.'' I strongly disagree. Instead, we will have \n     set the following important precedent for the future: that \n     partisan impeachment drives are doomed to failure.\n       It is up to the Senate, now, to restore sanity to this \n     process, exercise judgment, do justice and act in the \n     interests of the nation. We all knew before the trial began \n     that history will judge us on whether this case was resolved \n     in a way that serves the good of the country, not the \n     political ends of any party. I commend my colleagues in the \n     Senate and in particular Majority Leader Lott and Minority \n     Leader Daschle for working hard to maintain bipartisanship \n     and fairness in our proceedings.\n       In all the references to the first presidential impeachment \n     trial, a little-known historical fact has been overlooked. \n     After the unsuccessful effort to remove him from office, \n     former President Johnson returned to serve this country as a \n     United States Senator. I look forward to the day when the \n     Senate has concluded the impeachment of President Clinton and \n     we can close our work as an impeachment court and turn to the \n     other important work we face as Senators.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     1.

Black, supra, p. 17.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. Chief Justice, my fellow Senators, as this trial \nnears the end, we have to ask the question how we got here with a \ntragedy like this. There are many losers. There are no winners. There \nare surely no heroes. There are lots of lessons to be learned, and I \nthink all of our prayers ought to go out to those who were ensnared in \nthe web of controversy.\n  In reflecting on this case and my role in it under the Constitution, \nthe word ``sad'' comes to mind. I have not relished sitting in judgment \nof a twice-elected, popular President. I would prefer to make history \nin other ways. I also regret the nature of the subject of this case. It \nis not easy having our entire society suddenly thrust into an open, \nnonstop debate about things that ought to make all of us blush.\n  Some say that this impeachment effort is part of a right-wing \nconspiracy, it is a Republican plot to get a Democratic President. \nLet's look at how we got here and see if that argument holds up.\n  We are here because the President did wrongful acts and he admits to \nthat. We are here because of the independent counsel law. The President \nhimself led the charge to reauthorize the Independent Counsel Act. \nThirty-three of my colleagues on this side of the aisle were in the \nSenate at that particular time. All but one of you voted for \nreauthorization.\n  On June 30, 1994, the President signed that reauthorization bill. He \nissued a statement and here is what he said:\n\n       This law, originally passed in 1978, is a foundation stone \n     for the trust between Government and our citizens. . .\n\n\n[[Page S1591]]\n\n\n  He says,\n\n       Opponents called it a tool of partisan attack against \n     Republican Presidents and a waste of taxpayer funds. It was \n     neither. In fact, the independent counsel statute has been in \n     the past and is today a force for Government integrity and \n     public confidence.\n\n  Those were the words of President Clinton, June 30, 1994.\n  Before reauthorization, it was the President himself who advocated \nthe appointment of a special prosecutor. That appointment was made by \nthe President's own Attorney General. After reauthorization, the \nAttorney General supported the appointment of an independent counsel. \nThe independent counsel was then appointed by a special three-judge \npanel, as required by law.\n  Also under the law, the Attorney General can initiate the dismissal \nof an independent counsel if he oversteps his bounds or acts \nimproperly. Not only was this never done by the President's Attorney \nGeneral but, in contrast, she even agreed several times to expand his \njurisdiction, including to cover the Monica Lewinsky matter.\n  Also under the law, the independent counsel is obliged to send to the \nHouse any evidences of crimes that might be impeachable.\n  In short, this case came about through a legitimate, legal process. \nIt is a process that historically was vigorously defended by this side \nof the aisle. There are various checks and balances built into the \nprocess. They are designed to prevent abuse by the independent counsel, \nbut they were never triggered, even though the President's own Attorney \nGeneral could move for dismissal.\n  No, this President is in this predicament because of his own private \nwrongdoing and because of public policy he pursued. There is no \nconspiracy.\n  The President's actions are having a profound impact, of course, upon \nour society. His misdeeds have caused many to mistrust elected \nofficials. Cynicism is swelling among the grassroots. His breach of \ntrust has eroded the public's faith in the office of the Presidency. \nThe President's wrongdoing has painted all of us in Washington with a \nvery broad brush.\n  In the past 12 months, thousands of Iowans have registered their \nopinions with me. One letter from a middle school principal speaks \nvolumes.\n  At an assembly to mark the new school year, a video entitled \n``Attitude is Everything'' was presented to the student body. The video \nwas all about American heroes--college athletes, Olympic medalists, \nastronauts and world leaders.\n  Logically, the video also included President Clinton. The school \nprincipal wrote to me the following. He said, when the President's \npicture appeared, the entire student body--ages 11 to 14--snickered. He \nsaid their spontaneous reaction struck a chord. He wrote:\n\n       Although they may not fully understand the adult \n     connotations and political ramifications. . .they do know \n     that if you want to be trusted and [if you want to be] \n     respected, you must tell the truth. . ..[A]s an educator in \n     Iowa's public schools for the past 16 years. . .our students' \n     reaction to President Clinton's picture is one of the saddest \n     moments I can recall. In that instant, I realized how deeply \n     his conduct has affected our country.\n\n  Mr. Chief Justice, there is that word ``sad'' again. It seems to come \nto the fore in people's minds over this case, over this President's \nconduct, and over the impact it has had on our country.\n  The true tragedy in this case is the collapse of the President's \nmoral authority. He undermined himself when he wagged his finger and \nlied to our people on national television, denying that relationship \nwith Ms. Lewinsky. That did more damage to his credibility than any \nother single act.\n  There was no better reason than that for the resignation of the \nPresident. I did not personally call for his resignation in August. \nThat is something the President should decide on his own. But once you \nlose your moral authority to lead, you are a failure as a leader. FDR \nonce spoke of the Presidency in this way:\n\n       The Presidency is not merely an administrative office. . \n     ..It is preeminently a place of moral leadership.\n\n  Mr. Clinton should take note.\n  Next, there is the issue of the abuse of power and authority. The \nPresident used his position to enter into an improper relationship with \na subordinate--not just a subordinate, a young intern. He later used \nhis power to find her a job.\n  Another abuse of power: The full powers of the White House were on \nlease to stonewall the process and to attack the credibility of those \nwho investigated him.\n  This White House has perfected the art of stonewalling around the \ntruth. I fear that future White Houses will learn much from these \nexperts and will refine and improve their own truth-fighting arsenals. \nTruth and openness will be casualties.\n  Last, there is the issue of the poor example the President's actions \nserve for the Nation, especially for our youth. Is it now OK to lie \nbecause the President does it? And in the same manner, by wordsmithing, \nby trying to figure out what the meaning is of the word ``is''?\n  I received a call recently from a mother of a teenage son in Des \nMoines. All last year, she thought the investigation of the President \nwas a wasteful, partisan witch hunt. She was totally against the \ninvestigation and impeachment.\n  And then her son got into some serious trouble, and it involved \nlying. She confronted him with the wrong. Her son responded: ``What I \ntold you is the truth as I understood it at the time.''\n  The mother grew furious, and she said at that moment she knew that we \ncouldn't have a President like Bill Clinton. She knew firsthand the \ndamage that his conduct had done to her family and to our country. At \nthat point, she said she changed her position in favor of impeachment.\n  These are all questions and issues that emerge from the broader \ncontours of this case, outside the narrow charges in the articles.\n  With respect to the impeachment charges, many of the President's \narguments are based on contorted interpretations of the facts. These \ninterpretations aren't credible. They represent lawyering at its best \nor, as some would say, at its worst.\n  It is clear to me that the President committed serious crimes when he \ncoached his secretary, Betty Currie, and when he misled his aides, \nSidney Blumenthal and John Podesta. Each of these aides ended up being \na witness in official court proceedings. I believe, based on the \nevidence before the Senate, that the President lied to these witnesses \nso they would repeat those lies before official court proceedings. That \nis obstruction of justice.\n  In addition, I find it very interesting that a power lawyer like \nVernon Jordan would be so active in the job hunt for Ms. Lewinsky. \nRegardless of what she felt or thought, I believe the President was \narranging to get her a job. That way, she wouldn't provide harmful \ntestimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. Again, \nobstruction of justice.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, these actions weren't just outrageous, and, more \nimportant, morally wrong, but they were also illegal. They were a \ndirect assault on the integrity of the judicial process. The President \nis guilty of the offenses charged under article II.\n  The first article charges that the President committed perjury on \nseveral occasions. While I am not convinced he committed perjury on \neach occasion charged, I believe he did commit perjury when he lied \nabout his efforts to obstruct justice. That is the fourth count.\n  I don't believe the President's statement that he was merely trying \nto refresh his memory when he spoke with Betty Currie about his \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and I don't believe the President's \nstatement that he was only trying to protect himself from embarrassment \nwhen he concocted elaborate lies about Ms. Lewinsky and then conveyed \nthose lies to his aides.\n  The President was not forthright when he testified before the grand \njury. Time and time again, he gave answers that were misleading and \nsometimes deliberately false. The American people have a right to \nexpect their President to be completely truthful, as they can expect \nyou and me to be completely truthful. And the American people have a \nright to expect their President to be truthful, especially when placed \nunder oath. I will vote guilty on article I as well.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, these were not easy decisions. They are the \nproduct of soul-searching, as it is for all of you.\n\n[[Page S1592]]\n\n So they leave me with a good conscience. I believe my votes reflect \nthe truth of what happened in this case.\n  The Senate is about to close this chapter in American history. It may \nor may not be the final chapter in this story. Nonetheless, our \ndecision in this impeachment trial will stand against the test of time. \nYou only truly understand the present when it is past. In that respect, \nfuture generations will serve as our jury and, in the end, history will \nserve as the final judge. Thank you.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I promised to share with the people of Idaho and the \nnation what comments I made in the closed session of the Senate \ndeliberating on the impeachment of President Clinton.\n  What I told my colleagues as we deliberated was this:\n  If we were in a church, the minister would admonish us from the \npulpit to hate the sin and forgive the sinner. But we're not in a \nchurch.\n  If we were in a court of law, the judge would tell us to hate the \ncrime, and punish the criminal. But we're not in a court of law.\n  We're part of a constitutionally-directed impeachment tribunal, and \nour job is to love the Constitution and protect the office of the \npresident. Our decision should not be about saving or rejecting William \nJefferson Clinton, but about protecting the office of the president and \nkeeping our Constitution strong.\n  I believe he committed the crimes and acts charged in the articles of \nimpeachment, and I will vote to convict and remove him from office.\n  That was my statement to the Senators in closed deliberations, and I \nstand by it today.\n  But this statement was not the full explanation of my vote and my \nreasoning that I believe is owed to the people of Idaho and the nation. \nTherefore, let me take a few moments now to clarify why I voted to \nconvict President Clinton on the articles of impeachment.\n  First, I believe the House made its case on the facts. I was \npersuaded by what I saw, read, and heard that the president \ndeliberately lied under oath in the case brought by Paula Jones to \nenforce her civil rights. I was also persuaded that he encouraged \nothers to lie under oath and committed other acts designed to obstruct \njustice. In reaching these conclusions, it was important to me that the \nSenate is not bound to a specific constitutional or statutory standard \nin judging the evidence; instead, each Senator is left to his or her \nown experience and conscience. That is both the political and judicial \nnature of the impeachment process prescribed by the Constitution.\n  However, reaching this conclusion about the facts does not trigger \nautomatic conviction and removal of the president. A Senator must still \nresolve two questions: whether the acts committed were the kind of \n``high crimes and misdemeanors'' warranting removal from office, and \nwhether the interests of the nation are served by removal. Impeachment \nby the House expresses that chamber's opinion on those two questions, \nbut it is up to the Senate to render final judgment.\n  And it is these two questions that have caused the most perplexity in \nthis impeachment process--not to mention the most furious debate, hand \nwringing, and logical contortions.\n  For example, we have heard much during these proceedings about \nproportionality--in other words, about ensuring that the punishment or \nsanction fits the crime. Some of our colleagues have suggested that \nwhile the crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice may rise to the \nlevel of impeachable offenses, that conclusion is not inevitable on \nevery set of facts. More to the point, they argue there is something in \nthis particular case that diminishes the seriousness of the offense or \nrenders it a private, as opposed to public, crime: perhaps the context \nof the misdeeds, or the subject matter of the perjury, or the motive \nbehind the obstruction of justice.\n  Yet considerations such as these have not prevented the government \nfrom prosecuting citizens who committed such crimes. Furthermore, while \nwe are not bound by statutory definitions of crimes here, these \narguments frustrate the very goal our Founders had in mind when they \nestablished the extraordinary remedy of impeachment: to protect the \nexecutive office and the nation from a lawless president. The Framers \nof the Constitution believed that governments are established in the \nfirst place to protect the rights of the governed. It follows that the \nmost serious breach of duty in public office--the most serious threat \nto the order of society itself--is for the enforcers of the law to \nbreak the law. How much more grave that breach becomes when it is \ncommitted by the one individual in the nation who personifies the \nfederal government: the president. How much more abhorrent it is when, \nin covering up his crimes, that president exploited the very \npublic trust he betrayed.\n\n  There is no question in my mind that perjury and obstruction of \njustice are the kind of public crimes that the Founders had in mind, \nand the House managers have demonstrated these crimes were committed by \nthe president. As for the excuses being desperately sought by some to \nallow President Clinton to escape accountability, it seems to me that \ncreating such loopholes would require tearing holes in the \nConstitution--something that cannot be justified to protect this \npresident, or any president.\n  This brings me to the final question: whether the public interest \nwill be served by the president's removal from office. Let me say there \nare those in my State who have been seeking this result ever since the \npresident was elected, because they simply don't agree with him. I, \ntoo, generally disagree--sometimes loudly--with President Clinton's \napproach to public policy.\n  However, political and policy differences are emphatically not the \nfocus of this question. Instead, the Founders intended us to focus on \nthe safety of the nation. That is a very high threshold, appropriate to \nthe serious impact of the vote we must case. In this case, many are \narguing that our nation is not at risk; we're prosperous; the \ngovernment is not collapsing; there is no immediate or external threat \nto the country.\n  But I would submit that if a generation of young people are taught by \nour actions in this case that a lie carries no consequences, then the \nnation is at risk. If our citizens conclude that lawlessness in the \nhighest office is acceptable, that their elected representatives are \ncomplicit in that corruption, and that nothing can be done to stop it, \nthen the nation is at risk. If future presidents think they can go \nfurther in lying or obstruction of justice when they apply the \n``Clinton Indicator,'' then the nation is at risk. If the Executive \nOffice of the President is occupied by an individual who is generally \nbelieved to have lied and betrayed the public trust--if the symbol, the \nicon of the presidency is compromised, the nation is at risk.\n  Some have suggested that removing this president from office would \nput the nation at risk. That is false argument and something no one \nshould fear. Instead, we should place our faith in the Constitution and \nthe wisdom of its Framers, who provided a roadmap for a peaceful, \nswift, and orderly transition of power to the vice president. That \ntransition poses no threat to the nation.\n  On the other hand, I believe exonerating President Clinton with a \nvote for acquittal does create a threat to our nation. In short, I am \nconvinced that the nation is at risk today--not because of the \npossibility of the president's removal through the impeachment process, \nbut because of the damage he has caused to the Executive office of the \nPresident, and the damage that continues to be done by his remaining in \noffice.\n  For all these reasons, I believe my vote to convict and remove this \npresident from office is an appropriate response, a necessary response, \na constitutionally-compelled response.\n  I said at the beginning of this process that it would be my goal to \nensure that we proceeded in a fair and constitutional manner. I believe \nwe have done so--and managed along the way to generally rise above \npartisanship and the politics of the day. While I fundamentally \ndisagree with many of my colleagues in the final result, I salute them \nfor their sincerity and the seriousness of their purpose. No matter \nwhat the result, the Senate discharged its constitutional duty well.\n  However, reluctant as I am to say it, I do not believe this sorry \nchapter in our history is closed. On the first day\n\n[[Page S1593]]\n\nof this trial, as I watched the Chief Justice take the chair, I was \nangry--profoundly angry that this president had brought this nation to \nthis point because of his own self-gratification, setting what was good \nfor himself above what was good for the nation. It is unconscionable \nwhat the president has put the country through, continues to put the \ncountry through, and will continue to put the country through for his \nown personal and political ends. My differences with the president on \nthis point transcend party or policy; I am saddened that this sorry \nchapter will continue, that the book will be open and the pages of this \nchapter will be turning as long as this president remains on office. \nOur young people, our citizens, our Constitution deserve a better end \nto a better story.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. Chief Justice, my colleagues, 31 days ago at about this \nvery hour we gathered in the Old Senate Chamber in closed session to \nbegin the journey that has brought us to where we are today. We are \nonly hours away from casting what Robert C. Byrd has appropriately \ndescribed as the most important vote that any of us have cast or are \nlikely to cast in our service as U.S. Senators. For only the second \ntime in our Nation's glorious history, we, who are temporary custodians \nof these 100 seats, will decide whether to take the most extraordinary \nand grave action that could ever be asked of U.S. Senators. A decision \nto declare war or amend our Constitution pales in comparison to trying \nthe impeachment of a popularly elected President of the United States.\n  Unlike the House of Representatives, we did not decide to initiate \nthe impeachment action. We did not seek this burden. It has been thrust \nupon us. Our responsibilities were limited to how to proceed in this \ntrial and what verdict to render.\n  Despite our procedural differences along the way, the Senate has \nfulfilled, in my view, Alexander Hamilton's vision as a ``tribunal \nsignificantly and sufficiently dignified.'' The credit for that result, \nI suggest, belongs primarily to Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, and \nto Trent Lott, the majority leader. Let history record that these two \nleaders, saddled with different challenges, led us with patience, \nfairness, good humor and dignity.\n  I have listened intently to all of you who have spoken on this \nmatter, and I urge all Senators to add the reason for your vote to this \nrecord for, in many respects, it will be our words, our thinking, our \nrationale that will be revisited in the coming millennium, when and if \nthose who succeed us in this Chamber are ever asked to confront the \njudgment that is upon us.\n  The contemporary press will record what decisions we have reached, \nbut the cold, dispassionate eye of history will also scrutinize \ncollectively and individually how we reached our conclusion and what \nimpact this ordeal has had on the Constitution, the Congress, the \ncourts, the Presidency and the maintenance of our tripartite federal \nsystem of government.\n  I agree heartily with those who say we should not decide this matter \non the polls and the popularity of this President, but nor should we \ntotally disregard the voices of those who elected this President or who \nhave sent us here to represent them, including the voices of those who \nvoted against us.\n  It is not entirely insignificant that of the 13 House Republican \nmanagers who have presented their case, seven were unopposed in the \nlast election and three were elected with such significant majorities \nthey were virtually unopposed.\n  I find it disheartening that the passion for conviction of 10 of the \n13 House managers may not have been tempered by the voices of dissent \nwithin their own congressional districts. I sincerely hope that as we \nconsider the facts of this case, the law in this case, and the impact \nof removing this President, we will give equal consideration to the \nimpact on the Office of the Presidency.\n  It is clear from the Federalist papers that the framers wanted a \nstrong, independent and energetic executive, and in the words of \nAlexander Hamilton, free of ``propensity of the legislative department \nto intrude upon the rights and to absorb the powers of other \ndepartments.''\n  As our presiding Chief Justice properly noted in his book ``Grand \nInquests,'' the Constitutional Convention that met in Philadelphia in \n1787 borrowed many of its ideas from existing governments and from \npolitical philosophers, but it did make two original contributions to \nthe art of government. The first was the idea of a Presidential as \nopposed to a parliamentary system of government.\n  In the introduction of his treatise on impeachment, I say to my \ncolleague from New York and repeat his words, the noted constitutional \nscholar, Charles Black, reminds us that the Presidency is a prime \nsymbol of our national unity.\n  The election of the President is the only political act we perform \ntogether as a Nation. Voting in the Presidential election is certainly \nthe political choice most significant to the American people and most \nclosely attended by them. No matter, then, can be of higher political \nimportance than our considering whether, in any given instance, this \nact of choice is to be undone and the chosen President dismissed from \noffice in disgrace.\n  Charles Black adds forebodingly, as Pat Moynihan has already noted, \neveryone--everyone--must shrink from this most drastic of measures. In \nall candor, I say to you, my colleagues, I saw little evidence in the \nHouse majority of shrinking from the drastic measure of impeachment. I \nrevere the Presidency, and I wish all future occupants of the Oval \nOffice to inherit a strong, independent, and energetic office.\n  Now to the specifics of the case.\n  I fear the precedent of this impeachment case will come to haunt us. \nThe scandal has seriously bruised every institution that has come in \ncontact with it, but none has been battered more than the executive \nbranch itself. The culpability for this damage lies first and foremost \nwith President Clinton. His illicit affair with a young woman, a \nsubordinate in the west wing of the White House has properly been \ngreeted with universal condemnation.\n  President Clinton's subsequent and misleading false statements to his \nstaff, his Cabinet, the country, and others is abhorrent. History will \njudge his actions and significant lapses of judgments harshly, as it \nshould. If he is acquitted by this Senate, he will not, as some have \nsuggested, get off scot-free. To stand as the only popularly elected \nPresident to be impeached will relegate him as the Hester Prynne in the \npantheon of our Chief Executives.\n  Do not allow your decision to convict this President to be influenced \nby the false and ludicrous notion that he will emerge from this \nnational nightmare unscathed if you vote to acquit.\n  President Ford is often quoted as having said the grounds for \nimpeachment are whatever the House of Representatives say they are by a \nmajority vote. I do not take issue with that statement, except that it \nstrikes me as somewhat cavalier. In the Senate, the grounds for \nconviction and removal of a President must not be so loosely fashioned. \nThe grounds for conviction must be restricted to the articles of \nimpeachment as passed by the House.\n  I am dismayed by the argument of some that conviction can be based on \nreasons totally beyond the scope of the articles of impeachment. \nWhether we like it or not, we have a constitutional duty to confine our \njudgment to the specific accusations. The standard of proof that we use \nto arrive at our decision is probably up to each Senator, but we do not \nhave a similar luxury to decide what grounds we may use to convict. \nThose grounds are set by the House and must be proven by very narrow \nmargins on nearly party-line votes.\n  The House Republican managers have presented us with two articles of \nimpeachment accusing the President of perjury and obstruction of \njustice. The House managers have very specifically charged the \nPresident with violation of the Criminal Code, insisting that the facts \nprove each and every element of the criminal charges.\n  While it is certainly true that no person, including the President, \nis above the law, it is equally true that no President is below the law \neither. By insisting that this President is in violation of specific \ncrimes in the Criminal Code, have not the House managers, to some \ndegree, deprived the Members of this Senate of the individual judgment \nwhen exercising a standard of proof?\n  The standard of proof in all criminal cases is beyond a reasonable \ndoubt. If\n\n[[Page S1594]]\n\nthose who vote to convict on either count use a lesser standard than \nwould be used in any case of any other citizen, then a vote to take the \ndrastic measure of conviction and removal of a President from office \nwould be based on equal standard of justice.\n  I find it unsettling while the House Republican managers were \npassionately asking the Senate to convict this President of criminal \ncharges, two of its most active managers were simultaneously expressing \ntheir own reservations.\n  First, House Manager Lindsey Graham candidly told this Senate, in \nresponse to a question, that reasonable people could reasonably \nconclude to acquit this President. It appeared to me that Manager \nGraham was less than convinced this President was guilty beyond a \nreasonable doubt.\n  Secondly, House Manager Asa Hutchinson, in a moment of candor on a \nnational TV news program conceded he would not try a case such as this \none. He now asks us to reach the judgment of conviction beyond a \nreasonable doubt.\n  Does it not also strike you as somewhat strange that when given the \nopportunity to call any of three or four witnesses, the House managers \nchose not to invite Betty Currie to testify? Other than the President \nand Monica Lewinsky, no other person was as involved in the allegations \nbrought by the House managers, and yet they made the calculated \ndecision not to take her deposition.\n  For these reasons and the careful detailed distinction drawn between \nthe inferences made by the House managers and the direct testimony of \ndeposed witnesses, as outlined by our colleague, Carl Levin, I cannot \nconclude beyond all reasonable doubt that the President is guilty of \nthe criminal charges enumerated in either article of impeachment. Thus, \nnot only do I shrink from this most drastic of measures, I positively \naffirm we must not remove this President from office.\n  Some final thoughts. The criminalization of our political process \nmust stop before irreparable damage is done to the institutions of our \nfederal system. It is right to condemn in harsh words the behavior of \nthis President. It should be equally appropriate to condemn the damage \ndone by an independent counsel statute that has spawned runaway, \nreckless prosecutors that storm the country trampling on our system of \njustice, completely unchecked by any branch of Government.\n  The damage this President has caused his office can and will be \nrepaired. The damage of the Office of Independent Counsel and court \ndecisions that allow unlimited discovery in civil lawsuits may be far \nmore difficult to repair. That fragile balance between our three \ncoequal branches of Government is being subjected, I would suggest, to \nunprecedented strains as a result of the events that have occurred over \nthese past several years.\n  I would urge our two leaders to include an examination of these \nissues as part of the agenda in the 106th Congress.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. On January 7, 1999, the House of Representatives \npresented the Senate with two articles of impeachment against President \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton. The articles charged the President with \nlying under oath before a federal grand jury and with obstruction of \njustice. In the days following the House's presentation of the \narticles, many have criticized the Senate for continuing on where the \nHouse left off. They argue that if there are not enough votes in the \nSenate to remove the President, then the Senate should not have \nbothered proceeding with the trial. While this may seem like a \nreasonable way of disposing of an unpopular process, the Senate has a \nConstitutional duty to hold an impeachment trial. Although the \nConstitution provides little guidance, one thing was clear: In order to \nfulfill this duty, we had to come together as a body and proceed in a \nmanner that was judicious, deliberative and fair. That meant that \nbefore the Senate could make any decision on the articles of \nimpeachment, each side had to be given the opportunity to present its \ncase.\n  Now that we have heard from the House Managers, the President's \ncounsel and viewed the deposition testimony of three key witnesses, it \nis the appropriate time to render judgment on the articles of \nimpeachment. I must state at the outset that this has been one of the \nmost difficult experiences that I have endured in my 23 years in \nCongress.\n     A. A Loss of Respect.\n  This process has been distressing on a personal level because I came \ninto it with a great deal of respect and admiration for President \nClinton. Over the past six years, we have enjoyed a good working \nrelationship. While we do not share the same party and we often \napproach issues from different points of view, the President and I have \nworked together on a number of important projects. Given my esteem for \nthe President, I have been saddened and gravely disappointed by much of \nwhat I have learned over the last few weeks. Whatever the final \noutcome, I will leave this trial with the knowledge that the President \nhas indeed committed shameful acts, misled the American people and \nbrought disrepute on the office of Presidency. By his own actions, he \nhas ensured himself a place in history alongside President Andrew \nJohnson.\n     B. Setting An Important Precedent.\n  This process has been trying on a professional level because I \nrecognize the enormous historical significance of my decisions. This \ntrial will establish precedents to examine and judge the conduct of all \nfuture Presidents. While our founding fathers clearly intended \nimpeachment for only the greatest offenses, confronted with a series of \ntawdry acts, the facts and circumstances do not neatly fit into the \ndefinition of ``other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' I am gravely \nconcerned that a vote to convict the President on these articles may \nestablish a low threshold that would make every President subject to \nremoval for the slightest indiscretion or imperil every President who \nfaces a Congress controlled by the opposing party. Yet, at the same \ntime, I am concerned that a vote of acquittal could be mistaken by \nfuture generations to mean that perjury and obstruction of justice are \nnot impeachable offenses.\n\n\n    II. Have the House Managers Proven the Articles of Impeachment?\n\n     A. The Standard of Proof: Clear and Convincing Evidence\n  The Constitution provides very little guidance to the Senate for its \ntrying of the impeachment of the President. There is absolutely no \nreference at all to the standard of proof that senators shall use when \nevaluating the Articles of Impeachment. I believe the fact that the \nFramers gave this body the duty to try an impeachment, but no guidance \nas to what standard of proof to use in the trial, gives each senator \nthe discretion to select the standard he or she deems appropriate.\n  In making my decision, I have focused on the nature of the \nproceeding; The impeachment trial is a unique process, it is neither \ncriminal nor civil. I also focused on the purpose of the proceeding; \nThe Senate holds an impeachment trial to determine whether there is \nproof that the President's misconduct rises to the level which \ndemonstrates that he or she is no longer fit to hold office.\n  Given the nature and purpose of an impeachment trial, I have decided \nthat the ``preponderance of the evidence'' standard would not be \nappropriate as being too low a standard. On the other hand, I believe \nthat ``proof beyond a reasonable doubt'' would raise too high a \nstandard. The question we must ask ourselves is: Do the President's \nactions demonstrate that he is unfit to serve, thus warranting his \nremoval in order to protect the public? Since we are concerned with the \npublic's protection I would suggest that the clear and convincing \nstandard, which lies somewhere in between, would be more appropriate to \nmake the very fateful decision of removing the President from office.\n  Accordingly, I have used the clear and convincing evidence standard \nto judge the impeachment charges against President Clinton. I \nunderstand that this standard is little used, however, I feel that in \nimpeachment trials it is most appropriate to use a standard that is \nsomewhere in between the extremes.\n     B. Article I: Perjury Before the Grand Jury.\n  Article I alleges that the President provided perjurious false and \nmisleading testimony before the federal grand jury. The House Managers \napplied the federal perjury statute found at 18\n\n[[Page S1595]]\n\nU.S.C. Sec.  1623 to the President's testimony. The elements of perjury \nare met when: (1) while under oath (2) one knowingly (3) makes a false \nstatement as to (4) material facts. While I agree that some of the \nPresident's statements before the federal grand jury were false and \nmisleading, I have concluded that some of the allegations simply do not \nrise to the level of perjury and that the House Managers have not \nproven the remaining perjury charges by clear and convincing evidence.\n  The first allegation is that the President committed perjury before \nthe grand jury when he testified about the nature of his relationship \nwith Monica Lewinsky. In his testimony before the grand jury, the \nPresident admitted that his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was ongoing \nand that it involved inappropriate intimate contact. Based on the House \nManagers' presentation, there is no doubt in my mind that the \nPresident's prepared statement to the grand jury was inaccurate in \npart. While I disagree with the House Managers' conclusion that the \nPresident's use of the terms ``on certain occasions'' and \n``occasional'' were intentionally misleading, I agree with the House \nManagers that the President lied about when and how his relationship \nwith Ms. Lewinsky began. However, given that the President admitted to \nthe key issue before the grand jury, I am not persuaded that lies about \nthese immaterial details justify a charge of perjury. I also reject the \nrelated allegations pertaining to the President's testimony regarding \nthe definition of sexual relations used in the Jones case.\n  The second allegation of this Article is that the President committed \nperjury in his grand jury testimony by repeating the perjurious answers \nhe had given in his civil deposition. The House Managers have certainly \nproven that the President lied about a number of issues in his civil \ndeposition. However, Article I concerns the President's grand jury \ntestimony, not his deposition testimony and the House Managers seem to \nrely upon the President's reaffirmation of his deposition testimony as \nproof that he committed perjury. Since I do not find that the President \nreaffirmed his deposition testimony before the grand jury, I reject \nthis allegation of perjury.\n  The third allegation is essentially that the President committed \nperjury when he testified before the grand jury that he was not paying \nattention to Mr. Bennett's misstatement that the Lewinsky affidavit \nmeant that ``there was no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or \nform.'' Although the video tape of the President's civil deposition \ndoes show the President staring in Mr. Bennett's direction, we cannot \nknow what the President was actually thinking at that time. We have all \nhad moments where we appear to be paying attention to a speaker, when \nwe are actually lost in our own thoughts. Because the House Managers \ncould not possibly prove whether or not the President was actually \npaying attention to the exchange, they have not met the burden of \nproving that the President's testimony was false.\n  The final allegation in Article I is that the President testified \nfalsely about his attempts to obstruct justice in the Jones case. I \nreject this perjury allegation outright because I believe it was \nimproper for the House Managers to include a restatement of the \nobstruction of justice allegations within Article I. I have considered \nthe obstruction of justice allegations in Article II.\n     C. Article II: Obstruction of Justice\n  The second article of impeachment charges the President with \nobstruction of justice. Article II charges that the President \nprevented, obstructed and impeded the administration of justice, both \npersonally and through his subordinates and agents, in a Federal civil \nrights action. To prove a case of obstruction of justice under the \nFederal statute found at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1503, the House Managers must \nprove that the President acted with intent and that he ``endeavored to \ninfluence, obstruct or impede the due administration of justice.'' \nAfter considering these allegations, I have concluded that the House \nManagers failed to prove all but one of the obstruction of justice \ncharges. My basis for this conclusion is the following:\n  The first allegation in Article II is that the President obstructed \njustice by having his friend Vernon Jordan assist Ms. Lewinsky in her \nNew York job search in exchange for her silence in the Jones case. To \nprove this allegation, the House Managers presented compelling \ncircumstantial evidence that Mr. Jordan assisted Ms. Lewinsky with both \nher job search and with her affidavit. The House Managers also pointed \nto the fact that Ms. Lewinsky received her job offer just two days \nafter she signed a false affidavit. However, there are also \ncircumstantial facts that belie the ``quid pro quo'' claim. First, \nthere is evidence that the President enlisted Mr. Jordan's help well \nbefore Ms. Lewinsky's name appeared on the Jones witness list. Second, \nMr. Jordan testified in his Senate deposition that he had ``stepped \nup'' the job search before he learned that Ms. Lewinsky was involved. \nOn a final note, a conspiracy takes two willing actors. I would have a \nhard time convicting the President of this charge when both Mr. Jordan \nand Ms. Lewinsky have denied that there was any connection between the \njob search and the false affidavit.\n  Another allegation is that the President obstructed justice by \nencouraging Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the Jones case. \nThe House Managers have shown that when the President informed Ms. \nLewinsky that her name had appeared on the Jones witness list, he \nsuggested that she might file an affidavit to avoid being deposed. To \nfind that the President obstructed justice, however, I must infer from \nthe evidence that the President was encouraging Ms. Lewinsky to file a \nfalse affidavit. I cannot make this leap when Ms. Lewinsky herself \ntestified that President Clinton made no connection between their false \ncover stories and the contents of the affidavit. Indeed, Ms. Lewinsky \ntestified repeatedly that the President never discussed the contents of \nthe affidavit with her and that, at the time of their conversation, she \ndid not think that the affidavit necessarily had to be false.\n  Article II also alleges that the President obstructed justice by \nencouraging Ms. Lewinsky to hide his gifts. The thrust of the House \nManagers claim is that the President instructed Ms. Currie to pick up \nthe gifts from Monica Lewinsky on December 28, 1997, so that Ms. \nLewinsky would not have to turn the gifts over to Paula Jones' \nattorneys. I would agree that the circumstances of the President's \nsecretary, Ms. Currie picking up the gifts several hours after Ms. \nLewinsky suggested to the President that Ms. Currie might hold onto \nthem for safekeeping are certainly suspect. If the House Managers could \nprove that Ms. Currie initiated the gift pickup there would be clear \nand convincing evidence that the President was in fact encouraging Ms. \nLewinsky to hide the gifts. Because there is conflicting evidence on \nthis critical issue, the House Managers did not meet their burden.\n\n  In addition, Article II alleges that the President obstructed justice \nby making false and misleading statement to his aides about Ms. \nLewinsky. Given that the President had an ongoing relationship with Ms. \nLewinsky, it was spurious, mean spirited, defamatory and morally wrong \nfor the President to refer to Ms. Lewinsky as a stalker or to in any \nway impugn her reputation. The House Managers and all of us have every \nreason to be incensed by the President's actions. That being said, it \nis clear that the President made these remarks in his continuing effort \nto conceal the true nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. There \nis no evidence that the President knew that these aides would be called \nto testify. Therefore, I believe that this allegation has no merit.\n  While I found the other charges alleged in Article II to be either \nlegally or factually deficient, there is one allegation of obstruction \nof justice which I believe that the House Managers have proven by clear \nand convincing evidence; the President's post-deposition statements to \nBettie Currie. Ms. Currie testified that on two occasions in the days \nfollowing the President's deposition in the Jones case, the President \ncalled her into his office and made a series of remarks to her ``You \nwere always there when she was there, right? We were never alone. You \ncould see and hear everything. Monica came on to me and I never touched \nher, right? She wanted to have sex with me and I couldn't do that.''\n\n[[Page S1596]]\n\n  I simply do not believe the President's explanation that he was \nquestioning Ms. Currie in an ``effort get as much information as \nquickly as I could'' or that he was ``trying to ascertain what the \nfacts were'' or ``what Ms. Currie's perception was.'' I am also not \npersuaded by the fact that Ms. Currie testified that she did not feel \npressured to agree with the President. Rather, I agree with the House \nManagers that if the President was actually seeking information he \nwould not have been asking rhetorical questions. I also believe that \nthe President's explanation would be more plausible if his statements \nto Ms. Currie were not false.\n  The fact is that the President gave false testimony in the Jones \ndeposition, that during his deposition he repeatedly referred to Ms. \nCurrie as someone who could back up his testimony and that immediately \nfollowing the deposition he summoned Ms. Currie into work on a Sunday \nand cleverly spoon-fed his cover stories to her. Despite the \nPresident's counsel's protestation, there was still a possibility that \nMs. Currie could be called to testify in the Jones case. Accordingly, I \nbelieve that when the President called Ms. Currie to his office and \nrepeatedly recounted these false statements he ``endeavored to \ninfluence, obstruct or impede the due administration of justice'' in \nviolation of the federal obstruction statute.\n\n\n   III. Has President Clinton Committed a High Crime Warranting His \n                          Removal from Office?\n\n     A. To Decide Whether the President's Actions are a High \n         Crime, We Must Look at the Underlying Circumstances.\n  The House Managers has left us with the impression that once we \nconclude that the President has committed either perjury or obstruction \nof justice, we have a Constitutional duty to vote to remove the \nPresident from office. They maintain that perjury and obstruction of \njustice must be considered high crimes per se because they carry the \nsame penalties as bribery. I reject this premise. In fact, the severity \nof a bribery sentence is dependent on subject matter and the amount of \nthe bribe. Similarly, a conclusion that the President committed \nobstruction of justice should not automatically warrant his removal. It \nis incumbent upon each of us to examine the underlying facts and \ncircumstances to determine whether or not the President has committed a \nhigh crime.\n     B. Background: How Did We Get Here Anyway?\n  Now, having found that the President is guilty of obstructing justice \nin the Paula Jones case, I had to determine whether the violation is a \n``high crime'' warranting removal from office. This led me to think \nabout what justice was actually being obstructed and to consider the \nunderlying circumstances that brought us here today.\n  In the narrow legal sense, this entire impeachment trial rests on the \nIndependent Counsel statute and the Paula Jones case.\n  As many of my colleagues remember, Congress enacted the Independent \nCounsel statute in the wake of the Watergate scandal, after President \nNixon ordered the dismissal of special Watergate prosecutor Archibald \nCox over his refusal to drop a subpoena for Nixon's incriminating White \nHouse tapes. Congress designed the Independent Counsel statute to \ninsulate and protect investigations of alleged criminal conduct by the \nPresident and other high-level federal officials. Unfortunately, the \nstatute has not worked as Congress envisioned it would. This well \nintended statute has resulted in a proliferation of interminable, \nexpensive investigations against public officials. It has cost our \ntaxpayers more than $130 million and considering all the time, effort \nand expense, there have been very few successful prosecutions resulting \nfrom the statute.\n  One such investigation under the statute originated in August 1994, \nwhen Judge Kenneth Starr was appointed as an Independent Counsel to \ninvestigate alleged wrongful acts in the so-called Whitewater land \ndeal. During the course of the next four years, the Office of \nIndependent Counsel (``OIC'') expanded its investigation of President \nClinton a number of times. At the same time, the President was \ndefending a civil rights action by Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state \nemployee who alleged that President Clinton sexually harassed her \nduring the time he served as Governor. Last January, the OIC was able \nto expand its investigation and redirect its D.C. based Whitewater \nGrand Jury panel to investigate the President's concealment of his \nextramarital affair with White House employee Monica Lewinsky.\n  We must not forget that the reason that the President's relationship \nwith Ms. Lewinsky was even an issue in the Jones suit was because Paula \nJones was trying to show that the President's treatment of Ms. Jones \nwas part of a pattern and practice of sexual harassment. Judge Wright \ninitially ruled that Paula Jones was entitled to information on the so-\ncalled Jane Does, because that evidence might help establish the \nPresident's pattern of sexually harassing conduct. However, Judge \nWright ultimately ruled that evidence about the President's harassment \nof other women would not change her decision to dismiss the case \nbecause Paula Jones failed to establish that she, herself was harassed. \nI quote from the Judge's April 1, 1998 decision:\n\n       One final matter concerns alleged suppression of pattern \n     and practice evidence. Whatever relevance such evidence may \n     have to prove other elements of plaintiff's case, it does not \n     have anything to do with the issues presented by the \n     President's motion for summary judgment, i.e., whether \n     plaintiff herself was the victim of alleged quid pro quo or \n     hostile work environment sexual harassment. . . . Whether \n     other woman may have been subjected to workplace harassment, \n     and whether such evidence has allegedly been suppressed, does \n     not change the fact that plaintiff has failed to demonstrate \n     that she has a case worthy of submitting to a jury. [emphasis \n     added]\n\n  Why is this ruling so important in my decision? Well, we are \nessentially here today because the Whitewater investigation was \nexpanded to determine whether President Clinton's efforts to conceal \nhis consensual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky obstructed Paula Jones' \nright to justice. The plain fact is that the Jones case was thrown out \nbecause Judge Wright ruled that Paula Jones had no case and that even \nif the President had revealed the true nature of his consensual \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky, it would not have changed the outcome \nof Paula Jones case. While President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky \nwas morally wrong, there is absolutely no evidence that the President \nwas sexually harassing Ms. Lewinsky.\n  Although I have concluded that the President obstructed justice by \ntrying to influence the testimony of Bettie Currie, the fact is that \nthe President's actions did not actually hinder Paula Jones. Indeed, in \nthe midst of the OIC investigation, Paula Jones appealed Judge Wright's \nruling and the President agreed to pay her $850,000 in an out-of-court \nsettlement. Some might even argue that as a perverse result of the \nPresident's obstruction of justice, Paula Jones ended up with greater \nmonetary relief than she would have otherwise received. Therefore, \nwhile the articles of impeachment came about as a direct result of \nPresident Clinton's actions in the Jones case, it is clear that in the \nend, the President's actions did not negatively effect Paula Jones' \njustice. In other words, there was no justice to obstruct in the Jones \ncase.\n     C. Is the President Fit to Serve?\n  Most of us now believe that the President lied about his relationship \nwith Ms. Lewinsky when he testified under oath and that he also lied \nabout the nature of his relationship to his staff, his family and the \nAmerican people. I have concluded that the President not only lied \nabout the affair but that he took at least one illegal action in an \nattempt conceal the truth from Paula Jones. However, I believe that \nPresident Clinton took these steps to avoid deep personal \nembarrassment, not to seize, maintain or subvert the power of the \nstate.\n  Let us not forget that the ultimate question we must each answer is \nwhether on these facts arising out of these circumstances this \nPresident poses such a danger to the state that we can no longer permit \nhim to remain in office. The ultimate issue here is a determination of \nwhether the President is fit to serve.\n  Consider our constitutional guidance: The President of the United \nStates ``shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and \nConviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors.'' The Framers intentionally set this standard at an \nextremely high level to ensure that only\n\n[[Page S1597]]\n\nthe most serious offenses would justify overturning a popular election. \nThe concept of ``maladministration'' was considered and rejected.\n  I believe that whether the President's misconduct occurred in the \nprivate sphere or in his public or official capacity is also an \nimportant distinction to make when deciding his fitness to serve. \nClearly, there are those private acts which in no way reflect on a \npresident's fitness for office. On the other hand, there are public or \nofficial acts which I think no reasonable person would doubt reflect \npoorly on a president's fitness for office and would warrant \nimpeachment and removal. I think we can all see the difference in \ngravity between the offenses of which President Clinton stands accused \nand a hypothetical accusation that he took a bribe. While the former \nreflects poorly on his character and discretion, the latter reflects on \nhis fitness to serve and describes a classic case of abuse of office.\n  For the President to do what he did was reprehensible and morally \nwrong. I believe that the President lied to avoid embarrassment. \nHowever, the Framers did not envision such behavior as being \nencompassed by the phrase ``other high crimes and misdemeanors.''\n  The bottom line is that old maxim that bad facts lead to bad law. \nSuch a low threshold for removal of a president from office would be \ndangerous. After careful consideration, I have concluded that President \nClinton has not committed an offense that indicates the President is \nnot fit to serve. Therefore, I will not vote to convict President \nClinton.\n     D. Time to Move On.\n  I do not want the President to come away from this trial thinking \nthat he is forgiven, or that what he has done is not serious, because I \nthink it was most serious. I do not want the people of this nation to \nthink that a vote of acquittal means that the President's conduct is \nacceptable because it is not acceptable. Lying and obstruction are \nwrong. I also hope that my vote does not lend any credence to the \nnotion that sexual harassment is not that important, because it is \nimportant. A determination to let the President serve out his term \nshould not be taken as an exoneration of his actions. At the same time, \nI think it is extremely important that we leave this chapter behind us \nand move on to the nations' business.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. Chief Justice, I want to explain my views publicly \non the impeachment articles sent to us by a partisan vote of the House \nof Representatives, and on the removal of the President from office \nwhich they would prompt.\n  First, I am shocked and saddened that our Republican colleagues \npersistently have blocked our efforts to have open and public debates \nand discussion in our deliberations in this matter, and most especially \nin our deliberations on the final votes on whether to remove the \nPresident. Whatever their motives, this is not what a free, \nrepresentative, accountable democracy is all about. Simply publishing \npartial transcripts of our proceedings, which include only some formal \nstatements made by senators and not the deliberations themselves--and \ndoing so only at the end of the trial--is, in my view, a great leap \nsideways.\n  I also want to describe what I think--and frankly have thought for \nmonths--is a more appropriate mechanism to express our disapproval of \nthe President's behavior: a tough, bipartisan censure resolution which \nmakes clear our contempt for what he's done in lying to his family, his \nfriends, his staff, and the American people about his relationship with \nMonica Lewinsky; and the disgrace which those lies have placed upon his \nPresidency for all time.\n  In recent months, hundreds of Constitutional scholars--including many \nrespected conservatives--have argued that, in their view, the \nConstitution does allow this censure vote; the Senate's precedents \nallow it; we have done it before. It's true that the Constitution is \nsilent on the question of what else we can do in addition to removal; \nit is also true that the Constitution in no way prevents us from moving \nforward on censure. The argument that we are somehow blocked \nConstitutionally from censuring the President is contrived, and fraught \nwith partisan pleading.\n  Even so, if we are ultimately blocked by a filibuster from a vote on \ncensure, the President will not have escaped the judgment of Congress \nor the American people. Any Senator, in any venue they choose, can \noffer their own forceful, public censure of the President, repeatedly \nif they like. I certainly have. A corporate expression of the Senate's \ncondemnation of the President's actions, while of course preferable, is \nnot essential, for all of us already have made known our views.\n  We all condemn the President's behavior. It has been said so many \ntimes, it hardly bears repeating, were it not for the wilful, partisan \nattempts to mischaracterize a vote against removal as a vote to condone \nwhat the President has done. That is, of course, preposterous; the \nPresident has been impeached by the House. That has only happened once \nbefore in our history. The trial has gone forward, and every member of \nthis body has condemned the President's behavior as unacceptable, \nmeriting only scorn and rebuke.\n  It is clear that the President already has paid a terrible price in \nthe eyes of history, not least in the shame and humiliation that this \npermanent mark on his presidency has caused him, his family, his \nfriends and supporters, and his Administration. The message is clear, \nincluding to our young people: When one fails to tell the truth, there \nare real, sometimes even awful consequences and costs. The President's \nbehavior was shameful, despicable, unworthy, a disgrace to his office. \nAnd in this long, sordid, painful process, I believe he has been held \naccountable for what he has done.\n  Pursued overzealously by Kenneth Starr and by House Judiciary \nCommittee Republicans, the articles were then approved by the full \nHouse in a grossly unfair and partisan proceeding that was destructive \nboth of our polity and our politics. All of us should be deeply \ntroubled by it, and all should work together to put it behind us. In my \nview, these allegations should never have reached the Senate. But they \nhave, and the trial has now been held. It has changed few, if any, \nminds on the basic facts, on how the law should be applied to those \nfacts, or on the high bar for removal set by the Constitution.\n  Finally we bring to a close this long, sad year of investigations, \nhearings, and speeches. It has been a painful year. In many ways, it \nhas been a lost year. Think of what we might have done this past year, \nhad we not done this. Think of the news we could have made, had not all \nseen this. Think of the good laws that we could have written, had not \nthis stood in the way. Think of the opportunities lost, the hopes \nstaved off. We must ask with Langston Hughes, ``What happens to a dream \ndeferred?''\n  Sadly, so many opportunities for better, more prudent and \nproportionate judgment fell by the wayside. First, and most important, \nthe President should have avoided this sorry relationship. Then, a \nlittle over a year ago, the President could have been more forthcoming \nand told the whole truth, instead of misleading us all. The American \npeople could have handled it. Then, the Independent Counsel could have \nshown greater discretion in judging whether to bring this case forward. \nThe leadership of the House of Representatives could have allowed a \nvote on censuring the President, instead of pushing the case forward to \nimpeachment. They were wrong to thwart the will of what I expect would \nhave been a House majority in so doing. And the Senate could have voted \nto dismiss the case and promptly and resolutely censured the President.\n  Instead, against better judgment, against all indications of the \npeople's will, and against any shred of charity, an ardent and zealous \nminority pressed on. They had the right. They had the power. But they \nwere wrong, and I believe history will so judge them. It is a supreme \nirony that the most conservative forces in our politics today have for \nmonths wielded the most radical option made available in the \nConstitution against this President: impeachment and removal. Aware of \nits dangers, our founders designed Constitutional protections against \nits abuse. This process has shown that those protections are not \nperfect; they require reasoned judgment in their application; judgment \nthat has been missing in this process from day one.\n  Let us resolve to learn the lessons of this long, sad year. Let us \nlearn now,\n\n[[Page S1598]]\n\nhaving come this far, the wisdom of the founders that impeachment is \nand must be a high barricade, not to be mounted lightly. Let us learn \nthat because it requires the overwhelming support of the Senate to \nsucceed, it cannot and should not proceed on a merely partisan basis. \nLet us learn that the desire to impeach and remove must be shared \nbroadly, or it is illegitimate.\n  Let us learn that the subject matter of impeachment must be a matter \nof great gravity, calling into question the President's very ability to \nlead, and endangering the nation's liberty, freedom, security. Let us \nlearn that the case against the President must be a strong and \nunambiguous one in fact and in law, for even a President deserves the \nbenefit of our reasonable doubts.\n  The charges brought against President Clinton do not rise to those \nlevels. And even if they did, the case against him is neither strong \nnor unambiguous. As the White House defense team has made clear, there \nare ample grounds for doubt about both the facts and law surrounding \neach of the two articles before us.\n  It is true that the impeachment process has further alienated \nmillions of Americans from their government, and that is a tragic harm \nfor which the President bears considerable responsibility. It is also \ntrue, as we were told by Chairman Hyde yesterday, that the nobility and \nfragility of a self-governing people requires hard work, every day, to \nget it right, to fight the good fight, to discern the common good. But \nI believe, unlike him, that it is the impeachment process itself, both \nhere and in the other body--its partisanship, its meanness and \nunfairness, its leadership by those who want to win too badly--which \nhas increased people's cynicism; not the prospect of the President's \n``getting away'' with something.\n  Our nation was founded on the Jeffersonian principle, ``that \ngovernment is the strongest of which every man feels himself a part.'' \nWhat Jefferson and the other Founders feared was the warning of their \ncounterpart Rousseau: ``As soon as any man says of the affairs of State \n`What does it matter to me?' the state may be given up as lost.'' But \nwhile the many signs of disaffection among our people are growing, I do \nnot think we have reached the point of no return; there is time in this \nCongress to recover from this episode, and to move on.\n\n  Despite the claims of pundits that Americans have simply tuned out, I \nthink a deeper reality is present in their reactions, and in the polls. \nIn fact, most Americans, in their wisdom, have reached a subtle, \nsophisticated judgment in this case, and have already moved beyond it. \nAs is so often the case, they're way ahead of Washington. It is true \nthat they abhor the President's behavior, but don't believe it merits \nhis removal. In addition, they believe that there are larger issues \nfacing the nation than the misdeeds that nearly all now concede the \nPresident committed: peace in the Middle East; the hunger of children; \nthe health of Americans; saving our social security safety net; \ndebating whether hundreds of billions of dollars of surplus should go \nto bolster Medicare, or to some combination of universal savings \naccounts or tax cuts. These are the things that the people sent us here \nto work on. These are the things that I hear about when I return to my \nstate.\n  So let us now bring to a close, with our votes, this long, sad year \nof investigation and impeachment. And let us resolve that there shall \nbe many a year before we have another one like it. It is time for our \ncountry to pull together to seek an end to the fractious partisanship \nthat has defined this period, and to re-engage a full-throated, genuine \ndebate about our nation's future that can help us find again that \ncommon ground that unites us as Americans, and that can serve as a firm \nfoundation for resolving the many serious problems that still face our \ncountry--impeachment or not--today and tomorrow.\n  We should, as White House attorney Charles Ruff said, listen to the \nvoices not merely of the advocates who have been before us, but of \nMadison, Hamilton, and the others who met in Philadelphia 212 years \nago; of the generations of Americans since then; of the American people \nnow, and of future generations of Americans. And if we do, we will do \nthe right thing.\n  Congressman John Lewis observed in his final impeachment speech, in \nthe end, we are ``one house, one family, one people; the American \nhouse, the American family, the American people.'' We are called \ntogether to come to judgment on this President, and then to return \npromptly to the pressing issues that lay before us, and that require \nour urgent attention. That judgment is by now clear: Bill Clinton \nshould remain President; the censure of this body, and the historic \nimpeachment that will ever attach to his name, will leave a permanent \nmark on his presidency.\n  I thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, for the fine work that you have done, \nand I thank both the majority leader and the minority leader for their \nleadership. I said to Senator Lott, I think yesterday, I am still \nfurious that we are in closed session and will say that, but I \nappreciate the way in which you have kept us together. I thank the two \nof you.\n  I was thinking I might do something a little different, because even \nif I were to give a great speech to the best of my ability, I don't \nknow that there are any more arguments that can be made. I was thinking \nlike, I might agree--actually I have a printed statement--I might agree \nto just have my statement included in the Record and not speak any \nfurther, if I can get some support for some legislation. (Laughter.)\n  Just on some children's legislation. Does it look like we are at that \npoint? It does? Well, I like that show of support, and I think, Mr. \nChief Justice, what I will do is give to you in a moment a full \nstatement and just simply say to everybody here about three things in 2 \nminutes.\n  One, I wish we had done this in open session, and I cover that more \nin my full statement.\n  Second of all, I think that a decision to acquit is certainly not a \ndecision to condone the President's behavior which I think merits scorn \nand rebuke.\n  Third of all, I think that the standard, and I want to say this to \nSenator Domenici, talking about children, to me the standard is guilty \nbeyond a reasonable doubt. I think the evidence has to be unambiguous \nand strong. I don't think it was. Senator Levin said that very well, so \nI don't need to repeat any of those arguments.\n  Fourth of all, Tim Hutchinson, Senator Hutchinson, I like what you \nsaid about the polls. I actually make a different argument. I raised \nthe question earlier when we were raising questions about popular will \nand does it matter. I actually meant about the last election, it seems \nto me if it ever does, it is on such a decision. I think before you \noverturn an election, you really have to meet a very high threshold. I \ndon't think the House managers have done so.\n  Finally, I think a lesson that I have learned as a political \nscientist, when I teach class again, is I do not think the articles \nwork and this process works when it is clearly not bipartisan. I think \nit becomes illegitimate. It just doesn't work.\n  You did not have broad support coming from the House, and you do not \nhave it here. That is why I think it was doomed from the start.\n  Finally, it has been a long, sad year, and I wish--I just wish--that \nthose who could have really rendered decisions with judgment had done \nso, starting with the President and his sorry affair. He could have \ntold the truth to the people in the country. The people would have \nappreciated that. I could also talk about Starr, and I could also talk \nabout the House, and I could also talk about us. But I do not think I \nneed to do so.\n  Let's get on with the work of democracy. We have had some strong \nviews here, but I am looking forward to working with you.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank our majority leader. Throughout this ordeal, no \none has tried to poll me on any substantive matter or influence my \nvote. That, to me, means a great deal. I view this process as the most \nserious task I have faced as a Senator over the past 30 years, and I \nappreciate the recognition by the leadership of the solemnity of our \nduties under these circumstances and the fact that we each must reach \nour own conclusions based on the evidence.\n  As Senators, each of us joined in this oath:\n\n       I . . . do solemnly swear that I will support and defend \n     the constitution of the United\n\n[[Page S1599]]\n\n     States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will \n     bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this \n     obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose \n     of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge my \n     duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me \n     God.\n\nAnd now, we took an additional oath:\n\n       [I] solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the \n     trial of the impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, \n     President of the United States, now pending, [I] will do \n     impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws, so \n     help [me] God.\n\n  As free citizens of the world's most successful democracy we are \ninexorably tied to the pledges and commitments we make. These \nobligations, and the unlimited benefits they bestow on us, depend on \nour willingness to be truthful with one another. The President took the \ntwo most serious oaths any American ever encounters: the oath to \nfaithfully execute our laws, administered by the Chief Justice, our \nPresiding Officer, on the steps of this building, and the oath to tell \nthe truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth to a jury of his \npeers.\n  I am most concerned that the action we take here to day not denigrate \nthe role of oaths and truth in our society. To be fair to the \nPresident, I feel he believed that he admitted to the Grand Jury that \nhe had not testified truthfully under oath in his deposition. In fact \nhe did not, and he did not tell the truth to the grand jury either.\n  Both the House Managers and the President's lawyers have seized on \napparent conflicts in the evidence and recorded testimony before this \nCourt of Impeachment. Nonetheless, the evidentiary record and the \npresentations of both sides, as supplemented by their responses to our \nquestions, leave no doubt in my mind that if I were sitting as a juror \nin a criminal case I would find that the accused is guilty of perjury \nas charged in Article I. Following the jury's verdict, it would then \nfall to the judge to determine appropriate punishment within the bounds \nof the federal sentencing guidelines provided by Congress.\n  But an impeachment trial is no ordinary proceeding. We sit as judge \nand jury--rulers on law and triers of fact. The Constitution charges us \nwith a great responsibility. Section 4 of Article II of the \nConstitution requires that the President be removed from office upon \nconviction of high crimes and misdemeanors. No President has ever been \nremoved under these circumstances. To me, that history alone should \nmake each of us seriously consider whether the facts presented to us \nrequire that the Senate exercise this awesome power.\n  The process by which our Founding Fathers determined that this power \nshould be vested in the Congress is adequately briefed in the record. I \nfound particularly helpful the testimony and scholarly papers from the \nhearings before the House Judiciary Committee on November 9, 1998.\n  Remember in the House committee deliberations, the minority submitted \na joint resolution of censure for consideration in lieu of the Articles \nfinally voted upon. It restated:\n\n       Expressing the sense of Congress with respect to the \n     censure of William Jefferson Clinton. Resolved by the Senate \n     and House of Representatives of the United States of America \n     in Congress assembled, That it is the sense of Congress \n     that--\n       (1) on January 20, 1993, William Jefferson Clinton took the \n     oath prescribed by the Constitution of the United States \n     faithfully to execute the office of President; implicit in \n     that oath is the obligation that the President set an example \n     of high moral standards and conduct himself in a manner that \n     fosters respect for the truth; and William Jefferson Clinton, \n     has egregiously failed in this obligation, and through his \n     actions violated the trust of the American people, lessened \n     their esteem for the office of President, and dishonored the \n     office which they have entrusted to him;\n       (2)(A) William Jefferson Clinton made false statements \n     concerning this reprehensible conduct with a subordinate;\n       (B) William Jefferson Clinton wrongly took steps to delay \n     discovery of the truth; and\n       (C) in as much as no person is above the law, William \n     Jefferson Clinton remains subject to criminal and civil \n     penalties; and\n       (3) William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United \n     States, by his conduct has brought upon himself, and fully \n     deserves, the censure and condemnation of the American people \n     and the Congress; and by his signature on this Joint \n     Resolution, acknowledges this censure and condemnation.\n\n  On December 19, 1998, the House minority in the full house offered \nthis resolution on the House floor which stated:\n\n       That it is the sense of the House that--\n       (1) on January 20, 1993, William Jefferson Clinton took the \n     oath prescribed by the constitution of the United States \n     faithfully to execute the office of President; implicit in \n     that oath is the obligation that the President set an example \n     of high moral standards and conduct himself in a manner that \n     fosters respect for the truth: and William Jefferson Clinton, \n     has egregiously failed in this obligation, and through his \n     actions violated the trust of the American people, lessened \n     their esteem for the office of President, and dishonored the \n     office which they have entrusted to him:\n       (2)(A) William Jefferson Clinton made false statements \n     concerning his reprehensible conduct with a subordinate:\n       (B) William Jefferson Clinton wrongfully took steps to \n     delay discovery of the truth, and\n       (C) inasmuch as no person is above the law, William \n     Jefferson Clinton remains subject to criminal and civil \n     penalties and\n       (3) William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United \n     States, by his conduct has brought upon himself and fully \n     deserves the censure and condemnation of the American people \n     and this House.\n\n  As a former United States Attorney, Solicitor of the Department of \nthe Interior, and defense attorney, I believe I understand the rule of \nlaw. The conduct which the President engaged in was clearly wrong, and \nhis actions clearly warrant his Impeachment, which the House of \nRepresentatives has done. But with regard to the allegations in Article \nI, I do not believe his criminal activity rises to the level of ``High \nCrimes and Misdemeanors'' which require his removal from office by this \nSenate.\n  Article, II, charging obstruction of justice, to me, involves a very \ndifferent matter than the perjury charge in Article I. Article II \ninvolves the use of Presidential powers to impede or imperil the \nimpartial administration of justice in a civil as well as before the \ngrand jury. We have pledged to ``Support and Defend the Constitution,'' \nand I suggest that in our present roles we must do so by fulfilling and \nreaffirming the freedoms and obligations of all Americans under that \ndocument. By micromanaging the briefing of witnesses and the \nconcealment of evidence and by testifying before the grand jury to what \nhe knew was not the whole truth, the President has obstructed justice. \nHis oath as President requires him to faithfully execute laws, and by \nhis actions he has violated this oath.\n  In his 1992 book ``Grand Inquests,'' the Presiding Officer of this \nCourt (and the Chief Justice of the United States) wrote:\n\n       The framers [of the United States Constitution] and the \n     authors of the Federalist Papers had not envisioned political \n     parties as we now know them . . . Would the dominant role \n     played by political parties make the Senate a partisan \n     tribunal which would be willing to undermine the fundamental \n     principles of the Constitution in order to remove a political \n     enemy from office?\n\n  I also wonder whether the Framers anticipated that in 85 of the 106 \nCongresses, the minority party has held more than the necessary one-\nthird strength to prevent the removal of a President?\n  The action of the House of Representatives was not partisan. But, it \nis obvious from the final vote that future generations could reach such \na conclusion. In fact, it is obvious that many of our Democratic \nSenators have done so. In this Senate, a final vote strictly on party \nlines should not occur. The fundamental principles referenced by the \nChief Justice--particularly the balance of power between the \nlegislative and executive branches of our Federal Government--should \nnot be undermined. The most basic principle at issue is the obligation \nof each branch to dedicate itself to protect the separation of powers \nof our three branches of Government.\n  In my judgment, the power of the Senate to reach across to the \nexecutive branch and remove a President of the United States may be \nexercised only when the President's actions seriously threaten our \nnation's security, when he violates his oath to ``faithfully execute \nthe law of the United States,'' or does such violence to the rule of \nlaw that removal from office is clearly the only way to protect our \nnation from the possibility that he might do great harm to our people.\n  While I believe the President violated his oath, it does not \nnecessarily follow that he must be removed. For myself,\n\n[[Page S1600]]\n\nif I knew my vote would be the deciding vote here, I would not vote to \nremove this President, despite his unlawful acts. He has not brought \nthat level of danger to the nation which, in my judgment, is necessary \nto justify such an action.\n  The President remains answerable, as all Americans should be, to the \ncriminal processes of our justice system. We do not have the power to \nconvict him of a crime; the Constitution forbids it. Instead, the \nConstitution provides that the Senate, by a \\2/3\\ majority of those \nvoting, may remove him from office. For me, that makes this more than a \nfactual issue, so I do not vote as I would were I a juror in a criminal \ncase.\n  As I prepared my decision, it was apparent to me that there was no \nalternative that will dispose of this matter consistent with the \nsanctity of oaths and the importance of truth other than to adopt \nfindings of fact. Not to do so and to not remove the President \nundermines the great success of a nation based upon observance and \nloyalty to our oaths.\n  Having no other alternative, I shall vote guilty on Article II. As I \npreviously pointed out, I would not do so if I knew such action would \nremove the President from office. I do so to demonstrate my firm \nconviction not only that the President has obstructed justice, but also \nthat we should have followed the procedure which would establish the \nfacts clearly and then determine if the President should be removed \nfrom office.\n  When we had our first meetings on this issue, I told my colleagues we \nhad forces in Kuwait on high alert, forces in Bosnia, an alarming \nsituation in North Korea, and Asian flu plaguing the economies of \nemerging nations, and Pakistan and India drawing closer and closer to \nconflict. President Yeltsin, when I saw him yesterday, was a very ill \nleader, a leader of a nation that has the ability to threaten our \nfreedom. NATO could well order an assault in Kosovo if negotiations \nthere break down.\n  The world has one stable superpower--the United States of America. \nRemoval of the President by the Senate for the first time in history \ncould destabilize our nation--leaving him in office will not.\n  The long national ordeal our country has undergone over the past year \nhas been agonizing for all of us. Since the Senate convened as a Court \nof Impeachment, I have received thousands of e-mails and letters from \nevery reach of my state, from the most remote Eskimo village to our \nlargest urban center.\n  I have literally received letters from every walk of life: from \ndoctors, lawyers, and Indian chiefs. Many are filled with advice on how \nI should cast my vote, the most important vote I will ever cast as a \nSenator. But whether they believe the president should be removed from \noffice or not, all express deep concerns about the future of our \ncountry and the example we set for future generations. I have laid \nawake many nights pondering those very questions, and I share the \nanguish that many have felt.\n  When I was appointed to the Senate 30 years ago Christmas Eve, I had \na motto that I have tried to live by. ``To hell with the politics. Just \ndo what's right for Alaska.'' Today, as one of 100 men and women who \nhave been chosen to exercise this mighty power that our founding \nfathers conveyed on us over 200 years ago, I modify my creed: ``To hell \nwith the politics. Just do what's right for the nation.''\n  There are many who will disagree with the votes I cast in this \nhistoric trial. But I hope all will know that I have done my best to \nlive by the oaths that I took, and to do what I think is right for the \nnation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. Chief Justice, throughout the history of this \ngreat country, we have endured trials that have strained the sinews of \nour democracy and sometimes even threatened to tear apart our \nunparalleled experiment in self-government. Each time the nation has \nreturned to the Constitution as our common lodestar, trusting in its \nvision, its values and its ultimate verity. Each time we have emerged \nfrom these tests stronger, more resilient, more certain of Daniel \nWebster's claim of ``one country, one constitution, one destiny.'' \n(Speech to a Whig Party rally in New York City, March 15, 1837.) And \neach time our awe of the Founders' genius has been renewed, as has our \nreverence for the brilliantly-calibrated instrument they crafted to \nguide their political progeny in the unending challenge of governing as \na free people.\n  At this moment, we face a test that, although not as grave or \nperilous as some before, is nevertheless unlike anything this nation \nhas ever experienced. As my colleagues well know, the impeachment trial \nof William Jefferson Clinton marks the first time in our history that \nthe United States Senate has convened as a court of impeachment to \nconsider removing an elected President from office. But what also makes \nthis trial unprecedented are the underlying charges against President \nClinton, which stem directly from his private sexual behavior. The \nfacts of this case are complicated, embarrassing, demoralizing, and \ninfuriating. They raise questions that Madison, Hamilton, and their \nbrethren could never have anticipated that the Senate would have to \naddress in the solemn context of impeachment.\n  The public examination of these difficult questions--about private \nand public morality, about the role of the Independent Counsel, and \nabout our expectations of Presidential conduct--has been a wrenching, \ndispiriting and at times unseemly process for the nation. It has \ndivided us as parties and as a people, reaching its nadir in the \npartisan bickering and badgering that unfortunately defined the \nimpeachment vote in the House of Representatives and compromised the \nlegitimacy of this process in the eyes of many Americans. It has set \noff a frenzy in the news media that has degraded and devalued our \npublic discourse and badly eroded the traditional boundaries between \npublic and private life, leaving a pornographer to assume the role or \narbiter of our political mores. And it has so alienated the American \npeople that many of them are hardly paying attention to a trial that \ncould result in the most radical disruption of the presidency--\nexcepting assassination--in our nation's history.\n  Yet despite the significant pain this trauma has caused for the \ncountry, I take heart from the fact that we have once again reaffirmed \nour commitment to the Constitution and the fundamental principles \nunderpinning it. The conduct of the trial here in the Senate has been \npassionate at times, but never uncivil, and while some votes have \nbroken along party lines, they have never broken the spirit of common \npurpose we share. Indeed, throughout the past several weeks we as a \nbody have grown closer as we have continually measured our actions with \nthe same constitutional yardstick, and each of us has sought to remain \nfaithful to the Founders' vision as we understand it in fulfilling our \nresponsibilities as triers of the President. This, I believe, is in the \nend a remarkable testament to the foresight of our forefathers, that \neven in this most unusual of crises, we could and would rely on the \nConstitution as our compass to find a peaceable and just resolution.\n  We are about to achieve that resolution and complete our \nconstitutional responsibilities by rendering a judgment, a profound \njudgment, about the conduct of President Clinton and the call of the \nHouse of Representatives to remove him from office. This is the duty we \naccepted when we swore to do ``impartial justice,'' and it is a duty \nthat I, as each of you, have pondered night and day since this trial \nbegan.\n\n  As I have stated previously on this Senate floor, I have been deeply \ndisappointed and angered by this President's conduct--that which is \ncovered in the Articles, and the more personal misbehavior that is \nnot--and like all of us here, I have struggled uncomfortably for more \nthan a year with how to respond to it. President Clinton engaged in an \nextramarital sexual relationship with a young White House employee in \nthe Oval Office, which, though consensual, was irresponsible and \nimmoral, and thus raised serious questions about his judgment and his \nrespect for the high office he holds. He then made false or misleading \nstatements about that relationship to the American people, to a Federal \ndistrict court judge in a civil deposition, and to a Federal grand \njury; in so doing, he betrayed not only his family but the public's \ntrust, and undermined his moral authority and public credibility.\n  But the judgment we must now make is not about the rightness or \nwrongness\n\n[[Page S1601]]\n\nof the President's relationship with Monica Lewinsky and his efforts to \nconceal it. Nor is that judgment about whether the President is guilty \nof committing a specific crime. That may be determined by a criminal \ncourt, which the Senate clearly is not, after he leaves office.\n  No, the question before us now is whether the President's conduct--as \nalleged in the two articles of impeachment--makes his continuance in \noffice a threat to our government, our people, and the national \ninterest. That, I conclude, is the extraordinarily high bar the Framers \nset for removal of a duly-elected President, and it is that standard we \nmust apply to the facts to determine whether the President is guilty of \n``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.''\n  Each side has had ample opportunity to present its case, illuminating \nthe voluminous record from the House, and we Senators have been able to \nask wide-ranging questions of both parties. The House was also \nauthorized to conduct depositions of the three witnesses it deemed most \nimportant to its case. I have listened intently throughout, watched the \nvideotaped depositions, and been very impressed by both the House \nManagers and the counsel for the President. The House Managers, for \ntheir part, have presented the facts and argued the Constitution so \neffectively that they impelled me more than once to seriously consider \nvoting for removal.\n  But after much reflection and review of the extensive evidence before \nus, of the meaning of the term ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' and, \nmost importantly, of the best interests of the nation, I have concluded \nthat the facts do not meet the high standard the Founders established \nfor conviction and removal. No matter how deeply disappointed I am that \nour President, who has worked so successfully to lift up the lives of \nso many people, so lowered himself and his office, I conclude that his \nwrongdoing in this sordid saga does not justify making him the first \nPresident to be ousted from office in our history. I will therefore \nvote against both Articles of Impeachment.\n  In reaching the judgment that President Clinton is not guilty of high \ncrimes or misdemeanors, I started from the same premise that the \nFounders did--the right of the people to choose their leaders is \nparamount in America, derived directly, as Thomas Jefferson wrote in \nthe Declaration of Independence, from the equality of rights endowed to \nthe people by our Creator. The supremacy of this first democratic \nprinciple was well described by Alexis De Tocqueville in Democracy in \nAmerica: ``The people reign in the American political world as the \nDeity does in the universe. They are the cause and the aim of all \nthings; everything comes from them, and everything is absorbed in \nthem.'' (Heffner ed. 1956 p. 58)\n\n  In debating the President's fate, we must remember that we are \ndeciding is whether to supersede the people's decision about who should \nlead them--to substitute our judgment for theirs. On this point, the \nFramers of the Constitution were clear. They had boldly rejected the \nautocratic rule of a monarch and put in his place a President elected \nby, and accountable to, the people. Their deliberations show that they \ndid not want even the legislature to exercise too much control over he \npopularly-chosen President. The Framers provided impeachment to serve \nas the narrowest of escape valves in the most extreme of cases. As a \nresult, they set an extraordinarily high bar--both procedurally and \nsubstantively--for Congress to overcome before we, rather than the \nvoters, could remove a President from office.\n  Specifically, they required a majority of the House of \nRepresentatives to impeach and permitted removal only upon the \nconcurrence of two-thirds of the Senate--which the Framers surely knew, \nand the current proceedings have demonstrated, is exceedingly difficult \nto obtain. They also established a very strict substantive standard, \nauthorizing the Congress to remove a President from office only upon \n``Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high \nCrimes and Misdemeanors.'' (U.S. Constitution, Art. II, sec. 4)\n  The first time I read that clause, ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' \nI assumed it included any criminal offense--and only criminal \noffenses--and I thought that it gave Congress broad latitude to impeach \nand remove from office a President who had committed any violation of \nthe criminal code. But the more I studied the history, the less clear \nthat interpretation became. The phrase ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' \nwas a term of art to the Framers, and it meant something very different \nfrom ordinary crimes, the response to which must be left to the \ncriminal justice system. The Framers chose the term high crimes, to \nconnote a very specific type of offense, like treason or bribery, which \nhas a direct impact on the government and undermines the chief \nexecutive's ability or will to continue serving without corruption and \nin the national interest. As Alexander Hamilton explained in the \nFederalist Papers, high crimes and misdemeanors are ``those offenses \nwhich proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, \nfrom the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature \nwhich may with peculiar propriety be denominated political, as they \nrelate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.'' \n(The Federalist Papers, No. 65 Rossiter ed. 1961 p. 396 (emphasis in \noriginal))\n  It is not necessary here to offer a lengthy dissertation on the \nConstitutional Convention's impeachment debates. But I would like to \nshare a statement of James Madison that illuminates the reasons why the \nFramers wanted to authorize impeachment and removal, as well as the \nintended scope of that power. In response to the suggestion that it was \ndangerous to authorize the legislature to remove the President, Madison \nargued that it was:\n\n       indispensable that some provision should be made by \n     defending the Community against the incapacity, negligence or \n     perfidy of the chief Magistrate. The limitation of the period \n     of his service, was not a sufficient security. He might lose \n     his capacity after his appointment. He might pervert his \n     administration into a scheme of peculation or oppression. He \n     might betray his trust to foreign powers . . . In the case of \n     the Executive Magistracy which was to be administered by \n     a single man, loss of capacity or corruption was more \n     within the compass of probable events, and either of them \n     might be fatal to the Republic. (II Records of the Federal \n     Convention of 1787, pp. 65-66 (Farrand ed. 1888))\n\n``Loss of capacity or corruption''--that is the evil at which the \nConstitution's impeachment clauses were directed, in Madison's view.\n  Although neither the words of the Constitution nor the writings of \nHamilton, Madison or any of the other Framers of the Constitution \nprovide a precise list of those offenses that prove ``the abuse or \nviolation of some public trust,'' or the ``loss of capacity or \ncorruption'' that would constitute ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' \ntheir words and our history offer some help in supplying a more \ndetailed meaning to those terms.\n  First, the Framers saw impeachment as an extreme remedy meant to \nrespond to only a limited universe of offenses. They took great care to \nensure that their chosen substantive standard did not have the effect \nof providing Congress so much discretion over the President's fate that \nit could use its power to infringe on the President's independence. It \nwas for this precise reason that Madison successfully argued against \nallowing for removal for ``maladministration,'' for fear that ``[s]o \nvague a term will be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the \nSenate.'' (II Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 550 \n(Farrand ed. 1888))\n  Second, pervading the Framers' discussions--and the Constitutional \nlanguage they ultimately adopted--was the view that impeachment was \nintended to protect the nation and the national interest and not to \nprovide the legislature an alternative to the criminal justice system \nfor holding accountable the President or any other violator of the \nnation's criminal laws. In crafting our Constitution's impeachment \nclauses, the Framers specifically and consciously departed from the \nEnglish practice, in which Parliament could use its impeachment power \nto impose criminal sanctions. Emphasizing that the legislative branch \nhas no constitutional role whatsoever in meting out punishment, whether \nfor the Chief Executive or any other citizen, was so important to the \nFramers that they declared it not once, but twice in the Constitution--\nfirst when they outlawed bills of attainder (Art. I, sec. 9, cl. 3), \nand again when they emphasized\n\n[[Page S1602]]\n\nthat ``Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than \nto removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any \nOffice of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party \nconvicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, \nTrial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law'' (Art. I, sec. 3, cl. \n7).\n  It is this linguistically-driven irony--that the Constitution's \nimpeachment clauses employ the language of criminal law to authorize a \nprocess entirely outside of and distinct from the criminal justice \nsystem--that has created so much confusion over our precise task here. \nThe House Managers often appear to suggest that if they show that the \nPresident committed a crime, then they have met their burden, because \nit is our responsibility to hold accountable a President who violates \nthe law and to send a message that the President is not above the law.\n  But as Professor Charles Black so well explained in Impeachment: A \nHandbook, criminality in and of itself is neither a necessary nor a \nsufficient basis for concluding that a President has committed a high \ncrime or misdemeanor, because our goal is to protect the nation's \ninterests, not to punish a President for violating the criminal law. He \nstates: ``I think we can say that `high Crimes or Misdemeanors,' in the \nconstitutional sense, ought to be held to be those offenses which are \nrather obviously wrong, whether or not `criminal,' and which so \nseriously threaten the order of political society as to make pestilent \nand dangerous the continuance in power of their perpetrator. The fact \nthat such an act is also criminal helps, even if it is not  essential, \nbecause a general societal view of wrongness, and sometimes of \nseriousness, is, in such a case, publicly and authoritatively \nrecorded.'' (1998 ed. pp. 39-40)\n\n  If the purpose of impeachment was to ensure that the President is \nheld accountable for violating the law, then the Framers would have \nauthorized Congress to impeach and remove, not just for high crimes but \nfor any crimes. They did not do that. They gave us the power of \nimpeachment and removal for one reason and one reason only: to protect \nthe Republic from a Chief Executive who, by his acts, has demonstrated \nthat he can no longer be trusted to govern in the national interest. \nResponses to all other forms of malfeasance were left to the other \nbranches.\n  That is why I conclude that the appropriate question for each of us \nto ask is not whether the President committed perjury or obstruction of \njustice, but whether he committed a high crime or misdemeanor--a term I \nunderstand from the history to encompass two categories of offenses. \nThe first includes those that are like treason or bribery in that they \nrepresent a gross misuse of official power to directly injure the State \nor its people. Those guilty of such offenses must be removed from \noffice because they have explicitly demonstrated, by their conduct, \nthat they will place their personal interests above the national \ninterest.\n  The President's counsel and others suggest that we should stop here, \narguing that Congress has no authority to remove a President for any \noffense not committed through the use of official power. (See Trial \nMemorandum of President Clinton pp. 19-20) I cannot agree. Instead, \nMadison's argument that we must have an escape valve that allows the \nlegislature to remove a President when the need arises to defend ``the \nCommunity against the incapacity, negligence, or perfidy of the chief \nMagistrate,'' coupled with Hamilton's definition of ``high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors'' as an ``abuse or violation of some public trust,'' \nconvince me that it is more than just misuse of official power that can \nrequire the Senate to remove an office holder. Acts that, although in \ntheir immediate nature and effect differ from treason or bribery \nbecause they do not stem from a misuse of official power, may \nnevertheless undermine the offender's ability to discharge his duties \nin the interests of the American people. In other words, the second \ncategory of offenses that equal ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' are \nnon-official acts that unequivocally demonstrate the same threat posed \nby treason or bribery: that the President can no longer be trusted to \nuse his power in the best interests of the nation.\n  It is for this reason that I reject the contention that a President's \ngiving false or misleading statements under oath or his impeding the \ndiscovery of evidence in a lawsuit arising out of his personal conduct \nmay never constitute a high crime or misdemeanor. I have no doubt that \nunder certain circumstances such offenses could demonstrate such a \nlevel of depravity, deceit and disregard for the administration of \njustice that we would have no choice but to conclude that the President \ncould no longer be trusted to use the authority of his office and make \nthe decisions entrusted to him as Chief Executive in the best interest \nof the nation. It is because I hold this position that I found reaching \na decision in this case such a difficult matter.\n  Before evaluating the charges against the President, and determining \nwhether his misconduct in fact meets the high threshold the \nConstitution establishes for removal, each of us had to resolve the \nimportant question of what standard of proof should be used for judging \nthe evidence against the President. It is widely agreed that the House \nManagers have the burden of convincing Members of the Senate that the \nPresident has committee a high crime or misdemeanor, but there are \ndifferences of opinion on the level of certainly each of us in the \nSenate must reach before we can conclude that the House has met its \nburden.\n\n  During the Impeachment Trial of Judge Alcee Hastings, I gave a great \ndeal of thought to this question, and after weighing the competing \ninterests of preserving the integrity of the judiciary, maintaining the \nindependence of the judiciary, and protecting the personal interests of \nthe office holder, I concluded that the House had to prove it case by \n``clear and convincing evidence.'' (See 135 Cong. Rec. S 14359-61 (Oct. \n27, 1989)) Clear and convincing evidence is evidence that, in one \nformulation, produces in the mind ``a firm belief or conviction as to \nthe matter at issue'' (U.S. Fifth Circuit District Judges Association, \nPattern Jury Instructions Sec. 2.14 (1998 ed.)) or, put another way, \npersuades the finder of fact that the claim ``is highly probable'' \n(Committee on Model Jury Instructions, Ninth Circuit Manual of Model \nJury Instructions Sec. 1.12.2 (1997 ed.)).\n  There are valid arguments for adopting the higher standard of \n``beyond a reasonable doubt'' in this case, most importantly that the \nnational trauma caused by the removal of a President so far surpasses \nthe damage imposed by the removal of a single judge, that the Senate \nmust remove a President only if it has a very high degree of certainty \nin the facts underlying its decision. On the other hand, just as the \ntrauma of removing a President is greater than that flowing from \nremoving a judge, the danger an errant President poses to the Republic \nfar exceeds the threat presented by a misbehaving judge. This need to \nprotect the integrity of the Republic and the welfare of its people \nargues against setting the standard of proof so high that it would \nresult in leaving in power an individual whose fitness to continue \nserving in the national interest is seriously in doubt, remembering \nthat no matter what the standard, removal still requires two-thirds of \nthe Senators' support.\n  In 1974, then Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield recommended that \nthe standard of ``clear and convincing evidence'' was ``a logical \nmiddle ground between the burden of proof requirement in criminal \nproceedings (`beyond a reasonable doubt') and the burden of proof \nrequirement in civil proceedings (`by a preponderance of the \nevidence').'' He added these words of insight and reason:\n\n       An impeachment proceeding is not a criminal proceeding \n     since the Court of Impeachment is barred by the Constitution \n     from imposing any of the usual criminal law sanctions in the \n     event of conviction, and it is not a civil proceeding because \n     the extraordinary formality and complexity of the process and \n     the serious consequences of a conviction and removal (in at \n     least the case of an impeachment of the President of the \n     United States) militate against accepting as adequate the low \n     threshold requirement of a civil action. The burden of proof, \n     like the terminology and various other requirements, must be \n     unique because impeachment itself is unique. It is unique in \n     that it is a hybrid of the legislative and the judicial, the \n     political and the legal. (Senate Committee on Rules and \n     Administration Executive Session Hearings on Senate Rules and \n     Precedents Applicable to Impeachment Trials, Aug. 5-6, 1974, \n     p. 193)\n\n\n[[Page S1603]]\n\n\nFor similar reasons, Professor Charles Black in his Handbook on \nImpeachment (p. 17) offer the standard of ``overwhelming preponderance \nof the evidence'' as appropriate for impeachment trials.\n  Taken together, those arguments persuaded me to adopt as the \nappropriate standard of proof the same one I chose in Judge Hastings' \nimpeachment trial: clear and convincing evidence. In other words, to \nvote for either of the articles before us, I must conclude that there \nis clear and convincing evidence that President William Jefferson \nClinton has committed a high crime or misdemeanor.\n  This brings me to the crux of this case, where it is necessary to \napply the standard of proof I have adopted to the evidence the Managers \nhave presented, in order to reach judgment on the Articles before us.\n  A number of specific allegations contained in the Articles lack \nsufficient legal or evidentiary support. For example, it strikes me as \nhighly doubtful that an obstruction case can be made from the \nPresident's statements to aides who later testified to the grand jury. \nThe House asserts that these statements constituted obstruction because \nthe President knew his aides would repeat those statements to the grand \njury, thereby providing misleading information to the grand jury. But \nthe House has not adequately explained how the President saying \nprivately to his aides the same thing he was saying to the public could \nconstitute obstruction, particularly when we have been presented no \nevidence showing that the President made those statements for the \npurpose of having them repeated to the grand jury.\n  Similarly, the Managers have not offered a convincing legal theory \nshowing how the President obstructed justice simply by failing to \ndispute his attorney's statements about his relationship with Ms. \nLewinsky during the President's deposition. And, the Managers have \nfailed to substantiate their allegation that the President committed \nperjury by misstating the date of his initial sexual encounter with Ms. \nLewinsky when he told the grand jury ``When I was alone with Ms. \nLewinsky on certain occasions in early 1996 and once in early 1997, I \nengaged in conduct that was wrong'' (Aug. 17, 1998 Grand Jury Testimony \nof President Clinton pp. 8-9). The Managers have not offered evidence \nthat the President's error was intentional, nor did they provide a \nconvincing explanation how such a misstatement was material to the \ngrand jury's investigation.\n  Although the Managers offered slightly more weighty evidence \nconcerning the involvement of the President and his friend, Vernon \nJordan, in Ms. Lewinsky's job search at the same time she was filing a \nfalse affidavit in the Jones case, their case on this point leaves me \nsuspicious but unconvinced. The evidence is highly circumstantial, \namounting largely to an overlap in the timing between Ms. Lewinsky's \nappearance on the Jones' witness list and Mr. Jordan's efforts to find \nMs. Lewinsky a job at the President's request. Both Ms. Lewinsky and \nMr. Jordan testified that there was no connection between the two \nevents. Although the fact that Ms. Lewinsky's job search and the \ndrafting of her affidavit occurred simultaneously and that Mr. Jordan \nwas involved with both raises questions, nevertheless the ultimate lack \nof any direct evidentiary connection prevents me from reaching any \nsettled conclusion on the matter.\n  The House has provided more persuasive evidence to support a number \nof its other allegations. For example, I am troubled by the President's \ngrand jury testimony that he did not have sexual relations with Ms. \nLewinsky within the meaning of the definition offered him in his Jones \ndeposition. (See, e.g., Aug. 17, 1998 Grand Jury Testimony of President \nClinton pp. 9, 109) Ms. Lewinsky testified that they had several such \nencounters. (Aug. 26, 1998 Grand Jury Testimony of Monica Lewinsky pp. \n6-40) The President's counsel responded to this allegation by saying: \n``This claim comes down to an oath against an oath about immaterial \ndetails concerning an acknowledged wrongful relationship.'' (Trial \nMemorandum of President Clinton p. 44)\n  I disagree. The President's statement almost certainly was material \nto the grand jury's investigation. The grand jury was not investigating \nwhether or not Ms. Lewinsky and the President had a relationship per \nse, but rather whether the President perjured himself in his \nJones deposition and obstructed justice. Given that in his Jones \ndeposition, the President specifically denied having sexual relations \nwith Ms. Lewinsky, it seems not only material, but central to the grand \njury's investigation to determine whether the President told the truth \nhe said he did not have sexual relations with her.\n\n  The fact that Ms. Lewinsky was testifying under an immunity agreement \nand would therefore be subject to prosecution if she lied, and that \nmost of her other testimony is uncontroverted, so much that the \nPresident's counsel relies on it at several key points, leads me to \nview her testimony about the details of her sexual relationship with \nthe President as credible. The same is true of her consistent testimony \nthat it was Betty Currie who called her and told Ms. Lewinsky she \nunderstood she had something for her--the gifts from the President. \n(See Feb. 1, 1999 Deposition of Monica Lewinsky, 145 Congressional \nRecord S. 1225 (Feb. 4, 1999.)\n  Although it is a less central matter, I am puzzled by the President's \nincluding in his prepared grand jury testimony the statement that ``I \nregret that what began as a friendship came to include this \n[inappropriate] conduct.'' (Grand Jury Testimony of President Clinton \np. 9.) As the House Managers pointed out, according to Ms. Lewinsky, \nshe and the President engaged in ``this conduct'' on the first day they \nmet.\n  The series of questions which Betty Currie (a friendly witness to the \nPresident) testified that the President asked her on the day after his \ndeposition in January 1998 and again a few days later are most \ntroubling--both as to the credibility of the President's testimony to \nthe grand jury regarding those statements and as to whether his intent \nin making those statements was to wrongly influence Ms. Currie's \npotential testimony. The President testified that he asked Ms. Currie \nthose questions ``to refresh my memory about what the facts were.'' \n(Grand Jury Testimony of President Clinton p. 131.) In their trial \nmemorandum (pp. 52-53), the President's counsel assert that his \nstatement is consistent with Ms. Currie's testimony that the President \nseemed to be trying to gather information. But the President did not \ntestify that he was trying to gather information generally. He stated \nthat he was trying to refresh his own memory. And this, unfortunately, \nseems to me to be an implausible explanation of what he was doing. In \nhis testimony before the grand jury on August 17, 1998, the President \nadmitted that he had ``inappropriate intimate contact'' with Ms. \nLewinsky and that the relationship occurred ``when I was alone with Ms. \nLewinsky.'' (Grand Jury Testimony of President Clinton pp. 8-9.) He \ntherefore must have known in January 1998, when he asked Ms. Currie the \nseries of questions, that the statements they contained (for example, \nthat ``I was never alone with Monica Lewinsky,'' that Ms. Currie \n``could see and hear everything,'' and that ``Monica came on to me, and \nI never touched her, right?'') either were not true or were beyond Ms. \nCurrie's knowledge and that Ms. Currie could not possibly help refresh \nhis memory.\n  The President called Ms. Currie in on January 18, 1998 to ask her \nthose questions after the surprise questions he was asked the day \nbefore in the Jones deposition about his relationship with Ms. \nLewinsky, and after he repeatedly invoked Ms. Currie's name in \nconnection with Ms. Lewinsky in response to those questions. (See Jan. \n17, 1998 Deposition of President Clinton, reprinted in Senate Doc. 106-\n3 Vol. XXII, pp. 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.) Certainly, if the \nJones lawyers wanted to further investigate the President's \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky, the President's own statements would \nhave led them directly to Ms. Currie.\n  In summary, although the House managers have left me thoroughly \nunconvinced of some of their allegations, the evidence presented on \nothers does lead me to believe that it is likely that there were \noccasions on which the President made false or misleading statements \nand took actions which could have had the effect of impeding the \ndiscovery of evidence in judicial proceedings. Whether any of his \nconduct constitutes a criminal offense\n\n[[Page S1604]]\n\nsuch as perjury or obstruction of justice is not for me to decide. \nThat, appropriately, should and must be left to the criminal justice \nsystem, which will uphold the rule of law in President Clinton's case \nas it would for any other American. What I must do is uphold the \nConstitution and decide whether the House Managers have presented clear \nand convincing evidence that the President has committed a high crime \nor misdemeanor, which is to say whether they have demonstrated that his \nmisconduct has so compromised his capacity to govern in the national \ninterest that he must be removed.\n\n  I conclude that the House Managers have not met that high burden. I \nam, of course, profoundly unsettled by President Clinton's \nirresponsibility in carrying on a sexual relationship with an intern in \nthe Oval Office and by the disregard for the truth he showed in trying \nto conceal it from his family, his staff, the courts and the American \npeople. But the Managers have failed to convince me with the evidence \nthey have presented that his misbehavior, as charged in the articles of \nimpeachment, makes him a threat to the national interest, and that we \ncan no longer expect the President to govern free of corruption in the \nnation's best interests.\n  Indeed, the Managers have barely addressed this point of consequences \nat all, providing almost no evidence or argument that the republic \nneeds protecting from this President. Rather, they have presented their \ncase largely as if the Senate were a criminal court, as if our sole \nresponsibility were to determine whether the President is guilty of the \ncrimes of perjury and obstruction of justice, as if those specific \ncrimes were the indisputable equivalent of high crimes or misdemeanors \nautomatically warranting the President's removal. And in doing do, I \nbelieve, they have failed to cross the higher constitutional threshold \nof proving that the President has forfeited his right to fill out the \nterm for which the people elected him.\n  The voice of the American people, in fact, indicates that just the \nopposite is true. According to every public poll we have seen, a clear \nmajority of the American people have continued to support the President \nthroughout this ordeal. Nearly two-thirds of them say repeatedly that \nthey approve of the job that President Clinton is doing in running the \ncountry, and that they oppose his removal. In my state of Connecticut, \na survey done by The Hartford Courant just last week showed that 68 \npercent of my constituents rate the President's job performance as \nexcellent or good, and a full three quarters of them believe he \ndeserves to stay in office.\n  In noting this, I recognize that is would be a dereliction of my duty \nto substitute public opinion polls for reasoned judgment about our \nnational interest in resolving this constitutional crisis. But it would \nalso be a serious error to ignore the people's voice, because in \nexercising our authority as a court of impeachment we are standing in \nthe place of the voters who re-elected the President two years ago. In \nthis case, the prevailing public opposition to impeachment has \nparticular relevance, for it provides substantial evidence that the \nPresident's misconduct has not been so harmful as to shatter the \npublic's faith in his ability to fulfill his Presidential duties and \nact in their interest.\n  It is possible, of course, that a popular President could \nnevertheless be corrupt and pose a threat to the nation, which is to \nsay that public opinion is not the only barometer of fitness for \noffice. But in this democracy it is an indispensable measure, and in \nlight of the ultimately unconvincing evidence the Managers have \npresented to demonstrate the President's loss of capacity or \ncorruption, the public's opposition to removal carries weight in my \ndeliberations. It carries particular weight given the overwhelming \namount of information the news media has provided us about the details \nof the President's behavior, which strongly suggests that the American \npeople have not reached their conclusions in ignorance of the \nPresident's flaws or faults.\n  The public opinion polls tell us more than that the majority of \npeople support his continuance in office. Those two-thirds who \nconsistently give him high ratings for his job performance have also \nstrongly expressed their disapproval of his sexual behavior and his \ndeliberate lies to the nation. Indeed, surveys have routinely shown \nthat, as a consequence of this scandal, less than one-fifth of the \nAmerican people claim that they share the President's moral and ethical \nvalues, a result I find stunning and which may be unparalleled in our \nhistory.\n  How can so many Americans simultaneously hold the views that the \nPresident has demeaned his office and yet should not be evicted from \nit? We will be trying to answer that question and to weigh the \nconsequences of those seemingly conflicting opinions for a long time to \ncome. But I believe the explanation must have something to do with the \ncontext of the President's actions. As the record makes abundantly \nclear, the President's false or misleading statements under oath and \nhis broader deception and cover-up stemmed directly from his private \nsexual behavior, something that no other sitting American president to \nmy knowledge has ever been questioned about in a legal setting. The \nPresident neither lied about nor was trying to conceal presidential \nmalfeasance or a heinous crime, such as murder or rape, but instead \nsought to hide a sexual relationship with an intern that was deeply \nembarrassing, shameful, even indefensible, yet not illegal.\n  Indeed, troubled as I am by much of the evidence the Managers \npresented and the arguments they made, on each occasion I considered \nvoting for removal I invariably came back to this question of context, \nand I asked myself: Are these the kinds of offenses the Founders \nenvisioned when they entrusted us with the awesome power of invoking \nour democracy's ultimate sanction? Does this tawdry, tragic episode \njustify, for the first time in our proud history, ejecting from office \nthe individual the American people chose to lead the country? And each \ntime I had to answer no.\n  To reach this conclusion, that the context matters in judging the \nPresident's misconduct, is in the eyes of the House Managers and many \nof the President's critics and abdication of duty and honor. It is, \nthey contend, to wink at any immorality, any transgression that is \nconnected to sexual behavior, to sacrifice our most precious principles \nat the altar of moral relativism. And worse, by choosing to acquit the \nPresident, they argue, we are setting an awful precedent for presidents \nto come.\n  I understand and share the frustrations that lead to these \ncriticisms. As I stated in the speech I made on this floor on September \n3rd of last year, I was deeply angered by the President's recklessness \nand his purposeful deceit. The conduct he had acknowledged at that \npoint in his grand jury testimony was not only immoral but harmful. The \nPresident is, as eminent historian Clinton Rossiter noted, the American \npeople's ``one authentic trumpet,'' (Rossiter ``The American \nPresidency'' 1955 p. 23) and when the notes he sounds falter in the \nexpression of our common values, it has an effect, one that cannot be \nignored. That was made clear to me in talking with many parents and \nchildren about this matter over the last several months, hearing the \ndismay and distrust in their voices, which was powerful evidence to me \nthat the President had undercut his moral authority and undermined \npublic confidence in his word.\n  My disappointment and anger with the President's actions were \nreawakened as I listened to the evidence the Managers have presented. \nAnd like many of my colleagues, I am left dissatisfied with the all-or-\nnothing nature of the choice we have been asked to make in this \nproceeding, between removing this President from office on the one \nhand, or not removing him on the other, which could imply exoneration \nor even vindication.\n\n  But as unsatisfying as that choice is, it is the only one that the \nFounders empowered the Senate to make in this impeachment proceeding. \nOur responsibility is not to pass judgment on the morality of the \nPresident's behavior, or to find whether he committed a specific crime. \nImpeachment is not an instrument of protest, or of prosecution, but one \nof protection, of our country, its people, and our democratic ideals. \nWhen the roll is called on each article and I answer ``not guilty,'' I \nwant it understood that I am saying ``not guilty of a high crime or \nmisdemeanor,'' and that is all I can say.\n\n[[Page S1605]]\n\n  With that understood, I do believe the Constitution allows for one \nrecourse that would provide a means for us as the people's \nrepresentatives to register our and their disapproval, and would, I \nbelieve, help us to bring appropriate closure to this terrible chapter \nin our nation's history. It is well within the Senate's constitutional \nprerogatives to adopt a resolution of censure expressing our contempt \nfor the President's misconduct, both that which is charged in the \narticles and that which is not. Such a censure would not amount to a \npunishment, nor would it be intended to do so. What it would do, \nparticularly if it united Senators across party lines and positions on \nremoval, is fulfill our responsibility to our children and our \nposterity to speak to the common values the President has violated, and \nmake clear what our expectations are for future holders of that highest \noffice.\n  And what it could do, I believe, is to help us to begin healing the \nwounds the President's misconduct and the impeachment process's \npartisanship have done to the American body politic, and to the soul of \nthe nation. I have observed that roughly two-thirds of the public \nconsistently expresses its opposition to the President's removal. But I \ndo not think we can leave this proceeding, especially those of us who \nhave voted against the Articles, without also noting that roughly one-\nthird of the American people have consistently expressed their belief \nthat this President is unfit to lead this nation. That is a startlingly \nlarge percentage of our people who have totally lost confidence in our \nnation's leader.\n  This extraordinary divergence of opinion tells us that there is a \nrift in our public life that extends far beyond the specific \ncircumstances of this case, a rift that the President's misconduct has \nonly exacerbated. A statement of censure is not an antidote that will \nmagically eliminate this division, but I believe it will help by \ndemonstrating that we can find common moral ground and articulate our \ncommon values even though we Senators and our constituents have \ndisagreed about impeachment. For that reason, I hope that once this \ntrial is concluded, we will put aside our partisan loyalties and our \npolitical hesitations and overcome parliamentary obstacles to join \ntogether in passing a resolution that affirms our belief that the \npresidency is and must continue to be, in the words of Clinton \nRossiter, ``the one-man distillation of the American people,'' (The \nAmerican Presidency p. 11), the steward of our freedom and our values.\n  In closing, Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to quote from a wise and \ncompelling insight that Manager Hyde put forward in his final argument. \nThe most formidable obstacle the Managers faced in making their case, \nhe said, was public cynicism, ``the widespread conviction that all \npolitics and all politicians are by definition corrupt and venal.'' He \nwent on to say, ``That cynicism is an acid eating away at the vital \norgans of American public life. It is a clear and present danger \nbecause it blinds us to the nobility and the fragility of being a self-\ngoverning people.''\n  While I disagree with Manager Hyde's ultimate conclusion in this \ncase, I could not agree more with his eloquent assessment of this \nthreat to our democracy. It is a problem I addressed at the end of the \ncampaign finance investigation that the Governmental Affairs Committee \nconducted in 1997, when I argued that the mad chase for money that \ndominates and distorts our political system gives the American people, \nalready deeply skeptical of the motives of politicians, good reason to \ndoubt whether they have a true and equal voice in their government. And \nit is a problem that I fear has grown significantly worse in the wake \nof this unseemly saga and the damage it has done to the public's esteem \nfor and expectations of their leaders.\n  The long and painful process of impeachment is about to come to an \nend, and thankfully so, but the enormous challenge we face in restoring \nthe public's faith in our public institutions and those who serve in \nthem is just beginning. This is the next great test for the President \nand for each of us, the fight against cynicism's corrosive influence \nand the loss of public trust. If we once again seek the help of our \ncommon Creator and the counsel of our shared Constitution, and through \nour actions express their ideals and fulfill their expectations, I am \nconfident we can in time renew a sense of common purpose and reassure \nthe citizenry we serve that America is indeed, as Webster proclaimed, \none country with one destiny. Thank you.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I find that William Jefferson Clinton did commit \nperjury and obstruct justice; that these offenses rise to the level of \n``high Crimes and Misdemeanors;'' that William Jefferson Clinton should \nbe convicted under the Articles of Impeachment; and that he must be \nremoved as President of the United States.\n  This is a sad chapter in our nation's long and illustrious history. A \nman of extraordinary talent took a mistake and turned it into a \ntragedy. William Jefferson Clinton is no ordinary man. Gifted and \ncharismatic, brilliant and refined, he took raw ability and focus and \nturned it into a Presidency. Such is the stuff of story books and \nheroes. Sadly for this tale, the hero had a habit he would not break, \nand, when it called him back to darkness, he sought to hide it at all \ncost. And there the tragedy occurred.\n  President Clinton repeatedly chose to lie and obstruct justice rather \nthan tell the truth and comply with court orders throughout this \nordeal. By his words and deeds he chose to place himself above the law. \nBy his words and deeds he has undermined the rule of law in America to \nthe great harm of this nation. By his own words and deeds, he has \nundermined the truth-finding function of the judiciary, at great harm \nto that branch of our government. By his words and deeds, he had done \ngreat harm to the notions of honesty and integrity that form the \nunderpinnings of this great republic.\n  The following represents the specific facts upon which I find William \nJefferson Clinton is guilty of perjury before a Federal Grand Jury and \nobstruction of justice, and must be removed as the President of the \nUnited States:\n\n\n             article i--perjury before a federal grand jury\n\n  In his conduct while President of the United States, William \nJefferson Clinton, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully \nto execute the office of President of the United States and, to the \nbest of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of \nthe United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take \ncare that the laws be faithfully executed, has willfully corrupted and \nmanipulated the judicial process of the United States for his personal \ngain and exoneration, impeding the administration of justice, in that:\n  On August 17, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton swore to tell the \ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth before a Federal \ngrand jury of the United States. Contrary to that oath, William \nJefferson Clinton willfully provided perjurious, false and misleading \ntestimony to the grand jury concerning the nature and details of his \nrelationship with a subordinate Government employee:\n  A. Testimony that conflicts with Ms. Lewinsky's account of the \nrelationship:\n  Ms. Lewinsky testified as to the extent of her sexual relationship \nwith President Clinton, and her statements were corroborated by \nnumerous individuals with whom she contemporaneously shared the details \nof her encounters with the President, including two professionals. Her \ntestimony indicated direct contact by the President with certain areas \nof her body. The conduct described by Ms. Lewinsky clearly falls within \nthe definition of sexual relations as President Clinton understood the \nterm to be defined in the Paula Jones case and during his grand jury \ntestimony.\n  In his prepared statement to the grand jury, President Clinton stated \nthat the sexual encounters between he and Ms. Lewinsky ``did not \nconstitute sexual relations as I understood that term to be defined at \nmy January 17th, 1998 deposition.'' President Clinton acknowledged that \nthe type of activity described by Ms. Lewinsky constituted sexual \nrelations as he understood the term to be defined during the Paula \nJones' deposition: ``I understood the definition to be limited to, to \nphysical contact with those areas of the bodies with the specific \nintent to arouse or gratify.'' However, during questioning under oath, \nPresident Clinton repeatedly denied engaging in the activities \ndescribed by Ms. Lewinsky.\n\n[[Page S1606]]\n\n  President Clinton was even asked by a grand juror whether ``if Monica \nLewinsky says that while you were in the Oval Office area you touched \n[certain area of her body that falls within the definition of sexual \nrelations as understood by the President in the Paula Jones case], \nwould she be lying.'' President Clinton responded: ``That is not my \nrecollection. My recollection is that I did not have sexual relations \nwith Ms. Lewinsky and I'm staying on my former statement about that.''\n  If Ms. Lewinsky's testimony is true, President Clinton committed \nperjury during his grand jury testimony. I have had the opportunity to \nread the portions of grand jury testimony provided by both President \nClinton and Ms. Lewinsky concerning their characterizations of their \nsexual relations. I also had the opportunity to watch Ms. Lewinsky's \nvideotaped deposition in which she reaffirmed her previous grand jury \ntestimony concerning the extent of their sexual relations. Based upon \n(1) the corroboration of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony by numerous witnesses \nwith whom she had spoken contemporaneously, (2) the detailed nature of \nMs. Lewinsky's testimony, (3) the evasiveness of President Clinton's \ntestimony, (4) the apparent sincerity of Ms. Lewinsky in her videotaped \ndeposition before the Senate, and (5) the President's refusal to be \ndeposed by the Senate, I find that the President provided false and \nmisleading testimony before a federal grand jury that constitutes \nperjury.\n  B. Testimony concerning his account of the relationship to Betty \nCurrie:\n  On January 18, 1998, President Clinton met with Mrs. Currie at the \nWhite House and told her ``there are several things you may want to \nknow'' about the President's relationship with Monica Lewinsky. During \nhis grand jury testimony, President Clinton stated that ``I was not \ntrying to get Betty Currie to say something that was untruthful.'' \nHowever, as discussed further in the obstruction of justice charges, \nPresident Clinton said to Mrs. Currie ``Monica came on to me, and I \nnever touched her, right?'' Based upon both Ms. Lewinsky and President \nClinton's testimony concerning their intimate contact, and upon Ms. \nLewinsky's Senate deposition, I must conclude that Ms. Lewinsky's \naccount of their intimate activity is accurate. As a result, I must \nfurther concluded that President Clinton was lying when he told Mrs. \nCurrie that he had not touched Ms. Lewinsky, and that the President \npermitted perjury when he testified before the grand jury that he had \nnot asked Mrs. Currie ``to say something that was untruthful.''\n  Mr. Clinton further testified that his only interest in speaking to \nMrs. Currie that day after the President was deposed in the Paula \nJones' case was to ``refresh [his] own recollection'' and ``not to \nimpart instructions on how she was to recall things in the future.'' As \nwill be discussed further below, I conclude that President Clinton made \na series of statements to Betty Currie in an attempt to improperly \npersuade her to provide false testimony. As a result, based upon the \nevidence presented in the record, I believe that President Clinton's \ninterest in talking to Mrs. Currie the day after he was deposed by \nPaula Jones' attorneys was to impart instructions on how Mrs. Currie \nwas to recall events concerning the President's illicit affair and not \nto refresh the President's memory. The President's statements before \nthe grand jury concerning his interest in talking to Mrs. Currie would \nthus constitute perjury.\n  C. Testimony concerning his account of the relationship to Sidney \nBlumenthal and John Podesta:\n  In his grand jury testimony, President Clinton asserted in his \nconversations with Mr. Blumenthal and Mr. Podesta, that ``I said things \nthat were true. They may have been misleading.'' President Clinton \nfurther states that ``what I was trying to do was give them something \nthey could--that would be true, even if misleading in the context of \nthis deposition.'' Mr. Clinton told Sidney Blumenthal that ``Monica \nLewinsky came at me and made a sexual demand on me'' and that the \nPresident had rebuffed her. Mr. Blumenthal also testified that the \nPresident claimed that Ms. Lewinsky threatened the President, saying \n``that she would tell people they'd had an affair, that she was known \nas the stalker among her peers, and that she hated it and if she had an \naffair or said she had an affair then she wouldn't be the stalker any \nmore.'' When Mr. Blumenthal asked the President whether Mr. Clinton had \nbeen alone with Ms. Lewinsky, the President replied ``I was within \neyesight or earshot of someone.''\n  Even President Clinton acknowledges that he was alone with Monica \nLewinsky, and, therefore not within eyesight or earshot of anybody, on \nnumerous occasions. Mr. Clinton also acknowledges that he and Ms. \nLewinsky engaged in ``inappropriate intimate contact'' which, if Ms. \nLewinsky's testimony is true, amounted to sexual relations as President \nClinton understood the term to be defined in the Paula Jones case. As a \nresult, the President lied, not simply misled Mr. Blumenthal, when Mr. \nClinton stated that he had ``rebuffed her.''\n  John Podesta testified that President Clinton had told Mr. Podesta \nthat the President ``had never had sex with her [Ms. Lewinsky] in any \nway whatsoever.'' Mr. Podesta further testified that President Clinton \nelaborated that the President and Ms. Lewinsky ``had not engaged in \n[sexual activity that falls within the definition of sexual relations \nas President Clinton understood the term to be defined in the Paula \nJones case].''\n  During Mr. Clinton's grand jury testimony, he refused to directly \ncontradict Mr. Podesta's characterization of their conversation: ``I'm \nnot saying that anybody who had a contrary memory is wrong.'' President \nClinton was asked ``[i]f [the White House aides] testified that you \ndenied sexual relations or relationship with Monica Lewinsky, or if \nthey told us that you denied that, do you have any reason to doubt \nthem?'' The President responded ``no.''\n  Based on the evidence concerning the extent of the sexual \nrelationship between President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky, and based on \nthe President's own admission concerning the accuracy of statements \nmade by his aides, I conclude that President Clinton committed perjury \nwhen he characterized the manner in which he conveyed false statements \nto Mr. Podesta and Mr. Blumenthal. President Clinton did not simply \nmislead his aides, he lied to them about his relationship with Ms. \nLewinsky.\n\n\n                   article ii--obstruction of justice\n\n  In his conduct while President of the United States, William \nJefferson Clinton, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully \nto execute the office of President of the United States and, to the \nbest of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of \nthe United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take \ncare that the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed, \nand impeded the administration of justice, and has to that end engaged \npersonally, and through his subordinates and agents, in a course of \nconduct or scheme designed to delay, impede, cover up, and conceal the \nexistence of evidence and testimony related to a Federal civil rights \naction brought against him in a duly instituted judicial proceeding.\n  The means used to implement this course of conduct or scheme \nincluded:\n  A. On or about December 28, 1997, William Jefferson Clinton corruptly \nengaged in, encouraged, or supported a scheme to conceal evidence that \nhad been subpoenaed in a Federal civil rights action brought against \nhim.\n  Ms. Lewinsky testified that on December 28, 1997 she told President \nClinton that she had been subpoenaed and that the subpoena required her \nto produce gifts given her by the President. According to Ms. Lewinsky, \nshe asked the President ``should I--maybe I should put the gifts away \noutside my house somewhere or give them to someone maybe Betty.'' Ms. \nLewinsky testified that President Clinton responded ``I don't know'' or \n``Let me think about that.''\n\n  Later that day (December 28), Ms. Lewinsky testified that she \nreceived a phone call from Mrs. Currie, who stated ``I understand you \nhave something to give me'' or ``the President said you have something \nto give me.'' Mrs. Currie then retrieved the gifts that President \nClinton had given to Ms. Lewinsky and hid them under her bed. Based \nupon the fact that Mrs. Currie was clearly acting under instructions \nfrom President Clinton, I find that President Clinton obstructed \njustice by attempting to hide evidence requested\n\n[[Page S1607]]\n\nin a subpoena in a federal civil rights case.\n  B. Beginning on or about December 7, 1997, and continuing through and \nincluding January 14, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton intensified and \nsucceeded in an effort to secure job assistance to a witness in a \nFederal civil rights action brought against him in order to corruptly \nprevent the truthful testimony of that witness in that proceeding at a \ntime when the truthful testimony of that witness would have been \nharmful to him.\n  At President Clinton's request, Vernon Jordan met with Monica \nLewinsky in November of 1997 to discuss assistance that Mr. Jordan \ncould provide Ms. Lewinsky in securing a job in New York. However, Mr. \nJordan took no action until December 11, 1997, five days after \nPresident Clinton learned that Monica Lewinsky was on the witness list \nin the Paula Jones case and that Mr. Jordan had not yet provided Ms. \nLewinsky with any assistance in securing a job in New York. On the day \nthat Mr. Clinton learned that Ms. Lewinsky was on the witness list, the \nPresident assured her that he would talk to Mr. Jordan to ensure that \nMr. Jordan stepped up his efforts to secure her a job in New York.\n  Mr. Jordan stepped up his activities on December 11, 1998, because, \non that date, Judge Susan Webber Wright ordered that Paul Jones was \nentitled to information concerning any government employee with whom \nthe President had sexual relations. On January 7, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky \nsigned a false affidavit, stating that she had not engaged in a sexual \nrelationship with the President. On January 8, 1998, after Ms. Lewinsky \nbelieved that her interview with MacAndrews and Forbes in New York had \ngone poorly, Mr. Jordan called the company's CEO, Ron Perelman, to ask \nhis assistance with securing employment for Ms. Lewinsky within Mr. \nPerelman's company. All of this activity was done in order to ensure \nthat Ms. Lewinsky did not provide damaging testimony against President \nClinton and thus constituted an effort to obstruct justice in the Paul \nJones case.\n  C. On or about January 18 and January 20-21, 1998, William Jefferson \nClinton related a false and misleading account of events relevant to a \nFederal civil rights action brought against him to a potential witness \nin that proceeding, in order to corruptly influence the testimony of \nthat witness.\n  Mrs. Currie was summoned to the White House on Sunday, January 18, \n1998 for a private meeting with President Clinton. The President was \nunder court order not to talk about the case to anyone. Nonetheless, \nafter telling Mrs. Currie that he had been deposed in the Paula Jones \ncase and that Ms. Jones' attorneys had asked the President several \nquestions about Ms. Lewinsky, President Clinton then made a series of \nstatements to Mrs. Currie:\n\n       I was never really alone with Monica, right?\n       You were always there when Monica was there, right?\n       Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?\n       You could see and hear everything, right?\n\n  The testimony of Mrs. Currie and President Clinton demonstrate that \nthese statements were an attempt to influence the future testimony of \nMrs. Currie regarding the President's relationship with Monica \nLewinsky. President Clinton admitted being alone with Ms. Lewinsky. \nMrs. Currie also testified that the President and Ms. Lewinsky had been \nalone. Given the fact that President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had been \nalone on a number of occasions, a fact that President Clinton would be \nunlikely to forget considering the intimate nature of their encounters, \nthe President was not refreshing his memory when he stated to Mrs. \nCurrie that he and Ms. Lewinsky had never been alone. President Clinton \nwas attempting to improperly persuade Mrs. Currie to testify that he \nand Ms. Lewinsky were never alone.\n  Mrs. Currie testified that President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky were \nalone a number of times. Despite the legal hairsplitting engaged in by \nthe White House, I interpret the statement ``You were always there when \nMonica was there, right?'' to mean that President Clinton was \nattempting to improperly persuade Mrs. Currie to testify that Ms. \nLewinsky was always within Mrs. Currie's sight during her visits to the \nPresident.\n  Based upon Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, President Clinton's statement \nthat ``Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?'' would \nclearly be false. In addition, because even President Clinton admitted \nto ``inappropriate intimate contact,'' I assume that President Clinton \nis at least admitting to having touched Ms. Lewinsky. As a result, I \nmust conclude that President Clinton did touch Ms. Lewinsky. I must \nthen further conclude that, because Mr. Clinton was making a statement \nto Mrs. Currie that the President knew to be false, he could only have \nmade such a claim in order to improperly persuade Mrs. Currie to \ntestify that President Clinton had never touched Ms. Lewinsky.\n  In his grand jury testimony, President Clinton admitted that he did \nnot allow Mrs. Currie to ``watch whatever intimate activity [the \nPresident] did with Ms. Lewinsky.'' In addition, when asked whether he \nwould ``not have engaged in those physically intimate acts if [the \nPresident] knew that Mrs. Currie could see or hear that,'' President \nClinton responded ``[t]hat's correct.'' However, on the Sunday after he \nwas deposed in the Paula Jones' case, Mr. Clinton told Mrs. Currie \n``You could see and hear everything, right?'' I find these two concepts \nto be inherently contradictory. President Clinton could not, on the one \nhand, shield Mrs. Currie from seeing or hearing any intimate activity, \nwhile, on the other hand, be sincerely stating that Mrs. Currie could \nsee and hear everything. I must then conclude that President Clinton \nmade this statement in an attempt to improperly persuade Ms. Currie to \ntestify that President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky engaged in no activity \nthat Mrs. Currie could neither see nor hear.\n\n  D. On or about January 21, 23, and 26, 1998, William Jefferson \nClinton made false and misleading statements to potential witnesses in \na Federal grand jury proceeding in order to corruptly influence the \ntestimony of those witnesses. The false and misleading statements made \nby William Jefferson Clinton were repeated by the witnesses to the \ngrand jury, causing the grand jury to receive false and misleading \ninformation.\n  On January 21, 1998, President Clinton met with Sidney Blumenthal, a \nsenior White House aide. During the course of their conversation, Mr. \nBlumenthal asked President Clinton what the President had done wrong. \nAccording to Mr. Blumenthal, the President responded ``[n]othing'' and \n``I haven't done anything wrong.''\n  Mr. Blumenthal asked the President why, if he had done nothing wrong, \nwould the President want to appear on television and admit wrongdoing, \nwhich is what the President implied he wanted to do. At that point, \naccording to Mr. Blumenthal, the President stated that ``Monica \nLewinsky came at me and made a sexual demand on me'' and that the \nPresident had rebuffed her. Mr. Blumenthal also testified that the \nPresident claimed that Ms. Lewinsky threatened the President, telling \nhim ``that she would tell people they'd had an affair, that she was \nknown as the stalker among her peers, and that she hated it and if she \nhad an affair or said she had an affair then she wouldn't be the \nstalker any more.''\n  According to Mr. Blumenthal, President Clinton also stated that ``I \nfeel like somebody who is surrounded by an oppressive force that is \ncreating a lie about me and I can't get the truth out.'' When Mr. \nBlumenthal asked the President whether Mr. Clinton had been alone with \nMs. Lewinsky, the President replied ``I was within eyesight or earshot \nof someone.''\n  Based upon the grand jury testimony presented by Ms. Lewinsky and \nPresident Clinton, and upon the deposition provided to the Senate by \nMs. Lewinsky as well as the President's failure to provide the Senate \nwith a deposition, I have concluded that the statements made by \nPresident Clinton to Mr. Blumenthal are false. If the President had \nagreed to be deposed by the Senate, his testimony might have \nstrengthened the credibility of the statements that he had to Mr. \nBlumenthal. However, the credibility of such statements have no \nfoundation in the evidence presented to the Senate. As a result, I must \nconclude that President Clinton had a motive other than an interest in \nconveying the truth\n\n[[Page S1608]]\n\nwhen he made these statements to Mr. Blumenthal.\n  President Clinton has tried to argue that the President made these \nstatements to Mr. Blumenthal, not to obstruct justice, but merely to \nmislead him. However, when asked whether he knew that Sidney Blumenthal \nand John Podesta might be called into a grand jury, President Clinton \nresponded ``That's right.'' Therefore, I must conclude that President \nClinton lied to Sidney Blumenthal in order to plant false testimony on \na potential grand jury witness, a witness the President himself admits \nhe knew might be called.\n  John Podesta testified that President Clinton had told Mr. Podesta \nthat the President ``had never had sex with her [Ms. Lewinsky] in any \nway whatsoever.'' Mr. Podesta further testified that President Clinton \nelaborated that the President and Ms. Lewinsky ``had not engaged in \n[sexual activity that falls within the definition of sexual relations \nas President Clinton understood the term to be defined in the Paula \nJones case].'' As stated above, Mr. Clinton acknowledges that he knew \nthat Mr. Podesta might be called as a witness by the grand jury. As \nalso discussed above, it is my opinion, based on the evidence, that \nPresident Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky did engage in sexual activity that \nfalls within the definition of sexual relations as President Clinton \nunderstood the term to be defined in the Paula Jones case. As a result, \nMr. Clinton lied to Mr. Podesta. In addition, because President Clinton \nknew that Mr. Podesta might be called as a witness by the grand jury, I \nmust conclude that the President lied to Mr. Podesta, not simply to \nmislead him and his White House colleagues, but in order to plant false \ntestimony on a potential grand jury witness.\n\n\n                      high crimes and misdemeanors\n\n  Perjury before a Federal Grand Jury and Obstruction of Justice do \nrise to the level of being a ``high crime or misdemeanor'' that is the \nstandard set forth in the Constitution for impeachment. Indeed in \nrecent years the United States Senate has impeached two federal judges \nfor perjury. Where we not to remove the President for the same offense \nwe would be breaking established precedent.\n  Furthermore, would it be right to set a lower standard for the \nPresident than the judges he appoints? I think not. The President must \nbe held to the same standard, if not a higher one.\n  Perjury and obstruction of justice are crimes against the state. \nPerjury goes directly against the truth-finding function of the \njudicial branch of government. If the President can lie under oath, \nothers will plead the same defense, sacrificing the truth.\n  The President is the Chief Law Enforcement Officer in the land. He or \nshe should be the ultimate example of a law-abiding citizen, not one \nwho willfully and repeatedly violates the law when it serves his or her \nnarrow interest. The unlawful actions by the President will have the \nlong term effect of reducing compliance with the law by others if the \nPresident can get away with it.\n  The Constitution states that impeachment and removal is to occur when \n``the President, Vice President and all civil officers'' commit \n``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''\n  I find bribery and perjury to be offenses of the same nature. Both \nseek to thwart well established legal processes. Bribery seeks to \nproduce an outcome different from justice by obscuring our priorities. \nPerjury seeks to produce an outcome different from justice by obscuring \nthe truth.\n  Obstruction of justice committed by the President undermines the \nentire judicial system and is thus a crime against the nation falling \nclearly in the category of a ``high crime.''\n\n\n                          concluding comments\n\n  Whether or not the vote taken today is considered a victory for \nPresident Clinton, it will be, in many ways, a loss for America. We \nhave lost many things over the past few months: trust in public \nofficials, respect for the rule of law, confidence in the truth of the \nWhite House's public statements. But perhaps the most tragic loss has \nbeen the steady erosion of our societal standards.\n  It is hard to imagine that a generation or two ago, a majority of \nAmericans would have greeted news of Presidential crimes and cover-ups \nwith a shrug. We did not expect our leaders to be perfect, but we did \nexpect them to provide moral leadership, and to obey the laws they were \ncharged with upholding and executing. We expected Presidents to commit \nsins; but we would not allow them to commit crimes. We held the office \nof the Presidency, and the honor of the nation, in the highest esteem.\n  We looked to the leaders of our nation as examples to admire, rather \nthan avoid. Parents would point to the President of the United States \nand tell their son or daughter that if they worked hard and did right, \nthey might one day hold that office. That is not so today. Perhaps in \nthe future the admiration of that office can be restored.\n  Our loss is compounded by the manner of our response. In many \nquarters, the news of Presidential perjury and obstruction of justice \nhas been greeted with a shrug, if not a wink. We are no longer outraged \nby the outrageous. We have grown comfortable with presidential \nmisconduct, even as we prosecute, convict, and imprison the less \npowerful for the same crimes.\n  If we are to believe the media, much of our reluctance to enforce the \nlaws of our land springs from our material concerns. We have heard, \nfrom many quarters, the assertion that things are good in America, we \nare at peace, the stock market is doing well, so why rock the boat? Why \nshake things up?\n  We seem to have forgotten that all of our prosperity would be \nimpossible without the rule of law, and without a cultural \npredisposition to honor and uphold the law. Reducing the administration \nof justice to opinion polls debases our country. Putting pocketbook \nconcerns over standards of right and wrong impoverishes our culture. If \nwe do not sustain the moral and legal foundation on which our system of \ngovernment and our prosperity is based, both will surely and steadily \ndiminish.\n  The great southern writer Walker Percy once stated that his greatest \nfear for our future was that of ``seeing America, with all of her great \nstrength and beauty and freedom . . . . gradually subside into decay \nthrough default and be defeated . . . from within by weariness, \nboredom, cynicism, greed, and in the end, helplessness before its great \nproblems.''\n  I am optimistic about our future, but this point is an important one. \nAmerica is at a place in history where our great enemies have been \ndefeated. Our economy is strong, our incomes up, our expectations high. \nWe are the only remaining world superpower.\n  Our future looks bright. But our continued success is not a \nhistorical certainty. It will be determined by the character of our \nnation--by the condition of our culture, as much as our economy. The \nstandards we hold--for ourselves, and for our leaders--are a good \nindicator of what we soon shall be.\n  For all of the reasons described above, I have chose, with great \nsadness but firm resolve to vote for the conviction and removal of \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton as President of the United States of America.\n  Mr. BRYAN. We are about to embark upon a roll call vote that only one \nother Senate in the history of our Republic has been called upon to \ncast. It is a weighty decision. We have taken an oath that requires us \nto render ``impartial justice according to the Constitution and the \nlaws.'' By so doing each of us has undertaken a solemn obligation to be \nfair to the President, fair to the American people, and faithful to our \nconstitutional responsibility.\n  One hundred thirty one years ago, the 40th Congress faced a similar \ndecision. Then, as now, the Nation was divided. Then, as now, the \npassions of the day raged across the land. Then, as now, the critics of \nthe President were in the majority in the Senate. Confounding the \ncynics of that day, the Senate rose above itself by the slenderest of \nmargins, a single vote, and acquitted President Andrew Johnson. More \nthan a century later, that decision has stood the test of time.\n  The Senate's acquittal reaffirmed a basic constitutional doctrine \nthat the Executive branch, and the Legislative branch shall be separate \nand co-equal; and that the Executive Branch should not be subservient \nto the prevailing views of a Congressional majority.\n  How different the course of our constitutional history might have \nbeen had President Andrew Johnson been\n\n[[Page S1609]]\n\nconvicted. Our system of government today might be more like a \nparliamentary system undermining the independence of the chief \nexecutive.\n  Future Presidents may have been forced to operate within the \nomnipresent shadow of impeachment whenever a legislative majority was \nhostile to their views or policies. I think it is fair to conclude the \noffice of the Presidency would be a profoundly different one had Andrew \nJohnson been convicted. It is in that historical context we meet.\n  In this century, there have been five judicial impeachments that have \nreached the Senate. In each of those proceedings, the actions of the \nHouse and Senate were decided by a bipartisan vote, and all five judges \nwere convicted, and removed from office.\n  In the history of the Republic, there have been but two presidential \nimpeachments, that of Andrew Johnson and William Jefferson Clinton. \nEach Presidential impeachment, however, has come to the Senate under an \nominous cloud of partisanship.\n  The Constitution wisely imposes a heavy burden of proof upon the \nHouse of Representatives to convict and remove a duly elected \nPresident. And when that constitutional process is tainted by partisan \nactions, the Articles of Impeachment must be subjected to an additional \nmeasure of scrutiny.\n  The Constitution provides in Article II, Section 4 that ``The \nPresident . . . shall be removed from office on Impeachment for the \nConviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors.''\n  What constitutes impeachable conduct, as contemplated by the \nConstitution, is the central issue of this trial.\n  The Framers of the Constitution labored at some length to fashion an \nimpeachment article. As their guide, they looked to the English \nexperience in their parliamentary system. They followed that history in \ndeciding to involve both the House of Representatives and the Senate \ngiving them different roles--the former to charge and impeach, and the \nlatter to convict or acquit.\n  Unlike the British parliamentary system with its monarch, the Framers \ndecided impeachment would apply against its highest office holders, \nexpressly including the President. Further, the Framers determined that \nimpeachment would in and of itself be limited. Rather than including \ncapital punishment and other criminal penalties as a part \nof impeachment as Britain did, the Framers limited impeachment to the \nremoval of the individual from office upon conviction.\n\n  As the drafting of the Constitution's impeachment clause proceeded, \nthe drafters struggled with how to characterize the offenses for which \na president could be impeached, convicted, and removed from office. \nInitially, offenses such as ``malpractice'', ``neglect of duty'', and \n``corruption'' were considered. As the Constitutional Convention drew \nto a close, the Convention's Committee of Eleven proposed ``treason or \nbribery'' as the appropriate standard.\n  George Mason suggested the addition of ``maladministration'' due to \nhis concern that limiting the offenses to only treason or bribery would \nstill allow a president to commit ``many great and dangerous offences'' \nwhich would not be subject to impeachment. [The Records of the Federal \nConvention].\n  However, James Madison believe ``maladministration'' was ``. . . [s]o \nvague a term [it] will be equivalent to a tenure during [the] pleasure \nof the Senate.'' [The Records of the Federal Convention]. George Mason \nthen proposed the addition of ``high crimes and misdemeanors against \nthe State'', which the Committee on Style modified by deleting \n``against the State'' believing that language unnecessary.\n  Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Paper Number 65 argues that the \nSenate could convict and remove a President only for ``those offenses \nwhich proceed from the misconduct of public men, or in other words from \nthe abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which \nmay with peculiar propriety be denominated political, as they relate \nchiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.''\n  Nearly two centuries later, Charles Black explained in his \n``Impeachment Handbook'', the purpose of impeachment is to protect the \nnation, rather than to punish the individual holding the office of \npresident. Thus, the behavior at issue must reach a level of \nendangering the state.\n  The House voted to impeach President Clinton on two Articles; perjury \nbefore the Grand Jury, and obstruction of justice. Two other Articles \naccusing the President of perjury in a deposition in a civil case, and \nof abusing his power by not responding to the 81 requests for admission \nmade on November 5, 1998 in a manner the House desired were not \napproved.\n  Article I charging perjury is poorly and rather vaguely worded. \nNevertheless, it appears to contain 11 separate allegations. The House \nManagers in their presentation in Article II allege seven acts of \nPresidential misconduct constituting obstruction of justice.\n  The Office of Independent Counsel was authorized by the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States to conduct an investigation of the \nPresident's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Mr. Starr has 25 attorneys \nand 5 non-FBI investigators on his personal staff, and access to the \nvirtually unlimited resources of the FBI. The investigation continued \nfor eight months culminating in a record of over 60,000 pages of \nmaterials including sworn testimony from Grand Jury appearances, \ndepositions, and sworn statements.\n  That the relationship between the President and the Office of \nIndependent Counsel was a contentious one, is beyond dispute. Mr. Starr \nhas been as aggressive Special Prosecutor. Many believe that his \nprosecutorial zeal violated any reasonable standard of fairness. He has \nbeen no shrinking violet in his pursuit of the President.\n  Yet even Mr. Starr and his staff, after careful analysis, concluded \nthat 8 of the 11 allegations of perjury before the Grand Jury, and one \nof the allegations of obstruction of justice lacked sufficient \nprosecutorial merit to be submitted to the House. Certainly, it cannot \nbe contended that these allegations can sustain the burden of proof to \nestablish the President's guilt, or to rise to the level of impeachable \nconduct necessary to remove a duly elected president.\n  The Constitution's impeachment process was not created to mete out \npunishment against the individual serving as President. Rather, the \nimpeachment process is to protect the nation from a President who has \nbrought grave harm to the office and to the country. These are \ndistinctly different goals.\n  As is so often the case, the American people have a clear \nunderstanding of the circumstances that bring us together.\n  The President had an improper relationship in the White House with a \n22-year-old intern.\n  The President lied to his family, his staff and the American people \nin denying the existence of the relationship.\n  The President pursued a course of conduct to conceal his improper \nrelationship with the White House intern.\n  The President's conduct was wrong and it was immoral. It remains for \nus to determine the constitutional consequences, if any, to be attached \nto this conduct.\n  The House Managers rely heavily upon circumstantial evidence and draw \nfrom that evidence a series of inferences which lead them to conclude \nthat the President is guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice.\n  The President's counsel artfully attack the weaknesses in the \nManagers' case and assert that exculpatory direct evidence raises \nsufficient doubt under the law, and therefore, the President is \nentitled to be acquitted.\n  On this record, as one of the House prosecutors pointed out \nreasonable people can differ as to the conclusions they reach.\n  It is acknowledged that the House Managers have the burden of proof \nin establishing the President's guilt under legal definitions. Open to \nquestion is the standard of proof to be applied, a mere preponderance \nof the evidence as in a civil trial, clear and convincing evidence as \nin alleging fraudulent behavior, or beyond a reasonable doubt as in a \ncriminal case.\n  The House alleges that specific crimes have been committed, to wit \nperjury and obstruction of justice as defined in law. Under these \ncircumstances, I believe the appropriate standard is the criminal \nstandard--proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n[[Page S1610]]\n\n  But is it impeachable conduct? Does it rise to the constitutionally \nrequired standard of bribery, treason or other high crimes and \nmisdemeanors. I think not.\n  The President's conduct is boorish, indefensible, even reprehensible. \nIt does not threaten the Republic. It does not impact our national \nsecurity. It does not undermine or compromise our position of \nunchallenged leadership in international affairs.\n  Although I conclude that the evidence presented in this case does not \nreach the standard commanded by the Constitution to convict and remove \na President, it does not follow that we are precluded from registering \nour strong disapproval of the President's personal conduct.\n  There is a way. After our vote on these Articles of Impeachment, and \nassuming, as most believe, there are not the votes to convict the \nPresident--the Senate should proceed immediately to adopt a bipartisan \nresolution of censure.\n  It is important for us to do this. There are two reasons. First, the \nAmerican people need to hear from us in strong and unambiguous language \nthat the President's personal conduct is unacceptable and unworthy of \nthe President of the United States.\n  The record of these proceedings must also reflect that the acquittal \nof the President can in no way be construed as an exoneration of his \nconduct. A censure resolution should not be embarked upon lightly or \nfor political reasons, but it should be used in this case.\n  And finally, a response to the injunction that we have frequently \nheard over the past several weeks: that no man is above the law. That \nis a core value. It goes to the very essence of our beliefs as \nAmericans. No violence is done to this sacred principle by pursuing the \ncourse of action I have chosen.\n  For those who believe that the President is guilty of perjury and \nobstruction of justice--criminal offenses--there is a forum available \nfor that determination. It is our criminal justice system and William \nJefferson Clinton may be called to the bar of justice to respond to \nthese criminal charges--armed with no greater legal protection than \nthat accorded the most humble among us. And that is how it should be.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. When the impeachment trial began on January 7th, I took \nan oath to render ``impartial justice according to the Constitution and \nlaws: So help me God.'' This oath distinguishes impeachment from all my \nother responsibilities in the Senate. Although the Constitution \nrequires Senators to take an oath of office and gives the Senate \nnumerous powers and responsibilities, only the obligation to try \nimpeachments demands the swearing of a special, separate oath. While \nmany commentators have sought to mark this trial as a political event, \nthe oath leaves room only for impartial justice. I interpret this oath \nas requiring that I decide this case based on the evidence in the \nrecord, the arguments of the parties, and the applicable law--and on no \nother basis.\n  If I were to look beyond the evidence in the case, to public opinion \npolls, then a path to a decision would be clear. A large majority of \nAmericans, for example, believe that the President committed perjury, \nbut do not think that he should be removed from office. I am sure that \nthose surveyed considered a variety of factors and did not limit \nthemselves to the Senate record. More than anything else, these poll \nresults reflect the American people's capacity for forgiveness. I share \nthis desire to forgive the President for his admitted mistakes. \nHowever, the forgiveness we grant in our capacity as individuals must \nbe distinguished from the government's responsibility to remedy \nwrongdoing. We routinely ask jurors to sentence defendants in \naccordance with the law, even though they may forgive the defendant. \nThat is the same responsibility that the Constitution and my oath \nimpose on me in this proceeding.\n  On the other hand, if I were simply to vote my conscience as to \nwhether I believe the President's continued service is good for our \ncountry and our culture, that is a clear path as well. From the very \noutset, I have stated consistently that if the allegations were true \nconcerning the President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, then the \nPresident has disgraced himself and his office, and should resign. In \nmy view, the confessed facts of the President's conduct in the Oval \nOffice make his continued presence an obstacle to the healing our \nculture. The honorable course would be for the President to resign, to \nallow the nation to heal from the wounds he has inflicted.\n  My oath, however, forecloses either of these paths, and instead \nforces me to undertake the far more difficult task of sifting through \nthe record, weighing evidence, determining credibility and reaching a \nfinal, impartial judgment on the articles of impeachment. As a result, \nI cannot explain my judgment by resort to any grand principles or by \nbroad statements about my opinion of the President as a leader. I can \nonly explain my vote through a detailed examination of the articles of \nimpeachment, the evidence presented and the relevant law.\n\n\n                     article i--grand jury perjury\n\n  The first article of impeachment charges President Clinton with \ncommitting perjury before the grand jury when he testified on four \nsubjects. Attorneys for the President complain that the House Managers \nfailed to specify the particular grand jury statements of the President \nthat constituted perjury. I agree that the President deserves \nsufficient specificity to provide him the basis for a defense. However, \nduring the course of the House Managers' presentation it became clear \nthat the perjury allegations focused on a handful of specific \nstatements the President made to the grand jury.\n\n\n       the president and ms. currie--refreshing memory with lies\n\n  Perhaps the single most obvious instance of a false statement by the \nPresident stems from his explanation of his conversations with Ms. \nBetty Currie in the days immediately following his deposition testimony \nin Jones v. Clinton. Ms. Currie told the grand jury that on the evening \nof his deposition the President called her and requested that she make \na rare Sunday appearance at the White House. When she arrived, the \nPresident called her in and confronted her with an unusual series of \nstatements and questions, including: ``Monica came on to me, and I \nnever touched her, right?''; ``You were always there when Monica was \nthere, right?''; and ``I was never really alone with Monica, right?'' \n(See Sen. Rec. Vol. IV, part 1 at 559-60; Ms. Currie 1/27/98 GJ at 70-\n75.). When the President was asked to explain this conversation to the \ngrand jury, he stated that he was ``trying to refresh [his] memory \nabout what the facts were.'' (See Sen. Rec. Vol. III, part 1 at 651; \nMr. Clinton 8/17/98 GJ, at 131.) (See also Sen. Rec. Vol. III, part 1 \nat 593-94; Mr. Clinton 8/17/98 GJ, at 141-42 (Q: ``[Y]ou are saying \nthat your only interest in speaking with Ms. Currie in the days after \nyour deposition was to refresh your own recollection? A: Yes.''))\n  This statement is demonstrably false. A person cannot refresh his or \nher memory by repeating lies. The President's leading questions were \nfalsehoods. The President knew that he had been alone with Ms. \nLewinsky, knew that they had been together outside of Ms. Currie's \npresence, and knew that he had touched Ms. Lewinsky. Repeating these \nfalsehoods to Ms. Currie could not have refreshed the President's \nmemory ``about what the facts were.''\n\n  What is more, Ms. Currie testified that the President reviewed these \nsame statements and questions with her again two or three days later. \n(See Sen. Rec. Vol. IV, part 1, at 560-61; Ms. Currie 1/27/98 GJ, at \n80-82.) The President does not have specific memory of this second \nconversation, but does not dispute Ms. Currie's recollection. If the \nPresident were trying to refresh his memory, he would not go through \nthe same questions again two or three days later. However, if the \nPresident were trying to coach Ms. Currie's testimony and ensure that \nher version of events was consistent with his false deposition \ntestimony, then rehearsing these questions and answers a second time \nwould be helpful. Based on all the evidence, I have concluded beyond a \nreasonable doubt that the President's testimony concerning these \nconversations with Ms. Currie was false. The evidence clearly shows \nthat the President gave false testimony to the grand jury in order to \ncover up his illegal effort to influence Ms. Currie's testimony.\n\n\n                   the president's lies to his aides\n\n  Another clear example of a false statement by the President in his \ngrand\n\n[[Page S1611]]\n\njury testimony is his claim that he was truthful with his aides in \ndiscussing his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The exact nature of what \nthe President said to his aides in the immediate aftermath of his \ndeposition was of interest to the grand jury as part of its \ninvestigation of whether the President obstructed justice. When asked \nabout these conversations, the President told the grand jury that ``I \nsaid to them things that were true about this relationship.'' (See Sen. \nRec. Vol. III, part 1, at 558; Mr. Clinton 8/17/98 GJ, at 106.)\n  The testimony of the President's own aides, however, makes it clear \nthat the President was not truthful with his aides. He did not than \nmislead them, he lied to them. For example, one presidential aide, John \nPodesta, testified that the President told him that he did not have sex \nwith Ms. Lewinsky ``in any way whatsoever'' and provided additional, \nmore detailed denials concerning the relationship. (See Sen. Rec. Vol. \nIV, part 3, at 3311; Mr. Podesta 6/16/98 GJ, at 92.) Sidney Blumenthal, \nanother presidential aide, testified that the President told him that \n``Ms. Lewinsky came at me and made a sexual demand on me,'' that he \n``rebuffed her,'' and that Ms. Lewinsky ``was known as the stalker.'' \n(See Sen. Rec. Vol. IV, part 1, at 185; Mr. Blumenthal 6/4/98 GJ, at \n49.) In his Senate deposition Mr. Blumenthal unequivocally stated that \nhe now believes the President lied to him. (See Congressional Record \nS1249; Mr. Blumenthal 2/3/99 Dep.) As the President's closest aides \nhave conceded, the President was not truthful with them. In reviewing \nall the evidence, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the \nPresident was not truthful with his aides and that his grand jury \ntestimony concerning these discussions was false.\n\n\n   the president's testimony about his relationship with ms. lewinsky\n\n  The first example included in the grand jury perjury article approved \nby the House focuses on the President's grand jury testimony concerning \n``the nature and details of his relationship with'' Ms. Lewinsky. His \ntestimony on this matter also appears to be false.\n  Although some of the detailed testimony underlying this example of \nperjury is nothing short of sordid, the President's lack of credibility \non this matter is straightforward. For a number of months last year, \nMs. Lewinsky was on record as having told federal investigators that \nshe and the President had engaged in a sexual relationship. The \nPresident publicly and repeatedly denied the truth of these \nallegations. It was a classic ``he said, she said'' situation. Then \nphysical evidence of a sexual relationship between the President and \nMs. Lewinsky was discovered. After this physical evidence came to \nlight, it ceased to be a ``he said, she said'' situation. He changed \nhis story and admitted an ``inappropriate intimate relationship'' to a \nfederal grand jury, while she was vindicated.\n  However, the President declined to follow his oath to tell the grand \njury the whole truth and admit the true nature of the relationship. \nInstead, the President attempted to walk an impossibly fine line, \nadmitting to a relationship which involved sufficient contact to \nexplain the physical evidence but insufficient contact to make the \nPresident's earlier deposition statements about the relationship \nperjurious. The President's testimony on this matter, therefore, was at \nthe heart of the grand jury's investigation into whether the President \ncommitted perjury in the Jones case. The physical evidence strongly \nsuggested that the President had committed perjury in his deposition, \nand this grand jury testimony was the basis for his defense. The \nPresident's testimony flatly contradicts Ms. Lewinsky's testimony \nconcerning the nature and details of their relationship. Ms. \nLewinsky's testimony provides a much more plausible explanation of the \nphysical evidence, and makes clear that the President perjured himself \nin his sworn deposition testimony.\n\n  With respect to the nature and details of their relationship we are \nonce again present with a ``he said, she said'' situation. But now \nthere are two differences. First, the President's implausibly contorted \nversion of events appears to be tailored precisely to avoid admitting a \nprior perjury. Second, we have the benefit of a prior ``he said, she \nsaid'' dispute between the same two people, in which subsequent \nevidence conclusively proved that she was telling the truth and he was \nlying. Under these circumstances, I am convinced beyond a reasonable \ndoubt that the President lied about ``the nature and details of his \nrelationship'' with Ms. Lewinsky.\n\n\n          the president's testimony concerning his deposition\n\n  The House included two other examples of grand jury perjury in the \nfirst article of impeachment. The article alleges that the President \nlied to the grand jury concerning both his prior, perjurious deposition \ntestimony and whether he was paying attention to his lawyer's \nstatements during that same deposition. While there is considerable \nevidence that supports the notion that the President did lie to the \ngrand jury regarding these two matters, I am not convinced beyond a \nreasonable doubt that the President's statements on these matters \nconstitute perjury.\n  The President began his grand jury testimony with the assertion that \nhe was truthful in his deposition testimony. However, later in his \ngrand jury testimony, the President clarified and corrected much of his \nfalse and misleading deposition testimony. As a result, it is clear \nthat the President's claim that his deposition testimony was truthful \nwas itself a false statement. However, it is equally clear that this \nfalse statement cannot form the basis for a perjury conviction for two \nreasons. First, when viewed in its entirety, the President's grand jury \ntestimony makes this one statement immaterial. It is the equivalent of \nthe statement of a murderer who begins his confession with the \nstatement that ``I didn't do anything wrong.'' Second, in light of the \nHouse's decision to reject a separate article focusing on deposition \nperjury, I am uncomfortable allowing this one line to be used as a \nmeans to ``backdoor'' allegations that the President lied in that \nforum.\n  The allegation that the President lied to the grand jury when he \ntestified that he was not paying attention to his lawyer when he used \nMs. Lewinsky's affidavit to deny that there was any sexual relationship \nbetween the President and Ms. Lewinsky is a closer matter. During the \nPresident's deposition in the Jones case, the President's lawyer, Mr. \nBennett, argued to the Court that Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit demonstrated \n``there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form'' \nbetween the President and Ms. Lewinsky. (See Sen. Rec. Vol. XIV, at \n23).\n  The President allowed his lawyer to make this representation to the \nCourt, even though the President knew that representation and the \nunderlying affidavit were both false. When confronted with these facts \nbefore the grand jury, the President attempted to excuse his behavior \nwith the claim that he was not paying attention and this ``whole \nargument just passed me by.'' (See Sen. Rec. Vol. III, part 1, at 481; \nMr. Clinton 8/17/98 GJ, at 29). The available evidence and common sense \nsuggest that the President was paying attention. I have reviewed the \nvideotape of the President's deposition, and he appears to be paying \nattention to his lawyer before, during and after his lawyer's \nrepresentation. Common sense suggests the President was paying \nattention because his lawyer made this statement in an effort to keep \nthe President from answering a question the Jones lawyer had just \ndirected to him. The President would have needed to pay attention to \nthe question in order to answer it, and it is hard to believe he would \nhave tuned out his lawyer's objection to the question.\n  What is more, in light of the President's admitted fears about the \ntrue nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky becoming public, it \nis implausible that he would have not paid attention to his lawyer's \nefforts to use the Lewinsky affidavit to prevent questioning about \ntheir relationship. The President does not dispute that he suggested \nthat Ms. Lewinsky file an affidavit in a December 17, 1997, telephone \ncall. The President's stated objective in suggesting the filing of an \naffidavit was to keep Ms. Lewinsky from becoming an issue in the Jones \nlitigation. The notion that the President would not pay attention to \nhis lawyer's efforts to have that suggestion bear fruit strains \ncredulity. Finally, it is worth noting that immediately following Mr. \nBennett's representation, the presiding\n\n[[Page S1612]]\n\njudge cautioned Mr. Bennett against coaching the witness. That caution \nwould not have been necessary had the witness, Mr. Clinton, not been \npaying attention to his lawyer's words.\n  If I were applying a preponderance of the evidence or a clear and \nconvincing evidence standard, I certainly would reject the President's \nclaim that the ``whole argument just passed me by.'' However, applying \na beyond a reasonable doubt standard, I have reached a different \nconclusion. The problem for me is that the President's statement \nconcerns his own mental state. Although the evidence and common sense \nsuggest the President was paying attention to Mr. Bennett, I have not \nbeen able to remove all doubts from my mind on this score.\n\n\n                The Legal Elements Of Grand Jury Perjury\n\n  On the other hand, I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the \nPresident made false statements to the grand jury concerning his \nconversation with Ms. Currie, his statements to other aides, and the \nnature and details of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Moreover, in \nlight of the legal standards for grand jury perjury, I am convinced the \nPresident's conduct satisfies every element of felony perjury under \nsection 1623 of the federal criminal code, Title 18. There are five \nelements to the crime of grand jury perjury. To constitute perjury a \nstatement must be made under oath, before a grand jury, with intent, \nand the statement must be both false and material.\n  I have already discussed why I have concluded that these statements \nwere false, and there is no question that they were made under oath to \na grand jury. The only two remaining elements are intent and \nmateriality. Neither of these standards is difficult to satisfy in the \ncontext of grand jury perjury. Congress passed a special statute, \nsection 1623, to make it easier to prosecute grand jury perjury out of \na recognition that grand jury perjury is a more serious threat to the \nadministration of justice than other perjuries. As a result, the intent \nrequirement is not demanding--the defendant need only make the \nstatement with knowledge of its falsity. As the well-respected American \nCriminal Law Review published by Georgetown University concludes: \n``Section 1623, unlike 1621 [the general perjury statute], does not \nrequire proof that the allegedly false testimony was submitted \nwillfully. Rather, it requires that such testimony was knowingly stated \nor subscribed. This requirement is ordinarily satisfied by proof that \nthe defendant knew his testimony was false at the time he provided \nit.''\n  The one thing that emerges from the presentations made by both the \nWhite House and the House Managers is that the President made his grand \njury statements with a great deal of forethought and precision. The \nPresident's false statements did not result from inadvertence or \nconfusion. The President knew these statements were false. For example, \nhe knew full well that his conversation with Ms. Currie was not \ndesigned to refresh his memory.\n  Likewise, the materiality standard is easily satisfied in this case. \nCourts are generally quick to find grand jury perjury to be material in \ndeference to the broad investigatory authority of a federal grand jury. \nAs the Second Circuit observed in United States v. Kross, 14 F.3d 751, \n754 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 828 (1994): ``Because the grand \njury's function is investigative, materiality in that context is \nbroadly construed.'' The grand jury in this case was investigating \nwhether the President committed perjury in his Jones deposition or \nobstructed justice in the Jones lawsuit. Specifically, the grand jury \nwas concerned that the President may have lied in denying a sexual \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky and obstructed justice by coaching Ms. \nCurrie and his other aides. Therefore, the President's grand jury \ntestimony concerning what he said to his aides and the nature of his \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky was directly relevant to the grand \njury's investigation. The President's statements were not just \nmaterial--they were at the heart of the grand jury's inquiry.\n\n\n                     The President's Legal Defenses\n\n  Lawyers for the President raised a number of legal smoke screens in \nhis defense that do not change the ultimate conclusion that the \nPresident committed perjury. For example, they emphasize the so-called \nBronston defense, in which a misleading statement does not constitute \nperjury if it is technically true. However, the Bronston defense \nprovides no defense to a statement that is literally false. As United \nStates Supreme Court Justice Breyer, while still on the First Circuit, \nobserved: ``The Bronston Court held only that a defendant cannot be \nconvicted of perjury for true but misleading statements, not that a \ndefendant is immune from prosecution for perjury whenever some \nambiguity can be found by an implausibly strained reading of the \nquestions he is asked.'' United States v. Doherty, 867 F.2d 47,69 (1st \nCir.), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 918 (1989).\n  Likewise, the White House has attempted to rely on the two-witness \nrule--i.e., the notion that a perjury prosecution cannot rest on an \noath versus an oath. That rule of law would not apply here if it were a \ncorrect statement of the law because there is ample corroborating \nevidence. But the truth of the matter is that section 1623 expressly \nrejects the two-witness rule, stating that: ``it shall not be necessary \nthat such proof be made by any particular number of witnesses.'' As the \nAmerican Criminal Law Review puts it: ``the obvious purpose of this \nlanguage [is] to prevent the application of the two-witness rule in \nsection 1623 prosecutions.'' That view is supported by the Supreme \nCourt's analysis of the purpose of section 1623 in Dunn v. United \nStates, 442 U.S. 100, 108 & n.6 (1979).\n\n  In the end, the White House's legal arguments cannot obscure the fact \nthat the President committed perjury in his grand jury testimony. The \nHouse Managers successfully carried their burden. They proved the facts \nunderlying the first article of impeachment beyond a reasonable doubt, \nand the evidence satisfied every element of proof for grand jury \nperjury.\n\n\n        article ii--obstruction of justice and witness tampering\n\n  The second article of impeachment approved by the House alleges that \nthe President obstructed justice and provides seven examples of \nspecific conduct that obstructed justice either in the Jones litigation \nor in the federal grand jury's investigation. I have examined each of \nthese examples in detail and will share my analysis. As with perjury, \nperhaps the clearest example of obstruction of justice stems from the \nPresident's conversation with Ms. Currie the day after his sworn \ndeposition testimony in the Jones case.\n\n\n                    coaching ms. currie's testimony\n\n  As noted in the discussion of perjury, the President called in Ms. \nCurrie the day after his sworn deposition testimony and confronted her \nwith a series of questions and answers, such as ``Monica came on to me, \nand I never touched her, right?''; ``You were always there when Monica \nwas there, right?'' and ``I was never really alone with Monica, \nright?''; (See Sen. Rec. Vol. IV, part 1, at 559-560; Ms. Currie 1/27/\n98 GJ, at 70-75.). According to Ms. Currie, the President repeated this \nrehearsal of questions and answers two or three days later. As \ndiscussed earlier, the President's explanation for this conversation--\nthat he was trying to refresh his memory--is simply not credible. The \ntrue purpose of these conversations becomes clear in light of the \nPresident's sworn deposition testimony. On several occasions during his \ndeposition, the President invoked Ms. Currie's name in answering \nquestions concerning his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Indeed, at one \npoint, the President specifically directed the Jones' lawyers to ``ask \nBetty whether Ms. Lewinsky was alone with him or with Ms. Currie \nbetween the hours of midnight and 6:00 a.m. (See Sen. Rec. Vol. XIV, at \n35).\n  In other words, during his deposition, the President attempted to use \nMs. Currie as an alibi witness to deny that he had been alone with Ms. \nLewinsky. It is telling in this regard that in his conversation with \nMs. Currie the President sought Ms. Currie's agreement that ``he was \nnever alone with her, right?'' This was the exact point as to which the \nPresident directed the Jones' lawyers to ``ask Betty.'' In short, \nhaving invoked Ms. Currie as an alibi in his deposition, the President \nwasted no time in contacting Ms. Currie and making sure her story would \nsquare with the President's sworn testimony. Indeed, the President \ncontacted Ms. Currie and explained that Ms. Lewinsky's name had come up \nduring the deposition despite Judge Wright's\n\n[[Page S1613]]\n\nadmonition not to discuss the deposition with anyone other than his \nlawyers.\n  There is simply no innocent explanation for this conversation with \nMs. Currie. It was a violation of Judge Wright's order. It was not an \nattempt to refresh the President's memory. Instead, the evidence shows \nbeyond a reasonable doubt that this was an unlawful attempt to obstruct \njustice by altering Ms. Currie's testimony in the Jones case.\n\n\n          the president, ms. lewinsky, and the false affidavit\n\n  This coaching of Ms. Currie is not the only example of obstruction of \njustice by the President. For instance, the first example cited in the \nobstruction of justice article alleges that the President corruptly \nencouraged Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the Jones \nlitigation. The President does not dispute that he called Ms. Lewinsky \nat 2:30 a.m. in the morning on December 17, 1997, to inform her that \nshe was on the witness list in the Jones case. The President likewise \ndoes not dispute that he hoped Ms. Lewinsky would not have to testify \nand suggested to her that she could file an affidavit to reduce her \nchances of being deposed or called to testify in the Jones proceeding. \n(See Sen. Rec. Vol. III, part 1, at 567-73; Mr. Clinton 8/17/98 GJ, at \n115-121). The President's defense is that although he wanted Ms. \nLewinsky to file an affidavit to avoid testifying, he did not want her \nto file a false affidavit. As the President put in his grand jury \ntestimony, ``I did hope she'd be able to get out of testifying on an \naffidavit? Absolutely. Did I want her to execute a false affidavit? No, \nI did not.'' (See Sen. Rec. Vol. III, part 1, at 571; Mr. Clinton 8/17/\n98 GJ, at 119). This claim that an affidavit could be both truthful and \nresult in a reduced chance of Ms. Lewinsky testifying is critical to \nthe President's defense because it is a crime to corruptly persuade a \npotential witness to delay or prevent their testimony.\n\n  The fundamental problem with the President's defense is that a \ntruthful affidavit that disclosed the nature of his relationship with \nMs. Lewinsky would have been inconsistent with the President's stated \ngoal of reducing her chances of being called to testify. A truthful \naffidavit would have guaranteed that Ms. Lewinsky would have been \ncalled as a witness. It is folly to suggest that an affidavit that \nadmitted the relationship but emphasized its consensual nature could \nhave prevented Ms. Lewinsky from being called. Judge Wright had already \napproved discovery of government employees involved in relationships \nwith the President without regard to whether they were consensual.\n  Additional evidence that the President encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to \nfile a false affidavit comes from the President's revival of previously \ndeveloped cover stories in this same 2:30 a.m. telephone conversation. \nSpecifically, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President reminded her \nthat ``you can always say you were going to see Betty or that you were \nbringing me letters?'' (See Sen. Rec. Vol. III, part 1, at 843; Ms. \nLewinsky 8/6/98 GJ, at 123). To be sure, Ms. Lewinsky has testified \nthat the ideas of filing an affidavit and using the cover stories were \nnot explicitly linked in her mind. However, there must have been some \nimplicit link, in fact, because Ms. Lewinsky's draft affidavit featured \none of the cover stories. Although it was dropped in the editing \nprocess to eliminate any suggestion that the President and Ms. Lewinsky \nwere alone, the draft affidavit suggested that Ms. Lewinsky had brought \nthe President papers.\n  In addition, the notions that the President wanted Ms. Lewinsky to \nfile a false affidavit and that only a false affidavit and that only a \nfalse affidavit would have the desired effect of keeping Ms. Lewinsky \nfrom being called as a witness are supported by the fact that the filed \naffidavit was false. The affidavit Ms. Lewinsky filed was false, in the \nfollowing particulars: (1) it stated that Ms. Lewinsky did not \n``possess any information that could possible be relevant to the \nallegations made by Paula Jones . . .'', (2) it stated that on the \noccasions on which Ms. Lewinsky saw the President after she left \nemployment at the White House in April 1996 were official receptions \nand formal functions related to her job, and that ``there were other \npeople present on those occasions,'' and (3) it stated that--contrary \nto the President's admission before the grand jury that he and Ms. \nLewinsky had an inappropriate intimate relationship--``the President . \n. . always behaved appropriately in my presence.'' (See Sen. Rec. Vol. \nIII, part 1, at 1235). Moreover, any doubt about the falsity of Ms. \nLewinsky's affidavit is removed by her decision to enter into an \nimmunity agreement to prevent her prosecution for perjury with respect \nto the affidavit.\n  Finally, the President's claim that he did not want Ms. Lewinsky to \nfile a false affidavit is belied by the fact that the President allowed \nhis attorney to use the false affidavit in an effort to keep the Jones \nlawyers from questioning him about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. \nThe President's attorney, Mr. Bennett, relying on the Lewinsky \naffidavit, represented to the Court that ``there is absolutely no sex \nof any kind in any manner, shape or form, with President Clinton.'' \n(See Sen. Rec. Vol. XIV, at 23). Mr. Bennett expressly told the court \nthat the President was ``fully aware of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit.'' \n(See Sen. Rec. Vol. XIV, at 23). It is difficult to credit the \nPresident's claim that he did not want Ms. Lewinsky to file a false \naffidavit when he allowed his lawyer to use a false affidavit--of which \nhe was ``fully aware''--to keep him from being questioned about Ms. \nLewinsky.\n  The House has alleged that the President's decision to allow Mr. \nBennett to use this affidavit--knowing it to be false--was an \nadditional example of obstruction of justice. I am not convinced that \nthe President's failure to correct his attorney's representation to the \nCourt amounts to an obstruction of justice. However, the President's \nactions in allowing his attorney to use a false affidavit to his \nlitigation advantage undermines his claim that he never wanted Ms. \nLewinsky to file a false affidavit. When all the evidence is \nconsidered, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the President \nwanted Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit.\n\n\n                           the cover stories\n\n  The second example cited by the House in its obstruction of justice \narticle was the President's suggestion that Ms. Lewinsky could use \ncover stories to disguise the true nature of their relationship from \nthe Jones lawyers. These cover stories, of course, were used by the \nPresident and Ms. Lewinsky long before her name appeared on the witness \nlist in the Jones litigation. As a result, the cover stories--that she \nwas visiting Ms. Currie or bringing the President papers--were \ninstantly familiar to Ms. Lewinsky. But even though these cover stories \nwere not criminal--only deceptive--in their origins, the President's \nrevival of these cover stories after Ms. Lewinsky became a witness in a \ncivil suit against the President stands on a very different footing.\n\n  The President's reiteration of the cover stories in the same \nconversation that he told her she was on the witness list is evidence \nof an effort to alter her testimony. As demonstrated above, Ms. \nLewinsky included one of the cover stories in her false draft \naffidavit. Although the President emphasizes that the cover stories had \nan element of truth to them, that claim is not a defense to a witness \ntampering or obstruction of justice charge. For the federal witness \ntampering statute it is enough that the President attempted to \ninfluence Ms. Lewinsky's testimony through corrupt or misleading \nconduct, see 18 U.S.C. 1512, and for obstruction of justice it is \nenough that the President endeavored to influence the due \nadministration of justice, see 18 U.S.C. 1503. As a result, the \nPresident's revival of the cover stories constituted obstruction of \njustice. His actions obstructed the true course of justice and denied \nan American citizen a fair hearing of her claim.\n\n\n                           The Gift Exchange\n\n  The third example of obstruction of justice cited in the House \narticle concerns the efforts to conceal the President's gifts to Ms. \nLewinsky from the Jones lawyers. The House alleges that the President \norchestrated a scheme by which Ms. Lewinsky concealed the gifts from \nthe Jones lawyers by conveying them to Ms. Currie. In defending against \nthis charge, the President must overcome the undisputed fact that the \ngifts sought by the Jones lawyers ended up beneath the President's \npersonal secretary's bed.\n\n[[Page S1614]]\n\n  These gifts clearly were relevant evidence in the Jones litigation. \nThe subpoena served on Ms. Lewinsky required the production of ``each \nand every gift including but not limited to, any and all dresses, \naccessories, and jewelry, and/or hat pins given to you by, or on behalf \nof, Defendant Clinton.'' (See Sen. Rec. Vol. III, part 2, at 2704.) Ms. \nLewinsky discussed this subpoena with the President on December 28, \n1997, and both expressed their concern that the subpoena covered the \nhat pin. Ms. Lewinsky testified that when the subject of what to do \nwith the gifts came up the President responded: ``I don't know'' or \n``let me think about it.'' (See Sen. Rec. Vol. III, part 1, at 872; Ms. \nLewinsky 8/6/98 GJ, at 152.) The President, by contrast, told the grand \njury that he instructed Ms. Lewinsky that if the Jones' lawyers ``asked \nfor the gifts, [Ms. Lewinsky would] have to give them whatever she had, \nthat that's what the law was.'' (See Sen. Rec. Vol. III, part 1, at \n495; Mr. Clinton 8/17/98 GJ, at 43.)\n  Ms. Lewinsky left the White House and returned home only to receive a \ncall in which Ms. Currie told her, ``I understand that you have \nsomething to give me'' or ``the President said you have something to \ngive me.'' (See Sen. Rec. Vol. III, part 1, at 874; Ms. Lewinsky 8/6/98 \nGJ, at 154-55.) Ms. Currie does not recall making this call, and \ninstead suggests that Ms. Lewinsky initiated the gift exchange. It is \nuncontroverted, however, that Ms. Currie went to Ms. Lewinsky's \napartment to pick up the gifts and that those gifts were stored under \nMs. Currie's bed. The net result of these events is that the gifts that \nevidenced a relationship the President was trying to conceal in \nlitigation against him were kept from the Jones lawyers. This net \nresult makes the President's sworn testimony that he directed Ms. \nLewinsky to turn over the gifts difficult to credit. It is difficult to \nbelieve that Ms. Lewinsky would disregard the President's advice on \nthis issue.\n  This evidence makes it more likely than not than the President \nobstructed justice by orchestrating the concealment of the gifts. \nHowever, to prove obstruction of justice, the House must show that the \nPresident directed Ms. Currie to pick up the gifts. That is the missing \nlink in the House's case. Although that is the most likely explanation \nfor the concealment of the gifts, both parties to that conversation--\nMs. Currie and the President--deny that such a discussion took place. \nAs a result, there is a reasonable doubt in my mind as to whether the \nPresident obstructed justice by concealing the gifts, and I find this \nissue in his favor.\n\n\n                             The Job Search\n\n  The next example of obstruction cited by the House is the job search. \nThe evidence is clear that the President asked Vernon Jordan to help \nMs. Lewinsky find a job in New York City. Mr. Jordan was unequivocal \nthat he, not Ms. Lewinsky, was running the job search, and that he was \nfinding Ms. Lewinsky a job at the ``behest'' of the President. (See \nCong. Rec. S1245; Mr. Jordan Dep. 2/2/99). This word choice is telling. \nThe Dictionary defines ``behest'' as ``an authoritative order,'' or \nsecondarily as ``an urgent prompting,'' and suggests ``command'' as a \nsynonym. Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (Tenth Edition 1993) \np. 103.\n\n  The only remaining question is whether the President directed Mr. \nJordan to find Ms. Lewinsky a job in order to get Ms. Lewinsky to \n``withhold testimony, or withhold a record, document or other object, \nfrom an official proceeding,'' or for some other purpose. In evaluating \nthis issue, the President's past failure to provide job assistance to \nMs. Lewinsky is relevant. Since Ms. Lewinsky left the White House in \nApril 1996, she was anxious to get back and enlisted the President's \nsupport. He never helped her return to the White House. Eventually, Ms. \nLewinsky despaired of ever receiving any job assistance from the \nPresident to help her return to the White House and turned her sights \nto a job in New York. Once again, the President's level of job \nassistance was underwhelming until Ms. Lewinsky's name appeared on the \nwitness list in the Jones case. At that point, Mr. Jordan, at the \n``behest'' of the President, put the job search into full gear.\n  However, Mr. Jordan's involvement with Ms. Lewinsky was not limited \nto finding her a job. He also found her a lawyer, a lawyer who oversaw \nthe filing of an affidavit that turned out to be false. The same \naffidavit the President suggested Ms. Lewinsky could file in their late \nnight telephone call. The same affidavit that the President's lawyer \nattempted to use to keep the Jones lawyers from questioning the \nPresident about Ms. Lewinsky.\n  Mr. Jordan also shared a breakfast with Ms. Lewinsky in which they \ndiscussed draft notes between Ms. Lewinsky and the President. Mr. \nJordan initially denied that this breakfast meeting had taken place. \nHowever, when confronted with a receipt for breakfast, Mr. Jordan \nconceded the meeting took place and that the subject of the notes came \nup. Ms. Lewinsky testified that Mr. Jordan told her to make sure that \nthose incriminating notes were destroyed. Mr. Jordan denies that he \ngave her that advice. Ms. Lewinsky's testimony on this subject is \ncertainly entitled to great weight because she has consistently \nremembered the breakfast and what transpired, while Mr. Jordan \npreviously denied that the breakfast had occurred. But this conflict in \nthe testimony need not be resolved. Mr. Jordan is not on trial. The \nPresident is, and the fact that the person he designated to get Ms. \nLewinsky a job was also discussing incriminating notes relevant to the \nJones litigation and finding her a lawyer to file an affidavit in that \ncase undermine the President's claim that the job search and the Jones \nlitigation were unrelated.\n  Although Ms. Lewinsky has testified that the President never \nexpressly conditioned her job assistance on her continued cooperation \nin the Jones litigation, her conduct shows an implicit connection \nbetween the job search and the Jones litigation. When she received a \nsubpoena from the Jones lawyers she went to her job counselor. When she \nhad concerns about what to do with incriminating notes, she discussed \nthe matter with her job counselor.\n  The evidence demonstrates that the motivation for the job search was \nnot to enhance Ms. Lewinsky's career or to find her a ``dream job.'' \nThe President had the opportunity to give her a ``dream job'' at the \nWhite House and declined. Instead, the evidence shows beyond a \nreasonable doubt that the job search was intimately tied to the Jones \nlitigation and designed to ensure Ms. Lewinsky's continuing \ncooperation.\n\n\n                Mr. Bennett's Use Of The False Affidavit\n\n  The next example of obstruction of justice is the President's \ndecision to stand mute while his attorney used an affidavit the \nPresident knew to be false to make representations to a federal judge \nthat the President knew to be false. As I have noted, I do not think \nthe President's act of omission constitutes a separate act of \nobstruction. However, I do think the President's failure to object to \nthe use of this false affidavit sheds light on many of the President's \nacts of commission that do constitute obstruction of justice and \nwitness tampering, such as his suggestion that Ms. Lewinsky file an \naffidavit to avoid testifying in the Jones case.\n\n\n                 Influencing The Testimony Of His Aides\n\n  The final example of obstruction cited by the House involves the \nPresident's false statements to aides who were potential grand jury \nwitnesses. Most of the evidence on this point is not in dispute. The \nPresident insisted before the grand jury that he was truthful with his \naides. However, the President's own aides now admit that he lied to \nthem. There is no dispute that those lies were repeated to the grand \njury. The only remaining question is whether the President told these \nlies to his aides with the expectation that they would resurface in the \ngrand jury.\n\n  The White House's principal defense on this point is that the \nPresident's lies to his aides were no different than the lies he had \ntold the entire American people. This is a strange defense. \nEssentially, it attempts to make a virtue out of the fact that the \nPresident lied to every American, without respect to whether they were \npotential witnesses. The legal point appears to be that the President's \naides could not obstruct the due administration of justice because the \ngrand jurors already were exposed to the President's false denials.\n  There are several problems with this argument, not the least of which \nis that it is based on a false premise. The President did not merely \nrepeat the same denials he made to the public at\n\n[[Page S1615]]\n\nlarge. The President's denials to his aides were embellished and \nsubstantially more detailed. The President did not tell the American \npeople that Ms. Lewinsky was a stalker or categorically state that \nthere was no sex ``in any way whatsoever,'' though he labored hard to \nleave that false misimpression. He did share these details with his \naides, and they repeated them to the grand jury. These details, \nmoreover, were not immaterial to the grand jury's investigation. These \ndetails, such as the characterization of Ms. Lewinsky as a stalker, \ndirectly attack the credibility of the principal witness against the \nPresident in the grand jury proceeding. As a result, I am convinced \nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the President obstructed justice when he \nlied to his aides.\n\n\n        the law of obstruction of justice and witness tampering\n\n  The President's conduct clearly violates the federal criminal \nstatutes against obstruction of justice and witness tampering. The \nfederal obstruction of justice statute requires the government to prove \nthree elements: ``(1) there was a pending federal judicial proceeding; \n(2) the defendant knew of the proceeding; and (3) the defendant acted \ncorruptly with the specific intent to obstruct or interfere with the \nproceeding or due administration of justice.'' 35 American Criminal Law \nReview 989,992 (1998). There is no real dispute in this case that the \nPresident knew that the Jones' suit was pending when he engaged in the \nconduct covered by the obstruction of justice article. The only \nrelevant legal question is whether he intended to obstruct justice in \nthe Jones case.\n  There is ample evidence in the record to suggest that obstructing \njustice in the Jones case was the President's precise intent. Indeed, \nthe President's own testimony makes clear that he viewed the Jones \nlitigation as illegitimate. He stated that he ``deplored'' the Jones \nlawsuit and felt it was only going forward ``because of the funding \nthey had from my political enemies.'' (See Sen. Rec. Vol. III, part 1, \nat 532; Mr. Clinton 8/17/98 GJ, at 80.) As a result, the President \nconcedes that, in his words, he was ``not trying to be particularly \nhelpful'' to the Jones lawyers. (See Sen. Rec. Vol. III, part 1, at \n480; Mr. Clinton 8/17/98 GJ, at 28.) Moreover, the discussion of the \nspecific examples of obstruction of justice make clear that the \nPresident's advice that Ms. Lewinsky file a false affidavit, the \nPresident's coaching of witnesses, and the job search were all done \nwith the object of obstructing justice in the Jones litigation.\n  The Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 criminalized a \nparticular form of obstruction of justice, witness tampering. Part of \nthat act, section 1512(b) of the federal criminal code, sets out the \nfour elements of witness tampering. ``Under section 1512(b), the \ngovernment must prove that the defendant: (1) knowingly (2) engaged in \nintimidation, physical force, threats, misleading conduct or corrupt \npersuasion, (3) with intent to influence, delay or prevent testimony or \ncause any person to withhold a record, object or document (4) from an \nofficial proceeding.'' 35 American Criminal Law Review 989, 1004 \n(1998). Each of these elements is satisfied in this case.\n  The President's attorneys have emphasized that the President never \nphysically threatened any potential witness. In particular, they point \nto Ms. Currie's testimony that she never felt threatened or intimidated \nin her conversations with the President. However, that is simply not \nrelevant under the federal witness tampering statute, which \ncriminalizes not just physical intimidation, but corrupt persuasion and \nmisleading conduct as well. What is more, the statute makes clear that \nit applies to any witness in any official proceeding, and the statute \nspecifies in subsection (e) that ``an official proceeding need not be \npending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense.'' As with \nthe perjury counts, the President's legal defenses misstate the \napplicable law. Just as federal law does not require two witnesses to \nsupport a conviction for grand jury perjury, the assertion that witness \ntampering requires actual intimidation simply misstates the law.\n\n\n                      high crimes and misdemeanors\n\n  My careful examination of the evidence, legal precedent and arguments \nmade by both sides convinces me that the President committed perjury, \nobstructed justice and violated the federal witness tampering statutes. \nHaving reached this conclusion, the remaining step in my analysis of \nthe cases to examine whether these criminal acts require the \nPresident's removal from office. In other words, do perjury and \nobstruction of justice constitute high crimes and misdemeanors? The \nprecedents of the Senate provide an unequivocal answer: the Senate has \nrepeatedly treated perjury as a high crime and misdemeanor that \njustifies--indeed, necessitates--removal.\n  Three times in the last fifteen years the House has impeached and the \nSenate has removed a federal judge for perjury or related crimes. In \ntwo of the three cases, moreover, the judge was removed for lies that \nhad nothing to do with his official duties. Judge Harold Claiborne was \nremoved for filing false tax returns under penalty of perjury. Judge \nWalter Nixon was removed for lying to a federal grand jury about his \nefforts to influence a state judicial proceeding. The Senate's \nprecedents on perjury as an impeachable offense are clear. Moreover, \nthere is simply no basis in the Constitution to apply a less demanding \nstandard of the President than has been traditionally applied to \nfederal Judges. A single provision of the Constitution creates a single \nstandard of impeachment for all ``Officers of the United States,'' \nJudges and the President alike. To be sure, the Constitution specifies \nthat federal Judges ``shall hold their offices during good behavior.'' \nArt. III, sec. 1. However, this clause has always been understood as \nestablishing life tenure, as opposed to a relaxed standard for \nimpeachment, and no Judge has ever been impeached or removed for ``bad \nbehavior.'' In sum, the notion that the President--with his infinitely \ngreater effect on the culture, for good or ill--would be held to a \nlesser standard than one of 800 federal Judges has as little basis in \ncommon sense as it has in the Constitution's text.\n  Of course, even if we did not have the benefit of the Senate's \nprecedents treating perjury as a high crime, and had to consider this \nissue as an original matter, I would have little difficulty concluding \nthat perjury and obstruction of justice qualify as high crimes and \nmisdemeanors. The Constitution's use of the adjective ``high'' to \nmodify the phrase ``crimes and misdemeanors'' suggests that there may \nbe some crimes and misdemeanors that do not form the basis for \nimpeachment. However, those crimes, such as perjury and obstruction of \njustice, that undermine public confidence in government and strike at \nthe integrity of our systems of government and justice surely must be \ncovered by the phrase ''high crimes and misdemeanors.''\n  In addition, the scope of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' is \ninformed by the two crimes specifically enumerated in the Constitution \nas a basis for impeachment, treason and bribery. Both these crimes, in \ncommon with perjury and obstruction of justice, threaten the proper \nfunctioning of government--either directly in the case of treason, or \nindirectly, by undermining the government's integrity, in the case of \nbribery. Perjury is bribery's twin. Perhaps the clearest illustration \nof this point is that the President could have accomplished the same \nresult in this case--interfering with the Jones litigation--by bribing \na witness or the Judge. Perjury, like bribery, has been grouped among \nthe most serious crimes at least since the founding of our nation\n  John Jay, one of the three authors of the Federalist papers and our \nnation's first Chief Justice, provides a glimpse of the framers' views \non the seriousness of perjury. When riding circuit in Bennington, \nVermont in the Summer of 1792, Chief Justice Jay instructed the Grand \nJury in a perjury persecution. His instruction is worth quoting at \nlength;\n\n       Independent of the abominable insult which perjury offers \n     to the divine Being, there is no crime more extensively \n     pernicious to Society. It discolours and poisons the streams \n     of justice, and by substituting falsehood for truth, saps the \n     Foundation of personal and public rights. Controversies of \n     various kinds exist at all times, and in all communities. To \n     decide them, Courts of justice are instituted. Their \n     decisions must be regulated by evidence, and the greater part \n     of the evidence will always consist of the testimony of \n     witnesses. This testimony is given under those solemn \n     obligations which an appeal to the God of Truth impose; and \n     if oaths\n\n[[Page S1616]]\n\n     should cease to be held sacred, our dearest and most valuable \n     rights would become insecure.\n\n  There is ample evidence to support Chief Justice Jay's view that, of \nall crimes, perjury is among the most pernicous to society, and one \nthat has always been thought to rise to the level of ``high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.'' It is not surprising then, that the Kentucky \nConstitution of 1792 directed that: ``Laws shall be made to exclude \nfrom office and from suffrage those who thereafter be convicted of \nbribery, perjury, forgery or other high crimes or misdemeanors.'' Art. \nVIII cl. 2. Moreover, the belief that perjury is an impeachable high \ncrime is not limited to the framers. Less than a decade ago in a law \nreview article, Chief Justice Rehnquist, the presiding officer in this \nimpeachment trial, summed up our national experience with impeachment \nby noting that ``impeachment has been confined to flagrant abuse of \noffice--perjury, bribery, and the like.'' William Rehnquist, The \nImpeachment Clause: A Wild Card in the Constitution, 85 Northwestern \nUniversity Law Review 903, 910 (1991).\n\n  The point has also been raised that the President's conduct does not \nrise to the same levels as President Nixon's conduct in Watergate. That \nmay well be true, but it is also irrelevant. Not every high crime and \nmisdemeanor is created equal, but all require removal under the express \nterms of the Constitution. However, whatever differences exist between \nPresident Clinton's conduct and Watergate, the reaction of Watergate \nSpecial Prosecutor Leon Jaworski to President Nixon's misconduct is \ntelling. Of all the misconduct portrayed on the famous Nixon tapes, \nJaworski found one strip of dialogue ``the most repulsive on the tape. \nIn that strip the President--a lawyer--coached [his aide] to testify \nuntruthfully and yet not commit perjury. It amounted to subornation of \nperjury. For the number-one law enforcement officer of the country it \nwas, in my opinion, as demeaning an act as could be imagined.'' Leon \nJaworski, The Right and the Power--The Prosecution of Watergate 47 \n(1976).\n  That is perjury. The nation's first Chief Justice stated that ``there \nis no crime more extensively pernicious to Society.'' Our current Chief \nJustice described it as a ``flagrant abuse of office.'' And the \nWatergate Special Prosecutor thought subornation of perjury by the \nPresident ``as demeaning an act as could be imagined.'' There is no \ndoubt in my mind that perjury and the closely related crime of \nobstruction of justice are high crime and misdemeanors. Moreover, \nhaving concluded that the President committed these high crimes, the \nConstitution leaves me with no further discretion--it states that the \nPresident ``shall be removed from office for impeachment for, and \nconviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.''\n  Some have argued that the Senate retains some discretion not to \nremove a President even if the evidence shows that he committed acts \nthat constitute high crimes or misdemeanors. This simply misreads the \nConstitution. The Constitution is unequivocal that the President shall \nbe removed upon conviction of a high crime. As Justice Story observed \nin his Commentaries on the Constitution, ``the Senate, on the \nconviction, [is] bound, in all cases, to enter a judgment of removal \nfrom office.'' The Senate recognized this constitutional imperative in \nthe trial of Judge Halsted Ritter in 1936, when it expressly rejected \nthe need for a second vote on the question of removal, after the Senate \nhad convicted him of high crimes. Conviction without removal would be a \ndirect affront to the Constitution. It is no less an affront to refuse \nto convict despite facts that support conviction for a high crime \nbecause of an unwillingness to trigger the consequences demanded by the \nConstitution. Such an action subverts both the Constitution and the \nrule of law. It arrogates to Senators the authority to second guess the \nConstitution and conclude that although the President has committed \ncrimes for which others should be removed, in this case the President \nshould be permitted to remain in office. It is a brazen act of jury \nnullification.\n  The Constitution empowers the Senate to conclude that the facts do \nnot support the crimes alleged in the articles of impeachment. \nLikewise, the Senate may conclude that the crimes alleged in the \narticles do not rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors. But \nnothing in the Constitution allows the Senate to refuse to convict if \nit finds that the facts support the articles, and the articles allege \nhigh crimes. There has been much talk in this case about the rule of \nlaw. A power to refuse to convict in the face of evidence of a high \ncrime is the antithesis of the rule of law. It is the rule of whim. \nSuch an action would go beyond repudiating the value of the Senate \nprecedents that perjury is an impeachable offense, it would destroy the \nvalue of all Senate precedents. As Justice Story warned while riding \ncircuit over 160 years ago, if jury nullification were permitted, ``it \nwould be almost impracticable to ascertain, what the law . . . actually \nis.'' United States v. Battiste, 24 F. Cas. 1042 (Cir. Ct. D. Mass. \n1835).\n  Any discretion that exists in the constitutional framework to refuse \nto act in the face of impeachable offenses lies in the House of \nRepresentatives. The law has long recognized the legitimacy of \nprosecutorial discretion. But the law has also long criticized jury \nnullification. Unlike a normal jury, the Senate has the power \nto determine both law and facts. What it lacks is the raw power to \nrefuse to convict in the face of law and facts that both support \nconviction.\n\n  I cannot leave this discussion of perjury and obstruction of justice \nas high crimes and misdemeanors without a comment on the consequences \nof failing to remedy perjury and obstruction of justice by the number-\none law enforcement in the nation. Chief Justice Jay warned of the \ndangers of diluting the importance of oaths: ``[I]f oaths should cease \nto be held sacred, our dearest and most valuable rights would become \ninsecure.'' If the President of the United States--our nation's leader \nand the man surveys still identify as the most admired in America even \nafter all this--can commit perjury and obstruct justice without any \nimmediate consequence, it is difficult to see how oaths will continue \nto be held sacred. We can either abandon all perjury prosecutions or \nacknowledge that the President is above the law. Those are the choices: \nlawlessness or hypocrisy. Either option carries grave risks that oaths \nwill ``cease to be held sacred.''\n  Removing the President, by contrast, will not only reinforce the \nimportance of oaths; it will demonstrate the importance of personal \nresponsibility and accountability. Rather than signaling that some in \nsociety are too talented or important for the normal rules to apply, \nremoving the President will teach that actions have consequences, no \nmatter who you are. We have an opportunity either to set a good example \nfor our children or to enshrine the ``Clinton defense'' and the \n``Clinton exception'' to the importance of telling the truth. We need \nto send a message that the grand words that grace the Supreme Court--\nequal justice under law--mean what they say.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  After sifting through the evidence presented by both sides, all \nrelevant legal precedents, and all the arguments by counsel, it is \nplain that the President committed perjury and obstructed justice. The \nprosecutors have done more than show that the President lied and \ntampered with witnesses. They have proven the elements of these crimes \nbeyond a reasonable doubt. These federal crimes are not technical \nviolations of an obscure law. They are crimes as old as the nation. \nThey strike at the heart of the integrity of our government. Not \nsurprisingly, Congress always has treated them as high crimes and \nmisdemeanors that require the removal of a guilty party. In light of \nthe President's criminal misconduct, I will vote to convict the \nPresident on both articles of impeachment.\n  This is the only conclusion consistent with my oath to do impartial \njustice. In large measure, this case is all about the importance of \noaths. The President's failure to honor his oath has necessitated this \nentire proceeding. Although some might see a vote to acquit as \nexpedient, I will not further damage the sacredness and vitality of \noaths by disregarding my own.\n  I have not relished the responsibility of serving as a finder of fact \nand determiner of law in an impeachment trial. I am eager to return to \na legislative agenda to provide Americans and Missourians with tax \ncuts, retirement security, educational opportunity and\n\n[[Page S1617]]\n\ngreater safety from drugs and crime. It is regrettable that the \nPresident's misconduct forced Congress to consider this matter. I hope \nthe unprecedented time that Senators have spent together in this work \nwill enable us to make strong progress on the people's business when we \nreturn to the Senate.\n  Finally, while I have not relished this duty, and sincerely wish the \nPresident would have spared the nation this ordeal, this responsibility \nis among the most important assigned to the Senate under our \nConstitution. It has been my goal to do my very vest to do my duty as \nprescribed by the Constitution. While the Constitution calls upon the \nSenate to remove an unfit President, it does not charge the Senate with \npunishing the President. Indeed, the Constitution specifically limits \nthe Senate's remedies and leaves the President ``subject to . . . \npunishment, according to law'' through the courts. The Constitution \nrequires a clear choice: acquit the President and leave him in office, \nor convict him and remove him. The framers deemed it wise not to allow \nthe Senate to leave a President in place, but wound him with \npunishments short of removal. Thus, once we discharge our impeachment \nresponsibilities, the Senate should move energetically to its \nlegislative agenda. To accomplish legislative goals for the nation, it \nwill be necessary for Congress and the President to work together. If \nSenators wish to condemn the President's conduct, they should do so on \ntheir own, and should not tie up the Senate and divert energy from \ndoing the people's work.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. Chief Justice, the vote I cast on the articles of \nimpeachment was one of the hardest votes that I have had to make in all \nmy years in the United States Senate, not that I do not think I made \nthe correct decision. While I am saddened that we had to make the \njudgment we made in this impeachment trial, each of us had a duty to \nundertake this task, and I do not shirk from duties.\n  The House Managers performed their duty admirably, making a \ncomprehensive, coherent, and eloquent presentation. The White House \nattorneys presented a spirited defense. Similarly, due in part to the \noutstanding leadership of the Senate Majority Leader, I am confident \nthat history will record that we in the Senate exercised our duty to \nconduct the trial appropriately and fairly. I believe the Founding \nFathers would be pleased with the process and procedure.\n  The purpose of impeachment is not to punish a man. It is not a way to \nexpress displeasure or disagreement with a President or his policies. \nImpeachment is a mechanism designed to preserve, protect, and defend \nthe Constitution, the Country, and Office of the Presidency. My primary \nconcern, from the first day of this scandal, was the impact it would \nhave on the Office of the Presidency.\n  This case is not about illicit conduct or even about not telling the \ntruth about illicit conduct. Instead, the case is about two activities. \nThe first is whether the President intentionally made false statements \nunder oath to a Federal grand jury, to the Judiciary of the United \nStates. The second is whether the President obstructed justice before a \nUnited States District Court and a Federal grand jury, again to the \nJudiciary of the United States.\n  A Senator's role in an impeachment trial is a mix of roles from our \njudicial system, including being part judge and part jury. At least in \nreviewing the evidence, we do act as jurors, and we should view \nevidence the way the courts expect jurors to view it. We use our common \nsense and our knowledge of human behavior based on our everyday \nexperiences in life. In this case, the defense has attempted to take \neach act, separate it out, and artificially place it in isolation. I \ncannot view the evidence in this fashion. I cannot ignore common sense.\n  As to perjury, I have no doubt that the evidence presented to the \nSenate proves that the President did not tell the truth to the Federal \ngrand jury. He made numerous false statements to make his illicit \nconduct seem more benign; to make his efforts at witness tampering with \nhis secretary seem innocuous; and to make his testimony in the Paula \nJones case appear truthful.\n  As to obstruction of justice, in my mind there can be no dispute but \nthat the President intentionally interfered with the Judiciary. When \nthe President spoke to Monica Lewinsky about her being a witness in the \nPaula Jones case, he did not discuss the contents of her affidavit \nbecause he did not have to. Based on their previous conversations and \nthe pattern of their relationship, she knew exactly what he meant; he \nmeant for her to file a false and misleading affidavit with the Federal \ncourt. When the President spoke to his secretary and suggested to her \nan explanation for his relationship with Monica Lewinsky that he knew \nwas not true, he was engaged in classic witness tampering. There can be \nno other acceptable explanation. When the President failed to reveal to \nthe Federal judge during his Paula Jones deposition that the Monica \nLewinsky affidavit was false, he was obstructing the fact-finding \nprocess of the District Court. I can accept no other explanation.\n  The President has violated his sacred oath to faithfully execute the \nlaws of the United States. Regardless of the bounds of private conduct \nand of the importance of allowing people to keep their private lives \nprivate, those bounds are broken when someone violates an oath to tell \nthe truth in a court of law. Those bounds are also broken when someone \ninterferes with a court of law in its efforts to find the facts and \nfind the truth.\n  The President's conduct in this matter was an egregious affront to \nthe judicial system. We have a Chief Executive who has intentionally \ndecided not to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. Indeed, \nhe intentionally interfered with the lawful duties of a co-equal branch \nof government. This should not be tolerated.\n  No one is above the law. I cannot accept the argument that a \ndifferent legal standard applies to judges than to the President. The \nCongress has never accepted that argument before. There is no support \nfor it in the words of the Constitution, which establishes one standard \nof impeachment for ``the President, Vice President and all civil \nOfficers of the United States.'' There is no support for it in the \ndebates at the Constitutional Convention or in the Federalist Papers. \nIs it reasonable to conclude that our standards for removal from office \nfor criminal conduct is less for the Chief Law Enforcement Officer than \nit is for civil officers who are appointed to apply the law?\n\n  Because the President is the Commander in Chief, I must think about \nour men and women in uniform. I do not suggest that the President \nshould be strictly subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice \nduring his term in office. However, if we vote not guilty on the \narticles on these facts, what message do we send to our soldiers about \nduty, honor, and country? Given that the President is the Chief Law \nEnforcement Officer, if we vote not guilty, what message do we send \nAmerican citizens about respect for the rule of law? For that matter, \nwhat massage do we send our children and grandchildren for generations \nto come about the consequences of not telling the truth?\n  We have been told that we should not remove the President from office \nbecause doing so would ``overturn the results of an election.'' The \nSenate does not have this power. Our power extends no further than \nremoval of the President, and the law provides that his running mate, \nthe Vice President, takes the oath of office. If the President is \nremoved, the Administration does not change from one party to another. \nThe Constitution wisely provides for continuity. The impeachment \nprocess only provides for the removal of the current occupant.\n  Indeed, we are not engaged in a Constitutional crisis. The \nConstitution provides the roadmap for what we are doing. We are simply \nfollowing our Constitutional duty. We did not ask for this burden. It \nwas thrust upon us by the misconduct of the current occupant of the \nOffice of the Presidency.\n  Before today, perjury and obstruction of justice were clearly high \ncrimes and misdemeanors under the Constitution, My vote is consistent \nwith this. The President is not above the law. The Constitutional \nstandard is no different for him than for anyone else. It is for these \nreasons that I voted guilty on both articles of impeachment.\n  Mr. CRAPO Mr. Chief Justice, very soon we will all cast what is \nclearly among the most serious votes any members of Congress could ever \nbe\n\n[[Page S1618]]\n\nasked to make. I will vote to convict President William Jefferson \nClinton on both of the two articles of impeachment before the U.S. \nSenate--prejury before a grand jury and obstruction of justice. To me, \nthe evidence presented over the previous four weeks is not reasonably \nsubject to any conclusion other than that the President did commit the \ncrimes alleged against him.\n  From the very beginning of this matter, I have been circumspect about \ncommenting on President Clinton's conduct. As a newly elected Senator, \nI was inundated with interview requests from national media. I chose \nnot to appear on these programs and restricted my comments to a \ndiscussion of the process. I felt it was incumbent upon me as a member \nof the impeachment court to avoid commenting on the evidence until the \ntrial has concluded.\n  At the outset, each Senator was administered a separate oath by the \nChief Justice of the Supreme Court. This special oath was separate and \ndistinct from the oath of office that each Senator takes when sworn \ninto office. To my knowledge, this is the only other occasion in which \nour Founding Fathers required a separate and distinct oath of U.S. \nSenators to perform a constitutional responsibility.\n  Once again, the incredible wisdom of our Founding Fathers was \nevident. As each Senator took the oath to provide impartial justice, a \nrealization fell over us that we had just embarked on a very solemn \nduty. No longer was the Senate a legislative body, it was a court of \nimpeachment. A unique court, to be sure, not identical to traditional \ncivil and criminal courts, but a court nonetheless.\n  This oath to render ``impartial justice'' was a promise to God under \nour Constitution. It also represented a duty to all Idahoans to \nrepresent them impartially. I committed that I would conduct myself in \na fashion so that at any time I could affirm that I fully honored this \ncommitment. I was present at all the Senate proceedings, and fully \nreviewed the evidence presented before the Senate. I was ready to vote \neither to acquit or to convict, depending on the evidence, argument, \nand law presented to the Senate.\n  In approaching this decision, several questions must be answered. Did \nthe President commit the crimes alleged? And if so, are these crimes \n``high crimes and misdemeanors'' requiring the removal of the President \nfrom office under the impeachment provisions of the U.S. Constitution? \nAfter carefully weighing the evidence and the law presented to the \nSenate, I have concluded after many sleepless nights and troubling days \nthat the evidence shows that President Clinton committed the crimes \nalleged in the Articles of Impeachment. These crimes involve perjury \nand obstruction of justice in federal criminal grand jury proceedings \nand in a federal civil rights action. Although the ``beyond a \nreasonable doubt'' standard of traditional criminal trials is not \napplicable in impeachment proceedings, I am convinced the evidence \npresented in this case meet even this high standard.\n  Notwithstanding the impression created by some of the media and talk \nshows, there seems to be general consensus that the President committed \nthe acts alleged against him. The core debate is whether these acts \nrise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors as required to \nimpeach and remove the President from office under the Constitution.\n  Some argue that this entire matter is just an effort to impeach the \nPresident for ``private'' conduct and that impeachment is proper only \nfor ``public'' conduct that violates the public trust. But it is \nimportant to clarify that these proceedings are not about sex or even \nlying about sex. Both the President's counsel and the House managers \ncorrectly made the point that private conduct by the President is a \nmatter properly left between the President and his wife and family. The \nallegations in this case, however, relate to public acts that go to the \nheart of the rule of law in America--perjury and obstruction of justice \nin a civil rights case and before criminal grand jury proceedings. I am \ndeeply concerned that we will do great damage to our system of law and \nthe freedom it defends if we diminish the seriousness of these crimes \nand thereby suggest to future offenders that they can commit these \ncrimes with little to fear.\n  It is telling that on three separate occasions the U.S. Senate has \nremoved federal judges from office for perjury. Judges are tried under \nthe same Constitutional provision requiring proof of treason, bribery \nor high crimes and misdemeanors as are presidents. Judge Claiborne was \nremoved from office for lying on his income tax returns. Judge Hastings \nwas removed for lying under oath in a trial. Judge Nixon was removed \nfor making false statements to a grand jury. Clearly, under prior \nSenate precedent, perjury is a ``high crime and misdemeanor.''\n  In America, our freedom is assured by the rule of law. Our law seeks \nto provide equal and impartial justice to all. All Americans--the poor, \nthe rich, the weak, the powerful--are entitled to the same protection \nunder the law. And even, the most powerful among us must be subject to \nthose laws. Tampering with the truth-seeking functions of the law \nundermines our justice system and the foundations on which our freedoms \nlie. All Americans must abide by the rule of law, including the \nPresident of the United States, who is the highest official in the land \nand who has the additional duty to ensure that the laws are faithfully \nexecuted.\n  The primacy of the rule of law over the rule of individuals is one of \nthe most important safeguards of freedom in our Constitution. Our \nentire legal system is dependent on our ability to find the truth. That \nis why perjury and obstruction of justice are crimes. Federal \nsentencing guidelines place perjury, witness tampering, and obstruction \nof justice in the same realm of seriousness as bribery. Commission of \nthese crimes is a direct effort to prevent our legal system from \nperforming one of its core functions--finding the truth.\n  The offenses are even worse when committed against the poor or \npowerless by the wealthy or powerful. Our Constitution guarantees, \nfortunately, that the most ordinary person has the right to her day in \ncourt even if she is not well liked by the public or has become \ncharacterized in a bad light by her opponents. And even if the person \nfrom whom she seeks justice is the President.\n  In 1792, Chief Justice John Jay gave one of the best historical \nexplanations of the reason crimes against the truth-seeking process in \nour system of justice are so dangerous to our freedom:\n\n       Independent of the abominable Insult which Perjury offers \n     to the divine Being, there is no Crime more Pernicious to \n     Society. It discolors and poisons the Streams of Justice, and \n     by substituting Falsehood for Truth, saps the Foundations of \n     personal and public Right. . . . Testimony is given under \n     those solemn obligations which an appeal to the God of Truth \n     impose; and if oaths should cease to be held sacred, our \n     dearest and most valuable Rights would become insecure.--\n     Chief Justice John Jay, Charge to a Grand Jury of the Circuit \n     Court of the District of Vermont, June 25, 1792.\n\n  Perjury and obstruction of justice are public crimes that strike at \nthe heart of the rule of law--and therefore our freedom--in America. I \nconclude that these acts do constitute high crimes and misdemeanors \nunder the impeachment provisions of the U.S. Constitution. Therefore, I \nwill vote to convict President Clinton on both of the impeachment \narticles.\n  Fortunately, this trial is over and I now can direct my full \nattention to fulfilling the other oath I took when I was sworn in as a \nUnited States Senator. Many challenges and opportunities face Idahoans \nand all Americans. I will, as I always have, give all my energy to \nworking on a bipartisan basis to solve problems, strengthen America and \nprotect our future.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Thank you Senator Lott, Senator Daschle, and Mr. Chief \nJustice for the skill and dignity you have given these proceedings.\n  I wish every American could see and hear the Senate in these \ndeliberations.\n  There is a kind of majesty to see the Senate chamber filled with \nSenators listening to each other in debate and deliberation.\n  We are different people, coming from different regions with different \nphilosophies, and that is what creates the unique character of this \nwonderful institution.\n  I want to tell you briefly today about Teddy Roosevelt.\n  Over a century ago, Teddy Roosevelt was consumed with grief following \nthe death of his wife and mother who died on the same day. He decided \nto change\n\n[[Page S1619]]\n\nhis life and move out west. When he stepped off the train in the \nBadlands of North Dakota, he was wearing a cowboy suit hand-tailored \nfrom Brooks Brothers, rimless glasses, a Bowie knife with ``Tiffanys'' \nengraved on the handle, and Sterling silver spurs with his initials on \neach rowel.\n  The local cowboys thought he was a joke. One unlucky cowboy picked a \nfight with Teddy in a Badlands saloon in Medora. In minutes, the cowboy \nwas punched senseless by this funny looking easterner.\n  And then Teddy Roosevelt was accepted. Being different, looking \ndifferent didn't much matter to the folks in the Badlands after that.\n  Here in the Senate we're very different people too. No saloon fights \nhere, though. We engage in verbal battles. And the Senate works because \nwe accept each other, and we share a common purpose.\n  The discussion we are having today reminds me again of the unique \nskills and passion for our country possessed by each and every member \nof the Senate.\n  How do we apply these skills and that passion here and now?\n  Mark Twain once said, with tongue in cheek, that ``the next best \nthing to a lie, is a true story no one will believe.''\n  Well, this sorry chapter in our rich history embraces both. Lies, \nyes! And truth that is almost unbelievable.\n  We meet here as Senators to consider whether to remove from office a \npresident elected by the American people. In the entire history of our \ncountry, the Senate has never voted to remove a president. In fact, it \nhas been tried only once. The Framers of our Constitution made it very \nhard to do; and they made it, with a 2/3 vote required in the Senate, \nimpossible to do on a ``partisan'' basis.\n  The matter that calls us to this duty is a sordid one.\n  It is truly a scandal and a drama without heroes and without winners.\n  It is about a president who should be, and I'm sure is, ashamed of \nhis behavior. Is there anyone here in the Senate who had a sexual \nrelationship with one of their interns? Of course not! The President \ndid. He had a sexual relationship with an intern, and he lied about it, \nto the country, to all of us, to try to conceal it.\n  This President has betrayed our trust and I have expressed to him \npersonally how profoundly disappointed I am with his actions.\n  This matter is also about an Independent Counsel who you and I know \nhas leaked confidential information from secret proceedings of a grand \njury, and whose actions in detaining Monica Lewinsky should be \ntroubling to every Senator. And an Independent Counsel who came to \nCongress with such prosecutorial passion that his ethics advisor \nresigned in protest.\n  And it is about many others as well. Major figures and bit players, \nsome who conspired in disgraceful ways, and others who were innocently \nswept into the maelstrom of a sensational scandal.\n  But, for all of the intrigue, the matter here is less complicated \nthan some would have us believe.\n  Here is a short chronology.\n  Several years after the day she claims that then-Governor Bill \nClinton made unwanted sexual advances toward her, Paula Jones appeared \nat a conservative political gathering to announce she was filing suit \nagainst the President.\n  Some while later, following the Supreme Court ruling that the case \ncould go forward, the President was called to a deposition in the Jones \ncase.\n  In that deposition, which the Judge later determined to be \nimmaterial, and in a case that was later dismissed, Bill Clinton denied \nhaving a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. That was a lie. Oh, \nI know about the convoluted definition of sex that was used, but I \nthink he lied. But that's not a matter before us. The impeachment \narticle about that deposition was defeated in the U.S. House.\n  Following the President's testimony in the Jones case, the \nIndependent Counsel, appointed three years earlier to investigate a \nWhitewater land deal, and controversies called Travelgate and Filegate, \nswung into action to investigate this sex scandal. Linda Tripp was \nwired, Monica Lewinsky was detained by the Independent Counsel and the \nFBI, and they told her she shouldn't call her lawyer. A grand jury \nbegan hearing witnesses and after many months the President appeared \nbefore that grand jury to answer questions.\n  Then, one-and-a half months before the 1998 general election, the \nU.S. House, with cooperation from the Independent Counsel, released to \nthe American public all of their investigative material and the secret \nproceedings of the grand jury.\n  Following the election, the U.S. House Judiciary Committee began \ntheir impeachment hearings. The Independent Counsel, in a virtual \nfootnote to his presentation before the House on the sex scandal, \nadmitted he had not been able to implicate the President on Whitewater, \nTravelgate or Filegate--but he got him on the sex matter. And so the \nHouse managers and the Independent Counsel used the President's bad \nbehavior to weave their charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.\n  And finally the U.S. House on a partisan vote sent to the Senate the \ntwo articles of impeachment.\n  That's the chronology as I see it.\n  And so we gather--conducting a trial of this sordid mess.\n  What are we to do? What is our duty? What is, as Lincoln said, ``our \nlast full measure of devotion'' to this country.\n  I am deeply troubled by this President's behavior. But I am also \ntroubled by the constitutional gravity of removing a President. Some, \nwith a mere wave of the hand seem to say that ``it's not such a big \ndeal.'' But they are wrong. This decision affects the very roots of our \ndemocracy.\n  The selection of the head of government by the governed in a free \nelection is rare. It is still the case in too many countries that power \nshifts through the barrel of a gun--through raw, naked power and \nviolence.\n  In our country, the American people choose their President by the \nsimple, elegant act of voting. It is through voting--not fighting--that \npower shifts. Our governments change without an army marching. With no \nshots being fired. What a remarkable thing to behold.\n  The Constitution does contain a very special provision allowing for \nthe removal of a President ``for bribery, treason, and other high \ncrimes and misdemeanors.'' It does that because the Framers wanted to \nprovide a method to remove a president who was acting in a manner that \nthreatens the country.\n  But the Framers worried that a partisan majority could try to remove \na President for political gain.\n  Hamilton, in the Federalist 65 said, ``the greatest danger . . . that \nthe decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of the \nparties than by the real demonstration of innocence or guilt.''\n  Mason said that the President should be removed for ``great and \ndangerous offenses'' that amount to ``attempts to subvert the \nConstitution.'' Hamilton wrote that impeachable offenses result from a \n``violation of public trust'' and ``relate chiefly to injuries done to \nsociety itself.''\n  It is also clear that the impeachment process was not meant to punish \na transgressor. In fact, the Constitution provides that any such \n``crimes'' would still be punishable in the criminal justice system.\n  In short, impeachment is a device to prevent grave danger to the \nNation.\n  I believe that the Framers of the Constitution would be startled by \nthis impeachment effort.\n  That this impeachment process was passionately partisan in its birth \nin the U.S. House is not in question. In fact, two of the House \nmanagers who brought these articles of impeachment to us called for the \nimpeachment of President Clinton long before they had ever heard of \nMonica Lewinsky. Seventeen Republican Congressmen had called for \nimpeachment hearings long ago. Theirs was a cause searching for a \nreason.\n  Nearly two years ago, before Linda Tripp, before Monica Lewinsky, \nbefore Betty Currie, before knowledge of sex with an intern, before a \nstained dress, before the deposition in the Jones case, before the \ntestimony to the grand jury, two of the House Managers who argued for \nthese impeachment articles had introduced an impeachment inquiry \nresolution. Representative Bob Barr and Representative Lindsey Graham \nsaid then that it was about ``the rule of\n\n[[Page S1620]]\n\nlaw.'' They were asking for the nullification of an election before \nthey knew the existence of a Monica Lewinsky and before the action that \nled to the two articles of impeachment now before us.\n  Isn't there room to wonder then, that maybe this is exactly the \npartisan passion that persuaded our Framers to place the impeachment \nbar just above the vertical leap of those Members of Congress who would \ncarry ``fill in the blank'' impeachment papers for every reason and \nevery season.\n  Take the partisan flavor away. I don't think the case has been made \nthat the President's behavior, while reprehensible, poses a grave \ndanger to the Nation. Therefore I cannot vote to nullify the results of \nthe last election. The people chose Bill Clinton and I do not believe \nthe case made against the President meets the constitutional threshold \nfor removing a president.\n  I respect those here who differ. I do not allege that your guilty \nvote is partisan. You have reached a different conclusion charge than I \ndid, and I respect you for that.\n  But I cannot vote for these articles of impeachment. This is not a \ncase of high crimes and misdemeanors. It's a case of bad behavior by a \nPresident who has shamed himself.\n  But let us not respond to his bad behavior by hurting our country.\n  Let us not aim at Bill Clinton and hit the Constitution.\n  I do not vote to support our President. I vote against these articles \nof impeachment to support our Constitution.\n  In the final analysis, however, the President should take no solace \nin this vote. I and others in the Senate have joined in a censure \nresolution that expresses a harsh judgement about the President's \nactions.\n  Now, it is time for the country to move on.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. Chief Justice, my colleagues, I want to thank the \nChief Justice for his important stewardship of these proceedings. And I \nthank Senator Lott and Senator Daschle for their patient leadership in \nhelping to bridge the divide of partisan votes so that these are not \npartisan deliberations.\n  There is a special spirit in this Chamber. No matter all the easy \ncriticisms directed our way, this is a great institution and in our own \nway we are witnessing--living out--the remarkable judgment of the \nFounding Fathers.\n  Let me turn to the question of removing President William Jefferson \nClinton.\n  Many times the House managers have argued to us that if you find the \nfacts as you argue them, you must vote to convict and thereby remove. \nBut of course, that, like a number of things that they said, is really \nnot true. You can, of course, find the facts and still acquit, because \nyou don't want to remove on a constitutional basis or, frankly, on any \nother balance that a Senator decides to make in the interest of the \nNation.\n  Now, I agree that perjury and obstruction of justice can be grounds \nfor removal or grounds for impeachment. The question is, Are they in \nthis case? I will not dissect the facts any further because I don't \nhave the time but also because I believe there are issues of greater \nsignificance than the facts of this case.\n  Let's assume you take the facts as the House managers want you to. I \nwould like to talk about some of the things in the arena outside of the \nmere recitation of facts--critical considerations in this matter.\n  I have listened to all of the arguments for removal, and I must say \nthat even as I understand what many have said, there seems to be a gap \nbetween the words and the reality of what is happening in this country.\n  Some have said it sets a double standard for judges, despite the fact \nthat the vast majority of scholars say there is a difference between \nimpeachment of judges and the President, despite a difference clearly \nspelled out in the Constitution, and despite all of the distinguishing \nfacts of each one of those cases involving judges.\n  Some have said we will have a negative impact on kids, on the \nmilitary, and on the fabric of our country.\n  And while I agree that this is absolutely not about polls and \npopularity, some are making a judgment that clearly the country itself \ndoes not agree with. The country does not believe the fiber of our \nNation is unraveling over the President's egregious behavior, because \nmost people have a sense of proportion about this case that seems \ntotally lacking in the House managers' presentation.\n  No parent or school in America is teaching kids that lying or abusing \nthe justice system is now OK. In fact, the President's predicament, I \nargue, does not make it harder to do so. If anything, there may now be \na greater appreciation for the trouble you can get into for certain \nbehavior. More parents are teaching their children about lying, about \nhumiliation, about family hurt, about public responsibility, than \nbefore we ever heard the name of Monica Lewinsky.\n  The clear answer to children who write letters about the President is \nthat since being discovered he has been in a lot of trouble, may even \nbe criminally liable, has suffered public humiliation, and all of \nhistory will not erase the fact of this impeachment, this trial, or the \nlessons of this case.\n  But the bottom line for us is our constitutional duty, our \nresponsibility to balance based on common sense and sense of honor.\n  There is a simple question but a question of enormous consequence: Do \nwe really want to remove a President of the United States because he \ntried to avoid discovery in a civil case of a private, consensual \naffair with a woman who was subsequently determined to be irrelevant to \nthe case, which case itself was thrown out as wholly without merit \nunder the law? That is the question.\n  Let me be clear about the President's behavior so no one \nmisinterprets. I am as deeply disturbed by it as all of us are here in \nthe Senate. But I am not sure we need additional moralizing about \nsomething that the whole Nation has already condemned and digested. The \nPresident lied to his countrymen, to family, friends, to all of us. And \nif one is not enormously concerned by gifts not surrendered, \nconversations which can't refresh recollection, jobs produced with \nuncommon referral and speed, certainly one must be unsettled by the \nmere lack of easy compliance with judicial inquiry by a President. That \nis of grave concern to all. It deserves our censure.\n  But let me say as directly as I can that no amount of inflated \nrhetoric, or ideological or moral hyperextension can lift the personal, \nvenial aspects of the President's actions to the kind of threat to the \nfabric of the country contemplated by the Founding Fathers. I must say \nthat I am truly somewhat surprised to see so many strict \nconstructionists of the Constitution giving such new and free \ninterpretation to the clear intent of the framers.\n  And I have, frankly, been stunned by the overreach, the moral \nrighteousness, even the zealotry of arguments presented by the House \nmanagers.\n  No matter the words about not hating Bill Clinton, no matter the \ndisclaimers about partisanship, I truly sensed at times not just a \nscorn but a snarling, trembling venom that told us the President is a \ncriminal and that ``we need to know who our President is.''\n  Well, the President is certainly a sinner. We all are. And he may \neven have committed a crime. But just plain and simply measured against \nthe test of history so eloquently articulated by the Senator from New \nYork this morning and by the Senator from Delaware yesterday, just \nplain and simply, this is not in any measure on the order of high a \ncrime and misdemeanor so clearly contemplated by the Founding Fathers.\n  Unlike President Nixon's impeachment case, no government power or \nagency was unleashed or abused for a goal directly affecting public \npolicy. No election was interfered with. No FBI or IRS power was \nwrongfully employed. At worst, this President lied about his private, \nconsensual affair and tried wrongfully, but on a human level--\nunderstandable to most Americans, at least as to the Paula Jones case--\nto cover it up. I think, in fact, that most Americans in this country \nunderstood there was in that inquiry a violation of a zone of privacy \nthat is as precious to Americans as the Constitution itself.\n  The fact that the House dropped the Paula Jones deposition count \nunderscores the underlying weakness on\n\n[[Page S1621]]\n\nwhich all of this is based. So I ask my colleagues, are we really \nincapable of at least measuring the real human dimensions of what took \nplace here and contrasting it properly with the constitutional \nstandards we are presented by precedent and history?\n  We have heard some discussion of proportionality. It is an important \nprinciple within our justice system and in life itself. The \nconsequences of a crime should not be out of proportion to the crime \nitself. As the dictionary tells us, it should correspond in size, \ndegree or intensity.\n  I must say that no one yet who will vote to remove has fully \naddressed that proportionality issue.\n  If you want to find perjury because you believe Monica about where \nthe President touched her, and you believe that adopting the definition \ngiven to him by a judge and by Paula Jones' own lawyers, and you can \nreach into the President's mind to determine his intent, then that is \nyour right. But having done that, if you think a President of the \nUnited States should be removed, an election reversed, because of such \na thin evidentiary thread, I think you give new meaning to the concept \nof proportionality. If you do that, you turn away from the central fact \nthat the President opened his grand jury testimony by acknowledging \n``inappropriate, intimate contact'' with Monica Lewinsky.\n  Enough said, you would think. But no, not enough for this independent \nprosecutor. While not one more question really needed to be asked, a \ntorrent of questions followed. Every question thereafter calculated to \neither elicit an admission of a lie in a case found to be without \nmerit, or to create a new lie which could bring us here.\n\n  With the President's acknowledgment of intimate contact, everyone in \nthis Chamber understood what had happened. Everyone in America \nunderstood what had happened. For what reason did we need eighty \npercent of the questions asked about sexual relations? For the simple \nreason that the Presidential jugular instinct of the so-called \nindependent counsel was primed by what all of us have come to know--he \nhad colluded with Paula Jones' attorneys and Linda Tripp to set the \nMonica trap in the January deposition, and now he was going to set the \nperjury trap in the grand jury. Mr. Bennett's own comments in the \ndeposition underscore this:\n\n       ``I mean, this is not what a deposition is for, Your Honor. \n     He can ask the President, What did he do? He can ask him \n     specifically in certain instances what he did, and isn't that \n     what this deposition is for? It is not to sort of lay a trap \n     for him.''\n\n  I wonder if there is no former district attorney, now Senator; no \nformer attorney general, now Senator; no former U.S. attorney, now \nSenator; former officer of the court, now Senator, who is not deeply \ndisturbed by a so-called independent counsel grilling a sitting \nPresident of the United States of America about his personal sex life, \nbased on information from illegal phone recordings?\n  Is there no one finding a countervailing proportionality in this case \nwhen confronted by our own congressionally created Javert who is not \njust pursuing a crime but who is at the center of creating the crime \nwhich we are deliberating on now?\n  Think about it. When Mr. Starr was appointed, when we authorized an \nindependent counsel, when the grand jury was convened, the crime on \ntrial before us now had not even been committed, let alone \ncontemplated.\n  I wonder also if there is no one even concerned about Linda Tripp--\nwho new gives definition to the meaning of friendship--working with \nPaula Jones' attorneys even as she was in the guidance and control of \nMr. Starr as a Federal witness. Some of you may want to turn away from \nthese facts. Secondly, the House managers never even acknowledged them \nin their presentations. I raise them, my colleagues, not for \nideological or political purposes, but fundamental fairness demands \nthat we balance all of the forces at play in this case.\n  Now, much has also been made in this trial of the rights of Paul@ \nJones and her civil rights case--that we must protect Paul@ Jones' \nrights against the President of the United States.\n  My fellow colleagues--please let us have the decency to call this \ncase what it was. This was no ordinary civil rights case. It was an \nassault on the Presidency and on the President personally, and the \naverage American's understanding of that is one of the principal \nreasons our fellow citizens figured this case out long ago.\n  But there is more to it than that:\n  Mr. Starr became involved in the Paula Jones suit before he became \nindependent counsel.\n  He had contacts with Paula Jones' attorneys before his jurisidction \nwas expanded.\n  He wired Linda Tripp before his jurisdiction was expanded.\n  Many sources documented that without any expansion of jurisdiction, \nin 1997, he had FBI agents interrogating Arkansas State troopers, \nasking about Governor Clinton's private life--especially inquiring into \nPaula Jones.\n  After Paul@ Jones filed her suit in 1994, announcing it at a \nconservative political convention, and with new counsel affiliated with \nthe Rutherford Institute, her spokesperson said, ``I will never deny \nthat when I first heard about this case, I said, ``OK, good. We're \ngonna get that little slime ball.''\n  She later said: ``Unless Clinton wants to be terribly embarrassed, \nhe'd better cough up what Paula needs. Anybody that comes out and \ntestifies against Paula better have the past of a Mother Teresa, \nbecause our investigators will investigate their morality.''\n  Even Steve Jones, Paula Jones' husband, was part of an operation to \npoison the President's public reputation by divulging the secrets of \nhis personal life--threatening even to employ subpoena power to depose, \nunder oath, every State trooper in Arkansas who may have worked for the \nGovernor. Steve Jones pledged that: ``We're going to get names; we're \ngoing to get dates; we're going to do the job that the press wouldn't \ndo. We're going to go after Clinton's medical records, the raw \ndocuments, not just opinions from doctors. . .we're going to find out \neverything.''\n  Into all of this came Ken Starr, and the police power of our Nation.\n  This was not a civil rights suit in the context most of us would \nrecognize. Indeed, there existed an extended and secret Jones legal \nteam of outside lawyers--including George Conway and Jerome Marcus, \nexperts on sexual harassment and Presidential immunity, who ghostwrote \nalmost every substantive argument leveled by Paula Jones' lawyers; Ken \nStarr's friend Theodore Olson, and Robert Bork, the former Supreme \nCourt nominee, who together advised the Jones team; Richard Porter, a \nlaw partner of Ken Starr and former Bush-Quayle opposition research \nguru, who also wrote briefs for the Jones team; and the conservative \npundit and longtime Clinton opponent Ann Coulter, who worked on Paula \nJones' response to President Clinton's motion for a dismissal. The \nconnections between this crack--and covert--legal team, and Ken Starr's \nstaff and his witnesses--including Paul Rosenzweig, Jackie Bennett, and \nLinda Tripp--as well as familiar figures including Lucianne Goldberg, \nadd up to something far more than a twisted and disturbing game of six \ndegrees of separation.\n  I do not suggest that this was the right wing conspiracy bandied \nabout on the talk shows. But I ask you--are we not able to acknowledge \nthat this was a legal and political war of personal destruction--not \njust a civil rights case?\n  And we cannot simply dismiss the fact that all of this turmoil--these \nentire proceedings--arise out of this deeply conflicted, highly \npartisan, ideologically driven, political civil rights case with \nincredible tentacles into and out of the office of the independent \ncounsel.\n  Moreover, I remind my colleagues, Mr. Starr is supposed to be \nindependent counsel--not independent prosecutor. He was and is supposed \nto represent all of the Congress and nowhere do I remember voting for \nhim to make a referral of impeachment--a report of facts, yes--a \nreferral of impeachment, no.\n  Now there is a rejoinder to all of this. Nothing wipes away what the \nPresident did or failed to do.\n  So, some of you may say, So what? The President lied. The President \nobstructed justice. No one made him behave as he did. And yes, you're \nright. The President behaved without common sense, without courage, and \nwithout honor, but we are required to measure the totality of this \ncase. We must\n\n[[Page S1622]]\n\nmeasure how political this may have been; whether process was absurd; \nwhether the totality of what the President did meets the constitutional \nthreshold set by the Founding Fathers.\n  We must decide whether the removal of the President is proportional \nto the offense and we must remember that proportionality, fairness, \nrule of law--they must be applied not just to convict, but also to \ndefend--to balance the equities.\n  I was here during Iran-contra and I remember the extraordinary care \nSenator Rudman, Senator Inouye, and Senator Sarbanes exerted to avoid \npartisanship and maintain proportionality. I wish I did not conclude \nthat their example frankly is in stark contrast to the experience we \nare now living.\n  The House managers often spoke to us of principle and duty. And \nequally frequently we were challenged to stand up for the rule of law.\n  Well, we all believe in rule of law. But we also believe in the law \nbeing applied fairly, evenly--that the rule of law is not something to \ncite when it serves your purposes, only to be shunted aside when it \nencumbers.\n  But where was the managers' duty to their colleagues in the House--in \nthe committee--on the floor; where was the same self-conscious sense of \npain for what they were going through, when they denied a bipartisan \nprocess for impeachment; where was their commitment to rule of law in \ndenying the President's attorneys access to the exculpatory evidence \nwhich due process affords any citizen?\n  Rule of law is a process in a democratic institution, and there is a \nduty to honor process.\n  I believe the Senate has distinguished itself in that effort and I \nwant to express my deep respect for the strongly held views of all my \ncolleagues. Reasonable people can differ and we do, but we can still \ncome together in an affirmation of the strength of our Constitution.\n  Chairman Hyde says ``let it be done''--I hope it will be. Right \nrequires we be proportional as to all aspects of this case. I hope that \nwhat we do here will apply the law in a way that gives confidence to \nall our citizens, that everyone can look at the final result of our \ndeliberations and say justice was done. And we have called an end to \nthe process by which we savage each other, and are beginning to heal \nour country.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. Chief Justice, my friends in the Senate, each of the \narticles before us contains numerous examples of conduct, any of which \nas alleged would constitute grounds for the President's removal from \noffice. I have determined that most of these allegations have not been \nproven by clear and convincing evidence.\n  Let me now turn to the three, at least for me, remaining allegations. \nFirst is the allegation that the President obstructed justice. When? \nAfter his Paula Jones deposition, he had his two, by now very famous, \nconversations with Betty Currie. The facts are familiar, but they are \ntelling. On January 17, 1998, the President gave his deposition in the \nPaula Jones case. The Jones lawyers zeroed in on the relationship \nbetween Monica Lewinsky and the President. It was clear that the Jones \nlawyers had specific knowledge of the details of this relationship. In \nthe President's answers, he referred repeatedly to Betty Currie. \nFurther, counsel for Ms. Jones questioned the President in detail about \nBetty Currie, about her job, her hours at work, et cetera.\n  I submit that any first year law school student who attended that \ndeposition would know that Paula Jones was a prospective witness or \nwould know that Betty Currie was a prospective witness. In fact, 5 days \nafter the deposition Betty Currie was subpoenaed by the Jones lawyers. \nWhen the President returned to the White House after the deposition, he \nknew Betty Currie was a prospective witness.\n  Sure enough, within 3 hours of the conclusion of the deposition, the \nPresident called Betty Currie at home on a Saturday night and asked her \nto come to the White House the next afternoon, Sunday. During the \ncourse of that Sunday afternoon meeting, the President informed Betty \nCurrie that Monica's name came up during the deposition. According to \nBetty Currie's testimony, the President said to her--and we are all, of \ncourse, familiar with this--``You were always there when Monica was \nthere, right?'' ``We were never really alone, right?'' ``Monica came on \nto me and I never touched her, right?'' ``You could see and hear \neverything, right?'' ``She wanted to have sex with me and I couldn't do \nthat.''\n  We are all familiar with that, but I think most significantly, and to \nme the most telling thing, is that 2 or 3 days later the President \nagain spoke to Betty Currie and again made the same statements and used \nthe same demeanor.\n  The President does not dispute that he made these statements to Betty \nCurrie. He explained he was just trying to refresh his memory about \nwhat the facts were. The President's explanation is simply not \ncredible. It defies logic. Why would the President make five \ndeclarative statements to Betty Currie to ``refresh his memory'' when \nhe knew that Betty Currie could not possibly know whether most of these \nstatements were true? In fact, we know and the President knew that the \nstatements were false.\n  Betty Currie was a key potential witness who could contradict the \nPresident's sworn testimony in the Paula Jones deposition. She was also \nthe President's subordinate. On two separate occasions the President \nmade blatantly false statements to her to try to corrupt the due \nprocess of justice and with the intent to corruptly persuade her with \nthe intention to influence her testimony. This charge of obstruction of \njustice, I believe, has been proven by clear and convincing evidence, \nand I might add it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  Let me now turn to the second allegation, the allegation that the \nPresident committed perjury on August 17, 1998, when he testified about \nthese two post-deposition meetings with Betty Currie. I know there may \nbe some who are still struggling with the perjury charge. I simply say \nthis: If you believe, as I do, that the obstruction of justice charge \nis made based on the statements made to Betty Currie, then any fair \nreading of the grand jury testimony will indicate to you that you also \nhave to find he committed perjury.\n  Here is what he said:\n\n       What I was trying to determine is whether my recollection \n     was right and she [Betty Currie] was always in the office \n     complex when Monica was there and whether they thought she \n     could hear any conversation we had, or did she hear any. I \n     thought what would happen is it would break in the press, and \n     I was trying to get the facts down. I was trying to \n     understand what the facts were.\n\n  He also says, the President:\n\n       I was not trying to get Betty Currie to say something that \n     was untruthful. I was trying to get as much information as \n     quickly as I could.\n\n  I submit if the President is guilty of obstruction of justice in his \nstatements to Betty Currie, then clearly, clearly, he also must be \nguilty of perjury in his account of these events to the grand jury. The \ntwo findings are inextricably connected. One cannot reach the first \nconclusion without reaching the second. I believe it has been proven by \nclear and convincing evidence that the President committed perjury. And \nI might also add, I believe it has been proven beyond a reasonable \ndoubt. The evidence clearly shows that the President obstructed justice \nand then lied under oath about this obstruction in his grand jury \ntestimony.\n  Now, on the third charge, I believe the evidence shows that the \nPresident further perjured himself in the grand jury to avoid a perjury \ncharge in his prior deposition. This perjury had to do with the nature \nand details of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.\n  I know that many people have come to the well and have expressed \nconcern about how we got here, what brings us here today. I share some \nof those concerns. Congresses, beginning with this one, will have to \ndeal with the aftermath of this sorry affair: court cases that have \nweakened the Presidency, a discredited independent counsel law.\n  You will forgive me if I point out that I was one of the 80-some \nMembers of the House who voted against the independent counsel law when \nit came up--please forgive me for that aside. I voted against it \nbecause I share some of the same concerns we have heard expressed here \ntoday and yesterday. We also will have to deal with the Secret Service \nthat is now vulnerable to subpoenas and Presidents who are vulnerable \nto civil right suits while in office.\n  These are important issues, but I submit they are issues not for \ntoday\n\n[[Page S1623]]\n\nbut rather for another day. None of us wanted to be here, but we are \nwhere we are, the facts are what they are, and we know what we know. \nWhat we know is that the President obstructed justice and committed \nperjury. What must we do with this President who has obstructed justice \nand then committed perjury?\n  Obstruction of justice and perjury strike at the very heart of our \nsystem of justice. By obstructing justice and committing perjury, the \nPresident has directly, illegally, and corruptly attacked a coequal \nbranch of Government, the judiciary. It has been proven by clear and \nconvincing evidence that the President of the United States has \ncommitted serious crimes.\n  But while I have found specific violations of law, it is not \ninsignificant, in my final decision, that these specific criminal acts \nwere committed within a larger context, a larger context of a \ndocumented pattern of indefensible behavior--behavior that shows a \nreckless disregard for the law and for the rights of others.\n  I have concluded that the President is guilty of behaving in a manner \ngrossly incompatible with the proper function and purpose of his \noffice. In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee used those precise words \nto define an impeachable offense.\n  I have also concluded that the President is guilty of the abuse or \nviolation of a public trust. Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist No. 65, \nused those precise words to define an impeachable offense. What the \nPresident did is a serious offense against our system of government. It \nundermines the integrity of his office and it undermines the rule of \nlaw.\n  Here is what Thomas Paine said about the rule of law:\n\n       Let a crown be placed on the law by which the world may \n     know that, so far as we approve of monarchy, in America the \n     law is king.\n\n  The law is indeed king in America. There isn't one law for the \npowerful and one for the meek. That is what we mean when we say we are \na ``nation of laws.'' We elect a President to enforce these laws. In \nfact, the Constitution commands that the President ``take care that the \nlaws be faithfully executed.''\n  How can we allow a man who has obstructed justice and committed \nperjury to remain as the chief law enforcement officer of our country? \nHow can we call ourselves a nation of laws and leave a man in office \nwho has flouted those laws? We define ourselves as a people not just by \nwhat we hold up, not just by what we revere, but we also define \nourselves by what we tolerate. I submit that this is something we \nsimply, as a people, cannot tolerate.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, I will vote to convict the President on both \ncounts and to remove him from office.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my full statement be included in the \nRecord immediately following these remarks.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                Supplemental Statement of Senator DeWine\n\n       Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Senate: The President has \n     been impeached on two separate articles by the House of \n     Representatives.\n       Article I charges that the President willfully provided \n     perjurious, false and misleading testimony to the grand jury.\n       Article II charges that the President obstructed justice \n     (1).\n       Each article contains numerous examples of conduct, any of \n     which, it is alleged, would constitute grounds for the \n     President's removal from office.\n       I have examined each of these separate grounds or \n     allegations.\n       I have determined that most of these allegations have not \n     been proven by clear and convincing evidence (2).\n       I now turn to the three allegations that I believe have the \n     most merit.\n       I. I examine first the allegation that the President \n     obstructed justice when on January 18 and January 20 or 21, \n     1998, he related a false and misleading account of events \n     relevant to a Federal civil rights action brought against him \n     to a potential witness in the proceeding--Betty Currie--in \n     order to corruptly influence her testimony.\n       These are the essential facts: On January 17, 1998, the \n     President gave his deposition in the Paula Jones case. Jones' \n     lawyers zeroed in on the relationship between Monica Lewinsky \n     and the President. It was clear that the Jones lawyers had \n     specific knowledge of the details of this relationship. In \n     the President's answers, he referred--repeatedly--to Betty \n     Currie. For example, when asked whether he walked with Ms. \n     Lewinsky down the hallway from the Oval Office to his private \n     kitchen in the White House, the President said Ms. Lewinsky \n     was not there alone or that Betty was there (3); when asked \n     about the last time he spoke with Monica Lewinsky, he falsely \n     testified that he only recalled that she was only there to \n     see Betty (4); when asked whether he prompted Vernon Jordan \n     to speak to Monica Lewinsky, he stated that he thought Betty \n     asked Vernon Jordan to meet with Monica (5); and he said that \n     Monica asked Betty to ask someone to talk to Ambassador \n     Richardson about a job at the United Nations (6). Further, \n     counsel for Ms. Jones questioned the President in detail \n     about Betty Currie, her job, and her hours of work (7).\n       Anyone reading the transcript would have to expect the \n     Jones was the President's subordinate. On two separate \n     occasions, the President made blatantly false statements to \n     her to try to corruptly influence the due administration of \n     justice and to attempt to corruptly persuade her with the \n     intent to influence her testimony (8).\n       This charge of obstruction of justice has been proven by \n     clear and convincing evidence. (Let me state, for the record, \n     it has also been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.)\n       II. Let me now turn to the second allegation--that the \n     President committed perjury on August 17, 1998, when he \n     testified about these two post-deposition meetings with Betty \n     Currie.\n       Here is what the President said to the Grand Jury about \n     these meetings. He first testified that ``what I was trying \n     to determine was whether my recollection was right and that \n     she [Betty Currie] was always in the office complex when \n     Monica was there, and whether she thought she could hear any \n     conversations we had, or did she hear any . . . I thought \n     what would happen is that it would break in the press, and I \n     was trying to get the facts down. I was trying to understand \n     what the facts were'' (9).\n       The President also testified that ``I was not trying to get \n     Betty Currie to say something that was untruthful. I was \n     trying to get as much information as quickly as I could'' \n     (10).\n       When asked again about these statements, the President \n     said: ``I was trying to refresh my memory about what the \n     facts were . . . And I believe that this was part of a series \n     of questions I asked her to try to quickly refresh my memory. \n     So, I wasn't trying to get her to say something that wasn't \n     so'' (11).\n       He was asked this specific question; ``If I understand your \n     current line of testimony, you are saying that your only \n     interest in speaking with Ms. Currie in the days after you \n     deposition was to refresh your own recollection?'' The \n     President responded: ``Yes'' (12).\n       If the President is guilty of obstruction of justice in his \n     statements to Betty Currie, then clearly, he must also be \n     guilty of perjury in his account of these events to the grand \n     jury. The two findings are inextricably connected--one cannot \n     reach the first conclusion without also reaching the second.\n       It has been proven by clear and convincing evidence that \n     the President committed perjury (13). (Let me state for the \n     record that it has also been proven beyond a reasonable \n     doubt.)\n       III. The last allegation I would like to discuss is the \n     charge that the President committed perjury on August 17, \n     1998 before a Federal Grand Jury when he testified concerning \n     the nature and the details of his relationship with Monica \n     Lewinsky. Specifically, it is alleged that the President \n     committed perjury when he denied kissing or touching \n     certain body parts of Ms. Lewinsky. The President's \n     denials were quite specific on this point (14).\n       Monica Lewinsky's testimony is just as unequivocal. She \n     describes, in graphic detail, ten separate encounters where \n     such intimate activities occurred (15). Ms. Lewinsky's story \n     is corroborated by numerous consistent contemporaneous \n     statements she made to her friends and counselors. Her \n     testimony is further corroborated by phone logs and White \n     House exit and entry logs.\n       Counsel for the President have failed to show any motive \n     for Monica Lewinsky to lie about these details.\n       Conversely, the President clearly had a motive to lie. He \n     could not, in his Grand Jury testimony, admit such sexual \n     activity without directly contradicting his deposition \n     testimony in the Paula Jones case. Such a contradiction would \n     have subjected him to a perjury charge in that case. To avoid \n     a perjury charge concerning the Jones deposition, the \n     President had to carefully craft an explanation so it was \n     clear he did not touch Monica Lewinsky. He had to do this to \n     avoid falling within the definition of ``sexual relations'' \n     that had been given him in the Jones deposition.\n       The President's story defies common sense and human \n     experience. This is particularly true if you consider the \n     number of times the President and Monica Lewinsky were alone \n     and, in the President's words, engaged in ``inappropriate \n     behavior.'' It is also probative that the President's DNA was \n     found on Monica Lewinsky's dress.\n       The charge of perjury has been proven by clear and \n     convincing evidence. (Let me state, for the record, that it \n     has also been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.)\n       That concludes my findings of fact. The evidence clearly \n     shows that the President obstructed justice and then lied \n     under oath about this obstruction in his grand jury \n     testimony. He further perjured himself in the grand jury to \n     avoid a perjury charge in his prior deposition.\n       I wish this were not true. When I began my examination of \n     this case, I assumed that I\n\n[[Page S1624]]\n\n     would vote not guilty. I assumed that the evidence simply \n     would not be sufficient to convict.\n       Unfortunately, the facts are otherwise.\n       Many people, including myself, are deeply concerned about \n     how we got here. Congresses--beginning with this one--will \n     have to deal with the aftermath of this sorry affair: Court \n     cases that have weakened the Presidency; a discredited \n     independent counsel law; a Secret Service vulnerable to \n     subpoenas; and Presidents who are subjects to civil suits \n     while in office.\n       These are important issues. But they are issues for another \n     day.\n       None of us wanted to be here. But we are where we are. The \n     facts of the President's misconduct are what they are. We \n     know what we know. And although each of us may find some of \n     the acts more offensive than others, all of them are \n     disturbing, all are very serious, and all lead to the same \n     conclusion: The President obstructed justice and committed \n     perjury.\n       What must we do with this President who has obstructed \n     justice, and then committed perjury about that obstruction?\n       Obstruction of justice and perjury strike at the very heart \n     of our system of justice. By obstructing justice and \n     committing perjury, the President has directly, illegally, \n     and corruptly attacked a co-equal branch of government, the \n     judiciary.\n       The requirement to obey the law applies to us all, in all \n     cases. To say a President can obstruct justice is to put the \n     President above the law, and above the Constitution.\n       Perjury is also a very serious crime. The Constitution \n     gives every defendant a choice: Testify truthfully, or remain \n     silent. No one can be forced to testify in a manner that \n     involves self-incrimination. But a decision to place one's \n     hand on the Bible and invoke God's witness--and then lie--\n     threatens the judiciary. The judiciary is designed to be a \n     mechanism for finding the truth--so that justice can be done. \n     Perjury perverts the judiciary, turning it into a mechanism \n     that accepts lies--so that injustice may prevail.\n       It has been proven by clear and convincing evidence that \n     the President of the United States has committed serious \n     crimes. But although I have found specific violations of law, \n     it is not insignificant in my final decision that these \n     specific criminal acts were committed within a larger context \n     of a documented pattern of indefensible behavior--behavior \n     that shows a reckless disregard for the law and for the \n     rights of others.\n       I have concluded that the President is guilty of ``Behaving \n     in a Manner Grossly Incompatible with the Proper Function and \n     Purpose of (his) Office.'' In 1974, the House Judiciary \n     Committee used those precise words to define an impeachable \n     offense (16).\n       I have also concluded that the President is guilty of \n     ``the abuse or violation of (a) public trust.'' Alexander \n     Hamilton, in the Federalist No. 65, used those precise \n     words to define an impeachable offense.\n       What the President did is a serious offense against the \n     system of government. It undermines the integrity of his \n     office. And it undermines the rule of law.\n       Here's what Thomas Paine said about the rule of law: ``Let \n     a crown be placed (on the law), by which the world may know, \n     that so far as we approve of monarchy, that in America the \n     law is king'' (17).\n       The law is indeed king in America. There isn't one law for \n     the powerful and one for the meek. That's what we mean when \n     we say we are a nation of laws. We elect a President to \n     enforce these laws. The Constitution commands that he ``take \n     care that the laws be faithfully executed.''\n       How can we allow a man who has obstructed justice and \n     committed perjury to remain as the chief law enforcement \n     officer of our country?\n       How can we call ourselves a nation of laws, and tolerate a \n     man in office who has flouted those laws?\n       We define ourselves as a people not just by what we revere, \n     but by what we tolerate. This, in my view, is simply not \n     tolerable. I will vote to convict the President on both \n     counts, and to remove him from office.\n       I wish to acknowledge the assistance of many talented \n     individuals who have helped me address these difficult \n     questions of fact, law, and policy. I have been given able \n     counsel by Karla Carpenter, Helen Rhee, Louis DuPart, Robert \n     Hoffman, Laurel Pressler, and Michael Potemra on my Senate \n     staff; my good friends William F. Schenck, Curt Hartman, \n     Nicholas Wise, and Charles Wise; and my son and valued \n     adviser Patrick DeWine. All deserve my sincere thanks; of \n     course, the responsibility for the conclusions remains mine \n     alone.\n\n\n                                 notes\n\n       1. Specifically, the article charges that ``the President \n     has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of \n     justice and has to that end engaged personally, and through \n     his subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or scheme \n     designed to delay, impede, cover-up, and conceal the \n     existence of evidence and testimony related to a Federal \n     civil rights action brought against him in a duly instituted \n     judicial proceeding.''\n       2. Each Senator must determine the standard of proof to be \n     applied in judging an impeachment case. In weighing the facts \n     of this impeachment, I have used the standard of proof of \n     ``clear and convincing evidence''. The Modern Federal Jury \n     Instruction describes clear and convincing evidence as \n     ``proof (that) leaves no substantial doubt in your kind . . . \n     that establishes in your mind, not only the proposition at \n     issue is probable, but also that it is highly probable. It is \n     enough if the party with the burden of proof establishes his \n     claim beyond any `substantial doubt he does not have to \n     dispel every `reasonable doubt'.'' Modern Federal Jury \n     Instructions, section 73.01 (1998). I have rejected the \n     standard of proof ``beyond a reasonable doubt,'' which \n     applies to criminal cases. This standard is not applicable to \n     a case in which the defendant is threatened not with loss of \n     liberty but with loss of office. I have also rejected the \n     standard of ``preponderance of the evidence.'' This standard, \n     which would provide for conviction if the scales of evidence \n     were tipped ever so slightly against the President, would not \n     treat removal from office with the seriousness and gravity it \n     deserves.\n       3. Question: Do you recall ever walking with Jane Doe 6 \n     Lewinsky down the hallway from the Oval Office to your \n     private kitchen there in the White House?\n       Answer: . . . Now, to go back to your question, my \n     recollection is that, that at some point during the \n     government shutdown, when Ms. Lewinsky was still an intern \n     but was working the chief of staff's office because all the \n     employees had to go home, that she was back there with a \n     pizza that she brought to me and to others. I do not believe \n     she was there alone, however. I don't think she was. And my \n     recollection is that on a couple of occasions after that she \n     was there by my secretary Berry Currie was there with her. \n     She and Betty are friends. That's my, that's my recollection. \n     And I have no other recollection of that.\n       4. Question: When was the last time you spoke with Monica \n     Lewinsky?\n       Answer: I'm trying to remember. Probably sometime before \n     Christmas. She came by to see Betty sometime before \n     Christmas. And she was there talking to her, and I stuck my \n     head out, said hello to her.\n       Question: Stuck your head out of the Oval Office?\n       Answer: Uh-huh, Betty said she was coming by and talked to \n     her, and I said hello to her.\n       Question: I believe I was starting to ask you a question a \n     moment ago and we got sidetracked. Have you ever talked to \n     Monica Lewinsky about the possibility that she might be asked \n     to testify in this lawsuit?\n       Answer. I'm not sure, and let me tell you why I'm not sure. \n     It seems to me the, the--I want to be as accurate as I can \n     here. Seems to me the last time she was there to see Betty \n     before Christmas we were joking about how you-all, with the \n     help of the Rutherford Institute, were going to call every \n     woman I'd ever talked to, and I said, you know----\n       Mr. Bennett: We can't hear you, Mr. President.\n       Answer: and I said that you-all might call every woman I \n     ever talked to and ask them that, and so I said you would \n     qualify, or something like that . . .\n       Question: Was anyone else present when you said something \n     like that?\n       Answer: Betty, Betty was present, for sure. Somebody else \n     might have been there, too, but I said that to a lot of \n     people. I mean that was just something I said.\n       5. Question: You know a man named Vernon Jordan?\n       Answer: I know him well.\n       Question: You've known him for a long time.\n       Answer: A long time.\n       Question: Has it ever been reported to you that he met with \n     Monica Lewinsky and talked about this case?\n       Answer: I knew that he met with her. I think Betty \n     suggested that he meet with her. Anyway, he met with her. I, \n     I thought that he talked to her about something else. I \n     didn't know that--I thought he had given her some advice \n     about her move to New York. Seems like that's what Betty \n     said.\n       Question: So Betty, Betty Currie suggested that Vernon \n     Jordan meet with Monica Lewinsky?\n       Answer: I don't know that.\n       Question: I thought you just said that. I'm sorry.\n       Answer: No, I think, I think, I think Betty told me that \n     Vernon talked to her, but I, but my impression was that \n     Vernon was talking to her about her moving to New York. I \n     think that's what Betty said to me.\n       Question: Did you do anything, sir, to prompt this \n     conversation to take place between Vernon Jordan and Monica \n     Lewinsky?\n       Answer: I can tell you what my memory is. My memory is that \n     Vernon said something to me about her coming in, Betty had \n     called and asked if he would see her and he said he would, he \n     said he would, and then she called him and then he said \n     something to me about it . . .\n       Question: My question, though, is focused on the time \n     before the conversation occurred, and the question is whether \n     you did anything to cause the conversation to occur.\n       Answer: I think in the mean--I'm not sure how you mean the \n     question. I think the way you mean the question, the answer \n     to that is no, I've already testified. What my memory of this \n     is, if you're asking did I set the meeting up, I do not \n     believe that I did. I believe that Betty did that, and she \n     may have mentioned, asked me if I thought it was all right if \n     she did it, and if she did ask me I would have said yes, and \n     so if that happened, then I did something to cause the \n     conversation to occur. If that's what you mean, yes. I didn't \n     think there was anything wrong with it. It seemed like a \n     natural thing to do to me, But I don't believe that I \n     actually was the precipitating force. I think that she and \n     Betty\n\n[[Page S1625]]\n\n     were close, and I think Betty did it. That's my memory of it.\n       6. Question: Have you ever asked anyone to talk to Bill \n     Richardson about Monica Lewinsky?\n       Answer: I believe that, I believe that Monica, what I know \n     about that is I believe Monica asked Betty Currie to ask \n     someone to talk to him, and she, and she talked to him and \n     went to an interview with him. That's what I believe \n     happened.\n       Question: And the source of that information is who?\n       Answer: Betty. I think that's what Betty--I think Betty did \n     that. I think Monica talked to Betty about moving to New \n     York, and I, my recollection is that that was the chain of \n     events.\n       Question: Did you say or do anything whatsoever to create a \n     possibility of Monica Lewinsky getting a job at the U.N.?\n       Answer: To my knowledge, no, although I must say I wouldn't \n     have thought there was anything wrong with it. You know, she \n     was a--she had worked in the White House, she had worked in \n     the Defense Department, and she was moving to New York. She \n     was a friend of Betty. I certainly wouldn't have been opposed \n     to it, based on anything I knew, anyway.\n       7. Question: How long has Betty Currie been your secretary?\n       Answer: Since I've been president.\n       Question: How is her work schedule arranged? Does she have \n     a certain shift that she works, or do you ask her to work \n     certain hours the following day? Please explain how her \n     schedule is determined.\n       Answer: She works, she comes to work early in the morning \n     and normally stays there until I leave at night. She works \n     very long hours, and then when I come in on the weekend, or \n     on Saturday, if I work on Saturday, she's there, and normally \n     if I'm, if I'm working on Sunday and I'm having a schedule of \n     meetings, either she or Nancy Hernreich will be there. One of \n     them is always there on the weekend. Sometimes if I come over \n     just with paperwork and work for a couple of hours, she's not \n     there, but otherwise she's always there when I'm there.\n       Question: Have you ever met with Monica Lewinsky in the \n     White House between the hours of midnight and six a.m.?\n       Answer: I certainly don't think so.\n       Question: Have you ever met--\n       Answer: Now, let me just say, when she was working here, \n     during, there may have been a time when we were all--we were \n     up working late. There are lots of, on any given night, when \n     the Congress is in session, there are always several people \n     around until later in the night, but I don't have any memory \n     of that. I just can't say that there could have been a time \n     when that occurred, I just--but I don't remember it.\n       Question: Certainly if it happened, nothing remarkable \n     would have occurred?\n       Answer: No, nothing remarkable. I don't remember it.\n       Question: It would be extraordinary, wouldn't it, for Betty \n     Currie to be in the White House between midnight and six \n     a.m., wouldn't it?\n       Answer: I don't know what the facts were. I meant I don't \n     know. She's an extraordinary woman.\n       Question: Does that happen all the time, sir, or rarely?\n       Answer: Well, I don't know, because normally I'm not there \n     between midnight and six, so I wouldn't know how many times \n     she's there. Those are questions you'd have to ask her. I \n     just can't say.\n       8. There are two statutes regarding obstruction of justice \n     that are relevant to the facts of this case: 18 U.S.C. 1503 \n     which provides ``Whoever corruptly . . . influences, \n     obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, \n     or impede, the due administration of justice . . .'' shall be \n     guilty of the crime of obstruction of justice and 18 U.S.C. \n     1512 which provides ``Whoever knowingly . . . corruptly \n     persuades another person, or attempts to do so, or engages in \n     misleading conduct toward another person, with intent to--(1) \n     influence, delay or prevent the testimony of any person in an \n     official proceeding . . .'' shall be guilty of the crime of \n     witness tampering.\n       9. President's Grand Jury testimony, August 17, 1998, pp. \n     55-56.\n       10. Ibid., p. 56.\n       11. Ibid., pp. 131-2.\n       12. There are two federal perjury statutes relevant to the \n     facts of this case: 18 U.S.C. 1621 which provides that \n     ``Whoever--having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, \n     . . . or person, in any case, in which a law of the United \n     States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will \n     testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, . . . willfully \n     and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material \n     matter which he does not believe to be true . . .'' shall be \n     guilty of an offense against the United States; and 18 U.S.C. \n     1623 which provides that ``Whoever under oath . . . in any \n     proceeding before . . . any . . . court or grand jury of the \n     United States knowingly makes any false material declaration \n     . . .'' shall be guilty of an offense against the United \n     States. A statement is material ``if it has a natural \n     tendency to influence, or is capable of influencing, the \n     decision of the decisionmaking body to whom it is \n     addressed.'' A statement is no less material because it did \n     not or could not confuse or distract the decision maker. In \n     this case, the President made false statements to a grand \n     jury investigating ``whether Monica Lewinsky or others \n     suborned perjury, obstructed justice, intimidated witnesses \n     or otherwise violated federal law other than a Class B or C \n     misdemeanor or infraction in dealing with witnesses, \n     potential witnesses, attorneys, or others concerning the \n     civil case Jones v. Clinton.'' [January 16, 1998 Order of the \n     Special Division of the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia Circuit to expand the jurisdiction \n     of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr.] The President's \n     false statements strike at the very heart of what the grand \n     jury was investigating--perjury and obstruction of justice--\n     and are material.\n       13.

Question: So, touching, in your view then and now--the \n     person being deposed touching or kissing the breast of \n     another person would fall within the definition?\n       Answer: That's correct sir.\n       Question: And you testified that you didn't have sexual \n     relations with Monica Lewinsky in the Jones deposition, under \n     that definition, correct?\n       Answer: That's correct, sir.\n       Question: If the person being deposed touched the genitalia \n     of another person, would that be and with the intent to \n     arouse the sexual desire, arouse or gratify, as defined in \n     definition (1), would that be, under your understanding then \n     and now----\n       Answer: Yes, sir.\n       Question: --Sexual relations?\n       Answer: Yes, sir.\n       Question: Yes, it would?\n       Answer: Yes, it would. If you had direct contact with any \n     of these places in the body, if you had direct contact with \n     intent to arouse or gratify, that would fall within the \n     definition.\n       Question: So, you didn't do any of those three things----\n       Answer: You----\n       Question: --With Monica Lewinsky?\n       Answer: You are free to infer that my testimony is that I \n     did not have sexual relations, as I understood this term to \n     be defined.\n       Question: Including touching her breast, kissing her \n     breast, or touching her genitalia?\n       Answer: That's correct.\n       Grant Jury Testimony, President Clinton, 8/17/98, p. 94-95.\n       15.

Quoted in Maxwell Taylor Kennedy, ed., Make Gentle the \n     Life of This World: The Vision of Robert F. Kennedy. p. 106.\n\n  Ms. LINCOLN. Mr. Chief Justice, I thank you for your thoughtfulness \nand patience in these proceedings. I apologize that my back is to you.\n  I would also like to thank the majority leader and the minority \nleader. I have been awed by their patience--just as Job had the \npatience--to deal with all of us on our particulars that we have wanted \nto express here and the time constraints we have all felt. They have \ndone a wonderful job in accommodating all of us and certainly giving \nthese proceedings the dignity that I think all Americans have expected. \nI do appreciate that.\n  As the youngest female Senator in the history of our country, as a \nfarmer's daughter raised on the salt of the earth with basic Christian \nvalues, and as a young mother whose first priority in life is my family \nand the well-being of the world that they live in, I regret that my \nfirst opportunity to speak on the floor of this historic Chamber is \nunder these circumstances. And I am reluctant to speak here today. I \nhad intended to wait until I had more experience under my belt before I \naddressed my esteemed colleagues here. You will find that I am not \nquite as eloquent, or as lengthy, as my predecessor; but I will work on \nthat. But because of the historical aspects of this proceeding, I feel \nit is important that my thoughts and my judgments are expressed here \ntoday.\n  I, like President Clinton and my colleague, Senator Hutchinson, grew \nup in a small town in Arkansas, the oldest city in Arkansas. My \ncolleague expressed regret that the black and white of right and wrong \nis not as easy as it was growing up in that small rural community. I am \nreminded of the wisdom that my grandmother shared with me as a younger \nwoman returning home from college. I sat on our back porch and I \nexpressed to her my agony over what difficult times I was growing up \nin, and that she could not possibly know or understand because right \nand wrong were so much easier in her day.\n\n[[Page S1626]]\n\nShe quickly corrected me. Right and wrong becomes more difficult for \neach of us as we grow older, because the older we get the more we know \npersonally about our own human frailties.\n  I will not discuss the historical or the legal aspects about what we \nare doing here today and what we have been doing in these past weeks. I \nam not a lawyer; neither am I a historian. But I do want to thank each \nof you for your legal and your historical aspects, and the heartfelt \nwisdom and guidance that you have shared with me and with all of us as \ncolleagues.\n  I want desperately to cast the right vote for the people that I \nrepresent in Arkansas and for all the people of this great country. My \nheart has been heavy and I have deliberated within my own conscience, \nknowing that my decision should not come out of my initial emotion of \nanger toward the President for such reckless behavior, but should be \nbased on the facts. I have approached this both as a parent and as a \npublic servant, with the ultimate goal of doing what is right for our \ncountry. Since hearing of the President's misconduct, I have in no way \ntried to make excuses for the President or to defend such dishonorable \nbehavior. I have tried to determine how we should communicate to our \nchildren and our Nation that this very visible misconduct is \nunacceptable.\n  I have sought to reconcile in my mind what is appropriate \ncondemnation of such action and what is the best course of action for \nthe future of the Presidency and for this country. In my efforts to \nreach a fair conclusion, I have listened to the presentation of \nevidence from both sides. I have examined the historical intent of our \nFounding Fathers with regard to impeachment and my constitutional \nresponsibility as a Senator--however young I may be. I have sought the \ncounsel of colleagues, family, friends and constituents; and, of \ncourse, I have prayed for guidance for myself and for our country.\n  My home State of Arkansas has been under the scrutiny of a powerful \nmicroscope these past 6 years and, yes, regardless of how closely we \nmay be viewed, any of us, character does count in each and every one of \nus. But who of us in this Chamber does not have a chapter in our \nindividual books of life that we might be ashamed of or might regret--a \nchapter that might be revealed under such a powerful microscope, \nsomething we might be so ashamed of that we might mislead others to \nspare our families, our very children, the pain and sorrow?\n  Many have referenced what they would do if another President of their \nown party were in this situation, and they have indicated that they \nwould still vote the same.\n  But the true test, I say, is what each of us would want done if we \nwere in this President's position. How would we want to be treated? And \nwho of us would not go to great lengths to protect our children and our \nfamilies from the pain and embarrassment that we have seen over the \ncourse of these years?\n  I have also heard many people say that the President should be \nremoved from office because he set a poor example for our children. It \nis all of our responsibility to set an example for our children. It is \nnot just the President's. Ultimately, my husband and I have the \nresponsibility to teach our children. And we will teach our children \nthat misconduct is unacceptable. The President's conduct, however \ntroubling, does not take away my responsibility to teach what is right \nto my children. Future generations depend on each of us--not just the \nPresident--to teach and to lead.\n  Many are amazed that the general public, although they believe that \nthe President's behavior was wrong, does not want him removed from \noffice. I am not so amazed by this as I find it reassuring. This \nexpression of humanity and forgiveness from the real-life people of \nthis Nation that we represent reassures us that in our highly \ntechnical, fast-paced and somewhat impersonal society, we as a country \nbut, more importantly, we as human beings, are still equipped to handle \nthis or any other situation.\n  It is striking to me that we are at a crossroads in our Nation at \nthis entrance into the 21st century. We are being tested--not by war or \nby pestilence--but by conflict that is our own trouble from within. \nThis requires us to reflect on not only the lessons we have learned \nbut, more importantly, those that we want to leave. These lessons \nshould not only demonstrate how we as a country prosper, or how our \npeople advance, but how we treat and relate to one another as \nindividuals.\n  So today, after much careful thought and deliberation, I have come to \nthe conclusion that the President's actions, while dishonorable, do not \nrise to the level of an impeachable offense warranting his removal from \noffice. Impeachment was never intended to be a vehicle or a means of \npunishment. And the standard to prove high crimes and misdemeanors has \nnot been met by the disjointed facts strung together by a thread of \ninferences and assumptions that were presented here.\n  I have and will support a strong bipartisan censure resolution that \ntells the President and this Nation that the President's misconduct \nwith a subordinate White House employee was deplorable, and that future \ngenerations must know that such conduct will lead to a profound loss of \ntrust, integrity and respect. I believe there has to be consequences \nhere not only to demonstrate that something wrong has been done but to \nfinally bring closure to this ordeal, not just for us but also for the \nAmerican people.\n  Above all else, I believe we have been entrusted not only to be \njudges and jurors in this trial, but we have also been entrusted with \nthe last word. Senator Kerrey from Nebraska spoke strongly to this--\nthat the last word from this body's collective voice should be a \nchorus, loud and clear, of how great this land and our people are.\n  The President, actually in his own words from his 1993 inaugural \naddress, aptly replied. He said, ``There is nothing wrong with this \ncountry that cannot be fixed by what is right with this country.''\n  The most important thing we can do in the last days of this trial is \nto present the good in the U.S. Senate, in our government, and in our \nNation for the sake of our children and future generations. I hope and \npray that in the following weeks this body will grasp the leadership \nrole and to begin the process of healing our Nation, restoring pride in \nour Government, and inspiring faith in our leaders once again.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. Chief Justice, 26 years ago this past November, I was \nfirst elected to serve as a United States Senator from North Carolina. \nI had not believed it possible that I would be the first Republican \ndirectly elected to the U.S. Senate by the people of North Carolina.\n  I have often told many of the thousands of young people with whom I \nhave visited during the past 26 years that one of three commitments I \nmade to myself on that election night in November 1972 was that I would \nnever fail to see a young person, or a group of young people, who want \nto see me.\n  That was one of the most meaningful decisions I ever made. I am told \nthat I have met with something in the neighborhood of almost 70,000 \nyoung people according to our records for the past 26 years.\n  These are wonderful young Americans and I am persuaded that they are \nby all odds the most valuable treasure held by our country.\n  For the better part of the past year, these young people have almost \nwithout fail asked me about what they described as ``the problems'' of \nPresident Clinton. The vast majority of the time, the young people have \ntalked about the moral and spiritual principles so deeply etched in the \nhearts of those patriots whom we today call our Founding Fathers--or \nthe Framers of our Constitution--or both--when America was created.\n  So, in the first few weeks of this New Year 1999, I have begun my \nremarks to the young visitors with the recitation of two statements \nthat I sincerely believe have much to do with whether (and how) this \nblessed nation can and will survive.\n  The first statement: ``A President cannot faithfully execute the laws \nif he himself is breaking them.''\n  The second statement: ``The foundations of this country were not laid \nby politicians running for something--but by statesmen standing for \nsomething.''\n  The first statement was voiced by a former distinguished Democratic \nU.S. Attorney General of the United States, The Honorable Griffin Bell.\n\n[[Page S1627]]\n\n  The second was sent to me at Christmas time by a friend whose name \nand voice I suspect is familiar to most if not all Senators, my dear \nfriend, George Beverly Shea, who for so many years has thrilled and \ninspired millions as he stood beside Billy Graham and, singing with \nthat remarkably deep voice ``* * * How great Thou art.\n  Our trouble today is that the American people every day, must choose \nbetween what is popular and what is right. There is a constant deluge \nof public opinion polls telling us which way to go, almost without fail \nshowing the popular way.\n  But I must put it to you that we will, at our own peril, look to \nopinion polls to decide how we vote, when the real need is to look to \nour hearts, to our consciences and to our soul. So many decisions are \nmade in the Senate--be it on the fate of treaties, or legislation, or \neven presidents--decisions having implications, not merely for today, \nbut for generations to come, reminding that if we don't stand for \nsomething, the very foundations of our Republic will crumble.\n  Perjury and obstruction of justice are serious charges, as nobody \nknows better than you, Mr. Chief Justice, charges that have been proved \nduring the course of this trial. Therefore, the outcome of this trial \nmay determine whether America is becoming a fundamentally unprincipled \nnation, bereft of the mandates by the Creator who blessed America 210 \nyears ago with more abundance, more freedom than any other nation in \nhistory has ever known.\n  There is certainly evidence fearfully suggesting that the Senate may \nthis week fail to convict the President of charges of which he is \nobviously guilty. What else can be made of the behavior of many in the \nnews media whose eyes are constantly on ratings instead of the survival \nof America?\n  This trial has been dramatized as if it were a Hollywood movie \ntrivializing what should be respected as our solemn duty.\n  The new media technology is creating an explosion of media outlets \nand 24-hour news channels--and a brand new set of challenges.\n  A friend back home called me after an impressive presentation by one \nof the House managers and said, ``You know, Jesse, I found Asa \nHutchinson persuasive. But I had to tune into CNN to see whether it was \neffective--because I knew without the media's immediate stamp of \napproval, it wouldn't make a damn bit of difference.''\n  He had a valid point. Mr. Chief Justice, the awesome power of the \nmedia with its instant analysis is frightening. A political event \noccurs. The TV commentators immediately offer their lofty opinions; \novernight surveys are taken and many politicians are all too often \ncowed into submission by poll results.\n  In these proceedings, the House Managers of course provided a forest \nof evidence clearly indicating that the President of the United States \nperjured himself before a federal grand jury and obstructed justice. \nThe imaginative White House attorneys of course chopped down a few \ntrees here and there--and then proclaimed that the whole forest had \nburned down. The press gallery bought that whole concept.\n  Some years ago, there was a western movie starring Jimmy Stewart and \nJohn Wayne called ``The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.'' Jimmy Stewart \nportrayed a tender-footed young lawyer who ran afoul of the local \noutlaw, Liberty Valance.\n  Through a twist of fate, the character played by Jimmy Stewart \nreceived credit for ridding the county of the outlaw, even though it \nwas John Wayne's gun that brought Liberty Valance down. Yet it was \nStewart who rode public acclaim into a political career in the United \nStates Senate, while Wayne's character faded into obscurity.\n  Late in life, Stewart's character, still a Senator, returned from \nWashington to attend John Wayne's funeral. Stewart felt guilty, of \ncourse, that the truth of Wayne's heroism remained untold. He related \nthe entire story to the local newspaper, only to find the editor \ntotally disinterested.\n  ``When the legend becomes fact,'' the editor said, ``print the \nlegend.''\n  With its vote on Articles of Impeachment, the United States Senate is \npreparing to add to the legend of this whole sordid episode, Mr. Chief \nJustice. We have the facts before us and we should heed those facts \nbecause truth must become the legend.\n  We must not permit a lie to become the truth.\n  A couple of weeks ago, a Falls Church Episcopal minister, the \nReverend John Yates delivered a remarkable sermon to his parishioners. \nThe Reverend Dr. Yates had this to say about lying--and liars:\n\n       . . .if a person will lie, and develops\n       a pattern of lying as a way of life,\n       that person will do anything. Someone\n       who becomes good at lying loses his\n       fear of being discovered and will move\n       on to any number of evil actions. He\n       becomes arrogant and self-assured.\n       He comes to believe he is above the\n       law. You should fear people like this.\n       If such a person is caught red-handed\n       in a lie and confronted with the evidence,\n       that sort of man or woman will be\n       forced to admit it, but he won't like\n       it. It will make him angry and vengeful.\n       He will do all he can to move and leave\n       it behind. It's what the Bible calls\n       evidence of a seared conscience, not a\n       sensitive conscience, but a seared\n       conscience.''\n\n  If we allow the lies of the President of the United States of America \nto stand, Mr. Chief Justice, then I genuinely fear for America's \nsurvival.\n  Shortly before his death, Senator Hubert Humphrey visited this \nchamber for the last time. He knew it was the last time; we knew it was \nthe last time. Hubert's frail body was wracked with cancer, his steps \nwere halting, his voice feeble. But as he walked down the aisle, Hubert \nsaw me standing at my desk over there. He walked over to me, arms \noutstretched. Tears welled up in my eyes as Hubert hugged me softly \nsaying, ``I love you''.\n  I loved Hubert Humphrey too, Mr. Chief Justice, and I told him so.\n  Hubert and I disagreed on almost all policy matters, large and small. \nOften Hubert got the better of me in debates, a few times I did it to \nhim. But I loved Hubert Humphrey because we agreed on so much more--\nduty, honor, patriotism, faith and justice, the very essence of \nAmerica.\n  But we are obliged to ponder: What is the essence of America now? \nPublic life once was about honest debate on the merits, but it is now \noften a debate on the merits of honesty. And it was the President of \nthe United States who brought us where we are today.\n  In November of 1955, a young editor named William F. Buckley \nundertook an ambitious mission, now completed. Bill had decided to \nstart a conservative journal of ideas that would fuel an entire \npolitical movement.\n  In his ``Publisher's statement'', printed in the very first edition \nof National Review, he declared that his magazine ``stands athwart \nhistory yelling `Stop!' ''\n  Mr. Chief Justice, I plead with Senators to look around and see what \nBill Clinton's scandal has wrought. National debate is now a national \njoke. Children tell their parents and teachers that it's okay to lie, \nbecause the President does it. Our citizens tune out in droves, \npreferring the daily distractions of everyday life to an honest \nappraisal of the depths to which the Presidency of the United States \nhas sunk.\n  If this is progress and if this is the path history is taking, the \nSenate does have an acceptable alternative:\n  We simply must summon our courage and yell, ``Stop tampering with the \nsoul of America''.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. Chief Justice, I shall vote with a clear conscience \nnot to convict; rather, to acquit. And I have no better authority, of \ncourse, than my own Congressman, the manager, Lindsey Graham, when \nasked--and I will never forget it--by the Senators from North Carolina \nand Wisconsin: ``Under the law and the facts as then submitted at the \nend of the presentation, could reasonable people find differently with \nrespect to guilt?'' and Congressman Graham said, ``Why, of course,'' \nthat reasonable people could differ. And when the manager says there is \nreasonable doubt, that ends the case.\n  But let's remember that the impeachment clause is not intended to \npunish the President, but to protect the Republic. And the mistake in \nthis entire presentation on both sides, in my judgment, has been that \nthey have been trying a criminal case rather than a political case. \nWhat is really for the good of the country? I go to the understanding \nof the impeachment clause\n\n[[Page S1628]]\n\nwith respect to the author himself, George Mason, who said, ``must be \nguilty of high crimes and misdemeanors against the State.'' And Justice \nStory, in the midcentury, said that you could only impeach a President \nfor conduct that only the President could engage in.''\n  I will never forget, when they gave us the booklet, in the Nixon \nimpeachment, by the eminent professor of constitutional law, Charles \nBlack, he said that ``an impeachable offense must constitute a deep \nwrong to the country, an abuse of Presidential power.'' And everybody \nis talking about the polls and I think they are significant. When 80 \npercent of the people believe the President lied, and I believe he \ndid--not on the perjury charge, and not on the obstruction of justice, \nof course, but I believe he lied--and 80 percent of the people believe \nhe lied, but 70 percent of the people said keep him there. Why? Because \nthere wasn't a deep wrong to the country.\n  Let's get to it. Fooling around--that was what Monica Lewinsky called \nit--seen as sex and not, fooling around is not a crime. In fact, actual \nintercourse constitutes adultery, a crime which the managers, I would \nsay, are very familiar with.\n  We must remember that the fooling around was between consenting \nadults, both of them sexually experienced. Incidentally, in private \nboth of them are admitted liars. The President said he lied. Monica \nsaid that she grew up lying, was taught to lie.\n  But the managers said, ``Oh, this isn't about sex, this is about \ncrime.'' Really? I have been at the law too long. A sues B for the \ncrime of adultery, sexual misconduct. A and B both swear under oath and \nthrough their pleadings and their testimony and not before a halfway \ngrand jury. I always wondered, what if prosecutors went under oath \nbefore a grand jury? We would have to build new courthouses. But be \nthat as it may, they swear under oath in testimony before the judge who \nis trying the case on its merits, and A or B loses--whoever the loser--\nare they taken over to criminal court and charged for lying under oath \nand obstruction of justice?\n  I called a prosecutor in Congressman Graham's district, an 18-year \nexperienced prosecutor, a Republican, George Duckworth. I said, \n``George, have you ever taken lying under oath and obstruction of \njustice for sexual misconduct--have you ever taken that to criminal \ncourt?'' He said, ``It's never happened.''\n  I then went to the chief of all the State prosecutors, John Justice, \nwho happens to be from my State, and he said he had never heard of it.\n  So we are beginning to get to really what is going on, and that is \nnot to say, whoopee, everybody lies about sex and we can go ahead and \ndo that. We are not saying that at all, because the President can be \ncharged with it, as anybody can. It might be a rare case, but we ought \nto remember, rather than that one witness that they found--and I guess \nthey will find another one--but the Republican district attorneys who \ntestified on the House side, the deputy attorney general in charge of \nthe Criminal Division, William Weld, they said they would never bring \nthe case.\n  This case never should have been brought. Any respectable prosecutor \nwould have been embarrassed actually to so charge.\n  I will never forget when this commenced, David Pryor, the Senator \nfrom Arkansas almost 4 years ago, said: Wait a minute, 41 TDY FBI \nagents coming from one side of Arkansas to the other, 81 support \npersonnel, asking, ``Did you ever sleep with Bill Clinton? Do you know \nanybody who slept with him? I heard you know. We're going to take you \nbefore the grand jury.'' Locking up witnesses who did not testify to \nwhat they wanted attested to, paying off others and securing them and \nhiding the witnesses, and on and on; and thereafter subpoenaing the \nmother in tears; the Secret Service, the White House steward, the \nbookstore; some 4 1/2, 5 years and $50 million. And they come up with \nprivate sexual misconduct, in privacy. I know it is a public office. It \nis a public office, but we operate in private in our own offices. To \nmake this thing public after all of that expense and effort, I would be \nembarrassed as a prosecutor to bring it.\n  But not Kenneth Starr. He wasn't embarrassed. He should never have \ntaken it. A member of the Kirkland & Ellis law firm that had an \ninterest in the case, the Jones case, was participating at the time. \nInstead of recusing himself, he immediately started pursuing that case \nwith the official hand of Government.\n  Three years ago, seven former independent prosecutors expressed \ndismay at Starr's ethics. He was representing private clients inimical \nto the defendant, our President. The New York Times and other \nnewspapers editorialized that he ought to step aside. But instead of \nremoving himself, he continued to talk to political groups, all the \ntime leaking information and, yes, holding up his findings after 4\\1/2\\ \nyears until after the election and saying he found nothing with respect \nto Filegate, Travelgate, Whitewater, or any of the other cases for \nwhich he was commissioned--no embarrassment at all.\n  He injected himself so in the House proceedings to where finally his \nethics advisor, Sam Dash--who, of course, had been the principal \nparticipant in Watergate--had to resign. Then he injected himself over \nhere on the Senate side, and last weekend, during a key moment, of \ncourse, he said he was going to bring a criminal indictment. He leaked \nthat information.\n  So now we have the Justice Department investigating the independent \nprosecutor for his misconduct in the way he treated the main witness \nwith respect to her access to counsel. And you have an 8-to-1 vote in \nthe American Bar Association, which has been inserted; they say let \nthis independent prosecutor thing die.\n  Yes, we have, like Bryant said, broad overreaching of power. Not by \nClinton. He got into an elicit affair, and he tried like everybody else \nto cover it up. They sought to characterize it as lying, lying, lying, \nlying under oath. We had the chief of the managers; he lied not just \nfrom January till August, but 30 years --and others over there. The \nhypocrisy of that crowd.\n  Yes, we had broad overreaching of powers, mindful, of course, of the \nreason that we declared our independence 223 years ago--``sending \nhither swarms of officers to harass our people and seek out their \nsubstance.'' We have it now, and we have a chance to try it. We have an \nimpeachment case, but we are trying to impeach the wrong person. That \nis why the American people are as concerned as they are. That is what \nyou find in the polls that we keep talking about.\n  Let's understand, of course, that President Clinton debased the \nOffice of the Presidency, but let's say once and for all that we are \nnot going to have the political hijacking of the Office of the \nPresidency. Let's be certain when we vote this week that we don't \ndebase the Constitution.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. Chief Justice, our leaders, Senators Lott and Daschle, \nmy colleagues, my friends.\n  I doubt that I will ever know what the President of the United States \nwas up to when he lied to Betty Currie about the nature of his \nrelationship with Monica Lewinsky. Did the President lie to Ms. Currie \nbecause he didn't want her to know the truth about the affair? Did the \nPresident lie because he wanted her to defend him to the White House \nstaff? Did the President lie because he wanted her to repeat those lies \nunder oath? I doubt that I am ever going to get the real answer to \nthose questions.\n  But I believe I do know why it has been excruciatingly difficult for \nthe U.S. Senate to get to the bottom of the Currie controversy and \nseveral others that we have been wrestling with for weeks now. If I \nmight paraphrase a legal doctrine, this impeachment has become the \nfruit of a poisonous tree. This impeachment is a deadly plant that has \nflowered in the toxic soil of partisanship.\n  Given the highly contentious nature of the charges against the \nPresident, there is no question in my mind that the congressional \nleadership should have first established a bipartisan process for \ninvestigating the serious allegations.\n  It is my view that had the Founding Fathers decided that the first \nstep in the impeachment process would be taken by the U.S. Senate, I, \nSenator Lott and Senator Daschle would have produced a truly bipartisan \ninquiry, and we would have been able to find common ground on several \nof the key\n\n[[Page S1629]]\n\nissues. I don't think it would have produced a string of 100-0 votes, \nbut I believe that we would have had a more bipartisan result than what \nwe are going to see at the end of these deliberations. But this process \nbegan elsewhere. And I only want to make one comment about the House.\n  In my view, the House didn't even try to locate the common ground. \nAnd I use that word ``try'' specifically because it is one thing to \nwork your head off and not be able to bring people together. We have \nall been there. But that is not what went on in the House. They didn't \neven try to come together. It has been well documented, for example, \nthat the Speaker of the House and the House minority leader went for \nmonths at a time without even talking to each other. I am not going to \nassign fault to one or the other, but the fact is that by the end of \nlast year, our two major political parties were at war with each other \nover the allegations against the President.\n  This toxic partisanship is not, in my view, what public service is \nall about. I am a Democrat, for good reasons; and there are sincere, \nimportant differences of philosophy on issues between Senators on the \nrespective sides. But I have always felt doing what is right is more \nimportant than adhering to party dogma, and that is what I wanted to do \nin this matter.\n  The framers of the Constitution tried to give us a heads-up, a \nwarning about how the impeachment process could become unduly partisan.\n  Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist 65, said that the types of crimes \nfor which impeachment is the appropriate remedy are ``political.'' And \nhe added, ``the prosecution of them, for this reason, will seldom fail \nto agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into \nparties, more or less friendly, or inimical, to the accused.''\n  Thomas Jefferson, after almost having been kept from office in a \npartisan maneuver to replace him with Aaron Burr, set a deeply moving \ntone for looking beyond partisan confrontation in his first inaugural \naddress.\n  My colleagues and friends, it doesn't have to be all partisan all the \ntime. There is an alternative to slash-and-burn Government. And it is a \ntopic, I regret to say, that I know a fair amount about.\n  I won a very, very bitter Senate campaign against a man I am proud to \ncall my friend, my colleague, Senator Gordon Smith. Our part of the \ncountry had never seen a campaign so relentlessly negative. The whole \ncountry was watching the race to succeed Bob Packwood, but our campaign \ndidn't enlighten very many people. It brought out the worst in us. I \nwas so disgusted with it and what I had become, that with only a few \nshort weeks to go in the campaign I got rid of all my ads and basically \nstarted over.\n  Shortly after Senator Smith won his election, we got together and \ntalked about how we regretted the bitter nature of the campaign and \nwhat we had become. We decided from that point on we would put the \ngreater good, that of the people of Oregon, before any differences we \nmight have. The New York Times has started to call us the ``odd \ncouple''--a Jew from the city, a Mormon from the country. What kind of \nodds would you have given for that kind of relationship? But it works.\n  The votes that we are going to cast now are in little doubt. So I \nwish to express my concern that as the Senate completes its work on \nimpeachment that we have the ability to come back and tackle our other \nconstitutional responsibilities in a bipartisan fashion.\n  The public is tired of us being at each other's throats. They are \ntired of beltway politics that places toxic partisanship over the \npublic interest. Gordon Smith and I found out the hard way, and they \nare right.\n  Perhaps even at this late hour we can find our way to a little \nmiracle and wrap up this impeachment debate through a bipartisan \nstatement that makes it clear that each of us finds the President's \nconduct repugnant. If we miss that chance, let's keep looking for every \npossible opportunity to come together.\n  Senator Frist and I have a bipartisan education bill. No speeches \nabout that now, but every Governor in the country is for it. My point \nis that this impeachment process has brought us to a critical moment in \nour history. We can either rise to the occasion by forging new and \nhealthier ways to deal with our differences, or we can sink from the \ncollective weight of a partisan mess that we have all helped to create.\n  In arriving at my decision in this case, I kept coming back to the \nreality that Congress has not once removed a President, not once in 211 \nyears. The Constitution places the burden for such a grave step very \nhigh. Such a showing is not only to protect our Nation from partisan \nprosecution, but also to impose safeguards that are necessary, given \nthe severity of the potential punishment--a political death penalty, as \nHouse Manager Lindsey Graham said.\n  When I say ``punishment,'' I am not only referring to the punishment \nimposed on the President, but in particular to the destructive impact \nof such an action to our Nation as a whole. The House managers did not, \nin my view, prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. In my opinion, \nthey didn't get particularly close.\n  As stated earlier, I do find the President's lying to Betty Currie \nabout his relationship with Monica Lewinsky to be very, very \ndisturbing. The House managers have a hunch that the President's intent \nwas criminal. To borrow from House Manager Graham, they think it is \nlikely he was up to no good. My friends, hunches are not impeachable, \nnor should they be. If the evidence required to convict a President of \nthe United States in an impeachment trial is allowed to be less than \nthat required in a shoplifting trial, the constitutional foundation for \nthe Presidency will disintegrate before our very eyes. That is \nsomething that a few future Presidents in this body ought to consider \nfor just a moment.\n  Today I am going to vote to acquit on both counts. But I don't want \nthat to be my final contribution today.\n  I had a lot of farfetched dreams as a boy, but never once did I dream \nthat I could serve with all of you on the floor of the U.S. Senate. My \nparents fled Nazi Germany, and not all of my family got out. We lost \nfamily in Hitler's brutal Kristallnacht. So you might understand how I \ngrew up revering the greatness of America and the institutions of our \ndemocracy.\n  I will tell you, I never, ever believed that some skinny fellow with \nmodest oratorical skills and a face for radio--(laughter)--could have a \nchance to serve in the United States Senate.\n  What I want to be able to tell my grandchildren is that this was the \npoint in American history where we drew a line in the sand and said \n``no more'' to the excessive partisanship. A time when we said ``no \nmore'' to a brand of politics that each of us knows is bringing out the \nworst in good people. We have good leaders in the U.S. Senate--in Trent \nLott, in Tom Daschle--who have shown, in the last month, just how hard \nthey are willing to work to bring us together.\n  My friends, let the toxic partisanship end. Let it end here, and let \nit end now.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. Chief Justice, colleagues, first let me \nthank the Chief Justice for the dignity he has lent to this trial. I \nhave so appreciated the keenness of his intellect and the fairness of \nhis spirit.\n  I also join the Senator from Mississippi in thanking these two \nmagnificent men who lead this Chamber. I express to you, my colleagues, \nthe genuine affection that I feel for each of you. I am often asked the \nquestion, who do you like and who do you dislike? The ones I especially \nlike are very easy to name; and then when it comes to those I dislike, \nI cannot name one. I genuinely thank you for allowing me to participate \nwith you in this difficult and historic time.\n  I want to also thank my colleague, Ron Wyden, for his comments about \nme yesterday. When Ron and I ran for the Packwood seat, I think \nAmerica--and certainly Oregon--saw one of the most difficult and mean \nelections in the history of our State. Yet since that time, when I won \nthe Hatfield seat, Ron and I have become friends. It was a remarkable \nthing to both of us that by doing something as simple as having a joint \ntown hall meeting, Republican and a Democrat from the same State, it \nled to a full-page story in the New York Times. That is a sad \ncommentary.\n  The truth of the matter is that if Ron Wyden and I can become friends \nand do things to the credit and benefit of our State, so can you all. I \nactually believe\n\n[[Page S1630]]\n\nthat this trial will bring us closer together over time, and I hope lay \na foundation for some very good work in the 106th Congress.\n  Today, as Oregon's other Senator, I will cast two votes to convict \nand remove the President of the United States. Reaching this verdict \nhas been a very difficult ordeal for me, and I would like to tell you \nwhy. This Mr. Smith did not come to Washington, DC to oppose President \nClinton. Indeed, over the last 2 years there have been many issues, \nranging from the expansion of NATO to the promotion of free trade and \nthe fight against big tobacco, in which I have supported him and worked \nclosely with him. As I have met with President Clinton in his office, \ntraveled with him aboard Air Force One, he has consistently treated me \nwith great civility and has often inspired me with his eloquence.\n  To be in his presence is to experience the magic of his enormous \npersonal and political talents. It is the magnitude of his talents that \nmakes the magnitude of his misdeeds so disappointing. There can be no \ndoubt that President Clinton's conduct has made a mockery of most of \nhis words, or that his example has been corrosive beyond calculation to \nour culture and to our children. These personal conclusions, however, \ndo not provide a constitutional basis for his removal. Only his high \ncrimes could justify such a vote.\n  As you know, the House of Representatives argued two articles of \nimpeachment to us. Article I alleged four instances of perjury before a \ngrand jury; Article II alleged seven instances of obstruction of \njustice.\n  The House managers presented us with volumes of direct and \ncircumstantial evidence, and the White House lawyers worked skillfully \nto plant the seeds of reasonable doubt. But as the trial progressed, I \nfound that these seeds of doubt could only grow in proportion to my \nability to suspend common sense. I struggled throughout the trial to \nfind a way to acquit the President, if possible, on both or at least \none of the articles. But in the end, the facts kept getting in my way. \nThe stained blue dress. The Dick Morris poll asking whether the \nPresident could get away with perjury. Monica in tears in the Oval \nOffice being told she could not come back to the White House, and then \nbeing threatened that it is a crime to pressure the President in that \nway.\n  These facts and so many, many more led me to the logical, inescapable \nconclusion that what began as private indiscretions became public \nfelonies. It is even more ironic to me that I had not made up my mind \non article I until Mr. Ruff was in his closing arguments. We had just \nseen a videotape of Mr. Blumenthal saying that what he had been told \nwas a lie, and we saw Mr. Ruff play the videotape of Mr. Clinton's \ngrand jury testimony in which he said, ``What I told him was truthful \nbut misleading.'' That was a lie. And it was to a grand jury. It \nrevealed the calculations of his mind to obstruct justice. So common \nsense caught up with this juror.\n  Having concluded that the President did, indeed, commit perjury and \nattempt to obstruct justice, I had to ask if these offenses were high \ncrimes and misdemeanors as contemplated by the founders of this Nation. \nLike many of you, I found answers and comfort in the Federalist Papers \nEssay No. 65 written by Alexander Hamilton spoke directly to the \nultimate power of impeachment. You remember his words; I won't repeat \nthem. They will be in the Record many times.\n  When Senator Moynihan speaks, he is kind of like E.F. Hutton to me--I \nlisten. He had a wonderful statement yesterday about the kinds of \nimpeachable offenses. He cited the example of Justice Chase and \nPresident Johnson.\n  Senator Moynihan said that they were nearly impeached for their \nopinions, and to have done so would have been wrong. But it is not Bill \nClinton's opinions that affect my vote, it is his conduct.\n  Now, what is his conduct here? Last night, I think we all saw a \nbrilliant statement by Senator Edwards. I think we saw firsthand why he \nhas made so much money talking to jurors. We are seeing right now why I \nhad to make my money selling frozen peas. I went through the same \ncalculations as Senator Edwards, but I want to point out to you some \nvery different reasoning that led me to come down on the other side. \nSee, Senator Edwards is talking about what you do when you talk to a \njury about taking someone's life or their liberty. That is not what we \nare doing here. We are talking about protecting the public trust, \nprotecting the Constitution. So the arguments that he made ultimately \naren't the ones that we ought to be using to decide whether to remove \nPresident Clinton from office.\n  Now, what was so bad about President Clinton's conduct? The scales \nthat Senator Edwards spoke to us about, the fulcrum of justice, won't \nwork if President Clinton's conduct is sanctioned by this body or by \nany court. What President Clinton did was an attack on the Government, \nand specifically on the judicial branch of Government. You see, the \ncourts aren't supposed to write law, though, Mr. Chief Justice; they do \ntoo much of that. The courts don't have any power to raise taxes or \nappropriate money, and they can't raise an army or send a navy. They \ncan find the truth and act upon the truth. And if what Bill Clinton did \nis OK, then we have weakened the weakest of the branches of our \nGovernment, and that is a high crime under the Constitution.\n  I mentioned Mr. Hamilton. I think it is worth noting again that after \nthe publication of Federalist Paper No. 65, he became the Secretary of \nthe Treasury for President George Washington. He also became involved \nin an adulterous relationship with a woman named Maria Reynolds. Her \nhusband, upon learning of the affair, demanded of Mr. Hamilton a job at \nthe Treasury Department in exchange for keeping his silence and keeping \nMr. Hamilton from personal humiliation and political scandal. Hamilton \nrefused Mr. Reynolds a position on the public payroll, but he agreed to \npay him blackmail from his personal funds. News of this arrangement \nsoon found its way to Mr. Hamilton's opponents. When confronted, \nwithout being under oath, Hamilton confessed the truth and the whole \ntruth. He knew and respected the boundaries between the public and the \nprivate. He wrote them down for our country, and he lived his life \nwithin those boundaries, never veering recklessly over the line of \nimpeachability.\n  Consider the painful contrast this creates when measured against the \npublic life of President Clinton. When his scandalous conduct with a \nsubordinate female became entwined with another woman's civil rights \naction against him, which a unanimous Supreme Court ruled that she had \nthe right to bring, President Clinton set about to cover himself by \nlying to his staff, to his Cabinet, to the Congress, and to the \ncountry. And then, as the evidence so clearly shows, it demonstrates \nthat when brought to court--the weakest of our branches of Government--\nand placed under oath, he lied again and again and again.\n  Now, in the end, I suspect this place is going to divide pretty much \ndown the middle. I simply sound a warning note to raise your awareness \nto the fact that, ultimately, history and biographies and accounts yet \nto be revealed, facts yet to be uncovered, shoes yet to drop, will \ndetermine which of us voted right. But we have to decide on the \nevidence today, and the evidence to me is clear. Soldiers and sailors \nare discharged and punished for far less than what the President did. \nAnd judges are impeached by the House and removed by the Senate for far \nless than this. Indeed, we have to ask, is the President to be held to \na lower standard than those he sends to war or those he appoints to \ndispense justice? I cannot and I never will agree to such a low \nstandard for the Presidency of the United States.\n  Pollsters tell me how strongly Americans and Oregonians feel about \nthis case and how conflicted their feelings. Large majorities have \nconcluded that the President is guilty of the felonies charged. Yet, \nlarge majorities have also concluded that they do not want him to be \nremoved from office. These numbers remind me that the demands of \njustice are sometimes hard. I hope, however, that we remember obedience \nto the law will protect our liberties as nothing else can.\n  You see, political prisoners around the world look to the United \nStates for hope, not because we have a popular President, but because \nwe have laws to\n\n[[Page S1631]]\n\nprotect us from a popular President. If the President of the United \nStates is allowed to break our laws when they prove embarrassing to him \nor conflict with his political interests, then truly some public trust \nhas been violated, a trust which, as Hamilton says, ``relates chiefly \nto injuries done immediately to society itself.''\n  These felonies are impeachable offenses, and the Constitution makes \nour duty clear, even though it appears harsh and difficult. When the \nChief Justice calls my name, ``Senator, how say ye?'' I will say guilty \ntwice, because I refuse to say that high political polls and soaring \nWall Street indexes give license to those in high places to act in low \nand illegal ways. Perjury and obstruction of justice are high crimes, \nand they are utterly inconsistent with any Federal office--ours as \nwell, but especially with the office of the President of the United \nStates.\n  I harbor no illusions that two-thirds of the Senate will vote as I \nwill. Therefore, I hope the President will spend the balance of his \noffice repairing the damage done to his family, our democratic \ninstitutions, and our country. I will continue to support his proposals \nwhen I believe they are right, and I will oppose them when I believe \nthem to be wrong.\n  Now, the other man in this Chamber that I deeply regard--and because \nI am so junior I do it from a distance--is Senator Robert Byrd. I have \nappreciated his public struggle with this issue because it has \nvalidated my own struggle. When he said this last week on ``This Week \nwith Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts,'' he could have been speaking my \nwords: ``We have to live with the Constitution. We have to live with \nour consciences.'' And so do I.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I write this statement at my desk on the floor of the \nUnited States Senate. After weeks of listening, reading, reviewing, \nreflection, analysis and contemplation I have come to the conclusion \nthat I will vote to convict the President on both Articles of \nImpeachment.\n  The Constitution is very clear. It requires Members of the United \nStates Senate to vote for or against each Article of Impeachment. No \nimprovising. No substitutions. No censures. No findings of fact. The \ncompleteness of the charges against the President is powerful. The \nissue is abuse of power. Did the President abuse his power and \ntherefore violate the Nation's trust in him? We must remember that \ntrust is the only true currency elected officials have.\n  Perjury and obstruction of justice are not just federal crimes. When \ncommitted by an elected official they are abuses of power. When \ncommitted by a president they constitute an abuse of the highest power. \nThe standards and expectations for America's elected officials cannot \nbe calibrated. When elected officials bring down those standards and \nexpectations and violate the people's trust . . . they rip the very \nfabric of our Nation. There is then a dishonoring of the spirit that is \nthe guardian of American justice.\n  There can be no shading of right and wrong. The complicated currents \nthat have coursed through this impeachment process are many. But after \nstripping away the underbrush of legal technicalities and nuance, I \nfind that the President abused his sacred power by lying and \nobstructing justice. How can parents instill values and morality in \ntheir children? How can educators teach our children? How can the rule \nof law for every American be applied equally if we have two standards \nof justice in America--one for the powerful and the other for the rest \nof us?\n  What holds this Nation, this society, this culture, together? Yes, \nlaws are part of it. But it is really the strong moral foundation \nanchored by values and standards--the individual sense of right and \nwrong, personal responsibility, accountability for one's actions. This \nis what holds a free people together. Respect for each other--not \nbecause a law dictates that action--but rather because it's the right \nthing to do.\n  The President violated his Constitutional oath and he broke the law. \nHis crimes do rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors \nprescribed in the Constitution. The President's actions cannot be \ndefended by dancing on the pin head of legal technicality. Every \nAmerican must know actions have consequences. Even for presidents. All \nAmericans must have faith in our laws and know that there is equal \njustice for all. The core of our judicial process is the rule of law.\n  Americans deserve to always expect the highest standard of conduct \nfrom their elected officials. If that expectation is defined down over \ntime, it will erode the very base of our democracy and put our Republic \nin peril. That is the point of the Impeachment Clause of our \nConstitution . . . to protect the Republic. The Impeachment clause of \nour Constitution is there to ensure the fitness of an individual to \nhold high office. President Clinton's conduct has debased his office \nand violated the soul of justice--truth. He has thereby debased and \nviolated the American people. I have no other course to follow than to \nvote to convict President William Jefferson Clinton on both Articles of \nImpeachment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. Chief Justice, I rise today to announce, or \nsimply declare, that I will vote not guilty on both articles of \nimpeachment and to urge my colleagues to spare the country the \ninjustice of removing a President who has been twice elected to his \noffice by the American people, and whom they continue to trust to lead \nthem.\n  As a Senator, I have taken my trial oath very, very seriously. For my \npart, I have listened intently to the presentations, carefully \nconsidered the evidence, read everything that I could get my hands on, \nand thought about those matters carefully. I have read, and reread, the \nkey language of our Constitution, and thought long and hard about the \nwords of our Founding Fathers. In fact, the Constitution, in many ways, \ncame alive for me for the first time.\n  I am humbled by the wisdom and foresight of our founders as I \nstruggle through some of the most profound questions that our democracy \ncan present to us. What is the balance of power between the three \nbranches of Government? How do we measure public trust, and under what \ncircumstances may the Senate exercise its most devastating power--the \npower to overturn a popular election, and a power, therefore, to remove \na President from office?\n  As I confront these questions, I am acutely conscious of the terrible \ndisappointment of our Nation in the personal and public behavior of our \nPresident. No one of us would defend his actions. No one of us would \nsay that he is free of serious fault.\n  I have condemned in the strongest possible terms that I know how to \ndo--and I have done it to him directly--the conduct of the President in \nthe Lewinsky matter. And I share the sense of outrage that so many of \nmy constituents from West Virginia have shared with me.\n  When first confronted with this shameful affair, the President \ndeliberately misled his family, his friends, and his staff. He went on \nnational television, and, as far as I am concerned, lied to the \nAmerican people, and he walked a troubling line between truth and \ndeception in his sworn testimony, all in an effort to keep this scandal \nout of the humiliating glare of public scrutiny.\n  It is without question a very serious moral matter. But the ultimate \npower of the U.S. Senate--the power to convict and remove the President \nfor high crimes and misdemeanors--is not a power to pass moral judgment \nor render moral punishment. It is not even a power to render a judicial \nconviction or judicial punishment. The power of the Senate is drawn \ncarefully and narrowly by the Constitution of the United States, and it \nis a power to sit in judgment of a President only as a means of \nprotecting our Nation from great harm. It is a power to remove a \nPresident only if he has committed treason, bribery or other high \ncrimes and misdemeanors against the state.\n  As U.S. Senators, the Constitution must be our predominant guidepost. \nIt must be the compass we come back to at every point of hesitation or \nambiguity or doubt. ``Treason, bribery, or other high crimes and \nmisdemeanors''--these words are powerful, extraordinary, and carefully \ncrafted. We know how very grave treason and bribery are, and we know \nthat they involve a fundamental corruption of public office. But what \nabout high crimes and misdemeanors? The words, ``or other high crimes \nand misdemeanors,'' on its\n\n[[Page S1632]]\n\nface means high crimes and high misdemeanors.\n  Borrowing from my good friend, Senator Biden, the word, ``treason,'' \nwas defined in the Constitution itself. The word, ``bribery,'' was not. \nIt was a definition fixed at common law. These are both relatively \ndefinite terms. But ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' are indefinite.\n  In this setting, two rules of construction led us to add the word--\nMadison and Mason to add the word--``or other,'' in their famous \ncolloquy. The word, ``other,'' is, to me, fascinating, because what it \ndoes is essentially return us to the previous clause, which is \n``treason and bribery.'' It says that ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' \nmust necessarily be interpreted at the same level of, even though less \ndefinite than, ``bribery and treason.''\n  I think that is clear. I think that is uncontested.\n  As U.S. Senators, the Constitution must be, as I said, our guidepost. \nWe know from the statements of our founders that the phrase was \nintended in a very careful way--``high crimes and misdemeanors''--to \ncover only very grave and threatening abuses of Presidential duty and \npublic office.\n  The House managers contend, as did Independent Counsel Ken Starr \nbefore them, that in the course of hiding his illicit affair from the \nworld, the President committed perjury, obstruction of justice, and \nthose crimes are so serious that they constitute, by definition, high \ncrimes and misdemeanors, demanding conviction and immediate removal \nfrom office, something that has never happened before in the history of \nour Nation.\n  Most of this body are lawyers. And I think that most would agree--all \nof us would agree--the questions that must be answered by all of us in \nthis Senate are:\n  First, did the President commit perjury or obstruction of justice as \ncharged by the articles of impeachment?\n  Second, did the President's conduct rise to the level of high crimes \nand misdemeanors requiring removal?\n  The answer to both of these questions must be yes in order for the \nPresident to be removed from office. If either one of these questions \nfails, then by definition the Constitution demands that the President \nbe acquitted.\n  On the basis of the case presented over the last several weeks, on \nthe basis of the evidence and the deposition testimony, which I \nreviewed carefully and in full, and on the basis of the constitutional \narguments made by each side, I have concluded unequivocally that the \nanswer to both questions is no, and that the articles of impeachment \nare not well founded and must be rejected.\n  First and foremost, the House managers have utterly failed to prove \nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the President committed perjury or \nobstructed justice. Their case is speculative, circumstantial, and \ncontradicted by facts.\n  Admittedly, the burden of proof on the House managers is a very heavy \none.\n  We have a presumption in this country of innocence until proven \nguilty. And we have a presumption that national elections should be \nupheld.\n  With the fate of a twice-elected President before us in this Senate, \nI believe that the evidence must be the universally accepted standard \nof proof that is applied to other criminal cases. It must be proven \nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n  What does that mean, to prove a case beyond reasonable doubt? It \nmeans that it is proven to a moral certainty, that the case is clear, \nthat the case is concise. It means that, if there are doubts about the \nevidence, about the case, then he must be acquitted.\n  In the case presented by the House managers in the managers' version \nof the Clinton-Lewinsky story, there are many, many reasonable doubts.\n  There are the doubts about the articles themselves, which are \nambiguous, and what conduct actually purported to be criminal. There \nare serious doubts about the perjury charge in which the President \nopenly acknowledges his inappropriate behavior--and his effort to keep \nit secret from the Nation. There are doubts about the obstruction \ncharges in which the President is accused of a vast conspiratorial \nscheme to influence witnesses and testimony, even though everyone \ninvolved has denied that any such effort occurred. No person, \nregardless of the stature or position, could, or should be, convicted \non evidence that is so ambiguous and so questionable, and to my way of \nthinking ultimately, weak.\n  Second, and equally important, no matter how deplorable the \nPresident's conduct, the charges clearly do not meet the constitutional \ntest for conviction. They simply do not rise to the level of treason, \nbribery or other high crimes and high misdemeanors, as I would put it. \nAny other conduct, any other charges, are left to the judgment of the \npeople in casting of their votes, and to the judgment of the courts \nonce the President has left office.\n\n  Despite the anger that we feel at the President, despite misgivings \nthat we have about his honesty, despite his lies to the American \npeople, we cannot allow emotions--or, I might say, homilies--or \npartisanship to interfere with our judgment. The Constitution alone \nputs us in the box from which we dare not venture.\n  On impeachment, our constitutional history is well established. And \nwe in the Senate and across the Nation must abide by it, and abide by \nit strictly. We may remove a President only for using his great office \nto commit high crimes against the Nation, against the state, and \nagainst the people. There is no question in my mind that the President \nhas not done this. We would be derelict in our duties as Senators if we \nremoved him for anything less.\n  So, given the weakness of the evidence supporting the charges made by \nthe House, given the serious doubt in the Senate that the charges rise \nto the level of demanding removal from office, how do we find ourselves \nso far down this dangerous constitutional path?\n  How do we in the Senate find ourselves so close to the brink of \nremoving a President from office without clear and compelling evidence \nthat crimes against the state were committed?\n  How was an independent counsel investigation allowed to turn into a \nfive-year, $50 million crusade against the President?\n  And, why have we not been able to debate the real issues for the \nfuture of our nation--strengthening Medicare, reforming Social \nSecurity, ending the steel import crisis so West Virginia steelworkers \ncan get their jobs back?\n  It is clear that, in the end, justice will be done, and the \nConstitution will have protected the nation. I have been dismayed by \ngrowing partisanship, but the bottom line is that the President should \nnot be removed from office, and he will not be removed from office.\n  With the greatest respect for each of my colleagues, I must say there \nis something very wrong with the fact that we have been forced to take \nthis so far, and that the Senate has been rendered impotent for so \nlong. Even in the face of unceasing calls to end this investigation--\nfrom people in every state, from every background and political party--\nit has marched on relentlessly.\n  I do not believe that it was ever the will of the House of \nRepresentatives or the Senate to pursue these charges against the \nPresident to such great and absurd lengths. Yet we have--and in the \nprocess, a growing crack in the civil and moral foundation of our \ngovernment has been revealed.\n  It has become clear to me that a destructive momentum has taken hold, \nand supplanted the better judgement of some in this Congress and in \nthis country.\n  From the start, there has been a core of political interests that has \nsought every opportunity and pursued every tactic to attack this \nPresidency. Every President faces critics who will go to great lengths \nto fight his policies. But this President has faced unprecedented and \nunyielding attempts by a small group of determined activists to destroy \nhim, his family, and his work.\n  Unfortunately, these efforts at destruction have been aided by a \nmedia inside the beltway that has accepted nearly every rumor--proven \nor unproven--and splash it across the front page or put it at the top \nof the evening newscast. Ratings and revenues too often have taken \npriority over sound and judicious coverage of the news. Far from \nserving the public interest, this has only fueled the efforts of those \nwho have sought to undermine the reasoned pursuit of truth and justice.\n\n[[Page S1633]]\n\n  As I made clear earlier, none of this diminishes my belief that the \nPresident's actions were wrong and indefensible. His personal failures \nin this matter deserve our condemnation.\n  But his failures do not deserve--and have never deserved--the \nrelentless attempts at political and personal destruction that he has \nbeen subject to. His failures do not deserve--and have never deserved--\nthe triggering of a constitutional process that our Founding Fathers \nreserved for the most serious crimes against the nation.\n  I do not say this to fan the flames of partisan division. After all, \neach of us--Republican or Democrat--has and will make mistakes, and \neach of us must be held accountable for our mistakes. But no member of \nthe Senate, no member of the House, no elected official who serves this \ncountry to his or her best ability deserves the sort of insidious venom \nthat has become such a common part of our political discourse.\n  Let me also be clear that I say this not solely in defense of \nPresident Clinton--but principally in defense of civility and fairness \nin our political society. I say this with sincere hope that we can \nbring to an end the destructive momentum that has gripped this nation \nand this city. Because, as disturbing as the President's actions are, I \nam far more concerned by the fanaticism of those who have driven our \ngreat nation so close to the precipice.\n  For our system of Democracy to be successful for another two \ncenturies, it must be driven by people's best instincts--not their \nworst. It must be founded in moral strength and guided by civil \ndiscourse. We must, as Minority Leader Gephardt has so eloquently \nstated, end the politics of personal destruction.\n  I have great hope that we can do this, because as I look around, I \nsee a vast majority of Americans who are tired of good leaders being \ndestroyed by a vindictive minority. I see a majority of Americans who \nunderstand clearly that President Clinton should not be removed from \noffice for his deep personal failings. I see a majority of Americans \nwho know better than to believe everything and anything they hear in \nthe media.\n  The American people want us to seek the truth--they, in fact, demand \nit. But with equal vigor, they demand that we cast fair judgement; and \nthey demand that in seeking the truth, we do not seek to destroy lives \nand careers.\n  I believe that this Senate is prepared to cast a fair judgment on the \nPresident. We have been through a trying time in our nation's history--\na time that not one of us has relished or gained the least bit of \nsatisfaction from. We have all done our best to seek impartial justice, \nand I am certain that history will judge us well in this pursuit.\n  But history will cast a very severe judgement if we do not go forward \nwith the purpose of healing the wounds that this episode has caused, \nand restoring the moral and civil foundation of our political society.\n  I leave my colleagues with the wisdom of James Madison in Federalist \nPaper 62 when he addressed the important role of the Senate in \ntempering the actions of the House. ``. . . a senate,'' he wrote, ``as \na second branch of the legislative assembly, distinct from, and \ndividing the power with, a first, must be in all cases a salutary check \non the government.''\n  By dismissing these charges against the President, we will have done \nour duty to provide that salutary check, and we will have taken the \nfirst step in restoring the trust and faith of the people of this \nnation. It is time to do as the American people have asked: end this \nsad episode and get back to work.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. Chief Justice, it seems to be a prerequisite to \nspeak today for Senators to indicate the number of grandchildren each \nhas. I am proud to say Nancy and I have 11, but I won't indulge you \nwith naming each of them.\n  I along with all of you will soon cast our votes on the Articles of \nImpeachment that have been presented against President Clinton. With \nthe exception of voting on a declaration of war, I can think of no more \nserious vote that a Senator will cast in his or her lifetime than on \nremoving a President from office. History may or may not tell which \nvote is correct.\n  We have deliberated more than 67 hours. Five weeks ago, we met in the \nold Senate Chamber and on a 100-0 vote departed on a course of action \nto resolve this matter. The House Managers presented the case against \nthe President. White House counsel presented their defense and then \nSenators spent two days submitting questions to both sides. We then \nresolved the question of witnesses by allowing the use of videotapes, \nand heard final arguments from both sides on Monday. For the past two \ndays, Senators have offered their statements on this matter and we are \non target to reach a final vote on the two Articles in less than 48 \nhours. That's our Constitutional duty. I am proud and honored to have \nparticipated in this historical deliberation and respect each of you \nand your words.\n  There are several recollections about the facts in this case that \ntrouble me. Perhaps it is because I am not a lawyer.\n  In Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, she indicated that on the first day she \nmet the President, she was wearing a pink identification tag which \nprovides limited access to the White House. The President reached out \nand held it and said: ``Well, this could be a problem'' or words to \nthat effect. That tells us something about the President's character.\n  Furthermore, after the Lewinsky story broke in the press, the \nPresident had Dick Morris conduct a poll and when Morris told the \nPresident that the public would forgive him for adultery but not for \nperjury or obstruction of justice, the President responded: ``We will \njust have to win then.'' That tells me something else about the \nPresident.\n  It should also be noted that we would not be here if Ms. Lewinsky had \nnot kept the blue dress which contained the DNA evidence implicating \nthe President beyond a doubt. Without that dress, it would be an old \nstory of ``He said/She said.'' Think about that.\n  Finally, we are all held accountable for our actions. But the \nPresident refuses to be held accountable. And I have a problem with the \nrepeated reference from the First Lady that the President ministers to \ntroubled people, suggesting that Monica Lewinsky was such a person.\n  What has been happening, not just here in Washington, but all around \nthe country is something far more disturbing than the trial of a \nPresident. What we have been witnessing is a contest for the very moral \nsoul of the United States of America--and that the great casualty so \nfar of the national scandal is the notion of Truth.\n  Truth has been shown to us as an elastic commodity.\n  It has been said that this trial is not about the partisan political \ngamesmanship between the President's Democratic supporters and the \nRepublican forces on the other side, as the media would have you think.\n  Indeed one pundit said that more Americans get their ideas and \nreactions of the impeachment process from Jay Leno than they do from \nCNN.\n  The polls show Americans favoring leaving the President in office \nwhile they say Republicans appear bent on political suicide.\n  It has been said that Republicans see accountability, discipline and \npunishment as fundamental to the very structure of American society and \nthat the President ought to be the ``stern father'' image and a figure \nof moral authority.\n  Clinton's liberal supporters model American society on the \n``nurturing parent'' concept. To them, the Presidency is less a figure \nof moral authority than a helpful and powerful friend capable of doing \ngood.\n  Where were you when former President Nixon resigned? I wondered at \nthe time whether the republic would survive Watergate. We did survive \nand many believe we are a stronger nation because of that process.\n  In reaching a judgment in this case, I have reviewed the evidence \npresented by the House Managers and the able defense offered by the \nPresident's counsel. I have concluded that the President is guilty on \nboth Articles and that the two Articles more than satisfy the \nConstitutional standard of high crimes and misdemeanors.\n  I believe the President should be removed from office not because he \nengaged in irresponsible, reckless, and reprehensible conduct in the \nOval Office with a White House intern. He should be removed from office \nbecause\n\n[[Page S1634]]\n\nhe engaged in conduct designed to undermine the foundation, the very \nbedrock, of the concept of due process of law and, by extension, the \nvery notion of the rule of law.\n  There is no question in my mind that President Clinton intentionally \nprovided false and misleading testimony and committed perjury before \nthe Grand Jury when he told the Grand Jury he was ``trying to figure \nout what the facts were'' when he made the following statements to his \nSecretary Betty Currie the day after his civil deposition testimony:\n  ``I was never really alone with Monica, right?''\n  ``You were always there when Monica was there, right?''\n  ``Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?''\n  ``She wanted to have sex with me, and I cannot do that.''\n  Mr. Chief Justice, it is just not credible to believe that these \nstatements were designed to help the President elicit facts since he, \nand not Betty Currie, knew precisely the type of indiscreet activities \nhe and Monica Lewinsky had engaged in. To believe his testimony, one \nwould have to assume the unbelievable--that the President engaged in \nthese acts with Ms. Lewinsky in the full expectation that Ms. Currie \nwitnessed them.\n  It is only reasonable to assume that the President's statements to \nMs. Currie, made on more than one occasion (twice), were designed for \none, and only one simple purpose: to coach and influence her future \ntestimony. He was clearly seeking to undermine judicial proceedings by \nencouraging her to lie under oath for the single purpose of protecting \nhim. His conduct not only amounts to false testimony, but provides a \nclear basis to conclude that the President sought to obstruct justice.\n  Moreover, it is undisputed that gifts the President gave to Monica \nLewinsky, gifts that were subpoenaed in the civil suit against the \nPresident, were removed from Ms. Lewinsky's possession and hidden under \nBetty Currie's bed. There is no rational reason that Ms. Currie, on her \nown, decided to seek the return of the gifts. The only inference that a \nreasonable person could conclude is that the President asked Ms. Currie \nto retrieve the gifts in an effort to conceal evidence from the court; \nevidence that was clearly relevant in the civil case.\n  The House Managers have presented a credible case showing that the \nPresident increased the pressure on his friend, Vernon Jordan, to \nobtain a private sector job for Ms. Lewinsky when she was named as a \npotential witness in the civil case brought against the President. It \nwas not a coincidence of events, but rather a concerted effort by the \nPresident to secure employment for Ms. Lewinsky to ensure an affidavit \nthat did not harm his interests. Mr. Jordan is not at fault; he was \nmerely a pawn in the President's strategy to obstruct justice by \nencouraging the submission of a false affidavit from Ms. Lewinsky.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, the charges against the President concern perjury, \nwitness tampering, and concealing of evidence. These offenses clearly \nrise to the level of obstructing justice in the same sense that bribing \na witness to testify falsely or destroying evidence amount to \nobstruction of justice.\n  Today, there are 115 people incarcerated in federal prisons because \nthey were convicted of perjury. On Saturday, we heard the videotape \ntestimony of Dr. Barbara Battalino who had been an attorney and a VA \ndoctor. Her crime? She lied about sex under oath in a civil proceeding. \nHer penalty? She lost her medical license. She lost her right to \npractice law. She was fired from her job. The Clinton Justice \nDepartment prosecuted her for perjury and she was sentenced to 6 months \nof imprisonment under electronic monitoring and paid a $3,500 fine.\n  Should not the standard applied to Dr. Battalino apply to the \nPresident of the United States who swore an oath to ``preserve, protect \nand defend the Constitution,'' when he entered office and who swore an \noath to tell the truth when he testified before the Grand Jury? Or \nshould we condone the standard the President suggested in his Grand \nJury testimony, when he testified that he ``said things that were true, \nthat may have been misleading?'' Think about that statement!\n  Mr. Chief Justice, the foundation of our republic is that we are a \nnation governed by laws, not by men. For the rule of law to be \nmaintained, there must be a credible system of justice. Any effort to \nundermine the integrity of the judicial system subverts the principle \nof a nation of laws. And that system of justice depends for it very \nsurvival on maintaining the integrity of the oath that a person swears \nto tell the truth. Otherwise, if we turn a blind eye and allow people \nto lie under oath, destroy or hide evidence, or conspire to present \nfalse and misleading testimony, the entire notion of justice and truth \nbecome meaningless.\n  The President's counsel on Monday asked the question: ``Would it put \nat risk the liberty of the people to retain the President in office?'' \nUnfortunately, I believe the answer is yes. The right of an individual \nto a fair trial is endangered when the President of the United States \nremains in office having undermined the rule of law by obstructing \njustice and committing perjury.\n  Why should a citizen tell the truth in a court room when it does not \nserve his interest if the President is allowed to perjure himself \nbecause it does not serve his interest?\n  Why should an individual not try to influence the testimony of a \nwitness, when the President suffers no adverse consequences when he \nseeks to influence the testimony of a witness?\n  Does anyone in this chamber believe that obstruction of justice is \nnot a high crime and misdemeanor? Does anyone in this chamber believe \nthat President Clinton did not attempt to obstruct justice? If your \nanswer to those questions is in the affirmative, I believe you must, I \nrepeat, you must vote to convict and remove the President. That is the \nmandate of the Constitution.\n  Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution provides the President. . . \n. shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, \nTreason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n  There is nothing in the Constitution that says that a President with \na high popularity rating shall not be removed if convicted. The Framers \nbelieved that it was so important to rid the government of officials \nconvicted for such offenses that the Framers gave us no latitude on the \nquestion of removal from office.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, the nation has endured more than a year of what \nstarted as a scandal and turned into an obstruction of justice and an \nimpeachment. Again, had there been no DNA evidence, Ms. Lewinsky would \nhave been smeared in the press as a stalker and this case would be \nclosed.\n  I hope my colleagues in good conscience can put party aside and \nuphold the oath we took a month ago to be impartial in our judgment of \nPresident Clinton. This is a sad day for our contemporary country but a \nmagnificent day for the Founders who recognized that no man is above \nthe law and gave us the tools to remove those who violate the public \ntrust.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. Chief Justice:\n\n     I think my country sinks beneath the yoke,\n     It weeps, it bleeds,\n     And each new day,\n     a gash is added to her wounds.\n\n  I am the only remaining Member of Congress who was here in 1954 when \nwe added the words ``under God'' to the Pledge of Allegiance. That was \non June 7, 1954. One year from that day we added the words ``In God We \nTrust'' to the currency and coin of this country. Those words were \nalready on some of the coins. But I shall always be proud to have voted \nto add those words, ``under God'' and ``In God We Trust.'' They mean \nmuch to us today as we meet here.\n  This is my 47th year in Congress. I never dreamed that this day would \never come. And, until 6 months ago I couldn't place myself in this \nposition. I couldn't imagine that, really, an American President was \nabout to be impeached.\n  A few years ago, when my youngest grandson, who now is a Ph.D. in \nphysics, was just a little tot, he came up to my den and looked around \nand said, ``Papa, who made this mess?''\n  Now, Senators who made this mess? The mess was created at the other \nend of Pennsylvania Avenue. The House of Representatives didn't make \nit. The U.S. Senate didn't make it. But, nevertheless, we sit here \ntoday in judgment of a President.\n\n[[Page S1635]]\n\n  Mr. Chief Justice, I thank you for presiding over this gathering with \nsuch grace and dignity. But the Chief Justice is not here because he \nwanted to be. He is not here because we asked him to come. He is here \nbecause the Constitution commanded that he be here. Senators are not \nhere because you wanted to be here today.\n  We are here because the Constitution said that the Senate shall have \nthe sole power to try all impeachments.\n  Soon we will vote and, hopefully, end this nightmarish time for the \nnation. Like so many Americans, I have been deeply torn on the matter \nof impeachment. I have been angry at the President, sickened that his \nbehavior has hurt us all and led to this spectacle. I am sad for all of \nthe actors in this national tragedy. His family and even the loyal \npeople around him whom he betrayed--all have been hurt. All of the \ninstitutions of government--the presidency, the House of \nRepresentatives, the Senate, the system of justice and law, yes, even \nthe media--all have been damaged by this unhappy and sorry chapter in \nour nation's history.\n  The events of this last year have engendered so much disillusionment, \ndistrust, bitter division and discord among the people of the United \nStates. There can be, I fear, no happy ending, no final act that leads \nto a curtain call in which all the actors link hands and bow together \namid great applause from the audience. No matter what happens here, \nmany, many people will be left tasting only the bitter dregs of \ndiscontent.\n  I was proud of this Senate when, early last month, we gathered in the \nOld Senate Chamber to choose a path on which to proceed. We agreed on a \nConstitutional road map to follow during the early days of this trial. \nWe followed that road map to the letter, considering a motion to \ndismiss the proceedings as well as one to provide for the deposition of \nwitnesses. When there was a question or conflict, we decided the answer \ntogether. I commend Senator Daschle and Senator Lott for their untiring \nefforts to maintain bipartisanship.\n  Hamilton observed that impeachable offenses ``are those offenses \nwhich proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, \nfrom the abuse or violation of some public trust . . . to injuries done \nimmediately to the society itself.'' Hamilton also observed that the \nimpeachment court could not be ``tied down'' by strict rules, ``either \nin the delineation of the offense by the prosecutors (the House of \nRepresentatives) or in the construction of it by the judges (the \nSenate).''\n  Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story said: ``The jurisdiction is to be \nexercised over offenses, which are committed by public men in violation \nof their public trust and duties . . . injuries to the society in its \npolitical character,'' . . . ``such kind of misdeeds . . . as \npeculiarly injure the commonwealth by the abuse of high offices of \ntrust.''\n  Story observed that ``no previous statute is necessary to authorize \nan impeachment for any official misconduct,'' . . . because ``political \noffenses are so various and complex . . . so utterly incapable of being \ndefined, or classified, that the task of positive legislation would be \nimpracticable, if it were not almost absurd to attempt it.''\n  There are those--without my repeating the sordid details of what we \nhave all heard over and over and over again--there are those who say \nthat the President lied to protect his family. We all understand that. \nI have a feeling for that. But I can never forget his standing before \nthe television cameras and saying to the American people, what he said: \n``Now I want you to listen to me. . .'' Don't you Senators think that \nthat was a bit overdone if the purpose was to protect his family?\n  ``O, what a tangled web we weave when once we practice to deceive.''\n  Impeachment is a sword of Damocles that hangs over the heads of \npresidents, vice presidents, and all civil officers, always ready to \ndrop should it become necessary. But, the impeachment of a President is \nuniquely and especially grave. We must recognize the gravity and \nawesomeness of it, and act in accordance with the oath we took to do \n``impartial justice''. We are the wielders of this weapon, responsible \nfor using it sparingly and with prudence and wisdom.\n  This is only the second time that this nation has ever impeached a \nPresident. President Nixon resigned when it was made clear to him that, \nif impeached and tried, he would be convicted and removed from office. \nIn that instance, both the country and the Congress were of the same \nmind that the President's offenses merited his removal. It was not a \npartisan political impeachment; it was a bipartisan act. But where \npolitical partisanship becomes such an overwhelming factor as to put \nthe country and the Congress at odds, as it has with this impeachment, \nsomething draws us back. We must be careful of the precedent we set. \nOne political party, alone, should not be enough to bring Goliath's \ngreat sword out of the Temple.\n  Regrettably, this process has become so partisan on both sides of the \naisle and particularly in the House and was so tainted from the outset, \nthat the American people have rebelled against it. The President lied \nto the American people, and, while a great majority of the people \nbelieve, as I do, that the President made false and misleading \nstatements under oath, still, some two-thirds of the American people do \nnot want the President removed from office. I do not think that this is \njust a reflection of the American people's traditional bias for the \nunderdog, but rather, of the much more basic American dislike of \nunfairness. Many people, perhaps even most people, do not believe that \nthis process has been a fair process. They are further supported in \ntheir viewpoint by the polarization and partisanship so regrettably \ndisplayed in Congress.\n  Indeed, the atmosphere in Washington has become poisoned by politics \nand even by personal vendettas. As a result, perspective and a clear \nsense of proportion and balance have been lost by all too many people. \nAs a byproduct of the venom, a process intended to be serious and sober \nhas, instead, devolved into a virulent, off-color soap opera event, \nwatched by an incredulous people grown weary of its content.\n  We have known for weeks that the votes were not here to convict this \nPresident. And yet some wanted to press on, in a desperate attempt to \nbring witnesses onto the Senate Floor. What a dreadful national \nspectacle that would have been! That is one reason why I offered a \nmotion to dismiss the proceedings. Both the House Managers and the \nWhite House defense team had presented their case and had presented it \nwell. We had gotten into the 16 hours of questioning by Senators, while \nall went along swimmingly for a while, the proceedings began to \ndegenerate into a dueling press conference on both sides of the aisle. \nMoreover, the House Managers had already taken steps to begin the \ndeposition of Monica Lewinsky, and the fact that they were doing this \nbefore the Senate had even voted to depose witnesses, led me to believe \nthat it was time to call the whole thing off before the Senate slipped \ninto the snake pit of bitter partisanship like the House of \nRepresentatives had done. Always with a weather eye open concerning the \nimage of the Senate and its place in history, I made the motion to \ndismiss which had been provided for in the original agreement by 100 \nSenators on January 8, following the great bipartisan meeting we had \nall attended in the old Senate Chamber. Many people all around the \ncountry, as well as here within the beltway, misunderstood my reasons \nfor moving to dismiss. I didn't do that to protect Mr. Clinton, as some \npeople have so mistakenly surmised. I knew that the votes were not here \nthen to convict him, and we all know they are not here now. I just \ndidn't want the Senate to sink further into the mire. I did not want \nthis body to damage its own quotient of public trust the way the House \nand the White House have diminished theirs.\n  I called for these proceedings to be dismissed, out of genuine \nconcern for the divisive effect that an ultimately futile trial would \nhave on the Senate and on the nation.\n  The House Articles charged the President with having committed \nperjury. This word ``perjury''--lawyers can dance all around the head \nof a pin on that word. I won't attempt to dance all around on the head \nof the pin on the word ``perjury.'' The President plainly lied to the \nAmerican people. Of course, that is not impeachable, but he also lied \nunder oath in judicial proceedings.\n  Mr. Clinton's offenses do, in my judgment, constitute an ``abuse or \nviolation of some public trust.'' Reasonable\n\n[[Page S1636]]\n\nmen and women can, of course, differ with my viewpoint. Even though the \nHouse of Representatives rejected the second article that came out of \nthe Judiciary Committee, the evidence against Mr. Clinton shows that he \nwillfully and knowingly and repeatedly gave false testimony under oath \nin judicial proceedings.\n  When the President of the United States, who has sworn to protect and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States, and to see to it that the \nlaws be faithfully executed, breaks the law himself by lying under \noath, he undermines the system of justice and law on which this \nRepublic--not this ``democracy''--this Republic has its foundation.\n  In so doing, has the President not committed an offense in violation \nof the public trust? Does not this misconduct constitute an injury to \nthe society and its political character? Does not such injury to the \ninstitutions of Government constitute an impeachable offense, a \npolitical high crime or high misdemeanor against the state? How would \nWashington vote? How would Hamilton vote? How would Madison or Mason or \nGerry vote? My head and my heart tell me that their answer to these \nquestions would be, ``Yes.''\n  But the matter does not end there. The Constitution states, without \nequivocation, that the President, Vice President or any civil officer, \nwhen impeached and convicted, shall be removed from office. Hence, one \ncannot convict the President without removing him from office.\n  Should Mr. Clinton be removed from office for these impeachable \noffenses? This question gives me great pause. The answer is, as it was \nintended to be by the framers, a difficult calculus. This is without \nquestion the most difficult, wrenching and soul-searching vote that I \nhave ever, ever cast in my 46 years in Congress. A vote to convict \ncarries with it an automatic removal of the President from office. It \nis not a two-step process. Senators can't vote maybe. The only vote \nthat the Senator can cast, under the rules, as written, is a vote \neither to convict and remove or a vote to acquit.\n  So should I vote ``Guilty'' when my name is called, believing that \nPresident Clinton's offenses constitute high misdemeanors? Should I \nvote guilty and vote to remove him from office? Some critics may say--\nsome of my colleagues may say--they may ask, if you believe he is \nguilty, how can you not vote to remove him from office?\n\n  There is some logic to the question, but simple logic can point one \nway while wisdom may be in quite a different direction. It is not a \npopularity contest, of course. But remember our English forbears, who, \non June 20, 1604, submitted to King James I the Apology of the Commons, \nin which they declared that their rights were not derived from kings, \nand that, ``The voice of the people in things of their knowledge is \n[as] the voice of God.'' ``Vox populi, vox Dei.''\n  The American people deeply believe in fairness, and they have come to \nview the President as having ``been put upon'' for politically partisan \nreasons. They think that the House proceedings were unfair. History, \ntoo, will see it that way. The people believe that the Independent \nCounsel, Mr. Starr, had motivations which went beyond the duties \nstrictly assigned to him.\n  In the end, the people's perception of this entire matter as being \ndriven by political agendas all around, and the resulting lack of \nsupport for the President's removal, tip the scales for allowing this \nPresident to serve out the remaining 22 months of his term, as he was \nelected to do. When the people believe that we who have been entrusted \nwith their proxies, have been motivated mostly or solely by political \npartisanship on a matter of such momentous import as the removal from \noffice of a twice-elected President, wisdom dictates that we turn away \nfrom that dramatic step. To drop the sword of Damocles now, given the \nbitter political partisanship surrounding this entire matter, would \nonly serve to further undermine a public trust that is too much damaged \nalready. Therefore, I will reluctantly vote to acquit.\n  In 399 B.C., Socrates was convicted and sentenced by the Athenian \njury to die. If only 30 votes on that Athenian jury had switched, \nSocrates would not have been convicted. If only twenty Senators--or \nless--on my side of the aisle who are expected to acquit, were to \nswitch their votes, President Clinton would be convicted, and before \nthis coming Sabbath day, he would be removed from the Oval Office. \nPresident Clinton will be acquitted by the Senate; yet, he will not be \nvindicated.\n  The crowds will still cheer the President of the United States, but \nthe American people have been deeply hurt and, while they may forgive, \nthey will not forget. The pages of history will not be expunged--ever!\n  Be assured that there will be no winners on this vote. The vote cast \nby every Senator will be criticized harshly by various individuals and \nsundry interest groups. Yet, it is well for the critics to remember \nthat each Senator has not only taken a solemn oath to support and \ndefend the Constitution, but also to do ``impartial justice'' to Mr. \nClinton and to the nation, ``So help me, God''. The critics and the \ncynics have not taken that oath; only Senators have done so. Carrying \nout that oath has not been easy. That oath does not say anything about \npolitical party; politics should have nothing to do with it.\n  The frenzy of pro-and-con opinions on every aspect of this case \nemanating from every conceivable source in the land has made coming to \nany sort of ``impartial'' conclusion akin to performing brain surgery \nin a noisy, rowdy football stadium. It will be easy for the cynics and \nthe critics who do not have to vote, to stand on the sidelines and \nberate us. But only those of us who have to cast the votes will bear \nthe judgment of history.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, none of us knows whether the attitudes of the \nAmerican people will take a different turn after this trial is over and \nthis drab chapter is closed. ``Fame is a vapor; popularity an accident; \nriches take wings; those who cheer today may curse tomorrow; only one \nthing endures--character!'' It is the character of the Senate that will \ncount. And while the politics of destruction may be satisfying to some, \nthe rubble of political ruin provides a dangerous and unstable \nfoundation for the nation.\n  And yet we must move ahead. The nation is faced with potential \ndangers abroad. No one can foresee what will happen in Russia or in \nNorth Korea or in Kosovo or in Iraq. To remove Mr. Clinton at this time \ncould create an unstable condition for our nation in the face of \nunforeseen and potentially dangerous happenings overseas.\n  Preceding Senators have sounded the clarion note of separation of \npowers! I have sounded that same trumpet many times when the line item \nveto was before the Senate, but to no avail. Some of the voices that \nhave rung throughout this chamber in these deliberations, were \ncuriously still on that occasion. The Supreme Court of the United \nStates saved the Constitution and struck that law down. But the Supreme \nCourt has no voice in the decision that confronts the Senate at this \nhour. It is for the Senate alone to make. When these Senate doors are \nflung open, we must hope that the vote that follows will strengthen, \nnot weaken, our nation.\n  Let there be no preening and posturing and gloating on the White \nHouse lawn this time when the voting is over and done. The House of \nRepresentatives has already inflicted upon the President the greatest \ncensure, the greatest condemnation, that the House can inflict upon any \nPresident. And it is called impeachment! That was an indelible judgment \nwhich can never be withdrawn. It will run throughout the pages of \nhistory and its deep stain can never be eradicated from the eyes and \nmemories of man. God can forgive us all, but history may not.\n  Within a few hours, the mechanics of this matter will finally be \nconcluded. But it will not yet be over. For the nation must still \ndigest the unpleasant residue of these events. Mr. Chief Justice, \nhatred is an ugly thing. It can seize the psyche and twist sound \nreasoning. I have seen it unleashed in all its mindless fury too many \ntimes in my own life. In a charged political atmosphere, it can destroy \nall in its path with the blind fury of a whirlwind. I hear its ominous \nrumble and see its destructive funnel on the horizon in our land today. \nI fear for our nation if its turbulent winds are not calmed and its \nstorm clouds somehow dispersed. In the days to come, we must do all \nthat we can to stop the feeding of its vengeful fires. Let us heap no \nmore coals to fan\n\n[[Page S1637]]\n\nthe flames. Public passion has been aroused to a fever pitch, and we as \nleaders must come together to heal the open wounds, bind up the damaged \ntrust, and, by our example, again unite our people. We would all be \nwise to cool the rhetoric.\n  For the common good, we must now put aside the bitterness that has \ninfected our nation, and take up a new mantle. We have to work with \nthis President and with each other, and with the members of the House \nof Representatives in dealing with the many pressing issues which face \nthe nation. We must, each of us, resolve through our efforts to rebuild \nthe lost confidence in our government institutions. We can begin by \nputting behind us the distrust and bitterness caused by this sorry \nepisode, and search for common ground instead of shoring up the \ndivisions that have eroded decency and good will and dimmed our \ncollective vision. We must seek out our better natures and aspire to \nhigher things. I hope that with the end of these proceedings, we can, \ntogether, crush the seeds of ugliness and enmity which have taken root \nin the sacred soil of our republic, and, instead, sow new respect for \nhonestly differing views, bipartisanship, and simple kindness towards \neach other. We have much important work to do. And, in truth, it is \nlong past time for us to move on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1462-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECESS SUBJECT TO CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I call my colleagues' attention to a recent \nAssociated Press article on the Gulf of Mexico ``Dead Zone'', a large \narea that suffers from hypoxia, a lack of oxygen in the water. The \narticle states that researchers attending the national meeting of the \nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science say that fertilizer \nrunoff, which is rich in nitrogen, into the Mississippi River may \ncontribute to this oxygen deprivation.\n  Now, I do not know the extent to which this may be true. However, I \nam proud to say that the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi is working \non a high technology system that may hold the key to reducing farm \nnitrogen runoff while improving crop yield. The NASA Commercial Remote \nSensing Program Office at Stennis, in concert with the local farming \nindustry, are developing a new technique known as precision farming. It \nis, in real-time, bringing space age technology down to earth. \nPrecision farming uses emerging space-based instruments to monitor \nfarmers' soil content and computer technology to target fertilizer \nlevel to maximize crop yield. It will replace the widely used practice \nof fertilizing the entire crop to the same degree. Precision farming \nallows the farmer to give the land only what it needs.\n  Mr. Kenneth Hood of Perthshire Farms, in the Mississippi Delta town \nof Gunnison in Bolivar County, which is about 25 miles north of \nGreenville, monitors the health and soil consistency of his farm \nthrough NASA hyperspectral imaging techniques. This technique allows \nMr. Hood to add fertilizer as needed in specific portions of his \nacreage. It also helps him detect crop stress, before it can be seen \nthrough the human eye. Stennis Space Center's goal is to help Mr. Hood \nuse less fertilizer, lower his costs, and improve his crop yield.\n  This is a win for the farmer and a win for the environment. Most \nimportantly, this technology may yield a private sector incentive to \nvoluntarily reduce farm fertilizer runoff, a far better solution than \nimposing regulatory burdens or subsidizing inefficient and less \nproductive fertilizer limits.\n  NASA's Commercial Remote Sensing Program Office at Stennis Space \nCenter should be congratulated for developing practical and productive \ncommercial uses of this technology. This imaging technique, I believe, \nhas application in other areas as well, such as in highway planning, \nenvironmental monitoring, resource exploration, coastal zone management \nand timber management.\n  Mr. President, I encourage all of my colleagues with an interest to \ncontact Mr. David Brannon of the Stennis Space Center's Commercial \nRemote Sensing Program. I am sure many of my colleagues have farmers \nsuch as Mr. Hood who want to improve crop yield, decrease costs, and be \ngood stewards of the environment. All they need to do is call Stennis \nand learn about what Mississippi has to offer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1637-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1637-S1638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                A CALL FOR AN END TO THE POLITICAL WARS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today's votes on the Articles of \nImpeachment mark the end of a long and difficult journey. The story of \nthis impeachment process suggests a number of lessons on which I expect \nwe will all reflect individually and collectively for some time.\n  From the beginning of this process, I objected in the clearest terms \nto the President's legal hairsplitting and attempts to find a legal \nexcuse, or any excuse, for his deplorable personal conduct. In my view, \nthe President violated the public trust and brought dishonor to the \noffice he holds. For that, he will have to answer to the people of this \ncountry, and to history.\n  But it was every senator's duty to put personal views aside and \nrender impartial justice, based on constitutional standards and the \nevidence before the Senate. In my view, the President's conduct did \nnot, under our Constitution, warrant his removal from office. Others, \nacting on equally sincere motives, reached a different conclusion.\n  It is regrettable that something about this process led to a \nsituation, particularly in Washington, where sincere voices on both \nsides were too often drowned out by partisan voices--again, on both \nsides. But, if we listen to voices outside the nation's capital, the \nvoices of citizens rather than of partisans, those voices tell us that \nsomething has gone terribly wrong in our public discourse.\n  Those citizens see the impeachment process not as a solemn \nconstitutional event, which it assuredly was, but rather as another sad \nepisode in the sorry saga of a bitter, partisan and negative political \nprocess that runs on the fuel of scandal. In this sense, to many \nAmericans, the Starr investigation, and the impeachment process it \nspawned, were all too familiar.\n\n[[Page S1638]]\n\n  To much of the American public, this whole process was a long-\nrunning, 50-million-dollar negative ad built on personal attacks, the \nlikes of which Americans regret and reject.\n  I know this belief is shared by thousands of South Dakotans and \nmillions of Americans who hold widely varying views of what the outcome \nof the impeachment proceeding should have been--conviction or \nacquittal, removal or continued service by the President to the \nconclusion of his term.\n  What are the elements, the component parts, of this political process \nthat so many Americans judge to be merely an ugly spectacle \nincreasingly unworthy of their participation? What is making Americans \nso cynical that they are voting in record-low numbers and tuning out \nthe government meant to serve them?\n  Surely they must be concerned about the increased use, and misuse, of \nthe legal process in our political process. They are no longer certain \nthey can distinguish the proper application of the law to address real \nwrongdoing properly before the courts from the hijacking of the law to \nbludgeon political opponents and extend the battlefield of political \nattack.\n  In just ten years, we have seen the public careers of three House \nSpeakers, representing both political parties, destroyed by scandal. As \nthe process has escalated, Independent Counsels have pursued members of \nPresidents' cabinets--of both parties--and then, the President of the \nUnited States himself.\n  We have watched what we all acknowledge as ``the politics of personal \ndestruction'' threaten to devour our democratic ideals.\n  We can, and we will, argue the merits of the Independent Counsel \nstatute when it comes up for reauthorization this session. We can, and \nwe will, continue to pursue those who are corrupt, who use their \noffices for personal gain, or who otherwise deserve punishment.\n  But the law must be preserved as an instrument for the rendering of \njustice, not manipulated to serve as another readily accessible weapon \nto be used against political adversaries.\n  And the law should not become a substitute for elections. Political \nchoices in this country must remain in the hands of the people of this \ncountry, not conveyed to prosecutors and lawyers.\n  It is not the law's fault that there has been a hardening of position \nand a commitment to win at any cost. To paraphrase our former colleague \nDale Bumpers' now famous declaration in his presentation to the Senate, \n``Sometimes we want to win too badly.''\n  It is time for elected officials to ask themselves, ``Does anyone in \nthis country really feel as though they have been winners in this \nseemingly interminable process of investigation, media spectacle and \nimpeachment controversy?\"\n  I hope we can keep Senator Bumpers' words in mind and honor each \nother with the same degree of commitment that we bring to our \ndisagreements. I hope we can persuade without spinning; that we can \nargue without shouting; that we can dissent without dividing.\n  We can be passionate in our beliefs without prosecuting those who \nbelieve differently.\n  There were no winners in this impeachment process, but there were \nplenty of losers. There are good people who have accumulated thousands \nof dollars in legal bills as a result of the years of investigating the \nPresident. There are good people--on both sides of the aisle--whose \nprivate lives will be never be private again. There are people whose \nreputations have been battered and beaten.\n  I hope we can keep those people in mind and call for--indeed, insist \nupon--a truce in the political wars. We need now to think about what we \nowe ourselves, each other and the public as we move--and I hope without \nfurther delay--to address the true agenda of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1637-4", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SCOTT BATES, LEGISLATIVE CLERK OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \npay tribute to a fellow Arkansan, Scott Bates, who was struck and \nkilled by a car on Friday. He will be severely missed by all of us.\n  Scott was born in Pine Bluff, AR, where he was active in church and \nthe Boy Scouts, achieving the rank of Eagle Scout. He developed a love \nof politics, which he followed to Washington, D.C. For twenty-six \nyears, he performed dedicated service to the Senate, the last eight as \nthe Senate's Legislative Clerk, working tirelessly behind the scenes to \nensure the smooth operation of this institution. Scott was perhaps most \nvisible, or audible, in that role because of his deep, resonant voice, \ncalling the roll or reading legislation.\n  But Scott was much more than a dignifying voice to the Senate. He was \na husband, a father, a colleague, and a friend to many. I spent a lot \nof time in the last two years with him, learning the ways of the \nSenate. Scott and I would reminisce about our common Arkansas roots and \nour mutual love for the Razorbacks. He was a man of honor and humility, \nan encouragement to both staffers and Senators.\n  We pray for his wife Ricki. May the Lord grant her a swift recovery \nfrom her surgery. We pray for his three children, Lori, Lisa, and Paul, \nand for his family in Arkansas. May the Lord bring healing to them in \ntheir time of loss.\n  We grieve and we mourn his passing, for we know that the Senate and \nthe world will be a better place because of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1638-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1638-S1639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LINDA NERSESIAN\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to lament the \ntoo early death on December 19, after a four-year long battle with \nbreast cancer, of a former staff member and friend, Linda Nersesian, \nand to offer my heartfelt sympathy to her husband Robert Rae Gordon; \nher two children, nine year old George Raeburn Gordon, and six year old \nLouise Grace Gordon; her parents, Elsie Louise Nazarian and Serop S. \nNersesian; her brother Robert S. Nersesian; and the many, many friends \nand associates in the Congress and in Washington who will miss her \ngreatly.\n  Linda served in the Senate for six and one-half years, from August 4, \n1980 to January 5, 1987. She began her Senate career in the office of \nSenator Dole where she worked on energy and environmental issues. Linda \nleft Senator Dole's office in April of 1981 to join my staff as a staff \nattorney on the Subcommittee on Agency Administration of the Judiciary \nCommittee, which I then chaired. On the Subcommittee, Linda worked on a \nnumber of my highest legislative priorities. She consistently \ndemonstrated initiative, intelligence, and savvy.\n  When I became Chairman of the Subcommittee on Aging of the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee at the beginning of the 98th Congress in \n1983, the strong leadership qualities that Linda consistently \ndemonstrated in her work on the Administrative Practices Subcommittee \nmade her the perfect choice to serve as chief counsel and staff \ndirector of the Subcommittee on Aging. In that capacity, she organized \nthe office, recruited a staff, and oversaw the work of the Subcommittee \nthrough 1983. She was also responsible for advising me on major bills \nrelating to pharmaceutical drugs which were then under consideration by \nthe Committee.\n  In late 1983, Linda once again seemed the perfect choice for a \nposition of major responsibility, this time as the chief counsel and \nstaff director of the Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and \nProcedure. In that capacity, she was responsible for the child \nPornography Act. She also worked on what became the 1986 amendments to \nthe False Claims Act and the Equal Access to Justice Act. And she \nworked on defense procurement fraud. These were among my highest \nlegislative and oversight priorities at that time.\n  After serving as chief counsel of the Subcommittee until January 21, \n185, Senator Dole asked Linda to be the assistant secretary of the \nSenate. She served in that capacity until January 5, 1987, when she \nleft the Senate to become legislative counsel to the Pharmaceutical \nManufacturers' Association. In due course, Linda again assumed greater \nresponsibility, becoming the Association's vice president for \ngovernment relations, a position she held until she left to build her \nown consulting firm, the Columbia Consulting Group.\n  Mr. President, Linda Nersesian was a unique and remarkable \nindividual. Her\n\n[[Page S1639]]\n\npersonal qualities of drive, decisiveness, intelligence, common sense, \npersistence, and good humor were evident to all who came in contact \nwith her. It was easy to have confidence in Linda; she always knew what \nto do. Her manifest talents invariably led her to be entrusted with \npositions of responsibility. She contributed much in the time given to \nher. She will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1638-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FOOD AND MEDICINE FOR THE WORLD ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Ashcroft, Baucus, and Kerrey, in authoring the \nFood and Medicine for the World Act of 1999, which would limit the \nability of the U.S. government to unilaterally cut off our exports of \nfood and medicine to foreign countries.\n  The current stressed state of the farm economy is simply highlighting \na problem that has existed in U.S. foreign policy for years. That is, \nour law allows for the application of unilateral sanctions on the \nexport of food, despite extensive evidence that this policy is not only \nineffective in achieving U.S. foreign policy goals but also is harmful \nto American economic interests. This is especially the case for \nagricultural commodities, which are readily available from other \nsuppliers around the world and which are a critical component of the \nU.S. export portfolio. Moreover, limiting access to food and medical \nproducts is likely to have the most devastating effect on not the \ngovernments that the U.S. seeks to punish, but rather the poorest \ncitizens of the foreign country. Thus it makes sense for the U.S. to \nengage with the citizens of that country by supplying--either through \naid programs or through trade--basic life-sustaining products.\n  This bill takes a moderate approach and prohibits sanctioning of food \nand medical products only. It also provides a safeguard by allowing the \nprohibition to be waived if the President submits a report to Congress \nasking that the sanction include agriculture and medicine and Congress \napproves, through an expedited process, his request to sanction. \nTherefore, there is a mechanism to prohibit aid or trade from occurring \nwith a rogue foreign regime when there is broad national consensus that \nit is the right thing to do. I believe that this is a reasonable \nbalance between our need so stop using ineffective agricultural \nsanctions and our need to continue protecting U.S. foreign policy \ninterests.\n  It is high time we stop shooting ourselves in the foot by cutting off \nagricultural exports, which are a real building block of the U.S. \neconomy. I am encouraged that many members of the Senate have focused \ntheir attention on this problem and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on a bipartisan basis to enact needed reforms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1639-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        PRESIDENT CLINTON SHOULD FEEL THE DISDAIN OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senate has been held in the grip of \nthe impeachment trial for the past six weeks. The House has been \ninvolved in the impeachment process for the past six months, and the \nNation has been divided over the actions and fate of the President for \nmore than a year. We were not compelled to undertake this nearly \nunprecedented Constitutional remedy by partisanship, as some at the \nWhite House have suggested. We were driven to this point by Bill \nClinton and Bill Clinton alone.\n  Although I voted to acquit the President on the charges, I have no \ndoubt that if I served in the House, I would have voted to impeach him.\n  Chairman Hyde offered the White House every opportunity to defend the \nPresident, but the White House chose a different course. They chose to \nbelittle the charges against the President by suggesting that everyone \nlies about sex. They chose to accuse their accusers by attacking the \nmotives and integrity of the Judiciary Committee Republicans and by \ninsinuating that Judge Starr is a sex-obsessed prosecutor run amok. \nThey did not question the evidence on which the impeachment vote was \nbased.\n  With that evidence, the House Managers presented a powerful case \nagainst the President. As a result of their presentations, I am \nconvinced that the President acted to circumvent the law. The notion \nthat the President of the United States, the number one citizen of our \nnation, the man in whom the trust and respect of the country is meant \nto rest would deliberately maneuver around the laws of the land is \nreprehensible and should be condemned.\n  Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist Papers No. 65, said:\n\n       The delicacy and magnitude of a trust, which so deeply \n     concerns the political reputation and resistance of every man \n     engaged in the administration of public affairs, speak for \n     themselves.\n\nPresident Clinton betrayed that delicate trust. The House Managers \ntried to restore it. In the end, the witnesses, all of whom were \nsympathetic to or allies of the President, provided direct evidence \nthat failed to corroborate the House Managers' case. Removing the \nPresident from office in the face of a conflict between direct and \ncircumstantial evidence, in my view, would be mistaken. On that basis, \nI voted to acquit the President. Nevertheless, the House Managers and \nall of the evidence left me convinced that the President acted in a way \nthat is abominable. By voting for the censure resolution proposed by \nSenator Feinstein, the Senate makes clear that it does not exonerate \nthe President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1639-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1639-S1641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DEPOSITION PROCEDURES IN THE SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, no matter how each of us viewed the \nevidence in this case and no matter how each of us voted, we all share \ncommon relief that the impeachment trial of William Jefferson Clinton \nis concluding. In many respects, this was uncharted territory for us. \nWe all felt the weight of history and precedent as we made our \ndecisions on how to proceed.\n  With this in mind, the procedures developed and followed for the \nthree depositions taken during the course of this trial should be made \na part of the record of this impeachment trial. Unfortunately, the \ncomplete depositions were not introduced into evidence and made a part \nof the Senate trial record until after the vote on the Articles \nthemselves. Instead, at the request of the House Managers, the only \nparts introduced into evidence before then were those ``from the point \nthat each witness is sworn to testify under oath to the end of any \ndirect response to the last question posed by a party.'' (Cong. Rec., \nJan. 4, 1999, p. S1209).\n  I served as one of the six Presiding Officers at the depositions and \nattended all of them. In particular, I wish to thank Senators Dodd and \nEdwards for serving with me, and Senator DeWine with whom I jointly \npresided.\n  The decisions made during those depositions may provide guidance in \nthe future should any other Senate be confronted with challenges \nsimilar to those that we have confronted. For that reason, I have \ndescribed below the manner in which we reached our decisions and \nsummarize the issues we resolved both before and during the depositions \nof Monica S. Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan, and Sidney Blumenthal.\n  I thank Thomas Griffith, Morgan Frankel and Chris Bryant in the \nSenate Legal Counsel's office for their assistance during the \ndepositions and in preparing this summary of the rules and procedures.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Summary of Rulings and Procedures of the Presiding Officers During \n                Depositions in Senate Impeachment Trial\n\n\n                           A.

The Presiding \n     Officers rotated from deposition to deposition and the \n     Democratic Presiding Officers chose to rotate during the \n     deposition of Ms. Lewinsky, with Senator Leahy presiding over \n     the first part and Senator Edwards presiding over the latter \n     part of that deposition.\n       Attendance. All Presiding Officers were permitted to attend \n     each deposition in order to provide continuity in the \n     proceedings and ensure familiarity with both substantive and \n     procedural decisions made in each deposition.\n\n[[Page S1640]]\n\n       Consultation. All Presiding Officers present, whether or \n     not actually presiding over a specific deposition, were \n     invited to and did participate in discussions among Presiding \n     Officers about certain rulings.\n       Opening Script. The first Presiding Officer to speak was \n     from the majority party. He used an opening script that \n     summarized Senate Resolution 30 authorizing the depositions \n     and set forth the ground rules for the timing of lunch and \n     other breaks, the overall time allotted for the deposition, \n     the scope of the examination, basic guidelines for \n     objections, an explanation of the confidentiality \n     requirements, and the oath required to be administered to the \n     witness. (Lewinsky Depo. Tr., pp. 5-8). Senator DeWine \n     reiterated the confidentiality requirement at the close of \n     the Lewinsky deposition. (Id., p. 174, ln. 10--p. 175, ln. \n     7).\n       Senator Leahy made an opening statement at the Lewinsky \n     deposition to advise the witness of her rights, including \n     that she could correct the transcript, was free to consult \n     with her attorneys, and notified her of the criminal \n     liability she risked if she failed to tell the truth. \n     (Lewinsky Depo. Tr., pp. 9-11).\n       Senator Dodd stressed the confidentiality requirement \n     before the Jordan deposition (Jordan Depo. Tr., p. 9, lns. 6-\n     13).\n       Senator Edwards stressed the confidentiality requirement \n     again before the Blumenthal deposition (Blumenthal Depo. Tr., \n     p. 8, lns. 8-10).\n       Oath. The Presiding Officer from the majority party \n     administered the oath to the witness.\n       Advise of Rights. Senator Leahy in his opening remarks at \n     the Lewinsky deposition informed the witness that should she \n     fail to tell the truth, she would risk violating a federal \n     law (18 U.S.C.  Section 1001), prohibiting a person from \n     making any materially false statement in any investigation \n     or review by Congress (Lewinsky Depo. Tr., p. 9, Ins. 4-\n     13).\n       Breaks. Senator DeWine called for 5-minute breaks on the \n     hour, and Senator Leahy made clear that the witness should \n     just ask should she want a break. At the conclusion of each \n     break, Senator DeWine informed counsel of the time remaining \n     for questioning. (See, e.g., 145 Cong. Rec. S1218, S1222 \n     (Lewinsky)). Senator Thompson did likewise. (Id. at S1233, \n     S1238 (Jordan)). Senator Specter also called for 5-minute \n     breaks on the hour. (Id. at S1249, S1253; Blumenthal Depo. \n     Tr., p. 86, Ins. 6-7, 15). Senators Thompson and Dodd called \n     for a lunch break, even though Mr. Jordan asked to proceed \n     through lunch. (145 Cong. Rec. S1243). Brief breaks were also \n     taken when required to change the tapes, see, e.g., id. at \n     S1227, and during a power outage in the Jordan deposition. \n     (Id. at S1234).\n       Reserving Time for Re-direct and Re-Cross Examinations. The \n     parties were allowed to reserve time out of their four hours \n     for re-direct and re-cross examination, with the \n     understanding, however, that should the President's counsel \n     fail to cross-examine, the Managers would have no opportunity \n     to re-direct. Likewise, should the Managers fail to re-direct \n     following cross-examination, the President's counsel would \n     have no opportunity to re-cross.\n       During the Lewinsky deposition, the President's counsel \n     chose to ask no questions, which meant that the Managers \n     could ask no further questions. (Lewinsky Depo. Tr., p. 173, \n     Ins. 16-17). The President's counsel made a short apology to \n     the witness on behalf of the President, to which no objection \n     was made. (Id., p. 173, Ins. 18-20).\n       During the Jordan deposition, the President's counsel asked \n     very few questions on cross-examination, and the Managers \n     asked no questions on re-direct examination. (145 Cong. Rec. \n     S1245).\n       During the Blumethal deposition, the President's counsel \n     asked no questions on cross-examination, but the House \n     Managers were allowed to ask questions on a limited scope of \n     inquiry that had been the subject of an earlier objection \n     raised by the President's counsel. (Id. at S1253). Senators \n     Specter and Edwards had ruled that the Managers could develop \n     this line of inquiry at the conclusion of the deposition so \n     that should the objection be sustained, that portion of the \n     deposition could be easily excised (145 Cong. Rec. S1253). \n     Following the Managers' last line of inquiry, the President's \n     counsel was given the opportunity to ask, but had no \n     questions for Mr. Blumenthal. (Blumenthal Depo. Tr., p. 86, \n     Ins. 15-18).\n       Recalling the Witness. At the completion of the Managers' \n     direct examination of Ms. Lewinsky, Senator Edwards asked \n     Manager Bryant whether he had concluded his direct \n     examination. Manager Bryant said he had. When the President's \n     counsel determined not to ask any questions, Senators DeWine \n     and Edwards ruled that the deposition was completed, meaning \n     that the deponent could not be compelled to testify again \n     unless the Senate voted to issue another subpoena. (Lewinsky \n     Depo. Tr., p. 173, In. 24). In so doing, they expressly \n     rejected a request from Managers Bryant and Rogan to retain \n     jurisdiction over the witness should she be called as \n     a witness before the Senate. (Id., p. 176, lns. 4-8).\n       Off the Record. The Presiding Officers determined when to \n     go off the record. For example, Senator DeWine asked to go \n     off the record when conferring on a ruling with Senator \n     Leahy. (145 Cong. Rec. S1219 (Lewinsky)). Senator Edwards \n     also asked to go off the record to confer with Senator \n     Specter on a ruling. (Id. at S1250 (Blumenthal)). The parties \n     were also permitted to request that discussion take place off \n     the record. For example, upon Manager Bryant's request, \n     Senators DeWine and Leahy allowed discussion to take place \n     off the record. (Id. at S1229 (Lewinsky)). Similarly, upon \n     President's Counsel's request, Senators Specter and Edwards \n     allowed discussion to take place off the record. (Id. at \n     S1253 (Blumenthal)).\n       Videotape. Senator Leahy advised Ms. Lewinsky at the outset \n     for her deposition of how the videotape of the deposition \n     might be used, including admitted into evidence in the \n     impeachment trial and used in a way that it becomes public. \n     (Lewinsky Depo. Tr., p. 10, lns. 10-12). Her attorney noted \n     for the record that the witness objected to the videotaping \n     of the deposition, and to any subsequent public release of \n     the videotape of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony (Id. p. 12; lns. \n     19-22).\n\n\n                             b. the witness\n\n       Counsel May Not Coach the Witness. Senator DeWine \n     instructed Ms. Lewinsky's counsel not to coach or prompt the \n     witness in her answers. He stated that she was free to ask \n     for a break to confer with her counsel, but they should not \n     whisper responses to her while a question was pending. (145 \n     Cong. Rec. S1215).\n       Relying on Prior Grand Jury Testimony. Ms. Lewinsky \n     objected to certain questions, answers to which were already \n     in the record. After conferring, Senators DeWine and Leahy \n     instructed Ms. Lewinsky to answer a Manager's question even \n     though the question might have been covered in her grand jury \n     testimony, though she ``certainly can reference previous \n     testimony if she wishes to do that.'' Senator Leahy \n     particularly noted that there may be ``some nuances \n     different,'' and that she could ``correct her testimony.'' \n     (145 Cong. Rec. S1213).\n       Transcript Corrections. Senator Leahy made clear when he \n     presided at the Lewinsky deposition that the witness would be \n     given an opportunity to examine the transcript to make any \n     necessary corrections. By letter dated February 2, 1999, her \n     attorney provided a list of corrections to the deposition \n     (145 Cong. Res. S1229).\n\n\n               c. objections to questions and statements\n\n       Procedures for Resolving Scope Objections. Section 204 of \n     S. Res. 30 limited the examination of the witness to ``the \n     subject matters reflected in the Senate record.'' Prior to \n     the Lewinsky deposition, Senators DeWine and Leahy determined \n     that if objection was made to a question on the ground that \n     it exceeded the scope of the Senate record, the proponent of \n     the question would be allowed to identify where in the Senate \n     record the subject matter of the question was reflected. If \n     the proponent could satisfy the Presiding Officers that \n     the subject matter of the question was reflected in the \n     Senate record, the witness would be instructed to answer \n     the question.\n       In the Blumenthal deposition, a scope objection arose about \n     questions regarding White House strategy discussions of \n     Kathleen Willey. (145 Cong. Rec. S1249). Senators Specter and \n     Edwards decided to reserve that line of questioning until the \n     end of the deposition. When the issue arose again, after \n     consultation off the record, Senators Specter and Edwards \n     decided that questions regarding Kathleen Willey were within \n     the scope, but not questions regarding strategy sessions on \n     any other women. (Id. at S1253). Senators Specter and Edwards \n     also overruled Mr. Blumenthal's attorney's scope objection to \n     another area of questions after Manager Graham had offered \n     proof to support the scope of the question, and the attorney \n     had withdrawn his objection. (Id. at S1251).\n       Limitation on Scope. While S. Res. 30 broadly defined the \n     permissible scope of the deposition to cover subject matter \n     reflected in the Senate record, the Managers were reminded of \n     their representations to the Senate limiting the areas about \n     which they would examine the witnesses. For example, Senator \n     Leahy reminded Manager Bryant of his promise to the Senate \n     that he would not ask Ms. Lewinsky about her explicit sexual \n     relationship with the President. (145 Cong. Rec. 1213).\n       Objections by Counsel for the Witness. Senators DeWine and \n     Leahy ruled that counsel for the witness were allowed to \n     interpose objections to a question. (Id. at S1219 \n     (Lewinsky)).\n       Answering the Question Subject to an Objection. Section 203 \n     of S. Res. 30 required that ``the witness shall answer'' all \n     questions unless asserting a ``legally-recognized privilege, \n     or constitutional right.'' Senators DeWine and Leahy noted \n     all non-privilege objections and instructed the witness to \n     answer questions subject to the objection. (See, e.g., 145 \n     Cong. Rec. S1221 (Lewinsky)). The attorney-client privilege \n     was asserted by Ms. Lewinsky's counsel in response to one \n     line of questioning. Senators DeWine and Leahy instructed \n     Manager Bryant to postpone that line of questioning until \n     after Ms. Lewinsky's counsel could determine whether prior \n     grand jury testimony had waived the privilege for that \n     subject matter. (Id. at S1223). Her counsel later withdrew \n     the objection, and Manager Bryant resumed his line of \n     questioning. (Id. at S1224).\n       When Manager Graham asked about Mr. Blumenthal's prior use \n     of executive privilege, his attorney, Mr. McDaniel, objected \n     that the question was misleading because Mr. Blumenthal had \n     not raised the privilege, but the White House had. Senators \n     Specter and Edwards overruled the objection, and asked Mr. \n     Blumenthal to answer the question, which was rephrased. (Id. \n     at S1249).\n\n[[Page S1641]]\n\n       Compound or Ambiguous Questions. During the depositions, \n     there were numerous objections that the questions were \n     compound and/or ambiguous. In each instance, the Presiding \n     Officers invited the manager to rephrase the question and \n     allowed the questioning to proceed. (See, e.g., id. at S1214-\n     15 (Lewinsky), S1228 (Lewinsky), S1252 (Blumenthal)). At \n     one point in the Blumenthal deposition, Senators Specter \n     and Edwards ruled that Mr. Blumenthal could answer a \n     question to which Mr. McDaniel objected as confusing, if \n     the witness understood it. (Id. at S1250).\n       Open-ended Question. On cross-examination, Mr. Kendall \n     asked Mr. Jordan if he had anything to add to the testimony \n     he had given during his direct examination. That question \n     drew an objection from Manager Hutchinson that it was too \n     broad. Senator Thompson asked Mr. Kendall to rephrase the \n     question, which he did. (Id. at S1245).\n       Witness Statement. At the conclusion of his examination, \n     Mr. Jordan asked the Presiding Officers if he could make a \n     statement. (Jordan Depo. Tr., p. 157, lnc. 6-7). Manager \n     Hutchinson reserved the right to object if the statement \n     exceeded the scope of the inquiry. (Id. at ln. 18). Mr. \n     Jordan then offered a statement defending his integrity, \n     which the Presiding Officers allowed. (Id. at ln. 24--p. 158, \n     ln. 23). Manager Hutchinson did not assert an objection \n     following the statement.\n       Leading Questions. Senator Thompson allowed Manager \n     Hutchinson to ask a leading question of Mr. Jordan, since \n     according to S. Res. 30 these witnesses were to be treated as \n     adverse to the Managers. (145 Cong. Rec. S1238).\n       Questions Assuming Facts Not in Evidence. Senator Edwards, \n     with Senator Specter's concurrence, sustained an objection to \n     a Manager's question that contained premises and \n     characterized events not in the record, and Manager Graham \n     rephrased the question. (Id. S1252).\n       Speculation. Senators DeWine and Leahy asked Manager Bryant \n     to rephrase questions after objection was made that the \n     questions called for speculation about another person's state \n     of mind. (Id. at S1219, S1221 (Lewinsky)). Senators Specter \n     and Edwards asked Manager Graham to rephrase questions \n     calling for Mr. Blumenthal's speculation about other's \n     thoughts. (Id. at S1250, S1254).\n\n\n                           d. use of exhibits\n\n       Prior Production of Exhibits. Section 204 of S. Res. 30 \n     requires ``[t]he party taking a deposition . . . [to] present \n     to the other party, at least 18 hours in advance of the \n     deposition, copies of all exhibits which the deposing party \n     intends to enter into the deposition.'' Following objection \n     from the President's counsel that the Managers had failed to \n     comply with this requirement and had largely supplied only \n     general descriptions of exhibits without copies of specific \n     documents, Senators DeWine and Leahy ruled that this \n     provision required production to the witness, the other \n     party, and the Presiding Officers of a copy of any document \n     that would be used during the deposition. A general \n     description of the exhibit document did not comply with the \n     resolution. (Lewinsky Depo. Tr., p. 14, ln. 16--p. 19, ln. \n     5).  The President's counsel lodged an objection to the tardy \n     production of deposition exhibits by the Managers prior to \n     the Lewinsky deposition and again prior to the Jordan \n     deposition, but agreed to proceed after the Presiding \n     Officers assured them they would have an adequate \n     opportunity to review any documents used in the \n     deposition. (Jordan Depo. Tr., p. 13, lns. 22-25). \n     Senators Thompson and Dodd put the Managers on notice that \n     failure to comply with the Presiding Officers' ruling \n     would preclude the use of documents not provided in a \n     timely fashion at the Blumenthal deposition scheduled for \n     the next day. (Id. at p. 13, ln. 22-p. 14, lns. 6, 16-23).\n       Referring to Exhibits. Senators DeWine and Leahy ruled that \n     exhibits should be referred to according to their location in \n     the Senate record. (145 Cong. Rec. S1214, S1226 (Lewinsky)). \n     Senator Thompson reiterated that ruling in the Jordan \n     deposition. (Id. at S1236). Senator Thompson also ruled that \n     grand jury exhibits in the Senate record used as deposition \n     exhibits should not be referred to by their grand jury \n     exhibit number, but rather by an exhibit number for this \n     impeachment trial deposition. (Id.) Senators Thompson and \n     Dodd numbered the exhibits as they were presented, rather \n     than as they were admitted into evidence. (Id. at S1245).\n       Admitting Exhibits into Evidence. S. Res. 16, the agreement \n     which emerged from the Senate's January 8, 1999 bipartisan \n     caucus in the Old Senate Chamber, provides that the material \n     the House filed with the Senate on January 13, 1999 ``will be \n     admitted into evidence.'' Those materials were printed, \n     bound, and distributed to Senators. (See S. Doc. No. 106-3, \n     vols. I-XXIV (1999)). Thus, any documents in that Senate \n     record were already admitted into evidence by the time the \n     depositions were taken. S. Res. 30, which governs the conduct \n     of these depositions, provides that ``[n]o exhibits outside \n     of the Senate record shall be employed, except for articles \n     and materials in the press, including electronic media.'' \n     When a party used a document during a deposition that was in \n     the Senate record, there was no need to seek admission of \n     that document into evidence. The only non-record documents \n     that could be used in these depositions were ``articles and \n     materials in the press, including electronic media.'' A party \n     needed to seek the admission of those documents into evidence \n     before they could become part of the record.\n       During the Jordan deposition, Manager Hutchinson attempted \n     to use as an exhibit a summary of telephone records, a \n     redacted form of which was in the Senate record. Mr. Kendall \n     objected to the use of the exhibit because it had not been \n     properly authenticated. Senators Thompson and Dodd sustained \n     the objection. (145 Cong. Rec. S1241).\n       After the Manager's examination of Mr. Blumenthal, the \n     President's counsel, Lanny Breuer, presented various news \n     articles that were admitted into evidence. (Blumenthal Depo. \n     Tr., p. 81, ln. 8-p. 82, ln. 2). Manager Graham also \n     submitted articles into evidence, including those not \n     referred to by Mr. Blumenthal, and they were admitted after \n     Mr. Breuer withdrew his objection that no reference had been \n     made to the articles during the examination. (Id. at p. 82, \n     lns. 16-25, p. 83, ln. 15-p. 85, ln. 25).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1639-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1641-S1643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CORRECTION TO THE RECORD\n\n  In the Record of February 10, 1999, on page S1425-1427, the remarks \nof Senator Thomas appear incorrectly. The permanent Record will be \ncorrected to reflect the following:\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Helms, Mr. Murkowski, \n        Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Smith of New \n        Hampshire, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Nickles, and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 404. A bill to prohibit the return of veterans memorial objects to \nforeign nations without specific authorization in law; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n      s. 404: the veterans memorial physical integrity act of 1999\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nintroduce S. 404, a bill to prohibit the return to a foreign country of \nany portion of a memorial to American veterans without the express \nauthorization of Congress. The bill is identical to S. 1903 which I \nintroduced at the end of the last Congress.\n  I would not have thought that a bill like this was necessary, Mr. \nPresident. It would never have occurred to me that an Administration \nwould even briefly consider dismantling part of a memorial to American \nsoldiers who died in the line of duty in order to send a piece of that \nmemorial to a foreign country; but a real possibility of just that \nhappening exists in my state of Wyoming involving what are known as the \n``Bells of Balangiga.''\n  In 1898, the Treaty of Paris brought to a close the Spanish-American \nWar. As part of the treaty, Spain ceded possession of the Philippines \nto the United States. At about the same time, the Filipino people began \nan insurrection in their country. In August 1901, as part of the \nAmerican effort to stem the insurrection, a company of 74 officers and \nmen from the 9th Infantry, Company G, occupied the town of Balangiga on \nthe island of Samar. These men came from Ft. Russell in Cheyenne, \nWyoming--today's F.E. Warren Air Force Base.\n  On September 28 of that year, taking advantage of the preoccupation \nof the American troops with a church service for the just-assassinated \nPresident McKinley, a group of Filipino insurgents infiltrated the \ntown. Only three American sentries were on duty that day. As described \nin an article in the November 19, 1997 edition of the Wall Street \nJournal:\n\n       Officers slept in, and enlisted men didn't bother to carry \n     their rifes as they ambled out of their quarters for \n     breakfast. Balangiga had been a boringly peaceful site since \n     the infantry company arrived a month earlier, according to \n     military accounts and soldiers' statements. The quiet ended \n     abrupty when a 23 year old U.S. sentry named Adolph Gamlin \n     walked past the local police chief. In one swift move, the \n     Filipino grabbed the slightly built Iowan's rifle and smashed \n     the butt across [Gamlin's] head. As PFC Gamlin crumpled, the \n     bells of Balangiga began to peal.\n       With the signal, hundreds of Filipino fighters swarmed out \n     of the surrounding forest, armed with clubs, picks and \n     machete-like bolo knives. Others poured out of the church; \n     they had arrived the night before, disguised as women \n     mourners and carrying coffins filled with bolos. A sergeant \n     was beheaded in the mess tent and dumped into a vat of \n     steaming wash water. A young bugler was cut down in a nearby \n     stream. The company commander was hacked to death after \n     jumping out a window. Besieged infantrymen defended \n     themselves with kitchen forks, mess kits and baseball bats. \n     Others threw rocks and cans of beans.\n       Though he was also slashed across the back, PFC . . . \n     Gamlin came to and found a rifle. By the time he and the \n     other survivors fought their way to the beach, 38 US soldiers \n     were dead and all but six of the remaining men had been \n     wounded.\n\n\n[[Page S1642]]\n\n\n  The remaining soldiers escaped in five dug-out canoes. Only three \nboats made it to safety on Leyte. Seven men died of exposure at sea, \nand another eight died of their wounds; only 20 of the company's 74 \nmembers survived.\n  A detachment of 54 volunteers from 9th infantry units stationed at \nLeyte returned to Balangiga and recaptured the village. They were \nreinforced a few days later from Companies K and L of the 11th Infantry \nRegiment. When the 11th Infantry was relieved on October 18, by \nMarines, the 9th Infantry took two of the church bells and an old \ncannon with them back to Wyoming as memorials to the fallen soldiers.\n  The bells and cannon have been displayed in front of the base \nflagpole on the central parade grounds since that time. The cannon was \nrestored by local volunteers and placed under a glass display case in \n1985 to protect it from the elements. The bells were placed in openings \nin a large specially constructed masonry wall with a plaque dedicating \nthe memorial to the memory of the fallen soldiers.\n  Off and on since 1981, there have been some discussions in various \ncircles in Cheyenne, Washington, and Manila about the future of the \nbells, including the possibility of returning them to the Philippines. \nMost recently, the Philippine government--having run into broad \nopposition to their request to have both bells returned to them--has \nproposed making a copy of both bells, and having both sides keep one \ncopy and one original. Opposition to the proposal from local and \nnational civic and veterans groups has been very strong.\n  Last year, developments indicated to me that the White House was \nseriously contemplating returning one or both of the bells to the \nPhilippines. 1998 marked the 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Paris, \nand a state visit by then-President Fidel Ramos--his last as \nPresident--to the United States. The disposition of the bells was high \non President Ramos' agenda; he has spoken personally to President \nClinton and several members of Congress about it over the last three \nyears, and made it one of only three agenda items the Filipino \ndelegation brought to the table. Since January 1998, the Filipino press \nhas included almost weekly articles on the bells' supposed return, \nincluding several in the Manila Times in April and May which reported \nthat a new tower to house the bells was being constructed in Borongon, \nSamar, to receive them in May. In addition, there have been a variety \nof reports vilifying me and the veterans in Wyoming for our position on \nthe issue, and others threatening economic boycotts of US products or \nother unspecified acts of retaliation to force capitulation on the \nissue.\n  Moreover, inquiries to me from various agencies of the Administration \nsoliciting the opinion of the Wyoming congressional delegation on the \nissue increased in frequency in the first four months of 1998. I also \nlearned that the Defense Department, perhaps in conjunction with the \nJustice Department, prepared a legal memorandum outlining its opinion \nof who actually controls the disposition of the bells.\n  In response, the Wyoming congressional delegation wrote a letter to \nPresident Clinton on January 9, 1998, to make clear our opposition to \nremoving the bells. In response to that letter, on May 26 I received a \nletter from Sandy Berger of the National Security Council which I think \nis perhaps one of the best indicators of the direction the White House \nwas headed on this issue.\n\n  To head off any move by the Administration to dispose of the bells, I \nand Senator Enzi introduced S. 1903 on April 1. The bill had 18 \ncosponsors, including the distinguished Chairmen of the Committees on \nArmed Services, Foreign Relations, Finance, Energy and Natural \nResources, Rules, Ethics, and Banking; the Chairmen of five \nSubcommittees of the Foreign Relations Committee; and five members of \nthe Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. President, at this point let me dispose of a canard that was \nforwarded shortly after the time I introduced S. 1903 by those seeking \nthe return of the bells. They asserted that the bill was actually in \ncontravention of the wishes of the people of the State of Wyoming \nbecause the Wyoming Legislature, quoting a letter from the Ambassador \nof the Philippines dated April 3, 1998, ``supports the sharing of the \nbells.'' That statement, however, glosses over the real facts.\n  Wyoming's legislature is not a ``professional'' one--that is, the \nlegislators have other, full-time jobs and the Legislature only sits \nfor forty days at the beginning of each year and twenty days in the \nfall. When the Legislature meets, it is often to process an entire \nyear's worth of legislation in just a few weeks.\n  Like Congress, the Wyoming Legislature has a formal process of \nintroducing, considering, and then voting on bills which become law \nupon the signature of the chief executive--in this case the governor. \nAlso like Congress, the Legislature has a system for expressing its \nnon-binding viewpoint on certain issues through resolutions. But unlike \nCongress, the Legislature also has an informal resolution process to \nexpress the viewpoint of only a given number of legislators, as opposed \nto the entire legislative body, on a given topic; the vehicle for such \na process is called a ``joint resolution.''\n  In this process, a legislator circulates the equivalent of a petition \namong his or her colleagues. Support for the subject matter is \nsignified simply by signing one's name to the petition. Once the \nsponsor has acquired all the signatures he or she can--or wishes to--\nacquire, the joint resolution is simply deposited for the record with \nthe Office of the Governor; it is never--I repeat never--voted on in \neither House of the Legislature, nor is it signed by the governor. As a \nconsequence, it is not considered to be the position of, or the \nexpression of the will of, the Legislature as a whole, but only of \nthose legislators who signed it.\n  Although the bells are an issue of interest among some circles state-\nwide, the issue is not well-known all over Wyoming. I have heard from \nseveral of the signatories of the joint resolution on the bells that \nthey were not aware of the circumstances surrounding the bells at the \ntime they signed the joint resolution. In this regard, it is important \nto note that the sponsor of the joint resolution did not enlighten them \nabout the role of the bells in the unprovoked killing of 54 American \nsoldiers in Balangiga before they signed the document. Moreover, that \nfact was completely and purposefully left out of the wording of the \njoint resolution itself; the death of these American soldiers was \ncompletely glossed over. The closest the joint resolution gets to \nmentioning the surprise attack and resulting deaths is this, which I \nquote verbatim:\n\n       Whereas, at a point in the relationship, nearly one hundred \n     (100) years ago following the Spanish-American War, armed \n     conflict occurred between the United States and the \n     Philippines; and\n       Whereas, a particularly noteworthy incident occurred on the \n     island of Samar in 1901 during the course of that conflict; \n     and\n       Whereas, that incident involved the ringing of the Church \n     Bells of Balangiga on Samar to signal the outbreak of \n     fighting.\n\n  Imagine. The author of the joint resolution reduced the surprise \nattack and horrible deaths of fifty-four soldiers to a seemingly \ninnocent, benign ``noteworthy incident.'' So while some may rely on the \njoint resolution as though it were the ``voice of Wyoming'' in support \nof their position, an examination of the actual facts surrounding it \nproves that reliance to be very misplaced.\n  While time has passed since this issue came to a head last April, Mr. \nPresident, my deep concern that the Administration might still dispose \nof the bells has not. The Administration has not disavowed its earlier \nintent to seek to return the bells--an intent derailed by the \nintroduction of S. 1903 last year. In addition, despite Article IV, \nsection 3, clause 2 of the Constitution, which states that the \n``Congress shall have the power to dispose of . . . Property belonging \nto the United States,'' the Justice Department has issued an informal \nmemorandum stating that the Bells could possibly be disposed of by the \nPresident pursuant to the provisions of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 2572.\n  I continue to be amazed, even in these days of political correctness \nand revisionist history, that a U.S. President--our Commander-in-\nChief--would appear to be ready to ignore the wishes of our veterans \nand tear down a memorial to U.S. soldiers who died in the line of duty \nin order to send part of it back to the country in which they were \nkilled. Amazed, that is, until I recall this President's fondness for \nsweeping apologies and what some might view as\n\n[[Page S1643]]\n\nflashy P.R. gestures. Consequently, Senator Enzi and I have decided to \nreintroduce the bill in the 106th Congress.\n  Mr. President, to the veterans of Wyoming, and the United States as a \nwhole, the bells represent a lasting memorial to those fifty-four \nAmerican soldiers killed as a result of an unprovoked insurgent attack \nin Balangiga on September 28, 1901. In their view, which I share, any \nattempt to remove either or both of the bells--and in doing so actually \nphysically dismantling a war memorial--is a desecration of that memory.\n  S. 404 will protect the bells and similar veterans memorials from \nsuch an ignoble fate. The bill is quite simple; it prohibits the \ntransfer of a veterans memorial or any portion thereof to a foreign \ncountry or government unless specifically authorized by law; \nRepresentative Barbara Cubin is introducing similar legislation this \nweek in the House. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Enzi, Helms, \nHagel, Smith of Oregon, Murkowski, Smith of New Hampshire, Roberts, \nSessions, Nickles, and Coverdell as original cosponsors. I trust that \nmy colleagues will support its swift passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1641-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1643-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 1999, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on February 12, 1999, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the House has agreed to the following \nconcurrent resolution, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.

A bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, to \nprovide for a land exchange between the Secretary of Agriculture and \nthe Huna Totem Corporation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       Kake Tribal Corporation Public Interest Land Exchange Act\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce two similar \nbills both of which passed the Senate last year with unanimous consent. \nOne of these bills amends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \n(ANCSA), to provide for a land exchange between the Secretary of \nAgriculture and the Huna Totem Corporation, a village corporation \ncreated under that Act. The other bill provides for a similar land \nexchange between the Secretary and the Kake Tribal Corporation. Both of \nthese bills will allow the Kake Tribal and Huna Totem Corporations to \nconvey land needed as municipal watersheds in their surrounding \ncommunities to the Secretary in exchange for other Forest Service \nlands.\n  Enactment of these bills will meet two objectives. First, the two \ncorporations will finally be able to fully recognize the economic \nbenefits promised to them under ANCSA. Second, the watersheds that \nsupply the communities of Hoonah, Alaska and Kake, Alaska will be \nprotected in order to provide safe water for those communities.\n  The legislation I offer today clarifies several issues that were \nraised during the Committee hearings and mark-up last year. First, the \nlegislation directs that the subsurface estates owned by Sealaska \nCorporation in the Huna and Kake exchange lands are exchanged for \nsimilar subsurface estates in the conveyed Forest Service lands. Second \nthe substitute clarifies that these exchanges are to be done on an \nequal value basis. Both the Secretary of Agriculture and the \ncorporations insisted on this provision. I believe this is critical, \nMr. President, because both these bills provide that any timber derived \nfrom the newly acquired Corporation lands be processed in-state, a \nrequirement that does not currently exist on the watershed lands the \ncorporations are exchanging. Therefore, if this exchange simply were \ndone on an acre-for-acre basis it is likely that the acreage the \ncorporations are exchanging, without any timber export restrictions, \nwould have a much higher value than what they would get in return. It \nis for this reason that these exchanges will not be done on an acre-\nfor-acre basis. If it ends up that either party has to receive \nadditional compensation, either in additional lands or in cash to \nequalize the value, then it is my hope this will be done in an \nexpeditious way to allow the exchange to move forward within the times \nspecified in the legislation.\n  I believe these two pieces of legislation are in the best interest of \nthe native corporations, the Alaska communities where the watersheds \nare located, and the Federal government. It is my intention to try and \npass these bills out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee at the earliest opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 426\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve congressional deliberation on proposed \nFederal private sector mandates, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Budget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, \njointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1997, with instructions \nthat if one Committee reports, the other Committee have thirty days to \nreport or be discharged.\n\n\n                  the mandates information act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with 14 of my Colleagues, \nincluding the Chairmen of the Senate Small Business, Commerce, \nGovernment Affairs and Budget Committees, as well as the Majority \nLeader, in introducing vital legislation in protecting our nation's \nbusinesses from ill-thought government mandates, The Mandates \nInformation Act of 1999. This bill in my view furthers the cause of \ncareful deliberation in this, the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld. It will force Members of Congress to carefully consider all \naspects of potential legislation containing mandates affecting \nconsumers, workers, and small businesses.\n  We have been working towards final passage of this bill for quite \nsome time, Mr. President, as we introduced very similar legislation in \nthe last Congress. I wish to thank Chairmen Thompson and Domenici for \ntheir tireless leadership in shepherding this through their two \nCommittees last Congress. I am only sorry we did not have sufficient \ntime to bring it to the floor before adjournment. With their support \nand leadership in this Congress, I believe we can bring it to the floor \nfor quick consideration and move to Conference with the House.\n  And too it is the House that I also wish to extend my thanks and \nrespect. Under the careful leadership of Representatives Portman and \nCondit, and the very helpful support of the Speaker, the House version \nof the Mandates Information Act, H.R. 350, easily passed the House on \nWednesday with a broad, bipartisan majority of 274 to 194. Their \nconscientious sponsorship of the bill allowed it to quickly pass \nthrough Committee, and to avoid being watered down by unneeded \namendments. I offer my thanks and respect for their efforts.\n  Mr. President, this is not a new idea, but one that builds upon the \nimportant work of the 104th Congress when we passed the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act of 1995. That legislation required the \nCongressional Budget Office to make two key estimates with respect to \nany bill reported out of committee: First, whether the bill contains \nintergovernmental mandates with an annual cost of $50 million or more; \nand, second, whether the bill contains private sector mandates with an \nannual cost of $100 million or more. The 1995 act also established a \npoint of order against bills meeting the $50 million cost threshold for \nintergovernmental mandates. Although the point of order can be waived \nby a simple majority vote, it encourages Congress to think carefully \nbefore imposing new intergovernmental mandates.\n  The 1995 act did not apply its point of order to private sector \nmandates. This was understandable, given the bill's focus on \nintergovernmental mandates. But States and localities are not alone in \nbeing affected by Federal mandates. Consumers, workers, and small \nbusinesses also are affected when the Federal Government passes along \nthe costs of its policies. This is why the Mandates Information Act of \n1997 will apply a point of order to bills meeting the $100 million cost \nthreshold for private sector mandates, while also directing the CBO to \nprepare a ``Consumer, Worker, and Small Business Impact Statement'' for \nany bill reported out of committee.\n  These reforms are necessary in my view, Mr. President, because the \n1995 Act, while effective in its chosen sphere of intergovernmental \nmandates, does not contain the necessary mechanisms to force Congress \nto think seriously about the wisdom of proposed mandates on the private \nsector. This leaves our private sector faced with the same dilemma once \nfaced by our States and localities: Congress does not give full \nconsideration to the costs its mandates impose. Focusing almost \nexclusively on the benefits of unfunded mandates, Congress pays little \nheed to, and sometimes seems unaware of, the burden that unfunded \nmandates impose on the very groups they are supposed to help.\n  Unfunded mandate costs by definition do not show up on Congress' \nbalance ledger. But, as President Clinton's Deputy Treasury Secretary \nLawrence Summers has written, ``[t]here is no sense in which benefits \nbecome `free' just because the government mandates'' them. Congress has \nmerely passed the costs on to someone else.\n  And that ``someone'' is the American people. As economists from \nPrinceton's Alan Krueger to John Holohan, Colin Winterbottom, and \nSheila Zedlewski of the Urban Institute agree, the costs of unfunded \nmandates on the private sector are primarily borne by three groups: \nconsumers, workers, and small businesses.\n  What forms do these costs take? For consumers, mandate costs take the \nform of higher prices for goods and services, as unfunded mandates \ndrive up the cost of labor.\n  For workers, the costs of unfunded mandates often take the form of \nsignificantly lower wages. According to the Heritage Foundation, a \nrange of independent studies indicates that some 88 percent of the cost \nof private sector mandates are shifted to workers in the form of lower \nwages.\n  And mandates can cause workers to lose their jobs altogether. Faced \nwith uncontrollable increases in employee costs, our job creators too \noften find that they can no longer afford to retain their full \ncomplement of workers. The Clinton health care mandate, for example, \nwould have resulted in a net loss of between 200,000-500,000 jobs, \naccording to a study conducted by Professor Krueger.\n  Small businesses and their potential employees also suffer. Mandates \ntypically apply only to businesses with at least a certain number of \nemployees. As a result, small businesses have a powerful incentive not \nto hire enough new workers to reach the mandate threshold. As the Wall \nStreet Journal recently noted, ``The point at which a new [mandate] \nkicks in * * * is the point at which the [Chief Financial Officer] asks \n`Why grow?' ''\n  That question is asked by small businesses all over the country, but \nlet me cite one example from my State. Hasselbring/Clark is an office \nequipment supplier in Lansing, MI. Noelle Clark is the firm's treasurer \nand secretary. Mindful of the raft of mandates whose threshold is 50 \nemployees, Ms. Clark reports that lately ``we have hired a few temps to \nstay under 49.'' Thus, unfunded mandates not only eliminate jobs, but \nalso prevent jobs from being created.\n\n  Much as Members of Congress may wish it were not so, mandates have a \nvery real cost. This does not mean that all mandates are bad. But it \ndoes mean that Congress should think very carefully about the wisdom of \na proposed mandate before imposing it.\n  Such careful thinking, Mr. President, is the goal of the Mandates \nInformation Act of 1999. Just as the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of \n1995 protects State and local governments from hasty decisionmaking \nwith respect to proposed intergovernmental mandates,\n\n[[Page S1646]]\n\nthe Mandates Information Act would protect consumers, workers, and \nsmall businesses from hasty decisionmaking with respect to proposed \nprivate sector mandates. It would do so, in essence, by extending the \nreforms of the 1995 act to private sector mandates.\n  The bill I introduce today would build on the 1995 act's reforms in \ntwo ways. First, to give Congress more complete information about the \nimpact of proposed mandates on the private sector, my bill directs CBO \nto prepare a ``Consumer, Worker, and Small Business Impact Statement'' \nfor any bill reported out of Committee. This statement would include \nanalyses of the bill's private sector mandates' effects on the \nfollowing: First, consumer prices and [the] actual supply of goods and \nservices in consumer markets; second, worker wages, worker benefits, \nand employment opportunities; and third, the hiring practices, \nexpansion, and profitability of businesses with 100 or fewer employees.\n  But providing Congress with more complete information about the \nimpact of proposed private sector mandates will not guarantee that it \npays any attention to it. This we know from experience. In 1981, \nCongress enacted the State and Local Government Cost Estimate Act, \nsponsored by Senator Sasser. Pursuant to that act, CBO provided \nCongress with estimates of the cost of intergovernmental mandates in \nbills reported out of committee. But Congress routinely ignored this \ninformation. It did so because the 1981 act had no enforcement \nmechanism to force Congress to consider the CBO estimates. As Senator \nSasser himself explained in introducing a follow-up bill in 1993, \n``[t]he problem [with the 1981 act], it has become clear, is that this \nyellow caution light has no red light to back it up.''\n  To supply that ``red light,'' Senator Sasser's Mandate Funding Act of \n1993 contained a point of order. Of course, the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act of 1995 likewise contained a point of order, which is why it \nsucceeded where Senator Sasser's 1981 act had failed.\n  The Mandates Information Act of 1999 will provide this red light for \nproposed private sector mandates. It contains a point of order against \nany bill whose direct private sector mandates exceed the $100 million \nthreshold set by the 1995 act. Like the 1995 act's point of order \nagainst intergovernmental mandates, the 1997 bill's point of order can \nbe waived by a simple majority of Members. Thus it will not stop \nCongress from passing bills it wants to pass. It is here, Mr. \nPresident, that I wish to thank Chairman Thompson and Domenici for the \nexcellent revisions of the mandates language offered during the \nGovernment Affairs mark-up of the Mandates Information Act of 1997. We \nhave incorporated those changes in this bill and believe they greatly \nstrengthen the legislation, including making it very clear that the \npoint of order only applies to direct mandates upon the private sector \nthat exceed $100 million.\n\n  It is that point of order which will serve the vital purpose to \nensure Congress does not ignore the information contained in the \nConsumer, Worker, and Small Business Impact Statement. It will do so by \nallowing any Member to focus the attention of the entire House or \nSenate on the impact statement for a particular bill.\n  The Mandates Information Act of 1999 will provide Congress with more \ncomplete information about proposed mandates' effects on consumers, \nworkers, and small businesses. It will also ensure that Congress \nactually considers this information before reaching a judgment about \nwhether to impose a new mandate. The result, Mr. President, will be \nfocused, high-quality deliberation on the wisdom of private sector \nmandates.\n  Because of the success of the 1995 act, Congress is now much more \ncareful to consider the interests of State and local governments in \nmaking decisions about unfunded mandates. But Congress must be just as \ncareful to consider the interests of consumers, workers, and small \nbusinesses in making such decisions. This bill will ensure that care, \nhelping produce better legislation; legislation that imposes a lighter \nburden on working Americans.\n  Mr. President, I will include in the Record the following sample of \nletters from small business groups supporting the bill along with a \nlist of groups that have expressed their support for it.\n  Mr. President, the support for this legislation is broad and deep. It \nis needed to protect our small businesses against mandates which have \nnot been fully analyzed and which harm these businesses in ways that \nCongress may never have intended. But, Mr. President, I believe they \ncan best argue for the need for this bill.\n  Therefore, I call on my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation, and to move it through Committee and to the \nfloor as quickly as possible. It is necessary, it is wise, and it is \nfair. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation as well as a section-by-section summary of the bill, a list \nof groups in support of the bill, letters of support from the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, the Small Business Survival Committee and the \nCompetitive Enterprise Institute also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 427\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FEDERAL PRIVATE SECTOR MANDATES\n\n       (a) In General--\n       (1) Estimates--Directs the Congressional Budget Office, if \n     feasible, to estimate the impact of private sector mandates \n     on consumers, workers, and small businesses, including the \n     impact on--\n       Consumer prices and the supply of goods and services;\n       Worker wages, benefits, and employment opportunities; and\n       The hiring practices, expansion and profitability of \n     businesses with 100 or fewer employees.\n       The estimate prepared under this paragraph shall not be \n     considered in determining whether the direct costs of all \n     Federal private sector mandates in the bill or joint \n     resolution exceed the $100 million threshold.\n        (2) Point of Order--Provides that if the Congressional \n     Budget Office is unable to estimate the cost of private \n     sector mandates in a bill or joint resolution, a point of \n     order will still lie against consideration of that bill or \n     joint resolution.\n        (3) Threshold Amounts--Exempts funded private sector \n     mandates from a point of order.\n       (4) Application to Appropriations--Extends the point of \n     order only to appropriations bills only if a legislative \n     provision that includes a Federal private sector mandate is:\n       Contained in an appropriations bill or conference report; \n     or\n       Contained in an amendment to an appropriations bill; or\n       Amendments in disagreement between the two Houses to an \n     appropriations bill.\n        (5) Amendments--Requires the Congressional Budget Office, \n     when practicable, to estimate the direct costs of a Federal \n     private sector mandate contained in an amendment at the \n     request of any Senator.\n        (b) Exercise of Rulemaking Powers--States that the Act is \n     enacted as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives under their constitutional right \n     to change such rules at any time.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Organizations Supporting the Mandates Information Act of 1999\n\n\n                         NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS\n\n        The United States Chamber of Commerce, National Federation \n     of Independent Business, National Association for the Self-\n     Employed, National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, \n     National Retail Federation, Small Business Survival \n     Committee, Associated Builders and Contractors, American Farm \n     Bureau Federation, National Association of Manufacturers, \n     National Association of Home Builders, National Restaurant \n     Association, National Roofing Contractors Association, \n     Citizens for a Sound Economy, Heritage Foundation, \n     Competitive Enterprise Institute\n\n\n                         MICHIGAN ORGANIZATIONS\n\n        Associated Underground Contractors, Inc.; Grand Rapids \n     Area Chamber of Commerce; Michigan Association of Timbermen; \n     Michigan Chamber of Commerce; Michigan Farm Bureau Family of \n     Companies; Michigan NFIB; Michigan Retailers Association; \n     Michigan Soft Drink Association; Small Business Association \n     of Michigan.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Charmber of Commerce\n\n\n                                 The United States of America,\n\n                                Washington, D.C. February 9, 1999.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: As long standing advocates of \n     mandates relief for the private and public sectors, the U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce strongly supports the legislation that \n     you will be introducing, The Mandates Information Act of \n     1999.\n       Recent studies estimate the compliance costs of federal \n     regulations at more than $700 billion annually and project \n     substantial future growth even without the enactment of new \n     legislation. Congressional mandates impose significant costs \n     on the private sector, particularly small business. These \n     costs are passed along in the form of higher prices and \n     taxes, reduced wages, stunted economic growth, and decreased \n     technological innovation.\n       The Mandates Information Act builds upon the success of the \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act by requiring the Congressional \n     Budget Office (``CBO'') to provide Congress with information \n     on the potential impacts associated with proposed significant \n     mandates on the private sector. This legislation promotes \n     better decision making and greater accountability by \n     providing Congress with information relating to the costs and \n     impacts of its mandates before enacting them and passing the \n     costs on to consumers. It also allows a separate debate and \n     floor vote.\n       During the last Congress, H.R. 3534, the Mandates \n     Information Act, was passed by the U.S. House of \n     Representatives by a vote of 279-132. Additionally, the \n     analogous bill in the Senate was marked up and approved by \n     the Government Affairs Committee. Unfortunately, the 105th \n     Congress ended before the Senate could vote on the \n     legislation.\n       Lawmakers have the responsibility to legislate using the \n     most complete and accurate information available. The point-\n     of-order mechanism, coupled with CBO's analysis under the \n     Mandates Information Act, would help make Congress far more \n     responsive to the burdens created by ill-considered mandates.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation representing more than three million businesses of \n     every size, sector, and region, appreciates your effort to \n     make Congress more accountable to small businesses, workers, \n     and consumers through the Mandates Information Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Lonnie P. Taylor,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Small Business\n\n\n                                           Survival Committee,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 27, 1999.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: Any effort to highlight the burden of \n     private-sector mandates on small businesses, workers, and \n     consumers earns the support of the Small Business Survival \n     Committee's (SBSC's) 50,000 members.\n       The Mandates Information Act of 1999 is an important piece \n     of legislation that would provide Congress with the ability \n     to determine the economic impact of mandates by directing the \n     Congressional Budget Office to supply Congress with an \n     analysis of a new mandate's impact on small businesses, \n     workers, and consumers.\n       Small businesses bear a disproportionate burden of the \n     costs of federal regulations. The per employee costs of these \n     regulations are usually 80% higher for small businesses when \n     compared to that of large corporations. Ultimately, the costs \n     his employees hard, through lower wages, reduced benefits, \n     and fewer job opportunities and consumers are hurt by high \n     prices and reduced availability of goods and services.\n       To draw attention to private-sector mandates with annual \n     costs in excess of $100 million, the Mandates Information Act \n     of 1999 allows any member to raise a ``point of order'' to \n     ensure the Members of Congress do not ignore the economic \n     impact imposed by their mandates on taxpayers. This provision \n     is an important step in favor of true congressional \n     accountability.\n       The Small Business Survival Committee strongly support this \n     important piece of legislation and looks forward to working \n     with you to ensure its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Karen Kerrigan,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       [From the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Feb. 8, 1999]\n\n              So, What Will This Unfunded Mandate Cost Me?\n\n                       (By Clyde Wayne Crews Jr.)\n\n       The $1.77 trillion spending budget President Clinton sent \n     to Congress February 2 tells just part of the story of the \n     Federal government's reach in the economy. Regulatory \n     mandates placed on Americans increase the costs of government \n     by over a third. Legislation now being debated in the House \n     of Representatives (H.R. 350) could help better control that \n     cost.\n       Some know the problems of mandates more acutely than \n     others. Back in 1995, governors and other state and local \n     officials--fed up with the federal government's imposing \n     exceedingly costly environmental and\n\n[[Page S1648]]\n\n     other mandates on them--revolted. To many state and local \n     officials, every dollar spent on federal priorities, however \n     beneficial and popular, compromised their ability to achieve \n     their own budget priorities. Some even felt they could \n     protect their own local environments without Washington's \n     intervention, thank you very much.\n       Happy Governors.--The complaints that Washington too often \n     ignored the costs of its mandates were heard. The result was \n     the 104th Congress's Unfunded Mandates Act--the significance \n     of which garnered it the designation ``S. 1'' in the Senate. \n     The law required cost disclosure for significant mandates, \n     and offered an opportunity to demand explicit votes on the \n     intent to impose those costs.\n       Unfunded public-sector mandates weren't halted by the \n     Unfunded Mandates Act, of course. But total rules in the \n     federal pipeline impacting state and local governments has \n     dipped 12 percent over the past five years, from 1,317 to \n     1,161.\\1\\ The real innovation wasn't rule blockage at all, \n     but rather increased congressional, rather than agency, \n     accountability to the public for the impacts of rules.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\All figures on numbers of regulations in this document \n     were compiled by CEI from the federal Regulatory Information \n     Service Center's ``Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations,'' \n     various years' editions, for the forthcoming CEI report ``Ten \n     Thousand Commandments: A Policymaker's Snapshot of the \n     Federal Regulatory State,'' 1999 edition.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       But full congressional accountability and disclosure remain \n     to be achieved for rules impacting the private sector. For \n     example, agency rules significantly impacting small \n     businesses increased 37% over the past five years, from 686 \n     to 937. Yet Congress remains largely free to ignore the \n     accompanying costs when enacting legislation that will impose \n     many private sector mandates. And if costs become an issue \n     down the line with constituents, its easy to blame the \n     regulatory agencies that write the rules to implement the \n     legislation.\n       The Mandates Information Act (H.R. 350) vs. Those Other \n     Unfunded Mandates.--One remedy, on which House floor debate \n     will resume February 10, is the bipartisan Mandates \n     Information Act of 1999 (H.R. 350), sponsored by Reps. Gary \n     Condit (D-CA), Rob Portman (R-OH), Jim Moran (D-VA) and Tom \n     Davis (R-VA). Virtually identical to a version that passed \n     the 105th Congress on a 279-132 vote, the bill would extend \n     certain provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Act to mandates \n     on the private sector. H.R. 350 would establish a point of \n     order against any legislation that would impose costs over \n     $100 million annually, such as mandates impacting wages, \n     consumer prices or small businesses. If raised, the point of \n     order would halt further floor action unless members waive it \n     by a simple majority vote. In other words, should any member \n     object to the imposition of costs on the public, Congress \n     must then explicitly vote on its intent to consider the bill \n     despite its costs--and indirectly vote on its belief that \n     benefits outweigh costs. This approach doesn't necessarily \n     stop any mandate, but it would increase accountability.\n       A Step Toward Ending Hidden Taxes?--Legislators partial to \n     continuing to shield mandate costs from scrutiny and wiggling \n     out of responsibility, do so at their peril. Off-budget \n     mandates now cost as much as $700 billion annually. That's an \n     amount about 40 percent the size of the entire federal \n     budget, greater even than pretax corporate profits ($640 \n     billion in 1996) and almost as large as the combined GNPs of \n     Canada and Mexico ($542 billion and $237 billion in 1995).\n       The Mandates Information Act would help place \n     responsibility for costly lawmaking squarely back where it \n     belongs--with Congress. Nonetheless, H.R. 350 has raised the \n     ire of some who say the measure will make it difficult to \n     promulgate regulation. What they do not fathom is that it is \n     not supposed to be easy to impulsively impose what amount to \n     massive hidden taxes. The opponents' alarm at the point of \n     order's ``gagging'' debate is quite misguided: If the simple \n     majority vote to approve worthy, presumably chock-full-of-\n     benefits legislation is there in the first place, then the \n     simple majority to waive the point of order should be there, \n     too. Thus, opponents of H.R. 350's longoverdue focus on \n     costs, who cry ``What about benefits?'' need to ask \n     themselves that question. Voters aren't stupid, and they will \n     support costly legislation if persuaded those costs are \n     justified, and they will punish those whom they believe stall \n     needed legislation.\n       Too Easy To Scapegoat Agencies.--Perhaps the real fear of \n     the Mandates Information Act's opponents is the fact that a \n     separate vote to explicitly consider costs weakens political \n     cover. Today, representatives can deny responsibility for \n     regulatory costs when speaking before their small business \n     constituents back home: ``Uh . . . Your hardship is the \n     agencies' fault! They're out of control!'' That little dodge \n     would stop.\n       Congress Must Answer for All Costs.--Those who never met a \n     regulation they didn't like, those who always think more \n     rules make sense in the abstract, deserve occasionally to be \n     awakened from their perpetual Sim-City planner mode, just \n     long enough to consider whether a rule really makes sense \n     here on Earth. If even this meager reform is rejected, \n     Congress might just as well take a roll-call vote on a \n     resolution stipulating that: ``The public has no business \n     knowing the costs of the regulations that we impose upon \n     them.'' That way voters will have it made plain to them \n     exactly where they stand in the eyes of those they elected.\n       The innovation and legacy of the Mandates Information Act \n     is not that it will stop a lot of regulations. It won't. The \n     Mandates Information Act's lasting contribution will be its \n     unique step toward full disclosure, its potential to make \n     Congress more answerable for all the costs of government.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I rise to support the Mandates \nInformation Act of 1999. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of \nthis legislation, which will make Congress more accountable for the \nlaws it passes. I want to applaud my good friend from Michigan, Spence \nAbraham, for his hard work and leadership on this effort. He has always \nchampioned greater accountability and efficiency in our Government.\n  This legislation is based on a simple premise--that Congress should \nthink carefully and be accountable for passing mandates that impose \nsignificant costs on people and limit their freedom. In 1995, we passed \nthe Unfunded Mandates Act to make Congress think twice before imposing \nnew unfunded mandates on state and local government. But Congress also \nshould be concerned about the private sector, especially consumers, \nworkers and small businesses.\n  This legislation builds on the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act in two \nways. First, it will provide Congress with more complete information \nabout the costs of proposed Congressional mandates on the private \nsector. The Congressional Budget Office would prepare a ``Consumer, \nWorker, and Small Business Impact Statement'' for new private sector \nmandates in bills reported out of Committee. The Statement would \nanalyze the impacts of Congressional mandates on: (1) consumer prices \nand the supply of goods and services in the market; (2) worker wages, \nbenefits, and employment opportunities; and (3) the hiring practices, \nexpansion, and profitability of businesses with 100 or fewer employees.\n  Second, to ensure that Congress pays attention to the information, \nthis legislation would establish a point of order, waivable by a simple \nmajority, against legislation containing direct private sector unfunded \nmandates over the $100 million threshold established by the Unfunded \nMandates Act. This bill does not prohibit legislative mandates; it \nsimply requires Congress to think carefully before deciding whether or \nnot to impose them.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the public has a right to open, \naccountable, and efficient government. If Congress or the President \nwants to take credit for the benefits of a new program, we also should \nanswer for its costs. We can't shrug off our responsibilities just \nbecause the economy is good now and we can point to budget surpluses. \nThere has been a large growth in regulatory mandates that simply are \nnot accounted for in budget figures. Federal regulation costs about \n$700 billion per year by some estimates. That is about 40 percent of \nthe size of the entire Federal budget. And regulation begins when \nCongress passes legislation that delegates its lawmaking authority to \nthe Federal agencies.\n  The truth is that there is no free lunch. While we can see the costs \nof tax-and-spend programs in the taxes we pay, the costs of regulatory \nmandates are just as real. We all pay for regulatory mandates through \nhidden taxes in the form of higher prices, lower productivity and \nwages, and diminished economic growth and job opportunities.\n  In particular, the costs of private sector mandates can hit hard on \nconsumers, workers and small businesses. Consumers pay for mandates \nthrough higher prices for goods and services. Workers pay through lower \nwages. And small businesses pay through lower profitability and growth, \nwhich in turn means less job opportunities for workers. A 1995 Small \nBusiness Administration study found that an average business with less \nthan 20 employees spends about $5,500 per employee to comply with \nFederal regulations, while large firms with over 500 employees spend \nabout $3,000 per employee. While regulatory mandates affect everyone, \nsmall businesses have a particularly tough time shouldering them.\n  I have always said that agencies need to regulate smarter. But before \nwe even reach that step, Congress needs to legislate smarter. Last \nyear, this legislation passed the House, and in the\n\n[[Page S1649]]\n\nSenate we reported it out of the Governmental Affairs Committee. On \nWednesday, the House passed this legislation again by an overwhelming \nvote. It is my hope that we can enact it into law this year. The \nMandates Information Act will help place responsibility for costly laws \nat their source--Congress. It's long overdue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON:\n  S. 428. A bill to amend the Agricultural Market Transition Act to \nensure that producers of all classes of soft white wheat (including \nclub wheat) are permitted to repay marketing assistance loans, or \nreceive loan deficiency payments, for the wheat at the same rate; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                 loan deficiency payment for club wheat\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill restore payment equity to Pacific Northwest producers of club \nwheat.\n  Last year, during the middle of the 1998 harvest season, the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture made a rule change regarding the Loan \nDeficiency Payment (LDP) club wheat, a member of the soft white wheat \nsubclass. While I applaud USDA for its efforts in providing equal \npayments for club wheat and soft white wheat, by making the policy \nchange in the middle of the production year, many club wheat producers \nhad already contracted with the lower payment.\n  In order to address the inequity between the 1998 club wheat LDP \ncontracts, my colleagues and I requested that USDA make the policy \nretroactive. USDA claimed it does not have the authority to grant \nretroactivity, and as a result, I have introduced this legislation to \nprovide the agency retroactive authority.\n  At a time when commodity prices are at an all time low, it is my hope \nthat the LDP inequity for club wheat will be resolved by passage of \nthis legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 428\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPAYMENT RATE FOR MARKETING ASSISTANCE LOANS FOR \n                   WHEAT; LOAN PAYMENT RATE FOR LOAN DEFICIENCY \n                   PAYMENTS FOR WHEAT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 134(a)(2) of the Agricultural \n     Market Transition Act (7 U.S.C. 7234(a)(2)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in subparagraph (D), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(E) in the case of soft white wheat, be uniform for all \n     classes of the wheat, including club wheat.''.\n       (b) Application.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply beginning with the 1997 crop of wheat.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Grams, \n        Mr. Daschle, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 429. A bill to designate the legal public holiday of \n``Washington's Birthday'' as ``Presidents' Day'' in honor of George \nWashington, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Roosevelt and in recognition \nof the importance of the institution of the Presidency and the \ncontributions that Presidents have made to the development of our \nNation and the principles of freedom and democracy; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n               THE REDESIGNATION OF WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity, along \nwith my distinguished colleagues, Senators Kennedy, Cleland, Grams, \nDaschle, DeWine, Lautenberg, and Levin, to reintroduce legislation \nrecognizing the importance of the institution of the Presidency. My \nlegislation would redesignate ``Washington's Birthday'' as \n``Presidents' Day,'' honoring George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and \nFranklin Roosevelt. In taking this step, we would honor three of our \nnation's most important leaders, Presidents who led our nation through \nour greatest challenges and crises. In so doing, we would be \ncelebrating the contributions that these and other great Presidents \nhave made to the development of freedom and democracy in our great \nnation.\n  Our democracy depends upon the participation of a well-informed \nelectorate--citizens who take their civic responsibilities seriously. \nHowever, many Americans appear to have lost confidence in our political \nsystem. In the last presidential election, less than half of eligible \nvoters--49 percent--voted. In the 1998 midterm elections, only 36 \npercent of the voting populace cast their vote to determine the future \nof our nation. This was the lowest voter turnout since 1942, over 50 \nyears ago. The turnout rate among younger voters is even lower.\n  Tests administered by the National Assessment of Educational Progress \nfound that almost 60 percent of high school seniors lacked even a basic \nunderstanding of American history. These findings indicate that too \nmany Americans feel a sense of alienation from the political process \nand do not believe that government and political involvement are \nrelevant to their lives.\n  In this time of cynicism about American politics, we must restore the \nfaith and pride of our citizens in our government. Passage of this \nlegislation will recognize three of our nation's greatest leaders and \nthe enduring strength of the Office of the Presidency. It will remind \nall of us--but particularly young people who are our nation's future \nleaders--of the important contributions made by Presidents of the \nUnited States and the principles on which our nation was founded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1644-1", "month": "02",

Con. Res. 11\n\n       Whereas the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (Public Law \n     104-170; 110 Stat. 1489) was enacted with unanimous \n     congressional approval and with the assistance and leadership \n     of a broad coalition of agricultural, industry, and public \n     interest groups;\n       Whereas the amendments made by that Act are intended to be \n     an important tool in protecting public health, particularly \n     the health and well-being of the most valuable resource of \n     the United States, the children of the United States;\n       Whereas it is critical that the amendments made by that Act \n     be implemented in a way that accomplishes the intent of \n     Congress while maintaining an abundant, affordable, and safe \n     food supply for the United States, ensuring urban pest \n     control, and not unfairly providing competitive advantages to \n     foreign food suppliers over domestic producers;\n       Whereas the amendments made by that Act require the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to \n     develop risk assessment methodologies that are based on \n     reliable information and to undertake a massive review of all \n     approved pesticide tolerances;\n       Whereas on August 4, 1997, the Administrator published a \n     schedule for reassessment of more than 3,000 tolerances by \n     August 3, 1999, that could include certain classes of \n     products that are extensively used;\n       Whereas the sudden loss of uses and products could both \n     economically cripple a host of agricultural commodities, \n     including corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, cotton, and dozens of \n     fruit and vegetable crops and create a public health threat \n     to the urban environment from the unchecked infestation of \n     insects; and\n       Whereas it is critical that the amendments made by that Act \n     be implemented in a fair and equitable manner, and that the \n     protections be implemented while maintaining an abundant, \n     affordable, and safe food supply for the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency and the Secretary of Agriculture should ensure that \n     the implementation of the amendments made by the Food Quality \n     Protection Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-170; 110 Stat. 1489)--\n       (A) be based on sound science that protects public health;\n       (B) include transparent processes with full disclosure of \n     decisions and be subject to peer and public review;\n       (C) provide for a reasonable transition for agriculture; \n     and\n       (D) require consultation with the public and other \n     agencies;\n       (2) the development of risk assessment methodologies, \n     guidelines, and protocols for collection of data under the \n     amendments made by that Act be based on sound science and not \n     default assumptions in the absence of reliable data;\n       (3) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency should devote sufficient resources to register new \n     pesticide products and uses to provide effective substitutes \n     for pesticides that may be considered high risk under the \n     amendments made by that Act; and\n       (4) the Administrator should establish ongoing means for \n     input regarding the implementation decisions of the \n     Administrator with respect to that Act from producers, \n     pesticide users, registrants, environmental and public health \n     groups, consumers, State and local agencies, tribal \n     governments, Members of Congress, and appropriate Federal \n     agencies.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I submit a Senate Concurrent \nResolution which addresses the controversy surrounding the Food Quality \nProtection Act. I am pleased to be joined today by my colleagues, \nSenators Conrad, Brownback, Hutchison, Frist, Gramm of Texas, Landrieu, \nand Hutchinson who are original cosponsors of the resolution.\n  The Food Quality Protection Act directs the EPA to base its tolerance \nreview decisions pertaining to pesticides on reliable data that is \ncurrently available. Or, the EPA can require the development of new \ndata through the data call-in provisions of the Food Quality Protection \nAct.\n  In order to meet the review deadlines, the EPA is basing some \ncritical decisions on assumptions, which are primarily EPA's \npreliminary findings. This could lead to needless and questionable \nproduct cancellations, and have a significant impact on the \nagricultural industry.\n  It is essential that the EPA's insect tolerance assessment process be \nbased\n\n[[Page S1651]]\n\non sound scientific data. If the EPA's current approach to pesticide \nrisk assessments is not modified, it is likely that many uses of crop \nprotection products will be unjustifiably terminated. The sudden \nadoption of new restrictions of certain pesticide applications and \nproducts could needlessly cripple a host of agricultural commodities, \nincluding corn; soybeans; wheat; rice; cotton; and dozens of fruit and \nvegetable crops. It could also add a public health threat to the urban \nenvironment from mosquitos, cockroaches, and termites that might go \nunchecked. American farmers, ranchers, and consumers will feel the \nunnecessary and avoidable repercussions of the EPA's actions.\n  We all know pesticide use must be closely monitored and some \npesticides need to be replaced. The protection of the environment must \nalways be foremost in our minds. But, common sense and real science \nmust be involved in this matter so that all parties will benefit. \nCertain pesticides that warrant replacement or removal must have \nsuitable, affordable, and effective replacements. And, any changes must \nbe made in a sufficient time frame to allow producers to learn the safe \nuse of the new products as they transition away from old dated \nproducts.\n  Also, the current Food Quality Protection Act puts the United States \nat a distinct disadvantage in the global marketplace. Other countries \ndo not have the same requirements that our producers have, but we still \nimport and consume their products. We need to offer every advantage to \nour producers and safeguard consumers instead of providing other \ncountries an upper hand in the world's agricultural market.\n  To address this issue, the resolution I introduce today expresses the \nsense and intent of Congress for the fair and equitable implementation \nof the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. The resolution calls on the \nEPA Administrator and the Secretary of Agriculture to use sound science \nto protect the public health while effectively administering the Food \nQuality Protection Act.\n  Some important organizations have endorsed my resolution, including \nthe Colorado Farm Bureau and the Rocky Mountain Farmers Union.\n  We must modify the enforcement mechanisms in the Food Quality \nProtection Act to ensure the act is properly implemented, so that it \ncan help, not hurt the people and our environment it was intended to \nprotect. The resolution I submit today will help accomplish this goal, \nand I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1650-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 37--TO EXPRESS GRATITUDE FOR THE SERVICE OF THE CHIEF \n     JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES AS PRESIDING OFFICER DURING THE \n                           IMPEACHMENT TRIAL\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Res. 45\n\n       Whereas the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission \n     on Human Rights in Geneva, Switzerland, provides a forum for \n     discussing human rights and expressing international support \n     for improved human rights performance;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Department of State \n     and international human rights organizations, the Government \n     of the People's Republic of China continues to commit \n     widespread and well-documented human rights abuses in China \n     and Tibet and continues the coercive implementation of family \n     planning policies and the sale of human organs taken from \n     executed prisoners;\n       Whereas such abuses stem from an intolerance of dissent and \n     fear of unrest on the part of authorities in the People's \n     Republic of China and from the absence or inadequacy of laws \n     in the People's Republic of China that protect basic \n     freedoms;\n       Whereas such abuses violate internationally accepted norms \n     of conduct;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China is bound by the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights and recently signed the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but has \n     yet to take the steps necessary to make the covenant legally \n     binding;\n       Whereas the President decided not to sponsor a resolution \n     criticizing the People's Republic of China at the United \n     Nations Human Rights Commission in 1998 in consideration of \n     commitments by the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China to sign the International Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights and based on a belief that progress on human \n     rights in the People's Republic of China could be achieved \n     through other means;\n       Whereas authorities in the People's Republic of China have \n     recently escalated efforts to extinguish expressions of \n     protest or criticism and have detained scores of citizens \n     associated with attempts to organize a legal democratic \n     opposition, as well as religious leaders, writers, and others \n     who petitioned the authorities to release those arbitrarily \n     arrested; and\n       Whereas these efforts underscore that the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China's has not retreated from its \n     longstanding pattern of human rights abuses, despite \n     expectations to the contrary following two summit meetings \n     between President Clinton and President Jiang in which \n     assurances were made regarding improvements in the human \n     rights record of the People's Republic of China: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that at the \n     55th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in \n     Geneva, Switzerland, the United States should introduce and \n     make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution criticizing \n     the People's Republic of China for its human rights abuses in \n     China and Tibet.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, today I, along with Senators \nWellstone, Mack, and Feingold, submit a simple sense of the Senate \nresolution. This resolution urges the Administration to take the \nnecessary steps to introduce and pass a resolution criticizing the \nPeople's Republic of China for its human rights abuses in China and \nTibet at this year's meeting of the United Nations Human Rights \nCommission. With this resolution, we send a clear signal to the \nAdministration that the U.S. must not be silent on the human rights \nabuses perpetrated by the government of the People's Republic of China.\n  The U.N. Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, will \ntake place in March and April this year. The Commission is the most \nvaluable multilateral forum for monitoring and investigating human \nrights abuses around the world. Resolutions offered at the Commission \nboth highlight human rights abuses and pressure governments to correct \nthem. The U.S. has appropriately supported resolutions critical of \nChina eight times in recent years.\n  The Communist government of China has long committed a litany of \nhuman rights abuses. Thousands of political prisoners remain in prison, \nmany sentenced after unfair trials, others without any trial. At least \ntwo hundred of these prisoners are still suffering because of their \nparticipation in or support of the 1989 Tiananmen Square \ndemonstrations. Religious persecution runs rampant in China. People who \ndare to worship outside the aegis of officially sponsored religious \norganizations face fines, detention, arrest, imprisonment, and torture. \nThousands of peaceful monks and nuns have been detained and tortured in \nTibet, where the Chinese government is imposing a harsh patriotic \neducation campaign. Under China's one family, one child policy, couples \nface punitive fines and loss of employment for having unapproved \nchildren. But it doesn't stop with monetary penalties. Local \nauthorities, with or without the approval of the Communist Party cadre, \nforcibly perform abortions or sterilizations on women who are pregnant \nwith their second child. Relatives are held hostage until couples \nsubmit to this coercion. Furthermore, prisoners are executed after \ngrossly unfair trials, their organs sold on the black market. What do \nthese people all have in common? They oppose the Chinese Communist \ngovernment or its policies. Opposition bears a high price.\n  What has been the Administration's response? Last year, President \nClinton decided not to pursue a resolution critical of China at the \nU.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland, citing China's \ncommitment to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political \nRights (ICCPR), as well as other avenues for change. In July, President \nClinton granted the Communist government undeserved legitimacy by \nmaking a state visit to China. China did sign the ICCPR, a covenant \nwhich affirms free speech and free assembly, in October, only to turn \naround and violate its every principle.\n  Since July 1998, the Communist government of China has renewed its \ncrackdown on all who would dare to oppose the Communist Party. Some 100 \nmembers of the fledgling Chinese Democracy Party (CDP) have been \ndetained. Some have been released, others await trial, and the most \nunfortunate have been sentenced to long prison sentences. Three visible \nleaders of the CDP, Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin, and Wang Youncai were \nsentenced to 13, 12 and 11 years in prison, respectively, on charges of \nsubversion and endangering state security, after dubious trials. In \nreality, these democracy activists exercised their legal rights under \nChinese law to form a political party. There true crime, in the eyes of \nthe Communist Party, was their love of democracy.\n\n  But the crackdown does not end there. In fact, incidents of \nharassment and imprisonment are almost too numerous to list here. I \nwill highlight a few examples. The Communist government sentenced \nbusinessman Lin Hai to prison for two years for providing email \naddresses to a pro-democracy internet magazine based in the U.S. Zhang \nShanguang is in prison for ten years for providing Radio Free Asia with \ninformation about farmer protests in Hunan province. The government \nsentenced poet and writer, Ma Zhe, to seven years in prison on charges \nof subversion for publishing an independent literary journal. In \naddition, the Communist government has cracked down on film directors, \nartists, computer software developers, and the press, and continues to \nharass and detain religious activists. In November 1998, police \nimprisoned 70 worshipers from house churches in Henan province. The \npattern of human rights violations is undeniable. It must be stopped.\n  In light of these abuses, it is critical that the U.S. push for a \nresolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission highlighting these \nabuses. Last year, the Administration chose not to pursue a resolution, \ndespite clear signals from Congress. In this body, we passed a \nresolution similar to the one before us today by a 95 to 5 vote. We \ncannot afford to stand by idly as the Chinese Communist government \nthumbs its nose at internationally accepted norms--norns to which it \nclaims to subscribe.\n  There are some in the Administration who argue that a resolution \ncritical of China at the Human Rights Commission is pointless because \nit is certain to fail. This very sentiment is self-fulfilling. The more \nhalf-hearted the Administration is in its attempts to advance such a \nresolution, the less chance it has to pass. The longer the \nAdministration refrains from exercising leadership in the international \ncommunity on this matter, the less likely it is that the resolution \nwill be successful.\n\n[[Page S1654]]\n\n  Bringing forth a resolution at the Commission is a matter of \nprinciple. Success will be measured by the statements of truth that \nflow from debate at the Commission. A resolution at the Commission will \nproclaim boldly that the human rights abuses in China are an affront to \nthe international community.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan sense of the \nSenate resolution.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that any statements by Senators \nWellstone, Mack, or Feingold regarding this resolution be inserted at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today as an original co-sponsor \nof S. Res. 45 with regard to human rights in China.\n  The resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that the United \nStates should initiate active lobbying at the United Nations Commission \non Human Rights for a resolution condemning human rights abuses in \nChina. It calls specifically for the United States to introduce and \nmake all efforts necessary to pass a resolution on China and Tibet at \nthe upcoming session of the Commission, which is due to begin in March \nin Geneva.\n  This resolution makes a simple, clear statement of principle: The \nSenate believes that there should be a China resolution in Geneva, \nperiod.\n  Mr. President, the Commission on Human Rights first met in 1947, \nspending its first year drafting the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights. Over the next two decades, the Commission was responsible for \ndrafting an impressive body of international human rights law and set \nthe global standards for human rights. In the 1990s, the Commission has \nincreasingly turned its attention to assisting states in overcoming \nobstacles to securing human rights for their citizens. It has been a \nfocal point for protection of human rights for vulnerable groups in \nsociety, and as such, the Commission serves as an ideal multilateral \nforum for a resolution and debate on China's human rights practices.\n  The effort to move a resolution is particularly important this year, \nin light of the Administration's decision, contrary to the nearly \nunanimous sentiment of the Senate, not to sponsor such a resolution \nlast year. Their misguided belief that progress could be achieved by \nother means was clearly not borne out by events in 1998, when, \nparticularly in the last quarter, China stepped up its repression.\n  As we all know, for the past few years, China's leaders have \naggressively lobbied against efforts at the Commission earlier and more \nactively than the countries that support a resolution. Last year, \nChinese officials basically succeeded in getting the European Union \nForeign Ministers to drop any European cosponsorship of a resolution. \nIn the past, China's vigorous efforts have resulted in a ``no action'' \nmotion at the Commission, however, in 1995 a ``no action'' motion was \ndefeated and a resolution almost adopted, losing by only one vote. I \nsincerely hope we will not have the same results again at this year's \nmeeting.\n  It is essential to have a resolution on China under the auspices of \nthe Commission on Human Rights. The multilateral nature of the \nCommission makes it a very appropriate forum to debate and discuss the \nhuman rights situation in China. The Commission's review has led to \nproven and concrete progress on human rights in other countries, and \nthe expectation is that such scrutiny could also lead to progress on \nhuman rights in China. Under the pressure of previous Geneva  \nresolutions, China signed in 1997 the UN Covenant of Social, Economic \nand Cultural Rights and in October 1998 the International Covenant on \nCivil and Political Rights. Neither has yet been ratified or \nimplemented.\n\n  Nearly five years after the President's decision, which I deeply \nregretted, to delink most-favored-nation status from human rights, we \ncannot forget that the human rights situation in China and Tibet \nremains abysmal. While the State Department has not yet provided its \nmost recent human rights report, I have no doubt it will be as critical \nof China as the 1997 report was when it noted that ``the Government of \nChina continued to commit widespread and well-documented human rights \nabuses in violation of internationally accepted norms, including \nextrajudicial killings, the use of torture, arbitrary arrest and \ndetention, forced abortion and sterilization, the sale of organs from \nexecuted prisoners, and tight control over the exercise of the rights \nof freedom of speech, press, and religion.''\n  According to testimony to Congress by Amnesty International, the \nhuman rights situation in China shows no fundamental change, despite \nthe recent promises from the government of China. At least 2,000 people \nremain in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes that are no longer \neven on the books in China. At least 200 individuals detained or \narrested for Tiananmen Square activities nearly a decade ago are also \nstill in prison. By China's own statistics, there are nearly a quarter \nof a million people imprisoned under the ``re-education through labor'' \nsystem. One of these, Yang Qinheng, received a three year term in March \nafter he was arrested for reading an open letter on Radio Free Asia \nciting workers' right to unionize.\n  The litany of specific violations of human rights also has continued \nunabated in the last several months. Attempts to register the fledgling \nopposition China Democratic Party resulted in at least six arrests of \nopposition political leaders. In December, Wang Youcai, a student \nleader during Tiananmen Square protests, Xu Wenli, and Qin Yongmin were \neach sentenced to over 10 years in prison allegedly for ``attempting to \noverthrow state power'' because of their roles in the Democratic Party.\n  China took great strides to keep overseas dissidents out of China. In \nApril, less than an hour after her arrival at her parents home, Li \nXiaorong, a research scholar at University of Maryland, who was \ntraveling on a US passport with a valid visa, was taken into custody. \nHer crime, according to police, was that her work in the US on behalf \nof human rights in China was unacceptable. Similarly, in October, Shi \nBinhai, a journalist at the state-run China Economic Times and co-\neditor of a book on political reform was indicted for collusion with \noverseas dissident organizations. As recently as February 4, Wang Ce \nwas sentenced to four years in prison for illegally reentering China \nand providing financial support to the banned Democratic Party.\n  Demonstrating that the range of potential crimes has moved into the \ncomputer era, this year in late January, Lin Hai received the \ndistinction of being sentenced to two years in prison for providing e-\nmail addresses to an Internet pro-democracy magazine. These are but a \nfew of the many detentions, arrests, and assignments to  forced labor \nthat befell individuals for expressing their views since the \nPresident's human rights dialogue at the June 1998 summit in Beijing.\n\n  Mr. President, the situation is just as bad in Tibet, where, \naccording to Human Rights Watch, at least ten prisoners reportedly died \nfollowing two protests in a prison in the Tibetan capital in May. In \nthe weeks following, scores of prisoners were interrogated, beaten and \nplaced in solitary confinement. Other deaths in prison reportedly \noccurred in June, with Chinese authorities claiming that many were \nsuicides. Further, during the 1998, Chinese officials continued the \n``patriotic education campaign''' designed to force Tibetans, \nespecially Buddist monks and nuns, to denounce the Dalai Lama and to \nattest that Tibet has always been a part of China. As a result of the \ncampaign, authorities reported that 76 percent of Tibetan monasteries \nand nunneries had been ``rectified''.\n  In a December speech Secretary Albright said, ``As we look ahead to \nthe new century, we can expect that, perhaps, the greatest test of \ndemocracy, human rights and the rule of law will be in China.'' If the \nAdministration believes this, perhaps it should use the time left in \nthis century to take positive steps to encourage international \ncondemnation of China's human rights practices.\n  In January, Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights \nand Labor, Harold Koh held a bilateral human rights dialogue with the \nChinese, the first such discussions in four years, and notified them of \nthe possibility that the United States would sponsor a resolution in \nGeneva. In testimony to Congress following these discussions, he \nfurther promised that\n\n[[Page S1655]]\n\n``The Administration supports the Geneva process, and intends to \nparticipate vigorously in this year's Commission activities.'' I was \nencouraged to hear these words and I hope they will translate into \ndetermination by the Administration actively to pursue this issue, in \nthis forum, this year.\n  I urge the Administration to make a decision to sponsor a resolution \nand to begin high level lobbying of governments around the world to \nsupport a resolution before Secretary of State Albright travels to \nBeijing on March 1 and 2.\n  Mr. President, the situation in China indeed remains troubling.

Mr. President, last year I rose to offer a Mile \nHigh Salute to the Denver Broncos for winning their first world \nchampionship. It gives me great pleasure to rise again today and offer \na ``Repeat Mile High Salute'' to Colorado's repeat Super Bowl \nchampions. On Sunday the Denver Broncos won their second world \nchampionship in two years in Super Bowl Thirty-Three by beating Coach \nDan Reeves and the Atlanta Falcons.\n  The Broncos thrilling win came after the finest regular season in \nclub history. Coach Mike Shanahan guided the Broncos to a thirteen game \nwinning streak to start the season and an overall 19-2 record. Hall of \nFame bound icon John Elway became only the second quarterback ever to \nthrow for over 50,000 yards and he stands today as the winningest \nquarterback in NFL history with 148 regular season wins. Running back \nTerrell Davis became only the fourth player in NFL history to run for \nmore than 2,000 yards and his season ranks as the third best ever for \nhis position. Even place kicker Jason Elam kicked his way into the \nrecord books with a record tying 63 yard field goal earlier this year.\n  The Denver receiving corps is among the finest in football, featuring \nthe sure-handed and hard blocking Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith who each \ncaught for over 1,000 yards this season. And no one will be able to \nforget the verbose Shannon Sharpe who became the first tight-end in \nhistory to record 7 straight fifty catch seasons. The Broncos will send \nan American Football Conference record 10 players to the Pro Bowl in \nHawaii. John Elway, Terrell Davis, Ed McCaffrey, Shannon Sharpe, Steve \nAtwater, Bill Romanowski, Tom Nalen, Mark Schlereth, Tony Jones and \nJason Elam each made the trip to Hawaii.\n  The Denver offensive line, while quiet and unassuming off the field, \ndominates the line of scrimmage every week.\n  The well-balanced offense has been complimented by an equally well-\nbalanced defense. Led this season by leading tackler Bill Romanowski \nand veterans Ray Crockett, Steve Atwater, Neil Smith, Maa Tanuvasa and \nKeith Traylor. The Broncos defense has improved every step of the way \nthrough the regular season and playoffs.\n  The Broncos defense was as equally team oriented in their Super Bowl \nefforts. Their 30 tackles were distributed among twelve players. \nDarrien Gordon and Darrius Johnson combined for three interceptions and \nlinebackers John Mobley and Bill Romanowski each recorded a sack on \nAtlanta quarterback Chris Chandler.\n  What makes the Broncos special, though, is that all of their \nindividual accomplishments highlight fine team play from each and every \nplayer. When you look at the Super Bowl, Mr. President, you can see \nthat this championship was truly a team effort.\n  The Broncos offense totaled 457 yards. Terrell Davis rushed for 102 \nyards, while John Elway connected with six different receivers for 336 \nyards. Rod Smith led all receivers with 152 yards, including a key 80 \nyard reception that broke the game open in the second quarter. At the \nconclusion of the game, and perhaps at the close of his amazing sixteen \nyear career, John Elway was named Most Valuable Player of the Super \nBowl.\n  While nothing will compare to the excitement of last year's win, I \nknow I speak for all Coloradans when I say that we are proud to be the \nhome of the back to back world champion Denver Broncos.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1655-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1655-S1656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN RECOGNITION OF JUDGE LAURENCE E. HOWARD\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nremarkable person from my home state of Michigan, Judge Laurence E. \nHoward. On February 26, 1999, Judge Howard will\n\n[[Page S1656]]\n\nretire after 23 years of service to the Bankruptcy Court for the \nWestern District of Michigan.\n  Judge Howard's history of public service is truly deserving of \nrecognition. After serving his country in the Army during the Korean \nWar, he received his Juris Doctor degree from Notre Dame in 1961. He \nthen embarked upon a short career in the private sector, and in 1961, \nhe returned to the public arena as Assistant City Attorney of Grand \nRapids, Michigan. A couple of years later, he decided to return to \nprivate practice, but in 1968, the call of public service encouraged \nhim to run for the U.S. House of Representatives. Though his bid for \noffice was unsuccessful, he remained active in local politics over the \nnext several years. In 1976, he was appointed to the Bankruptcy Court \nfor the Western District of Michigan. For the last 23 years, Judge \nHoward has served with integrity and compassion.\n  His departure from the bench will certainly mark a new chapter in his \nlife. I am confident that it will be as successful as his law career. \nThough he plans to remain active in the Grand Rapids area, he will \nsurely enjoy spending more time with Marilyn, his wife of over forty \nyears, his four children and sixteen grandchildren. I am pleased to \njoin his colleagues, friends and family in offering my thanks for all \nhe has done.\n  Mr. President, Judge Laurence E. Howard can take pride in his long \ncareer of honor and dedication to the public. I know my colleagues will \njoin me in saluting Judge Howard's commitment to his community, his \ncountry and the law, and in wishing him well in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1655-4", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN RECOGNITION OF PATRICK CAMPBELL\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nPatrick Campbell as he celebrates his retirement from the International \nUnion of Operating Engineers. Pat has been a cornerstone of the labor \nmovement in New Jersey for over fifty years, and he has made equally \nsignificant contributions to political and civic life. It is a pleasure \nfor me to be able to honor his past accomplishments.\n  Prior to his career with the IUOE, Pat served admirably in the United \nStates Navy, as a Navy Seabee in the South Pacific during World War II. \nUpon returning to the United States, Pat joined Local 825, \nInternational Union of Operating Engineers and quickly rose through its \nranks to occupy numerous leadership positions. The membership of Local \n825 recognized Pat's leadership when he was chosen as Business Manager \nin 1976, and reelected seven times.\n  Pat is Second General Vice President of the International Union of \nOperating Engineers. As General Vice President, he is delegated to \nattend many conferences and conventions of the Operating Engineers and \nalso serves on joint committees of the Engineers/Teamsters, Engineers/\nLaborers, and Engineers/Iron Workers. In addition, Pat is President of \nthe Northeastern Conference of Operating Engineers, and a Vice \nPresident of the New Jersey AFL-CIO.\n  Pat's leadership has advanced New Jersey's interests as well. He has \nserved as Vice President of the New Jersey State Building and \nConstruction Trades Council, and has been a delegate to numerous \nconferences and conventions with the council. Pat has also served on \nthe Port Authority Development Advisory Committee of New York and New \nJersey.\n  In addition to his union activities, Pat has served as a scoutmaster \nfor the Boy Scouts of America, has coached Little League girls' \nsoftball, and has been Vice President of the Parents' Guild of Roselle \nCatholic High School. Pat has also been a member of the Catholic War \nVeterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Knights of Columbus. \nPat is currently a member of the Council of Regents of Felician College \nin Lodi, New Jersey, and a member of the Housing Commission of the \nArchdiocese of Newark. Pat and his wife, Adele, have been married for \nforty-eight years and are the proud parents of four children and ten \ngrandchildren.\n  Pat's integrity and commitment to New Jersey are two of the qualities \nI admire most. He has worked to pass these same qualities along to the \ncountless numbers he has faithfully served. Pat's contributions have \ndone much for the future of New Jersey, and our nation as a whole. I \ncongratulate Pat on a job well done, and I wish him the best in \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1656-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                CENSURE\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, during the impeachment trial, it was \nthe duty of the Senate to look at the facts, look at the law, look at \nthe Constitution, and make a judgment. We did our duty.\n  But now we need to go one step further because neither acquittal nor \nconviction is an entirely adequate conclusion to this sordid matter. We \nmust speak our contempt and disappointment for the low behavior of our \nhighest elected official.\n  We need to speak for the spirit behind our laws, behind this \ninstitution, behind the country. We need to say that the President's \nactions and lies were wrong--``shameful, reckless and indefensible.'' \nWe need to acknowledge that his conduct, unacceptable for any American, \nis especially so for the President of the United States because it \n``creates disrespect for the laws of the land.''\n  I am proud that all 100 Senators worked together through this ordeal \nto do our duty. I am proud that so many of us from both sides of the \naisle worked together to craft this tough censure resolution.\n  But I am sorry that a small minority will keep us from also doing \nwhat is honorable and what is right. We need to officially express our \ncollective disdain for the President's conduct. It's the only truly \nappropriate, bipartisan way to bring closure to this melancholy moment \nin American history.\n  When Senator Feinstein and I started talking about a censure \nresolution, as early as last December, I had no certainty that we would \ncome so far and bring so many along. Her perseverance, hard work and \nlegislative craftsmanship deserve our praise, but our efforts deserve a \nclean ``up or down'' vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1656-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1656-S1657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN RECOGNITION OF 100 YEARS OF BASKETBALL AT MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nMichigan State University basketball program, which is celebrating 100 \nyears of excellence this year.\n  The MSU fight song begins, ``On the banks of the Red Cedar, Is a \nschool that's known to all, Its specialty is winning, And those \nSpartans play good ball. . .'' Any basketball fan who has watched the \nSpartans on the court throughout their history knows just how good they \nhave been. Who could forget the wizardry of Lansing, Michigan's own \nEarvin Johnson, who performed ``magic'' every time he stepped onto the \ncourt? Or the deft shooting touch of Big Ten scoring champion Mike \nRobinson? Or the dapper sensibility of legendary coach Jud Heathcote, \nwho coached Michigan State to a national championship in 1979? In all, \nthe MSU men's basketball team has won seven Big Ten championships, one \nnational title, and has made ten consecutive post-season tournament \nappearances. Forty-five Spartans have been drafted by the National \nBasketball Association, fifteen have been honored as first-team All-\nAmericans, and four have been Big Ten Player of the Year.\n  This year's Spartans basketball team is living up to the standards \nset by the heroes of the past. They are currently in first place in the \nBig Ten and are ranked fourth in the nation. Under the leadership of \ntheir coach, Iron Mountain, Michigan native Tom Izzo, the Spartans are \nroaring into the post-season ready for the challenges ``March Madness'' \nwill bring. Like countless basketball fans nationwide, I am looking \nforward to watching Mateen Cleaves, Morris Peterson and the rest of the \nteam add another national championship to the Michigan State trophy \ncollection.\n  Michigan State's athletes, whether they compete in basketball, \nvolleyball, gymnastics, football, or any of MSU's athletic programs, \nalso deserve recognition for their outstanding achievements in the \nclassroom. More than three hundred of MSU's student athletes had 3.0 \ncumulative grade point averages as of the fall semester. One hundred \nseventy-eight were on the\n\n[[Page S1657]]\n\nDean's List. And thirty-nine had 4.0 grade point averages. Now, thanks \nto the unprecedented generosity of a former Spartan basketball player, \nMSU's student athletes will have access to some of the finest academic \nsupport facilities in the country. Steve Smith, Michigan State's all-\ntime leading scorer and current NBA star, recently gave $2.5 million to \nMSU to build the Clara Bell Smith Student-Athlete Center, named for \nSteve's late mother. The Center serves the more than 800 students who \nplay varsity sports at Michigan State. Athletes are able to take \nadvantage of tutoring and mentoring programs, computer literacy \ntraining and career development sessions. The Clara Bell Smith Student-\nAthlete Center is truly a powerful symbol of Michigan State's \ncommitment to the academic success of its athletes.\n  Mr. President, Michigan State basketball has brought pride to the \nstudents and alumni of that great university, as well as to the people \nof Michigan. I know my colleagues will join me in congratulating \nMichigan State's students, alumni and faculty as it celebrates 100 \nyears of basketball excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1656-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RESOLUTION OF CENSURE\n\n   Mr. HOLLINGS.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to commend Mr. Frank Burk, the \nLegislative Counsel of the Senate, who retired on December 31, 1998, \nafter serving in the Senate for more than 28 years, including 8 years \nas Legislative Counsel.\n  Mr. President, as President pro tempore of the Senate, it was my \npleasure to oversee the work of the Office of the Legislative Counsel \nduring the last four years of Frank Burk's tenure. I appreciated the \ngreat dedication and professionalism he displayed in his role as \nLegislative Counsel.\n  The Legislative Counsel and his staff play a very important role in \nthe legislative process. We all rely upon the Legislative Counsel and \nthe attorneys in his Office to provide legislative drafts to \neffectively carry out our legislative policy. Mr. Burk has seen to it \nthat we are all served well by a professional, career, and nonpartisan \nstaff.\n  In addition to his service as Legislative Counsel, Frank Burk served \nfor more than 25 years as the principal drafter in the Senate on \nvirtually all matters relating to banking, housing, securities, mass \ntransit, and small business. As Legislative Counsel, he prepared \nlegislation on matters relating to the operations and rules of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor this resolution and I am proud \nto have known and worked with Frank Burk. He has served his Nation well \nfor over 30 years, including two years with the United States Army. I \nwish Frank and his wife Virginia the very best for the future, \nespecially time spent with their four daughters, Elizabeth, Alison, \nAbigail, and Emily, their two sons-in-law, Lange Johnson and Hunt \nShipman, and their granddaughter, Anna Shipman.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor with Senator \nThurmond a resolution commending Mr. Frank Burk who retired as \nLegislative Counsel of the Senate on December 31, 1998. While serving \nas President pro tempore of the Senate, I had the pleasure of \nappointing Frank Burk to the position of Legislative Counsel of the \nSenate on January 1, 1991.\n  I wish to join with Senator Thurmond, and with all Senators, in \nexpressing our deepest gratitude to Frank Burk for his long years of \nservice to the United States Senate. He has been part of the Office of \nLegislative Counsel for more than 28 years, including the last 8 as \nLegislative Counsel; and during that time he has provided valuable \nassistance to me and to my staff.\n  Mr. President, while overseeing the Office of Legislative Counsel \nduring the first 4 years of Frank Burk's tenure as Legislative Counsel, \nI appreciated the great dedication and professionalism he displayed in \ncarrying out his duties and responsibilities. I know that his departure \nwill leave a void that is difficult to fill. In passing this \nresolution, the Senate recognizes his years of commitment to the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I wish Frank Burk and his family well in his \nretirement.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank Francis Burk for his nearly three decades of service to the \nUnited States Senate and to wish him well as he begins the next chapter \nof his life.\n  Frank Burk began his career with the Senate Office of Legislative \nCounsel in June 1970. For more than 25 years, Frank was the primary \ndrafter in the Senate of legislation relating to banking, securities, \nhousing, mass transportation, and small business. Senator Byrd, as \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate, appointed Frank as Legislative \nCounsel of the Senate on January 1, 1991. He continued to serve in that \nposition until his retirement on December 31, 1998.\n  Mr. President, Frank Burk is one of the dedicated public servants who \nserve the Senate for years and who become sources of knowledge and \nexpertise for all Senators and staff. They are our institutional \nmemory: those who allow us to proceed from Congress to Congress with a \nsense of history and continuity. Our jobs would be even more difficult \nwithout people like Frank.\n  I know I speak for other Senators and for staff when I say we will \nmiss Frank Burk.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Mr. Thurmond, in cosponsoring his resolution expressing \nthe gratitude of the Senate for the service of the Senate Legislative \nCounsel, Frank Burk.\n  Many people outside the Senate do not know the office of the \nLegislative Counsel even exists. However, the legislative business of \nthe Senate could not be accomplished without the able assistance of the \noffice of the Legislative Counsel.\n  A graduate of Dartmouth College and George Washington University Law \nSchool, Mr. Burk served as an Army officer in Korea. Mr. Burk has \nworked in the Legislative Counsel's office for more than 28 years, \nbeginning as a law assistant in 1970 and rising to hold the office's \ntop position, Legislative Counsel in 1991.\n  As many know, attorneys in the legislative counsel's office have \nspecific areas of expertise and responsibility. For more than 25 years, \nMr. Burk's responsibilities included banking, securities, \ntransportation, housing and small business. After becoming Legislative \nCounsel, he assumed the duty of drafting legislation relating to the \noperations and rules of the Senate.\n  I am very pleased to join my colleagues today in expressing our \ngratitude and in extending our best wishes to Frank Burk.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Marcos.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as many of our colleges may be aware, Mr. \nDavid G. Marcos, who has served as the Senate's Executive Clerk for the \nlast four years, has recently retired. Under David's supervision, the \nOffice of Executive Clerk processed all of the executive business of \nthe Senate. This includes the preparation of the Executive Calendar and \nprocessing hundreds of nominations and treaties to which the Senate \ngives its advice and consent each year. This effort requires a great \ndeal of attention to detail. The Senate requires the staff of this \noffice to work long and hard into the night after the Senate closes its \nfloor proceedings. Dave Marcos was one of the uncomplaining individuals \nwho put this Senate first and worked hard to make sure the Senate's \n``advice and consent'' responsibility was accurately documented and \nrecorded.\n  Before becoming the Executive Clerk of the United States Senate, Dave \nworked as the Assistant Executive Clerk, the Keeper of Stationery and \nin other responsible posts. His career in the Senate spanned 39 years.\n  Mr. President, I extend my best wishes to Mr. David G. Marcos in his \nwell deserved retirement and wish him many years of health and \nhappiness.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I also wish to extend my best wishes to \nMr. David G. Marcos on the occasion of his retirement.\n  Mr. Marcos has had a long career of distinguished service to the \nSenate, under both Republican and Democratic majorities. He worked hard \nto discharge whatever responsibilities were assigned him, whether as \nExecutive Clerk, Assistant Executive Clerk, Keeper of Stationery, or in \nother responsible positions. For 39 years, David provided dedicated \nservice to the Senate, and I know that I speak for my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, when I commend him for his long and dedicated \nservice. Undoubtedly, Dave has seen many changes and improvements in \nthe administrative operations of the Senate over his long career. He \ncan be rightfully proud of the contributions he has made to the \nimprovements in the Office of the Executive Clerk and the Senate \nStationery Room. Again, I offer my best congratulations to Dave. May he \nenjoy many years of health and happiness in his retirement.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating to the resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

First, Mr. President, now that the vote to impeach \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton has been taken, and before I discuss my vote, \nlet me say that this whole thing could have been avoided had President \nClinton resigned months ago. I say this because I called for his \nresignation last September. Rather than explain my reasoning for \ncalling for President Clinton's resignation, I believe it is better \nexplained by an 8th grade school teacher from Tulsa, Oklahoma, Mr. \nTerrence Hogan. I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Hogan's letter to the \nPresident dated September 26, 1998, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               September 26, 1998.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: It is in the early morning hours. The \n     infamous Starr report has been made public for less than \n     twentyfour hours and I am unable to sleep. I don't imagine \n     you've had much of a restful night either. As you no doubt \n     are troubled, so am I.\n       As the forty eight year old father of five and a teacher of \n     eighth grade Civics these past twenty two years I am greatly \n     concerned about the moral direction of our nation. It is as \n     if we have lost our compass and know not what we as a nation \n     wish to be. I am fearful, for I do not wish us to become a \n     nation that is only concerned about the economy and has lost \n     the will to be a nation of admirable principles. I do not \n     want us to dissolve into a people who are more influenced by \n     the spin of the facts than the facts themselves. I am \n     concerned about the effects the next six months of a legal \n     nit picking debate over whether or not you commited an \n     impeachable offense will have on our nation. I am also \n     concerned that the debate will not ask what I believe to be \n     the two paramount questions. First, are you capable of \n     leading this nation for the next 30 months in the directions \n     that we want and need to go? And secondly, do you deserve to \n     be allowed to lead this country?\n\n[[Page S1661]]\n\n       There is no question in my mind that you have the will to \n     lead. The sad conclusion I have drawn is that you no longer \n     have the moral authority to lead for you have violated the \n     main foundation upon which all relationships are built, that \n     being the existence of mutual trust. In the elections of 1992 \n     and 1996 the American voters forgave you for your one \n     admitted transgression with Ms. Flowers. Then, however, you \n     chose to repeat that transgression in the confines of the \n     Oval office. After which, when confronted with your choices \n     you chose to repeatedly lie to your wife, daughter, \n     supporters and the American people. You chose to continually \n     lie about your choices rather than to frame the debate around \n     the issue that this was a private matter between you and your \n     wife and therefore no business of the American public. It is \n     my heartfelt belief that your choice to lie was designed not \n     so much to save your wife and daughter certain pain but to \n     save yourself and your presidency, an understandable choice \n     but not an acceptable one. Your willful and repeated lying \n     has given the people of this country an insight into the \n     character and integrity of their leader.\n       With this in mind I am asking you to resign your position \n     as President of these United States for if we are even to \n     pretend to be a nation of principles we cannot tolerate from \n     our president actions and choices that we would not tolerate \n     from the principal of our neighborhood school.\n       In the last few days you have begun to ask the forgiveness \n     of the American people. If your contrition is heartfelt you \n     deserve the forgiveness of all those individuals whose trust \n     you have violated. I for one forgive you. But as a member of \n     the body politic I must also hold you accountable for your \n     public choices and demand that certain natural consequences \n     be allowed to occur. You no longer posess the trust of the \n     majority of the American people and can therefore no longer \n     lead that people and must therefore give up your position of \n     leadership.\n       No doubt you share my belief that God our creator calls \n     each of us to be all we can be and that we are also called to \n     sacrifice ourselves for what is in the ultimate best interest \n     of our neighbors, I am asking you now, Mr. President, to do \n     both of those things. Please set aside your personal pride \n     and ambitions, take full responsibility for the choices you \n     have made, accept the natural consequences of those choices \n     and step down as our president and save this nation from the \n     turmoil that the debate over your choices will undoubtedly \n     cause. Let this nation heal and get on with those issues you \n     believe need to be dealt with. Please remember that in making \n     this personal sacrifice that your true legacy will not be \n     determined by what kind of president you were but by what \n     kind of man you became.\n       Please know that my prayers are with you and your family in \n     this time of trial for you, your family and this country.\n           With sincerity,\n                                                   Terrence Hogan.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Today I voted to convict William Jefferson Clinton on \neach of the two Articles of Impeachment presented by the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I find the President guilty, as charged, of high crimes and \nmisdemeanors: lying under oath and obstructing justice. The President \nengaged in a deliberate and selfish pattern of conduct designed to \nthwart the civil rights of a fellow citizen. This conduct represents a \nserious breach of faith and trust. This conduct is incompatible with \nthe solemn duties and moral responsibilities of the high office of \nPresident of the United States.\n  Similar conduct by others results in consequences: perjurers, witness \ntamperers and obstructors of justice go to jail; supervisors lose their \njobs; military officers are court-martialed, imprisoned or forced out \nof the armed forces; judges are impeached and removed from office. \nShall we embrace a lower standard for this President under these \ncircumstances? I think not. I believe that the President of the United \nStates should be held to the very highest of standards.\n  I believe that conviction and removal from office is justified in \norder (1) to preserve the integrity, honor and trust of the presidency; \n(2) to protect the sanctity of the witness oath in judicial \nproceedings; and (3) to uphold the fundamental principle of ``equal \njustice under law.''\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n  In accord with my sworn oath to do ``impartial justice according to \nthe Constitution and the laws,'' I have approached the trial of William \nJefferson Clinton as a solemn constitutional duty. Voting on the \nArticles of Impeachment may be the most historically significant thing \nI will do in my entire career in public service. I have taken this \nobligation seriously, without concern for public opinion polls or for \nany partisan political advantage of consequence. This is a moment when \none must put the longer-term interests of the country first.\n\n\n                          previous jury trial\n\n  As a political opponent of this President, I have made an extra \neffort to weigh the evidence and the arguments on both sides with a \nsense of detachment and fairness. Having served on a jury in a criminal \ntrial some 24 years ago, I learned how important it is to listen and to \nexercise impartial judgment. During jury selection in a local murder \ntrial, I found myself assigned to a murder case about which I had \nexpressed a definite opinion. From press reports, I was already \nconvinced the defendant was guilty. With that and since I was the \nauthor of the capital punishment bill in the legislature, I thought for \nsure they would never qualify me for the jury, but somehow they did. \nFive days later, I surprised even myself when I became the foreman of \nthe jury that acquitted that very defendant.\n  I have approached the trial of the President with that experience in \nmind. I have also considered whether in good conscience, I would apply \nthe same judgment I made here equally to a similar set of facts and \ncircumstances if they applied to a Republican--and not a Democratic--\npresident.\n  In 1990, I did not hesitate to publicly condemn a Republican \nPresident, George Bush, when he violated his ``read my lips'' campaign \npledge. Politicians who deliberately violate public trust undermine \ngood government and increase the level of cynicism in society.\n  Today, I have a clear conscience in rendering the judgment I believe \nis just, and in the best interests of the future of the country.\n\n\n                              conclusions\n\n  I have concluded that the President engaged in a deliberate and \npremeditated pattern of conduct which was corruptly designed to \nundermine the rights of a fellow citizen. That citizen was entitled \nunder the law to obtain truth and justice in a duly constituted legal \nproceeding.\n  The President had a legal obligation, as a citizen, to comply with \nordinary and proper legal procedure and to faithfully abide by the \nstandard oath to ``tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the \ntruth.''\n  I believe the President also had a moral obligation, as President, to \nrefrain from engaging in any conduct which would, by example, undermine \nrespect for the rule of law, the witness oath, or the dignity, honor, \nor public trust embodied in the presidency.\n  The President failed to fulfill these obligations. He lied under \noath, obstructed justice and tampered with witnesses. He sought to \nundermine the judicial system for his own personal gain. In so doing, \nhe set a perverse example for every school child, parent, teacher, \nemployer, supervisor and citizen in America. He brought dishonor upon \nhimself and his office.\n\n\n             president's supporters concede essential facts\n\n  White House lawyers went to great lengths to try to deny the specific \ncharges, but common sense and the weight of the evidence leave no \nreasonable doubt in my mind that the charges are true. I believe there \nare few, if any, members of the Senate who do not believe the President \nlied under oath and obstructed justice. Even many of the President's \nmost ardent supporters in and out of the Senate have openly stated \ntheir belief that the essential facts of the case are not in dispute.\n  Senator Robert Byrd pretty well summed it up in a recent TV \nappearance. He said of the President: ``I have no doubt that he has \ngiven false testimony under oath and . . . there are indications that \nhe did indeed obstruct justice . . . It undermined the system of \njustice when he gave false testimony under oath. He lied under oath.''\n\n\n                         non-lawyer perspective\n\n  I have often said that one of the qualifications I have for the U.S. \nSenate is that I am not an attorney. So, when I read the Constitution, \nI know what it says. When I read the law, I know what it says. When I \nlook at the evidence and apply common sense from a non-lawyer \nperspective, I know what it says. In this case, it says--without \nquestion--the President is guilty as charged.\n\n\n                        conduct warrants removal\n\n  The President's attorneys kept arguing that the President's conduct \ndoes\n\n[[Page S1662]]\n\nnot amount to the technical crimes of perjury or obstruction of \njustice, but that even if it does, it should not warrant his removal \nfrom office.\n  I have concluded the President's conduct does amount to the crimes of \nperjury and obstruction, but that even if it does not, it still \nwarrants his removal from office because it is unacceptable behavior, \nincompatible with his duties and responsibilities as President.\n\n\n                            lying under oath\n\n  I was not persuaded by the hairsplitting argument that the President \ndid not lie under oath. The President lawyers claim he did not lie or \ncommit perjury before the grand jury and they imply that his conduct \nthere should be deemed acceptable. As a non-lawyer, I find their \narguments preposterous and an insult to the intelligence and moral \nsensibilities of the members of the Senate of both parties, not to \nmention the American people.\n  The President was afforded every opportunity to treat the grand jury \nwith the respect it deserved. He was not blind-sided, tricked or \ntrapped. He could anticipate all the key questions in advance. he had \nplenty of time to prepare. He was warned on numerous occasion by \nmembers of both parties in the Congress of the serious consequences of \nuntruthful testimony. Yet he deliberately sought to continue weaving a \nself-serving and misleading web of deception and falsehood.\n\n\n                          obstructing justice\n\n  Similarly, I reject the argument that the President did not commit \nobstruction of justice in an improper and illegal effort to undermine \nthe legitimate search for truth in the Paula Jones civil suit. To \nbelieve the President's defense is to stand common sense on its head.\n  Does anyone seriously believe the Lewinski job search would have \nproceeded to a successful conclusion in early January 1998--a critical \nmoment in the Jones case--had her name not appeared on the Jones case \nwitness list?\n  Does anyone seriously believe the President was suggesting to Ms. \nLewinski that she file a truthful affidavit?\n  Does anyone seriously believe that the decision to conceal the gifts \n(evidence) was not blessed and ordered by the President?\n  Does anyone seriously believe the President was seeking to ``refresh \nhis memory'' while planting false stories with Ms. Currie when his \nconversations took place after he had testified that the Jones lawyers \nshould talk to Ms. Currie.\n  Does anyone seriously believe the President did not want and expect \nMr. Blumenthal and other aides to repeat false stories to the grand \njury?\n  I do not believe any of these things. I believe--and I suspect most \nSenators believe--the President is guilty as charged of obstruction of \njustice.\n\n\n                  the president knew what he was doing\n\n  The President's efforts to cover up his relationship with Ms. \nLewinski, however understandable in a non-legal context, became \ntextbook examples of obstruction of justice once her name appeared on a \nwitness list and in a duly constituted legal proceeding.\n  The President, after all, is himself a lawyer. He was well aware \nthat--orchestrating a job search to silence a potential hostile \nwitness, suggesting the filing of a false affidavit, concealing \nrelevant evidence, and coaching potential witnesses to give false \ntestimony--all are improper and illegal.\n  Yet he chose to take these actions, not in some contorted belief that \nthey were proper, but in the calculation that if successful, he could \nthwart the legal search for truth and justice in the Jones case.\n  To accept this behavior by the President without Constitutional \nconsequence is to permit the setting of a precedent which will \nreverberate negatively for years throughout our legal justice system \nand beyond.\n\n\n             different standards for judges and presidents?\n\n  I am amazed that there is any debate whatsoever over whether lying \nunder oath before a grand jury is an impeachable offense. The precedent \nis clear: Judge Walter Nixon and others have been rightly convicted and \nremoved from office for lying under oath. Is there to be a different \nstandard for a president, or for this particular president, or for this \nparticular set of circumstances? Are we to make exceptions for lying \nunder oath so long as it is lying about some things but not others? If \nso, what precedent will that set?\n  Our legal system depends of the sanctity of the witness oath. There \ncan be no exceptions to the obligation every citizen incurs when he \nsolemnly swears ``to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but \nthe truth.'' Setting any other precedent would totally disrupt our \nsystem of jurisprudence by breeding disrespect for the rule of law.\n  The White House lawyers argued that since the President is elected \nand judges are appointed, a different standard should apply. The only \nconceivable way they might be right is if the President is held to a \nhigher--not a lower--standard.\n  Important as each of a thousand judges is to our legal system, it is \nthe President alone who stands at the pinnacle of our system of law and \njustice. He alone is constitutionally charged to ``take care that the \nlaws be faithfully executed.'' He appointed the judges. He embodies the \npublic trust to a degree far and above anyone else. He sets the example \nfor the entire nation. His public conduct in abiding by the oath must \nbe above reproach.\n\n\n                     young bill clinton's standard\n\n  In speaking about President Richard Nixon in 1974, a young Arkansas \ncongressional candidate spoke to the need for high standards:\n  ``Yes, the President should resign. He has lied to the American \npeople, time and time again, and betrayed their trust. Since he has \nadmitted guilt, there is no reason to put the American people through \nan impeachment. He will serve absolutely no purpose in finishing out \nhis term; the only possible solution is for the president to save some \ndignity and resign.''\n  The Candidate, Bill Clinton, set his own perfectly understandable \nstandard:\n  ``If a President of the United States ever lied to the American \npeople, he should resign.'' Arkansas, Democrat Gazette (8/6/74)\n\n\n                   what kind of lying is impeachable?\n\n  Recently, one of my Democrat colleagues, in a television interview, \nexplained his standard for perjury as an impeachable offense: ``Perjury \ncould be an impeachable offense,'' he said. ``If he lied about the \nnational security interest of the United States, or if he did something \nelse that had serious consequence for the country, or performing \nimproperly in his official capacity, that's impeachable.'' But if he's \n``not acting in his official capacity'' and only ``as an individual,'' \nthat's different. That's not impeachable, he says.\n  I believe this kind of making exceptions for lies about certain \nsubjects, and not others, is a dangerous and slippery slope. I believe \nany lying before a grand jury by a sitting president will have \n``serious consequences for the country'' if it is deemed to be in some \nway acceptable.\n\n\n                     national security implications\n\n  Indeed, part of the reason this is so important is that if the \nPresident is capable of lying under oath about one thing, it reveals a \npredisposition and capability to lie about other more important things, \nwhile not under oath. For example, we already know this president has \nlied about the national security interest of the United States on \nnumerous occasions. He lied to Congress in 1995 in pledging U.S. troops \nwould not remain in Bosnia beyond one year. He lied or misled audiences \nover 130 times 1995 and 1996 in asserting that no nuclear missiles were \naimed at American children. People know he has lied on numerous other \npublic occasions. Such behavior eats away the public trust and the \nmoral authority of the presidency, which are so vital to the national \nsecurity.\n  In addition, it should not go unremarked that the President's \nunderlying conduct in this matter showed astonishingly bad judgment and \ndisregard for the national security implications of his own behavior. \nIn the modern world, the President is always a potential target of \nforeign intrigue, blackmail and salacious propaganda.\n  Ms. Lewinski testified before the grand jury that the President \nhimself speculated that his phone calls to her may have been monitored \nby a foreign embassy. In essence, he was admitting that he had exposed \nhimself to potential blackmail. Such behavior by any president is not \nmerely inappropriate. It is clearly dangerous and unacceptable.\n\n[[Page S1663]]\n\n                        erosion of public trust\n\n  Economic-driven ``popularity'' polls are masking an unprecedented \nerosion of public trust in this President which has already caused \nserious damage to his ability to rally the country in time of national \nthreat or crisis. His consistent and long-term pattern of untruthful \nand deceptive behavior, as exemplified in the Articles of Impeachment, \nhas undermined his credibility to such an extent that he can longer be \nafforded the benefit of any public doubt about virtually any topic.\n  When the President took military action against overseas terrorists \ntargets in August and when he ordered air strikes against Iraq in \nDecember, popular majorities (!)--in the polls--questioned his timing \nand motives--and rightly so. Suspicions about both of these actions \nlinger to this day, draining the small reserves of trust the President \nmay have left.\n\n  What happens if and when there is a much more serious international \nor domestic crisis, requiring timely public sacrifice mobilized through \npresidential leadership? Will the President be believed--even if he is \ntelling the truth? In a world of many lurking dangers of which much of \nthe public is only vaguely aware (from information warfare to weapons \nof mass destruction), such questions raise very serious concerns.\n\n\n             what do we say to previously convicted liars?\n\n  If we do not hold the President accountable in this case, what do we \nsay to the over 100 people who are serving time in federal prison for \ncommitting perjury in legal proceedings? What do we say to Ms. Barbara \nBattalino, who was convicted of perjury, sentenced, and lost her right \nto practice her profession because she lied under oath . . . about sex \n. . . in a civil case . . . that was eventually dismissed by the judge? \nWhat do we say to others in similar situations? I was waiting for the \nPresident's lawyers to address these issues. But they never did in any \nremotely satisfactory way.\n\n\nwhat do we say to military officers disciplined for lying about sexual \n                              misconduct?\n\n  What do we say to the military officers whose careers and lives have \nbeen ruined over misconduct similar to the President's, including \nsexual misconduct, lying and obstructing justice?\n  Capt. Derrick Robinson, an Army officer caught up in the Aberdeen sex \nmisconduct case, is serving time in Leavenworth prison for admitting to \nconsensual sex with an enlisted person who was not his wife.\n  Drill Sgt. Delmar Simpson is serving 25 years in a military prison \nbecause a court martial found that, even though his relationship with a \nfemale recruit was consensual, the power granted him by his rank made \nsuch consensual sex with a subordinate unacceptable and--in the \nmilitary--illegal.\n  Lt. Kelly Flinn was forced out of the Air Force for lying about an \nadulterous affair.\n  Sgt. Maj. Gene McKinney, the Army's top enlisted man, was tried for \nperjury, adultery and obstruction of justice concerning sexual \nmisconduct. He was convicted of obstruction of justice, but not before \nhis attorney asserted at trial how people in uniform rightly ask: ``How \ncan you hold an enlisted man to a higher standard than the President of \nthe United States,'' the Commander-in-Chief.\n\n\n                            double standard\n\n  When we establish a glaring double standard in the law, we diminish \nrespect for all law. This is why we must uphold the highest of \nstandards for officials in public office.\n\n\n                                censure\n\n  I will oppose any censure resolution that may be offered after the \ntrial, as I opposed any so-called ``finding of fact'' during the trial, \nbecause it is little more than a thinly veiled effort to give people \npolitical cover. I believe some who might otherwise vote to convict \nlook to censure as a way to justify or politically cover a vote to \nacquit. There is no precedent for censure in the Constitution or in an \nimpeachment context. It would be dangerous and wrong to set such a \nprecedent now. I believe it could threaten the separation of powers \nbetween the branches of government as Congresses start censuring \nSupreme Courts and Presidents for all manner of perceived misconduct.\n  Senators should vote on the Articles of Impeachment, explain their \nreasons, and live with the consequences.\n  I am struck that some of my colleagues who agree that the President \ndid commit the serious offenses charged in the Articles of Impeachment, \nstill believe Congress can render some effective consequence short of \nremoval such as censure, which will uphold the presidency, the rule of \nlaw, and the sanctity of the oath. I believe they are wrong.\n  I fear that they are not properly considering the precedent they \nwould establish. Nevermind what we think of this particular president. \nA thoroughly corrupt president in the future will not be inhibited by \nthe empty words of a non-biding ``sense of the Senate'' resolution. \nHowever, such a corrupt president will think twice about certain \nconduct, if he knows without doubt, by precedent, that such conduct is \nremovable.\n  If perjury, obstruction of justice, and witness tampering are \ndeemed--as a result of this trial--to be non-removal offenses in \ncertain circumstances, then a corrupt future president may calculate \nthem to be acceptable. We should not set that precedent.\n\n\n                               witnesses\n\n  From the beginning, I strongly supported efforts to allow both the \nHouse managers and the White House lawyers to call whatever live \nwitnesses they deemed necessary to make their case. I favored a full \nand complete trial, believing that it was more important to insure \nfairness to both sides than it was to get the trial over by some \narbitrary date. This was in keeping with normal procedures in all \nprevious impeachment trials. It also seemed to me to be essential to \nfundamental fairness and a full airing of the facts and issues in \ndispute. A hundred years from now, no one will care whether the trial \nlasted two weeks or six months. They will care, we must hope, about the \nextent to which justice was done. Overall, I was disappointed in the \nunnecessarily tight procedural restrictions imposed on this trial, \nincluding the limits on witnesses, I fear that a bad precedent has been \nunnecessarily set for the future.\n\n\n                          closed deliberations\n\n  Throughout the trial, I opposed efforts to waive the time-honored \nrules of procedure which require that deliberations among senators be \nclosed to the public. I am convinced this was the right decision. The \nclosed meetings allowed for a more colleagial atmosphere among \nsenators, limiting much of the posturing and grandstanding that often \ngoes on before the cameras. The closed sessions also helped enhance a \ngreater spirit of duty and cooperation concerning the tasks at hand. As \nwith all jury trials going back for more than 2000 years in history, \nclosed deliberations constitute proper procedure and I believe this \ntradition should be maintained.\n  This need not, and does not, diminish the accountability of senators \nto their constituents and the public at large. All roll call votes \nremain open and I believe every member maintains an obligation to \ninform his constituents of the reason for his votes.\n\n\n             constitutent letter raises key issue: the kids\n\n  I received a letter from Mr. Terrence Hogan of Owasso, Okla., an \neighth grade civics teacher at the Cascia Hall Middle School in Tulsa \nfor the past 22 years. He wrote last September saying he ``was greatly \nconcerned about the moral direction of our nation'' in light of the \nPresident's ``willful and repeated lying.'' He said the nation ``cannot \ntolerate from our President actions and choices that we would not \ntolerate from the principal of our neighborhood school.''\n  And this is exactly the point that people across America are asking. \nIs the President subject to the same moral accountability as every \nother responsible citizen in the workplace, or in any other position of \npublic trust? And what do we say to the kids about truth and justice, \nabout honesty and integrity, about the political and governmental \nheritage they should admire and emulate?\n\n\n                          impeachable offenses\n\n  These acts, which were committed willfully and premediately by the \nPresident, are serious offenses which I believe clearly rise to the \nlevel of impeachable offenses.\n  I reject the White House lawyers' argument that the President's \nconduct\n\n[[Page S1664]]\n\ndoes not amount to the technical ``crimes'' of perjury and obstruction, \nbut I'm content to allow a regular court of law to settle the issue. I \nalso reject their argument that the President's conduct does not rise \nto the level of impeachable offenses.\n  I believe the President's conduct (however it is ultimately labeled) \nconstitutes absolutely unacceptable behavior on the part of the \nPresident of the United States, the nation's chief law enforcement \nofficer who is constitutionally charged to ``faithfully execute the \nlaws,'' and who, by word and deed, sets an example for every citizen.\n  In finding the President guilty on both Articles of Impeachment, I \nbelieve the constitutional consequence of removal from office is \nwarranted in order to uphold for future generations:\n  The integrity, honor, and trust which are indispensable to the moral \nauthority of the presidency;\n  The sanctity of the oath which every citizen must take in any legal \nproceeding to tell ``the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the \ntruth;'' and\n  The viability of our judicial system, the rule of law, and the \nprinicple of ``equal justice under law.''\n\n\n                  a final note to my fellow oklahomans\n\n  Holding public office is a special privilege and I am continually \ngrateful to the people of Oklahoma for the opportunity to serve in the \nUnited States Senate.\n  During the past weeks and months, I have received thousands of \nletters, e-mails, faxes, phone calls and other communications relative \nto the impeachment trial and all of the subject matters surrounding it. \nMany have expressed strongly held views on one side or the other, often \nurging me to vote in accord with their wishes and thinking. My \noverworked staff and I have done our best to digest and respond to \nthese inquiries and comments as best we could. To those who may have \nnot yet received a personal response, I want to express my appreciation \nfor sharing your thoughts, your ideas, and your concerns.\n  Whether you agree or disagree, I want you to know that my votes for \nconviction on the two Articles of Impeachment represent my best \njudgment, based on my analysis of the facts, the law, the Constitution \nand what I believe is best for our country. They do not represent the \nresults of any poll or political calculation about what may be popular, \neither in Oklahoma or elsewhere.\n  I have viewed the trial as a serious Constitutional duty and have \nlistened and deliberated with profound sense of history and patriotism. \nI have sought to respect the process and preserve for future \ngenerations those wise procedural precedents, including the rule of \nlaw, that have served this nation so well for over 200 years.\n  I have stated my views and I accept the result of the trial. I harbor \nno personal bitterness or hatred toward the President. It is time to \nlook to the future. I hope all of us on all sides of these issues can \nunite in a prayer for the future of our country and for the ideals of \nfreedom and justice it stands for in the world. God Bless America.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I just want to point out to everyone \nwho is interested that a censure resolution has been entered at the \ndesk. It has 38 cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, during these trying days, the question has been asked \nof many of us: ``What will we tell our children about this sordid \nperiod in our Nation's history?''\n  Mr. President, Members of the Senate, I had hoped to be able to tell \nmy granddaughter and, indeed, the rest of our Nation, that the United \nStates Senate had come together in bipartisan fellowship to approve a \ncensure resolution that would deliver a clear message that the behavior \nof President William Jefferson Clinton has been inappropriate, \nintolerable and unacceptable.\n  Unfortunately, some in this body have forestalled our ability to \nbring such a resolution to the floor of the Senate for a vote. This I \nregret deeply.\n  There are moments in history when we are able to rise up against the \nforces driving us apart and come together with a united purpose. I \nbelieve that the censure resolution provided us with just such an \nopportunity.\n  While not a cure-all, the resolution is a way to share with our \nchildren and the rest of our nation our findings, our sentiments, our \nbelief that the actions of the President are a violation of the trust \nof the American people and have brought shame and dishonor upon the \npresidency and the man.\n  But as has been made clear, those of us who truly believe a strong \ncensure is the appropriate resolution in this case are being prevented \nfrom bringing it to the floor of this Senate for a vote.\n  The main co-sponsor is the Senator from Utah, Mr. Robert Bennett. In \nall, it is co-sponsored by 36 Senators.--over \\1/3\\ of this Senate.\n  The words of the resolution were strong, but they are fitting words \nand I believe a bipartisan majority of the Senate would be prepared to \nvote for this censure resolution if it were permitted to come to a vote \ntoday.\n  Over the past few weeks, I have worked very closely with a large \nnumber of Senators to develop a bipartisan resolution, largely because \nI felt it so important that anyone who looks at this shabby episode of \nAmerican history understands that while one may not vote to convict and \nremove a president, one can have profound dismay and concern about the \nmisconduct that was inherent in the articles of impeachment.\n  That is why I regret deeply that some have seen fit to prevent us \nfrom voting on a censure resolution.\n  Because that cannot happen today, I have joined with the cosponsors \nof this resolution to formally present it to the Senate and record it \nin the Congressional Record, making clear for all time the strong \ncensure of this President and condemnation of his actions by at least \none-third of the U.S. Senate.\n  Earlier today, I voted against conviction and removal of the \nPresident on both articles of impeachment. I did not believe the House \nmanagers established beyond a reasonable doubt that this President is \nguilty of perjury and obstruction of justice.\n  Although I deplore the circumstances that have brought us to this \npoint, I do not believe they present a clear and present danger to the \nfunctioning of our government, and therefore this President, who has \nbeen a good President for the people of the United States, should not \nbe convicted and removed from office.\n  However, I feel very strongly and sincerely that the acquittal of the \nPresident on the articles of impeachment should not be the Senate's \nlast word on the President's conduct, and that without further action \nsuch as a resolution of censure, the wrong message about the \nPresident's actions and the Senate's views thereon will be sent to the \ncountry.\n  One of the most worthwhile experiences of my Senate career has been \nlistening to the remarks of the Senators over the past three days on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate. Each one gave substantial deliberation, \nserious thought and research and tried his or her level best to \nmaintain their oath of impartiality.\n  It should be clear that this was not an easy time. It should be clear \nthat every one in the Senate at every minute of every day wished this \nwere not happening. But we found ourselves caught up in a \nconstitutional requirement that gave us little choice.\n  I hope we come out of this with a deeper understanding of the \ndivisions and polarization, which all of this has caused, and that \nevery effort can be made, not only by our leadership, but by every \nmember of the Senate in every issue that comes before us to seek out a \nbipartisanship and to work\n\n[[Page S1665]]\n\ntogether to solve the problems facing our nation.\n  A good start in this process would have been to have allowed a vote \non the censure resolution. I hope that when we return from the \nPresident's Day recess, we will do better.\n\n\n                  intent behind the censure resolution\n\n  I want to clear up once and for all the intent behind our censure \nresolution.\n  The resolution does not express legal conclusions in the court of \nimpeachment. Rather, it is a legislative measure, expressing our \nconclusions regarding the President's conduct.\n  The legal conclusions to be made in this case, if any, will be left \nto a court of law. Our intent is not to bind or influence the court one \nway or another, for good or ill, in making any determinations which it \nmay about the President's conduct.\n  Instead, our purpose is to speak to the moral ramifications of the \nPresident's conduct, and to the message that those actions send to the \npeople of our nation, especially its youth.\n  While the President's actions do not constitute a fundamental threat \nto the nation, neither were they at all acceptable. The President's \nconduct was both willful and wrong, clearly by any standard, his \nbehavior is indefensible.\n  These actions demeaned the Office of the President, violated the \ntrust of the American people, and brought shame and dishonor upon \nPresident Clinton.\n\n\n                        drafting the resolution\n\n  Let me speak for a moment about the process which we have gone \nthrough in developing the language. I began the process when I started \nto doubt whether the President's conduct rose to the level of a high \ncrime or misdemeanor for which he should be removed from office.\n  Senator Herb Kohl was an early partner in this effort, and he and his \nstaff provided valuable input.\n  As we developed the language further, I sounded out more of my \ncolleagues, on both sides of the aisle, on the issue. I was fortunate \nenough to have Senator Bennett join me as the lead Republican co-\nsponor. Senator Bennett has been a stalwart partner in this effort, and \nit has been a real pleasure working with him.\n  Many senators offered input regarding the specific language of the \nresolution, and we have incorporated virtually every suggestion made.\n  Senators Lincoln, Snowe, Levin, Jeffords, and Schumer, for instance, \nall have left their imprint upon this text, as has Senator Moynihan, \nwho was appointed by Senator Daschle to join Senator Kohl and myself as \na Democratic task force on censure.\n  In the process of developing this language and striving for a \nbipartisanship, we have gone through some 25 drafts of the resolution. \nWe believe that the text before you today is that which can obtain the \nmost support from the most senators, of both parties, possible.\n  As a result of these efforts, I am very pleased that we have been \njoined by a very significant number of co-sponsors from both sides of \nthe aisle. These co-sponsors run the ideological gamut from liberal to \nmoderate to conservative. The breadth of these co-sponsors, I believe, \nrepresents the widespread consensus that the President's actions merit \nserious condemnation.\n\n\n                   Historical Precedents for Censure\n\n  Let me now discuss the ample historical precedents for this censure \nresolution.\n  Censure is an extraordinary measure that Congress has used sparingly \nover the past 200 hundred years.\n  Censure is rare because it is such a powerful expression of \nCongressional criticism. In a censure resolution, a House of Congress \npublicly states its collective view that an individual has acted beyond \nthe bounds of acceptable professional conduct. A censure records for \nhistory the major misdoings of public men and women.\n  Over the past 200 years, the House and Senate have initiated censure \nproceedings against Executive Branch officials on at least 13 different \noccasions.\n  Three times a House of Congress has adopted measures that could be \ndescribed as a censure of a President. In 1834, the Senate censured \nPresident Andrew Jackson. Twice the House has adopted statements \ncriticizing presidents--in the cases of John Tyler and James Buchanan.\n  Censuring President Clinton would be consistent with historical use \nof this rare, but powerful, Congressional power.\n\n\n                       the case of andrew jackson\n\n  By far the most famous censure case of a sitting president involved \nAndew Jackson.\n  President Jackson feuded with Congress over the establishment of a \nbank of the United States.\n  1. First, In 1832, he vetoed the rechartering of the Bank of the \nUnited States on the grounds that it was unconstitutional, elitist, and \nhad failed in establishing a sound currency.\n  2. Second, Jackson directed the government to withdraw its funds from \nthe Bank. When his Treasury Secretary protested the withdrawal, Jackson \nremoved him from his position.\n  On March 28, 1834, the Senate voted to censure President Jackson by a \npartisan vote of 26-20.\n  The resolution stated:\n\n       Resolved, That the President, in the last executive \n     proceedings in relation to the public revenue, has assumed \n     upon himself authority and power not conferred by the \n     Constitution and laws, but in derogation of both.\n\n  The censure resolution expressed more than idle words. It dealt \nJackson a painful blow in the arena of public opinion and in history.\n  Soon after the vote, Jackson wrote to the Senate challenging its \naction. He noted that the Senate resolution was an ``an imputation upon \nmy private as well as public character.''\n  This censure was such a powerful condemnation of President Jackson's \nactions that his supporters led the Senate to revisit the issue several \nyears later. On January 14, 1837, the Senate voted to expunge the \ncensure resolution from the record by a vote of 24-19.\n  The House of Representatives has adopted two other statements that \ncan be construed as censure motions against a president.\n\n\n                          president john tyler\n\n  In 1841, John Tyler assumed the Presidency upon the death of \nPresident William Henry Harrison. In contrast to President Harrison, \nwhose Whig views coincided with views of the majority of Congress, \nTyler espoused State's rights.\n  Tyler aroused the anger of Congress by vetoing Whig-sponsored bills \nrelated to tariffs and the creation of a national bank. Exasperated \nMembers of the House of Representatives finally decided to publicly \nrebuke the President.\n  A select committee drafted a report criticizing the President for:\n  ``Gross abuse of constitutional power and bold assumptions of powers \nnever vested in him by any law''; for having ``assumed the whole \nLegislative power to himself, and levying millions of money upon the \npeople, without any authority of law''; and for the ``abusive exercise \nof the constitutional power of the President to arrest the action of \nCongress upon measures vital to the welfare of the people.''\n  On August 17, 1842, the House passed this select Committee report.\n\n\n                        president james buchanan\n\n  Along with his Secretary of the Navy, President Buchanan was \nimplicated in a financial scandal. There were accusations of \n``kickbacks'' and the granting of government contracts to political \nsupporters.\n  On June 13, 1860 the House of Representatives voted 106-61 in favor \nof ``censuring'' the Secretary of the Navy and stating that President \nBuchanan's conduct deserved its ``reproof.''\n  The resolution stated:\n\n       Resolved, That the President and the Secretary of the Navy, \n     by receiving and considering the party relations of bidders \n     for contracts and the effect of awarding contracts upon \n     pending elections, have set an example dangerous to the \n     public safety, and deserving the reproof of this House.\n  Other executive officials: At least three secretaries of cabinet \ndepartments and one ambassador have also been censured.\n  These cases include:\n  (1) Secretary of the Navy Isaac Toucey, 1860--On June 13, 1860, the \nHouse of Representatives passed a resolution censuring Secretary Toucey \nin the same ``kickback'' and bribery scandal that led to the \n``reproof'' of President Buchanan.\n  (2) Secretary of War Simon Cameron, 1862--In another corruption \nscandal, the House passed a censure resolution against Secretary of War \nCameron for embezzlement and for entrusting public money to his \nlieutenant, Alexander Cummings. Mr. Cummings allegedly spent $21,000 of \ngovernment funds on personal items like straw hats, linen pantaloons, \nscotch ale, and herring.\n\n[[Page S1666]]\n\n  (3) Attorney General, A.H. Garland, 1886--On March 24, 1886, the \nSenate passed a resolution of ``condemnation'' of the Attorney General \nfor refusing to turn over government papers regarding the removal of a \nDistrict Attorney from Office.\n  (4) Ambassador Thomas Bayard, 1896--On March 20, 1896 the House of \nRepresentatives considered a resolution condemning and censuring \nAmbassador Bayard for diplomatic improprieties. He was charged with \nmaking partisan remarks to British audiences.\n\n\n                     censur of members of congress\n\n  Congress has also used censure to condemn the conduct of its own \nmembers. Nine senators and 22 members of the House have been censured.\n  Indeed, many members of this body personally know former senators who \nhave been censured. To those who argue that censure is ``a wet noodle \nacross the wrist,'' I would respectfully request that they ask their \ncolleagues how these former senators felt about being censured. I am \nconfident, because I have had some of these conversations myself, that \nthey would find that censure was felt deeply, and was a very \nsignificant stain upon their reputations and legacy.\n\n\n                       censure history conclusion\n\n  In sum, censure is a powerful tool used very sparingly by Congress to \ncondemn unacceptable conduct. Congress has initiated censure \nproceedings in policy disputes, but it has also criticized executive \nbranch officials in the case of President Buchanan, Navy Secretary \nWelles, and President Nixon for personal misconduct.\n  So to those who argue that passing this censure would establish a \nprecedent for the future where presidents and cabinet officials could \nbe censured, I hope this discussion has made it clear: that precedent \nhas already been set.\n\n\n                  bipartisan censure promotes healing\n\n  In this bipartisan censure, we provided the Senate with a real \nopportunity to achieve a strong, unifying, bipartisan conclusion to \nthis whole tawdry, exhausting and divisive controversy.\n  The House's actions were marred with partisanship. Indeed, one \nexample of this was the action of the House leadership to prevent a \ncensure resolution from even being considered on the House floor.\n  The Senate started its proceedings on a high note, when we came \ntogether to agree unanimously, across party lines, upon procedures for \nthe trial. Passing our censure resolution by a strong, bipartisan vote \nwould represent an appropriate ``bookend'' to this bipartisan \nbeginning, and would stand this Senate well in the annals of history.\n  Moreover, it would put the proper historical perspective upon the \nSenate's actions and determinations, which should not be read as a \nvindication of the President.\n  I believe that passing this censure on a bipartisan basis would bring \na real closure to the process, and would help to heal the divisions \nbetween the parties which were created during these proceedings, so \nthat we can move on to work together to address the real problems \nconfronting the American people, like saving social security, improving \neducation, and continuing the fight to reduce crime.\n  It is time that we move on to these other matters of significance to \nour people, to reconcile differences between and within the branches of \ngovernment, and to work together--across party lines--for the benefit \nof the American people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of cosponsors and the text of the \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Cosponsors\n\n       Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \n     Kohl, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. \n     Daschle, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Reid, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Bryan, Mr. \n     McConnell, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. \n     Campbell, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. \n     Schumer, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Breaux, \n     Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Reed, Ms. Landrieu, \n     Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Robb, Mr. \n     Inouye, and Mr. Akaka.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         Resolution of Censure\n\n       Whereas William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United \n     States, engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a \n     subordinate employee in the White House, which was shameful, \n     reckless and indefensible;\n       Whereas William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United \n     States, deliberately misled and deceived the American people, \n     and people in all branches of the United States government;\n       Whereas William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United \n     States, gave false or misleading testimony and his actions \n     have had the effect of impeding discovery of evidence in \n     judicial proceedings;\n       Whereas William Jefferson Clinton's conduct in this matter \n     is unacceptable for a President of the United States, does \n     demean the Office of the President as well as the President \n     himself, and creates disrespect for the laws of the land;\n       Whereas President Clinton fully deserves censure for \n     engaging in such behavior;\n       Whereas future generations of Americans must know that such \n     behavior is not only unacceptable but also bears grave \n     consequences, including loss of integrity, trust and respect;\n       Whereas William Jefferson Clinton remains subject to \n     criminal actions in a court of law like any other citizen;\n       Whereas William Jefferson Clinton's conduct in this matter \n     has brought shame and dishonor to himself and to the Office \n     of the President; and\n       Whereas William Jefferson Clinton through his conduct in \n     this matter has violated the trust of the American people: \n     Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate does hereby censure \n     William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, \n     and does condemn his wrongful conduct in the strongest terms; \n     and now be it\n       Further resolved, That the United States Senate recognizes \n     the historic gravity of this bipartisan resolution, and \n     trusts and urges that future congresses will recognize the \n     importance of allowing this bipartisan statement of censure \n     and condemnation to remain intact for all time; and be it\n       Further resolved, That the Senate now move on to other \n     matters of significance to our people, to reconcile \n     differences between and within the branches of government, \n     and to work together--across party lines--for the benefit of \n     the American people.\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I have just returned, as have most Senators, \nfrom responding to many requests by the media on the grounds of the \nU.S. Capitol. I have said that the verdict is in. It has been given by \nthe Senate. It is now before the Nation and they will be the final \njury, the final arbiter. The sovereignty of this country rests not in \nthe high office holders, but it is in the hands of the people. It is \nfor them to decide.\n  As they approach the decision, I humbly submit to them: Let us put \nthis chapter in our history, tragic though it may be, behind us, and \nthat we heal ourselves and unite and go forward.\n  This is a great and strong nation. It is a leader of the world, not \nonly in matters of security for ourselves but security for others, not \nonly in matters of military security but in matters of economic \nsecurity. Our President, by his own actions, is a weakened President. \nThat strength which for a while he can no longer give to the Nation \nmust be filled in by the people--individually and collectively. I think \nwe should not spend time dwelling on the past. Leave it to the \nhistorians. Let us move forward to the future, heal ourselves, \nstrengthen our Nation, so we can resume as a leader in the world. And \nmay God rest his hand on this Senate and its verdict as being the best \nfor the Nation and for our people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1667-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished colleagues, let me begin \nby expressing my appreciation to the Chief Justice for his wisdom, for \nhis infinite patience, and for conferring upon this body the judicial \ntemperament envisioned by the Framers.\n  I would also like to commend both the Senate majority and minority \nleaders for upholding the dignity of this body, by preserving \njudiciousness and fairness, and maintaining bipartisanship and \ncivility.\n  Colleagues, we have arrived at a juncture in our public lives that \nwill largely define our place before the judgment of history, and I \nthink it will be said that justice and the Constitution were well \nserved.\n  Indeed, the consequences of our decision are manifest in the words of \nAlexander Hamilton, who wrote of ``the awful discretion which a court \nof impeachment must necessarily have, to doom to honor or to infamy the \nmost confidential and the most distinguished characters of the \ncommunity.''\n  Those words should weigh heavily upon us. But while the gravity of \nour task is humbling, the genius of our Constitution is ennobling; for \nwe deliberate not under the imposing shadow cast by the exceptional men \nwho framed this Nation, but in the illuminating light of their wisdom.\n  Impeachment was designed by the Framers to be a circuitbreaker to \nprotect the Republic, when ``checks and balances'' would not contain \nthe darker vagaries of human nature. Impeachment empowers the Senate--\nunder the most extraordinary of circumstances--to step outside its \nlegislative role, reach into the executive branch, and remove a \npopularly elected President.\n  Impeachment was not, however, devised as an adjunct or independent \narm of prosecution. It is not for the U.S. Senate to find solely \nwhether the President committed statutory violations.\n  Rather, we have a larger question--whether there is evidence that \npersuades us, in my view beyond a reasonable doubt, that the \nPresident's offenses constitute high crimes and misdemeanors that \nrequire his removal.\n  Here is the precise point of our challenge--to give particular \nmeaning to the elusive phrase, ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' This \ntask is critical, because impeachment is not so much a definition, as \nit is a judgment in a particular case--a judgment based not upon an \nexact or universal moral standard--but upon a contemporary and \nhistorical assessment of interest and need.\n  ``High crimes and misdemeanors'' speak to offenses that go to the \nheart of matters of governance, social authority, and institutional \npower--offenses that, in Hamilton's words, ``relate chiefly to injuries \ndone immediately to the society itself.''\n  And these crimes must be of such magnitude that the American people \nneed protection, not by the traditional means of civil or criminal \nlaw--but by the extraordinary act of removing their duly elected \nPresident.\n  For removal is not intended simply to be a remedy; it is intended to \nbe the remedy. The only remedy by which the people--whose core \ninterests are meaningfully threatened by the President's conduct--can \nbe effectively protected.\n  This, to me, is what President Woodrow Wilson meant when he referred \nto ``nothing short of the grossest offenses against the plain law of \nthe land.'' This, to me, is what Framer George Mason meant when he \nemphasized ``great and dangerous offenses.''\n  So in determining whether this President has committed a ``great and \ndangerous offense'' requiring removal, we must first weigh all of the \ncredible evidence to identify which acts were actually committed. Then, \nwe must assess the gravity or degree of the misconduct. This process \nrequires that we review the acts from their origin, and the \ncircumstances in their totality.\n  The allegations in article I do not paint a pretty picture. Indeed, \nwe are all struggling with having to reconcile the President's lowly \nconduct with the Constitution's high standards. And we should all be \nconcerned with the minimal threshold that he has set, and the poor \nexample he has created for leadership in this country.\n  The President himself admits he gave evasive and incomplete \ntestimony. He admits he worked hard to evade the truth. He admits he \nmisled advisers, Congress, and the Nation. And he looked all of America \nin the eye--wagging his finger in mock moral indignation when he did \nit.\n  The fact is, the truth is not our servant. The truth does not exist \nto be summoned only when expedient. And I find his attempts to contort \nthe truth profoundly disturbing. A President should inspire our most \nnoble aspirations. Unfortunately, he has fueled our darkest cynicisms.\n  And I resent the ordeal he has put this country through--and we \nshould make no mistake about it--whatever else may be said, we are here \ntoday because of the President's actions. I resent the shadow he has \ncast on what should be--and I feel still is--an honorable profession; \npublic service. And I\n\n[[Page S1670]]\n\nthink all of us who take our oaths to heart should resent it.\n  Finally, as a woman who has fought long and hard for sexual \nharassment laws, I resent that the President has undermined our \nprogress. No matter how consensual this relationship was, it involved a \nman in a position of tremendous power, with authority over a 21-year-\nold female subordinate, in the workplace--and not just any workplace. \nHe has shaken the principles of these laws to their core and it saddens \nme deeply.\n  But as I work my way through my distaste, my dismay, and my \ndisappointment, I return to the discipline that the Constitution \nimposes upon us as triers of fact. My job here is to review the \nevidence, and to measure that evidence against my standard of proof, \nand the constitutional standard of high crimes and misdemeanors.\n  So let's look at the evidence. Article I does not go to perjury about \nthe underlying relationship--that charge was dismissed by the House. \nInstead, the article before us alleges perjury based on statements \nabout statements about conduct. Unfortunately, what this comes down to \nis a case of ``perjury once removed''--an inherently tenuous charge.\n  As triers of fact, we are asked under article I not to find whether \nthe President lied, but whether he committed the specifically defined \nact of perjury. Here, the law is clear that there must be proof that an \nuntruth was told; that it was told willfully; and that it was told \nabout a subject matter material to the case. These are the hard rules \nof the statute.\n  In this instance, article I alleges perjury in statements the \nPresident made explaining the nature and details of the relationship. \nSignificantly, the underlying subject matter of most of these \nstatements was ruled irrelevant and inadmissable in the underlying \ncivil case that was itself dismissed and settled. To me, these facts \nundermine the materiality of these statements.\n  Article I also alleges perjury in the President's statements \nexplaining his concealment of that relationship. Here, I find \ninsufficient evidence of the requisite untruth and the requisite \nintent. Given, again, that we are talking here about ``perjury once \nremoved,'' I cannot conclude that the President is guilty on article I.\n  As I look at article II, I have similar concerns and conflicts. Are \nthere any among us who can look at the disturbing pattern that has been \nlaid out for us and not be deeply troubled?\n  Just look at the allegations. The President may have influenced the \nfiling of an affidavit. The President may have initiated the \nconcealment of potential evidence. And the President may have \naccelerated a job search, in hopes of influencing a witness.\n  But for all of this, there is only circumstantial evidence. Despite a \n64,000 page record and countless hours of argument and testimony, there \nis no direct evidence supporting any of these allegations.\n  To the contrary, where there is direct evidence, the testimony is \nagainst the allegations. Indeed, not one witness with firsthand \nknowledge has come forward since the beginning of this matter to \ncorroborate the charges. So, while I can draw inferences from the \nevidence, I cannot draw conclusions beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  The Framers clearly prescribed caution when measuring high crimes, \nand such caution is all the more important when a case rests on purely \ncircumstantial evidence. Mindful of this caution, I still find that one \nallegation stands out from the rest; the President's attempt to \ninfluence the potential testimony of his personal assistant.\n  Let's look at the facts. In the President's civil deposition, the \nPresident suggested, at least three times, that the attorneys should \nask questions of his personal assistant. At the end of the deposition, \nthe judge reminded him of the confidentiality order not to discuss the \ntestimony with others.\n  Within 2\\1/2\\ hours, the President called his personal assistant to \narrange a rare Sunday meeting. At that meeting, the President disclosed \nto her the contents of his deposition. In a manner that all but reveals \nthe President's motives, he included in his discussion with her false \nstatements about the circumstances of his relationship. Indeed, she \nwould later testify that she believed the President sought her \nagreement with those statements he was posing.\n  Consider this critical exchange in the testimony of the President's \nassistant:\n  She was asked, ``Would it be fair to say then--based on the way he \nstated it and the demeanor he was using at the time he stated it to \nyou--that he wished you to agree to that statement?'' The President's \nassistant nodded. She was then asked, ``And you're nodding your head \nyes, is that correct?'' And she answered, ``That's correct.''\n  And he again violated the gag order when he revisited these \nstatements with her several days later.\n  As an experienced lawyer, the President knew that, by the force of \nhis own testimony, he made his assistant a potential witness.\n  As a former State attorney general, the President knew he was \nviolating the confidentiality order when he spoke with her.\n  As a defendant who repeatedly named his assistant, the President knew \nthat his assistant would be subpoenaed.\n  And she was subpoenaed just 3 days later. But even if she hadn't, the \nPresident did not need absolute or direct knowledge that his assistant \nwould testify. Under the law of obstruction, which, unlike perjury, \ndoes not expressly require materiality, he only had to know that she \ncould offer relevant facts.\n  Make no mistake about it, I find the President's behavior deplorable \nand indefensible.\n  If I were a supporter, I would abandon him. If I were a newspaper \neditor, I would denounce him. If I were an historian, I would condemn \nhim. If I were a criminal prosecutor, I would charge him. If I were a \ngrand juror, I would indict him. And if I were a juror in a standard \ncriminal case, I would convict him of attempting to unlawfully \ninfluence a potential witness under title 18 of the United States Code.\n  However, I stand here today as a U.S. Senator, in an impeachment \ntrial, with but one decision--does the President's misconduct, even if \ndeplorable, represent such an egregious and immediate threat to the \nvery structure of our Government that the Constitution requires his \nremoval?\n  To answer this broad question, we need to ask several finer \nquestions.\n  Do the people believe that their liberties are so threatened that he \nshould not serve his remaining 23 months? Is the President's violation \non par with treason and bribery? What are the inescapable and \nunprecedented effects of removing a duly elected President? And can the \nPresident's wrongdoing be more effectively remedied by criminal \nprosecution, in a standard court of law, after he leaves office?\n  These are the questions which drive our consideration of the \n``gravity'' and ``degree'' of the President's conduct. To this end, I \nreturn to the words of another Maine Senator, William Pitt Fessenden, \nwho during the Andrew Johnson trial said that removal must ``be \nexercised with extreme caution'' and in ``extreme cases.'' It must, he \nsaid, ``address itself to the country and the civilized world as a \nmeasure justly called for by the gravity of the crime . . ''\n  In this case, I understand how reasonable minds could differ, for I \nhave struggled long and hard with my own decision.\n  But the Constitution tempers our passion and measures our judgment. \nAnd the Constitution requires each of us to determine not just whether \nthe President violated a statute. For had the Framers intended the \noffenses charged in this case to require removal in any and all \ncircumstances, they would have specifically included them in the \nimpeachment provisions of the Constitution.\n  Because they did not, we are compelled to ask ourselves whether the \nnature and circumstances of his conduct are such that we have no choice \nbut to inflict upon him what one of the House managers called ``the \npolitical equivalent of the death penalty.''\n  If I could conclude that this President's conduct is of that nature, \nI would vote to remove him. Because if there is one thing I've learned \nthroughout my 25 years in elective office, it is that the really tough \ndecisions leave us with but one choice--doing what we know to be right \nand true.\n  In this instance, among the seven allegations charged in article II, \nI have\n\n[[Page S1671]]\n\nonly been persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the President \ncommitted one of them. After due consideration of all the factual \ncircumstances relating to this one finding, and the constitutional \ndictates and implications of this matter as a whole, I am persuaded \nthat the President's wrongdoing can and should be effectively addressed \nby the additional remedy expressly provided by the Framers in the \nConstitution--namely, trial before a standard criminal court. And I am \nfurther persuaded that future Presidents, and future generations can be \neffectively deterred from such wrongdoing by this impeachment and a \npotential prosecution.\n  The President's behavior has damaged the Office of the Presidency, \nthe Nation, and everyone involved in this matter. There are only two \npotential victims left--the Senate and the Constitution--and I am \nfirmly resolved to allow neither to join the ranks of the aggrieved.\n  From the day I swore my oath of impartiality, I determined that the \nonly way I could approach this case was to ask myself one question, \n``if I were the deciding vote in this case, could I remove this \nPresident under these circumstances?'' The answer, I have concluded, is \n``no''--and therefore, I will vote against both articles of \nimpeachment.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, I came to this process with an open notebook and \nan open mind, determined to honor my oath to do impartial justice and \nserve the best interests of the Presidency, the American people, and \nthe Nation. I stand confident that in doing so, my manner has been \nimpartial, and my judgment has been measured. Therefore, in my mind and \nin my heart, I believe to a moral certainty that my verdict is just.\n  As men and women of honor, that is the highest expectation to which \nwe can aspire. For we are writing history with indelible ink, but \nimperfect pens.\n  In the end, when future generations dust off the record of what we \nhave done here, may they say we validated the Framers' faith in the \nSenate. May they say we reached within ourselves to discover our most \nnoble intentions. And may they say we achieved a conclusion worthy not \njust of our time, but of all time.\n \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/12/senate-section/article/S1669-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}]
