They have \nendured the excruciating pain of grief so often. And yet, through it \nall, they have shown us the resiliency of faith in You and the \nuplifting strength of an indefatigable commitment to public service.

Mr. President, this week a delegation of British Members of \nParliament will visit the Senate in the latest in a long line of \nbiennial exchanges fostered by the British-American Parliamentary \nGroup. My good and true and long-time friend, Senator Stevens, and I \nserve as co-chairs for the American delegation. These exchanges date \nback to the aftermath of World War II, when both sides recognized the \nvalue of maintaining the kind of close working relationship that can \nonly be realized through personal interaction and camaraderie. After \ngraciously hosting Senator Stevens and me in 1997, when we visited \nLondon and York with several other Senators, Lord Jopling later this \nweek will arrive in Washington with Members from the House of Lords and \nthe House of Commons. Lord Michael Jopling is a former Member of\n\n[[Page S8776]]\n\nthe House of Commons. This weekend, I am pleased that the group will be \nmeeting at the famous Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, West \nVirginia, to discuss defense, trade, and environmental issues of \nconcern to our great nations.\n  As an avid student of history, particularly Roman and Greek history, \nPersian history, English history, and American history, I remind all \nwho will listen that those roots are essential in understanding the \ndevelopment of the American Constitution. In the Senate chamber, and \nwhile walking through the halls of our columned Capitol building, I am \ndaily reminded of the unique and enduring legacy bequeathed to \nAmericans by our English, Scot, Welsh, and Irish ancestors. The Minton \ntiles paving the corridors as well as the very language of debate which \nrings across the Senate floor in sonorous spoken cadences recall this \npowerful legacy. Even the physical being of the Capitol building \nitself--its white marble and sunny sandstone gleaming amid graceful \nstands of stately trees and curving drives--owes a nod of thanks to \ninformal and inviting landscaping design pioneered in Britain.\n  And, less visible but more pervasive, the strong skeleton of \ngovernment and law in the United States carries the indelible genetic \nmarkers of British origin--its DNA shaped by centuries of struggle \nbetween monarchs and parliaments before mutating into a new form under \nthe guidance of the British citizens that became our Founding Fathers. \nThough certainly not an exact clone, like Dolly the sheep, the American \nbicameral legislature and our legal system based upon British Common \nLaw bear witness to this sturdy inheritance.\n  From the defining moment at Runnymede in 1215, when the English \nbarons forced King John to give his assent to a charter of liberties, \nthe belief in fundamental written guarantees of rights and privileges \nhas become a treasured inheritance on both sides of the Atlantic. \nUnknown or unpracticed in many parts of the world, the concept of \nindividual rights guaranteed by law is a jewel in the crown of British \nhistory. Other documents written since the Magna Carta, and comprising \nthe unwritten English Constitution, including the Petition of Right, \n1628, and the English Bill of Rights, 1689, have also found new life on \ndistant shores in the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. And the \nconcepts of ``habeas corpus,'' presentment and trial juries, ``just \ncompensation,'' and the right against self-incrimination, all pillars \nof American jurisprudence, migrated to the United States from England \nand English law.\n  To my mind, however, one of the greatest legacies bestowed upon the \nUnited States by these generations of British lawmakers is in \nestablishing control over the power of the purse in elected officials \nof the people, rather than in the executive. Seven hundred and two \nyears ago, in 1297, Edward I reluctantly agreed to the ``Confirmation \nof the Charters,'' promising not to levy taxes without the common \nconsent of the realm.\n  Parliament took on its original form during the reign of Edward \nI, who has been called the father of Parliament. Parliament divided \ninto the House of Commons and the House of Lords along about 1339, \n1341-42, during the reign of Edward III, who reigned from 1327 to 1377, \na total of 50 years.\n\n  Paired with this spending authority came the right to audit how funds \nhad been expended. These powers of appropriation and audit, the \nfraternal twins of legislative might, shaped and tested by British \nexperience, were united by the American Founding Fathers in a single \nparagraph of article I, section 9, of the U.S. Constitution. It states \nthat, ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence \nof Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of \nthe Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published \nfrom time to time.'' And so it is this sentence, together with the very \nfirst section of article 1, which invests in the Senate and the House \nof Representatives their broad scope to check the power of the Chief \nExecutive and defend the interests of their various constituencies.\n  For this, as in so many things, I give thanks to my English \nforbearers, who shed their blood at the point of the sword in wresting \nfrom tyrannical monarchs the control of the power over the purse. That \nstruggle lasted for hundreds of years, until finally, in 1689, under \nthe English Bill of Rights, it was guaranteed. As for William of Orange \nand Mary, who assumed the joint rule over the British people, \nParliament required that they accede to and agree to the Declaration of \nRights, which had been drawn up in February of 1689. Once they agreed, \nthen they were crowned joint monarchs. In December of that year, the \nEnglish Declaration of Rights was put into statute form and designated \nthe English Bill of Rights.\n  This is a pearl beyond price, and one which I hope to pass down \nunblemished to my descendants. Never again, after that English Bill of \nRights had been put into statute form, would Kings levy taxes--excise \nor other taxes--upon the British people without the approval, the \nassent and consent of Parliament. I have fought with every ounce of \nenergy that I could muster against such mutations of the legacy passed \ndown to this country through a thousand years of blood and English \nhistory as the constitutional amendment to balance the budget and the \nline-item veto.\n  Our common past has built a history of cooperation between the \nBritish and the American people that has always prevailed over our \ndifferences. In this century, our sons, brothers, and fathers have \nstood shoulder to shoulder against common enemies from the \nbattlegrounds of world wars to conflicts in the Persian Gulf and in the \nBalkans. Together, we have stood against the Soviet bear. We have stood \nfast through changes of governments and shifts in political power. \nWhile not always smooth, just as relations between family members are \nnot always smooth, Anglo-American relations have weathered bigger \nstorms than Bosnia, Kosovo, NATO expansion, and differences in how to \napproach the problem of global climate change.\n  Our blood ties are stronger than the vast and deep ocean of waters \nthat are between us. And those unbreakable bonds will see us through to \nthe next century and beyond, because we are brothers made so through \nthe parenthood of historical experience. Exchanges like those fostered \nby the British-American Parliamentary Group are the nectar, the \nambrosia, that sweetens and sustains the close ties between our \nnations. I look forward to this week's opportunity to join again at the \nflower of good fellowship.\n  I second the words of Winston Churchill, who said in a speech in the \nHouse of Commons on August 20, 1940:\n\n       The British Empire and the United States will have to be \n     somewhat mixed up together in some of their affairs for the \n     mutual and general advantage. For my own part looking out \n     upon the future, I do not view the process with any \n     misgivings. I could not stop it if I wished; no one can stop \n     it. Like the Mississippi, it just keeps rolling along. Let it \n     roll, let it roll on full flood, inexorable, irresistible, \n     benignant, to broader lands and better days.\n\n  Senator Stevens, our other colleagues who have agreed to join with us \nat the Greenbrier, and my wife Erma and I welcome Lord and Lady \nJopling. My wife and I were in England--in York, as a matter of fact--\nin August of the year before last, on the day that Princess Diana was \nkilled, and on which we returned to the United States after meeting \nwith the British-U.S. Parliamentary Group. I had the pleasure of \nchairing the group when we Democrats were in control of the Senate. On \nthat occasion, I took the members of the British group down to the \nGreenbrier, in Greenbrier County at White Sulphur Springs. We enjoyed \nit. We all look forward to going there again.\n  Again, I welcome Lord and Lady Jopling, and the British members of \nthis year's exchange.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. As I understand it, we are in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I can speak for approximately 6 minutes.\n\n[[Page S8777]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk about a bill introduced on \nFriday on Social Security in which I and other sponsors were involved. \nI mention it because it seems to me that it is one of the issues that \nis most important. I just came back from Wyoming, and I talked with \nfolks about issues. Social Security is one of those that is, of course, \na top priority.\n  Obviously, most everyone knows Social Security has to be changed if \nwe are to fulfill the goals all of us want, and that is to protect \nSocial Security for those who are now beneficiaries, to keep it going \nfor those who are now paying in and will pay in for many years and can \nthen expect to be beneficiaries. Those are the things that have to \nhappen, and there have to be changes to cause that to happen.\n  We have a rapidly aging population. When we started Social Security, \nthere were some 30 people working for every one who was drawing \nbenefits. An individual paid $30 a year into Social Security in the \n1930s. Then we got to where there were five people working for every \none who was a beneficiary. Now I believe it is less than three, and we \nwill soon be to the point where there will be one individual working \nfor every one person drawing benefits. We have to make changes. Of \ncourse, people are living longer, so that also brings new demands on \nthe programs.\n  What are the options? There are several that are fairly obvious, some \nof which are not particularly popular. A tax increase: We already pay \n12.5 percent of what we make into Social Security. That is a rather \nhigh percentage. For many people that is the largest tax they pay. So \ntax increases are not particularly a good option.\n\n  We could cut benefits. I do not think people generally want to cut \nbenefits. There may be some changes made in benefits because people are \nliving longer and there are changes in our lives.\n  The third alternative is one which I think probably has the most \nappeal, and that is to get a higher rate of return on the money we are \nputting into Social Security and have been putting into it for some \ntime. That is the part of the bill we have introduced.\n  It is a bicameral, bipartisan bill that enhances the program through \nprivate accounts. It will take a portion of the money you and I put \ninto Social Security--I believe it is about 2 percent of the 12.5 \npercent--and that becomes a personal account for each person. It can be \ninvested then at the direction of that account owner. It can be \ninvested in equities, stocks, it can be invested in bonds, or it can be \ninvested in a combination of those things. It will be invested by a \nprivate investor such as the Federal employees program is now. You will \nhave a broad choice. The owners will not be doing the investing, but \nthey will be choosing the kinds of investment they want.\n  This can then accumulate as a nest egg for the owner. If the owner is \nunfortunate not to live long enough to receive the benefits that will \naccrue to his or her estate, it will be the owner's.\n  We have been talking a lot about a safety box, some way to take the \nmoney that comes in to Social Security and ensure it is used for that \npurpose and not spent for some other purpose or not loaned to the \ngeneral fund. This probably and certainly is the best way to do that.\n  I make the point that we are not looking at total privatization. Some \npeople accuse us of that. That is not the case. It is a partial \nprivatization. It puts money in so it can earn more than it has earned \nin the past. As most people understand, excess in the trust funds now \nhas to be invested in Government securities. It has a relatively lower \nreturn, lower than if you and I invested those securities. This is a \nchange for improvement.\n  We need to work on the lockbox. We tried five times to pass the \nlockbox legislation to have some way to ensure Social Security funds \ncoming in are not expended for other things, and that they are, indeed, \nkept for the purpose of maintaining and strengthening Social Security. \nThat is what we want to do.\n  There are some other good features of the plan. It is more \nprogressive. It guarantees larger benefits for low-income workers. It \nincreases widow benefits, which has been unfair in the past. It repeals \nearnings limitations, if you are a beneficiary and choose to continue \nto work. In, in fact, there are several incentives for continuing to \nwork. Since people are living longer and are healthier, there is more \nreason and opportunity and willingness to work.\n  This bill is designed to protect current retirees. Current \nbeneficiaries will not be affected by the changes. It is aimed \nprimarily at young people who are beginning to pay into the program. \nAlmost all young people 20 years old say: We probably won't get \nanything out of this; all we will do is pay. That is very unfair, and \nwe can change that.\n  There is a great deal of talk about doing something with Social \nSecurity, but, frankly, the administration and our friends on the other \nside generally have not come up with a plan. Now we have a bipartisan \nplan which is before the Senate. We can do something that will make the \nchanges we propose to make and which are good for the American people.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, frankly, this is a very important debate \nthat starts today on a very important bill, H.R. 1555, and there is a \nvery important amendment that we will allude to and talk about this \nafternoon with reference to reorganizing the Department of Energy in \nways that have been suggested by many in order to minimize security \nrisks in the future and maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of \nthe department of the Department of Energy that works on the nuclear \nweapons installations, facilities, and research within that department.\n  I note the presence of Senator Levin on the floor, and I want to be \nas accommodating as he would like in terms of his using time. I am \nprepared to speak a lot today about history and the like, but whenever \nhe is ready, I will be glad to yield to him.\n  I am going to start today's debate by inserting into the Record a \nJune 30, 1999, column from the Wall Street Journal, written by Paul C. \nLight. He is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and the author \nof ``The True Size of Government,'' Brookings, 1999.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Loose Lips and Bloated Bureaucracies\n\n       How can Washington prevent future security breaches like \n     the one at the Los Alamos nuclear laboratory? Last week \n     former Sen. Warren Rudman, chairman of the President's\n\n[[Page S8778]]\n\n     Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and head of a special \n     investigating panel, recommended a ``new semi-autonomous \n     agency'' within the Department of Energy that would have ``a \n     clear mission, streamlined bureaucracy and drastically \n     simplified lines of authority and accountability.''\n       Mr. Rudman is right to focus on the structure of the \n     department, not the failures of one or two key bureaurcrats. \n     For the Energy Department has never had more layers of \n     management than it does now--and its leadership has never \n     been more disconnected from what is happening at its bottom. \n     Secretary Bill Richardson last week appointed a security \n     ``czar,'' Gen. Eugene Habiger, to serve as the fulcrum for a \n     newly rationalized chain of command. But the czar may merely \n     add one more layer to a meandering, mostly unlinked \n     collection of overseers who can easily evade responsibility \n     when things go wrong.\n       At the department's founding in 1979, its secretary, deputy \n     secretary, undersecretary and assistant secretary \n     ``compartments'' contained 10 layers and 56 senior \n     executives. By 1998 those four compartments had thickened to \n     18 layers and 143 senior executives, including an assortment \n     of chiefs of staff and other alter-ego deputies who fill in \n     whenever their bosses are out.\n       The problem in such overlayered, top-heavy organizations is \n     not a lack of information on possible wrongdoing. Lots of \n     people knew about the vulnerabilities at Los Alamos. The \n     problem is finding someone who is ultimately responsible for \n     taking action. Which department executive does Congress hold \n     accountable for the security breach? The secretary? His chief \n     of staff? One of the two deputy chiefs of staff? The deputy \n     secretary? Undersecretary? Assistant secretary for defense \n     programs? For environmental management? For science? How \n     about the principal deputy assistant secretary for military \n     applications? Deputy assistant secretary for research and \n     development? Defense laboratories office director? Perhaps \n     the assistant secretary for strategic computing and \n     simulation? Or the inspector general, deputy inspector \n     general, or assistant inspector general?\n       The answer is everyone and no one. And the diffusion of \n     accountability continues down into the University of \n     California, the contractor that supervises the Los Alamos \n     laboratory and three other DOE facilities. Whom does the \n     federal government hold accountable at the university? The \n     president? The senior vice president for business and \n     finance? Vice president for financial management? Associate \n     vice president for human resources and benefits? Assistant \n     vice president for laboratory administration? The executive \n     director for laboratory operations? Director of contracts \n     management? The manager for facilities management and \n     safeguards and security?\n       No wonder it takes a crisis to focus attention. With 15 to \n     25 layers just to get from the top of the department to the \n     top of Los Alamos, information is bound to get lost along the \n     way, and no one is accountable when it does.\n       The Department of Energy is hardly alone in such senior-\n     level thickening. Forced by repeated hiring freezes to choose \n     between protecting the bottom of government and bulking up \n     its middle and top, federal departments and agencies have \n     mostly sacrificed the bottom. In 1997, for the first time in \n     civil service history, middle level employees outnumbered \n     bottom-level ones. Nearly 200,000 senior and middle-level \n     managers have retired from government in the past few years, \n     and almost everyone next in line has been promoted--all at a \n     cost of $3 billion in voluntary buyouts for what turned out \n     to be a big retirement party with no effect on the basic \n     structure of government.\n       Some of the lower-level jobs have disappeared forever with \n     the arrival of time-saving technologies. Others have migrated \n     upward into the middle-level ranks as professional and \n     technical employees have added lower-level tasks to their \n     higher-paid duties. Still others have migrated into the \n     federal government's contract workforce which numbered some \n     5.6 million employees in 1996.\n       Meanwhile, the top of government has grown ever taller. \n     From 1993 to 1998, federal departments created 16 new senior-\n     level titles including principal assistant deputy \n     undersecretary, associate deputy assistant secretary, chief \n     of staff to the under secretary, assistant chief of staff to \n     the administrator, chief of staff to the assistant \n     administrator and--lets not forget--deputy to the deputy \n     secretary.\n       Spies will be spies, and the Los Alamos espionage probably \n     would have occurred regardless of the width or height of the \n     government hierarchy. But the breach would have been noticed \n     earlier and closed sooner had the top been closer to the \n     bottom. If Congress wants to increase the odds that nuclear \n     secrets will be kept in the future, it could do no better \n     than to order a wholesale flattening of the Energy Department \n     hierarchy. Then it should do the same with the rest of the \n     federal government.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about what \nMr. Light discusses in this column on the 30th day of June, 1999, and \nset it a bit in perspective. As Senators and those listening today \nmight recall, starting about 3 months before this article written by \nPaul C. Light appeared in the Wall Street Journal, word broke through \nthe media in the United States of the possibility that the People's \nRepublic of China had, in fact, breached security at Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory and, indeed, they may have some of the most \nsignificant and profound secrets with reference to our nuclear weaponry \nin their possession. That broke in the New York Times in a series of \narticles, and thereafter it was in the headlines and on the front pages \nof our papers for 3 or 4 weeks. Now it seems to have dwindled a bit \nbecause Congress and the executive branch are working on what we ought \nto do about it.\n  Frankly, one of the purposes for my being on the floor today and \ntomorrow and for as many days as it takes until we can take up the \nintelligence bill, H.R. 1555, which I have little to do with because I \nam not on that committee, is an amendment that would permit us to \norganize within the Department of Energy that aspect of the Department \nof Energy's work that has to do with nuclear weapons.\n  The reason that is important is because the American people should \nnot be misled, nor should we let this issue go to sleep. The issue is a \nserious one. The issue of who develops and protects our nuclear \nweapons, and are they doing it in the best possible way, should be \nfront and center with the American people because if, in fact, the \nsecurity was breached to the extent that the Cox committee report had--\nthat is a House Member's name; he was chairman of a joint committee in \nthe House that prepared a report commonly known as the Cox report. If \nit is as bad as he and other House Members say in that report, and as \nbad as some others who have reported on it say, then clearly we are at \nrisk that the Communist Chinese has sufficient information to develop, \nover time, a very significant arsenal of nuclear weapons.\n  Coupled with the fact that they are moving rapidly with respect to \ndelivery systems, then clearly in the next millennium we will have a \nnew adversary in the world. It will no longer necessarily be Russia as \na successor to the weapons systems and delivery systems--the U.S.S.R.--\nbut, essentially, we may have both Russia and China with substantial \nnuclear weapons. We may feel secure with our Air Force and our Navy and \nwith our Army, as we have had these skirmishes in the past 3 to 5 \nyears, but we will still be looking at a very dangerous world.\n  As a matter of fact, it may be the only single source of real power \nand military might that Russia might have for the first 50 or 100 years \nin the next millennium. And that is enough for a country that is not \ndoing very well to be a bit dangerous. It is certainly enough for the \nworld to be dangerous and America to be in danger and fearful if the \nChinese Communist regime has a determined and dedicated and significant \nnuclear arsenal.\n  With that as a background, and with many hearings in both bodies--\nsome joint, some singular by different committees--over the weeks since \nthis was first broken, we have heard all kinds of evidence about how \nthis happened--some of it in secret, some of it public. As a Senator \nfrom New Mexico, I have had to learn about nuclear weapons because two \nof the laboratories are in my State, and I happen to be chairman of the \ncommittee that funds all of the Department of Energy. I have said that \nthere is so much that went wrong that there is plenty of blame for \neveryone. This is not exclusively a problem that occurred within that \nlaboratory at Los Alamos. It is not exclusively a problem that \nsomething happened within the Department of Energy. It is not totally \ndispositive of this issue to stand on the floor of the Senate and say \nthe FBI didn't do their job right--which they didn't. The problem is, \nit was a comedy of errors. Everybody seems to have messed up on this \none.\n  Frankly, it seems that enough time has passed for us to be on the \nverge of fixing it, and so let's talk a minute about how we are going \nto fix it, and then I will read excerpts from the article that I asked \nbe printed. First of all, there is no question that we received a \nformidable report from the PFIAB Commission, which is made up of five \nmembers. It is a presidentially appointed group.\n  The President did something different about this one than in the past \nin that he asked them to do the report and to plan to release it to the \npublic.\n\n[[Page S8779]]\n\n They did. It was released to the public, and its principal spokesman \nand chairman was the very distinguished former Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Rudman.\n  We will talk at length about what they recommended. But suffice it to \nsay they found that the management structure within the Department of \nEnergy was in such a state of chaos that it could not control, in the \nform and manner that it existed over these past years, the security of \nvaluable secrets and information within the laboratories; that it was \nincapable of doing it because it was disorganized, or organized in a \nmanner where there was no accountability. So that if you wanted to \nblame the FBI for something that happened out of their Santa Fe, NM, \noffice, they could clearly, if they chose, say: Yes, but somebody else \nfell down on the job.\n  If you asked the Director of the laboratories, he would say: Nobody \never told me about it. Nobody brought me on board. I thought since they \nwere doing an investigation of an individual that they were in charge \nof the investigation, and I didn't have anything to do with it.\n  There are many examples, real and anecdotal, that say the Department \nof Energy is incapable of maintaining within its current framework of \nmanagement such a significant system as the nuclear weapons system of \nthe United States of America.\n  Frankly, it pains me to come to the floor and say that I have arrived \nat that conclusion unequivocally. And it pains me to say that I arrived \nat it some time ago. As a matter of fact, there will be a big argument \nmade that we should move slowly.\n  I would like in due course, if not today, tomorrow, to outline why \nthe time has come to fix it in the manner recommended by the Rudman \ncommission, which is a Presidential commission. How much more time do \nwe need?\n  I will tell the Senate that 2 to 3 weeks before the Rudman report was \nissued, this Senator from New Mexico was busy working with Senators \ndeveloping the exact same model that the Rudman commission ultimately \nrecommended to the Congress and the President of the United States for \nrestructure, in a formidable way with significant changes, of the \nentire apparatus that functions within DOE and produces for us safe, \nsound, and reliable nuclear weapons and that has all of the ancillary \nfunctions which are related to that.\n  Having said that, it was not just yesterday that there were \nrecommendations that the Department of Energy was straining under its \nown bureaucracy and that the nuclear weapons laboratories were victims \nof it. In fact, we will allude to at least two prior reports and \nrecommendations to that of the Rudman commission by which clearly we \nare sending a loud and clear signal: Fix it. It is not working. It is \nthe risky way you have it done.\n  I would add, it is not only risky as to security, but let me suggest \nthere is a substantial lack of efficiency and the ability to manage the \nnuclear weapons system adequately and frugally to get the very best we \nshould have. It is almost an impossibility within the structure of the \nDepartment of Energy, a hybrid department made up of many different \nagencies and groups thrown together in a haphazard way. And then we \nexpect the nuclear weapons part of it to function under the overload of \nmanagement, rules, and regulations that apply across the board to any \nkind of function within the Department, some so removed from nuclear \nweaponry that you wouldn't even think of them being in the same \npersonnel department, in the same environmental department, or in the \nsame safety and health departments.\n  With that, let me move to the Wall Street Journal article and paint a \nlittle history along with this writer, Mr. Light.\n  He starts by saying:\n       How can Washington prevent future security breaches like \n     the one at the Los Alamos nuclear laboratory? Last week \n     former Sen. Warren Rudman, chairman of the President's \n     Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and a head of a special \n     investigating panel, recommended a ``new semiautonomous \n     agency'' within the Department of Energy that would have ``a \n     clear mission, streamlined bureaucracy and drastically \n     simplified lines of authority and accountability.''\n       Mr. Rudman is right to focus on the structure of the \n     department, not the failures of one or two key bureaucrats. \n     For the Energy Department has never had more layers of \n     management than it does now--and its leadership has never \n     been more disconnected from what is happening at its bottom.\n       Secretary Bill Richardson, last week appointed a security \n     ``czar,'' Gen. Eugene Habiger, to serve as the fulcrum for a \n     newly rationalized chain of command. But the czar may merely \n     add one more layer to a meandering, mostly unlinked \n     collection of overseers who can easily evade responsibility \n     when things go wrong.\n\nI could not say it any better.\n  Continuing on:\n\n       At the department's founding in 1979, its secretary, deputy \n     secretary, undersecretary and assistant secretary \n     ``compartments'' contained 10 layers and 56 senior \n     executives. By 1998 those four compartments had thickened to \n     18 layers and 143 senior executives, including an assortment \n     of chiefs of staff and other alter-ego deputies who fill in \n     whenever their bosses are out.\n       The problem in such overlayered, top-heavy organizations is \n     not a lack of information on possible wrongdoing. Lots of \n     people knew about the vulnerabilities at Los Alamos. The \n     problem is finding someone who is ultimately responsible for \n     taking action. Which department executive does Congress hold \n     accountable for the security breach? The secretary? His chief \n     of staff? One of the two deputy chiefs of staff? The deputy \n     secretary? Undersecretary? Assistant secretary for defense \n     programs? For environmental management? For science? How \n     about the principal deputy assistant secretary for military \n     applications? Deputy assistant secretary for research and \n     development? Defense laboratories office director? Perhaps \n     the assistant secretary for strategic computing and \n     simulation? Or the inspector general, deputy inspector \n     general, or assistant inspector general?\n       The answer is everyone and no one. And the diffusion of \n     accountability continues down into the University of \n     California, the contractor that supervises the Los Alamos \n     laboratory and three other DOE facilities. Whom does the \n     federal government hold accountable at the university? The \n     president? The senior vice president for business and \n     finance? Vice president for financial management?\n\n  And on it goes. I will jump down in the article to another full \nquote:\n\n       No wonder it takes a crisis to focus attention. With 15 to \n     25 layers just to get from the top of the department to the \n     top of Los Alamos, information is bound to get lost along the \n     way, and no one is accountable when it does.\n\n  I am going to skip a little bit of the article and move down to the \nend of it with another quote. I will insert it with the underline parts \nbeing that which I read.\n\n       Spies will be spies, and the Los Alamos espionage probably \n     would have occurred regardless of the width or height of the \n     government hierarchy. But the breach would have been noticed \n     earlier and closed sooner had the top been closer to the \n     bottom. If Congress wants to increase the odds that nuclear \n     secrets will be kept in the future, it could do no better \n     than to order a wholesale flattening of the Energy Department \n     hierarchy. Then it should do the same with the rest of the \n     federal government.\n\n  The reason I read excerpts from the article is that it is quite \nobvious to me this man has his finger right on the problem.\n  Let me now proceed to a discussion of the latest thorough \ninvestigation of the Department of Energy and its mission as the \nprimary functionary in nuclear weapons from research to security to \nsafekeeping, et cetera. Let me move to the latest thorough report, and \nthen we will go back to some others that existed prior thereto.\n  I don't know that I want to make this report a part of the Record, \nbut everybody should know if they want to read what has been said by \nthe latest contingent of reputable, dedicated, knowledgeable Americans, \nI am reading from ``Science at its Best, Security at its Worst,'' a \nreport on security problems of the U.S. Department of Energy by a \nspecial investigative panel, the President's Foreign Intelligence \nAdvisory Board, of June 1999.\n  There are plenty of these reports around for anybody who wants to \nparticipate in this discussion. We will make them available. We will \nsee that some are in the Cloakroom for people who might want to review \nthem. I will talk a little bit about the significance of this report \nand why I think the time has come to adopt its principal \nrecommendations.\n  For those who wonder what we are trying to do, obviously, we had to \ndraw from a lot of people to do what was recommended in this report. \nWhile Members may not find every word of the extensive amendment I will \nsoon allude to in detail within this report, let me repeat, for anybody \ninterested in the security of the weapons laboratories and the nuclear \nweapons activity of\n\n[[Page S8780]]\n\nour Nation, the amendment we are trying to call up as part of H.R. 1555 \nis the recommendations from this report.\n  Let's get in the Record what this report is. This report is the \nresult of a March 18, 1999, President Clinton request that the \nPresident's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, commonly known as \nPFIAB, undertake an inquiry and issue a report on ``The security threat \nat the Department of Energy's weapons lab and the adequacy of measures \nthat have been taken to address it.''\n  I will read the names of the board members and make sure the Senate \nand everybody knows who they are: The Honorable Warren B. Rudman, \nchairman; appointed members are Ms. Ann Z. Caracristi, Dr. Sydney \nDrell, Mr. Stephen Friedman, to form the special investigative panel. \nThey are the members. They were given detailees from several Federal \nagencies, including CIA, FBI, DOD, to augment the work of the staff. \nThey spent 3 months interviewing 100 witnesses, received more than 700 \ndocuments encompassing thousands of pages, and conducted on-site \nresearch and interviews at five of the Department's National \nLaboratories and plants: Sandia National Lab, Pantex in Texas, Oak \nRidge in Tennessee, Livermore in California, and Los Alamos in New \nMexico.\n  This report and an appendix that supports it, both of which are \nunclassified, are now before the Senate. A large volume of classified \nmaterial which was also reviewed and distilled for this report has been \nrelegated to a second appendix and is authorized for special kinds of \nauthorized recipients.\n  This report examines the 20-year history--which I just alluded to in \nreading the excellent article by Mr. Light--of security and \ncounterintelligence issues at the laboratories, with an issue on five \nlaboratories that focus on weapons and related weapons research. It \nlooked at the inherent tensions between security concerns and \nscientific freedom at the laboratories. In effect, they looked at the \ninstitutional culture and efficacy of the Department. They looked at \nthe growth and evolution of foreign intelligence and the threat \nthereafter to the National Laboratories, particularly in connection \nwith foreign visitors programs, the implementation of effective \nPresidential Decision Directive No. 61, the reforms instituted by the \nSecretary, and other related initiatives.\n  At some point in time within the last 5 or 6 months when it started \nto evolve that, in fact, there could have been a very serious, \nsignificant, prolonged, and persistent breach at Los Alamos, the \nPresident of the United States--and others might argue that the \ntimeliness of the President's actions is an issue. I am not sure that I \nwill argue that point. My point in what I will discuss today and \ntomorrow, and for however long it takes to get this bill up and get \nthis amendment considered, is going to be discussing how we fix what is \nwrong with this Department of Energy as it relates to nuclear weapons \nand how we do it now--not 6 months from now, not a year from now, but \nnow.\n  Eventually, the President issued a Presidential decision directive \nwhich is called No. 61. Now, that suggested in no uncertain terms that \nsome things be changed in the Department, and changed forthwith. \nHowever, those were things the Department could do without any \nlegislation. They preceded the thorough recommendations that were made \nby the Rudman commission. Then it included additional measures to \nimprove security and counterintelligence.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the page of the \nabstract of the Rudman report, with the panel of members and the staff.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Panel Members\n\n       The Honorable Warren B. Rudman, Chairman of the President's \n     Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. Senator Rudman is a \n     partner in the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton, and \n     Garrison. From 1980 to 1992, he served in the U.S. Senate, \n     where he was a member of the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence. Previously, he was Attorney General of New \n     Hampshire.\n       Ms. Ann Z. Caracristi, board member. Ms. Caracristi, of \n     Washington, DC, is a former Deputy Director of the National \n     Security Agency, where she served in a variety of senior \n     management positions over a 40-year career. She is currently \n     a member of the DCI/Secretary of Defense Joint Security \n     Commission and recently chaired a DCI Task Force on \n     intelligence training. She was a member of the Aspin/Brown \n     Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the Intelligence \n     Community.\n       Dr. Sidney D. Drell, board member. Dr. Drell, of Stanford, \n     California is an Emeritus Professor of Theoretical Physics \n     and a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. He has served \n     as a scientific consultant and advisor to several \n     congressional committees, The White House, DOE, DOD, and the \n     CIA. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a \n     past President of the American Physical Society.\n       Mr. Stephen Friedman, board member. Mr. Friedman is \n     Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Columbia University and \n     a former Chairman of Goldman, Sachs, & Co. He was a member of \n     the Aspin/Brown Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of \n     the Intelligence Community and the Jeremiah Panel on the \n     National Reconnaissance Office.\n\n\n                              pfiab staff\n\n       Randy W.

Swindle, Department of Defense, Naval Criminal \n     Investigative Service.\n       Joseph S. O'Keefe, Department of Defense, Office of the \n     Secretary of Defense.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I note the presence of the cochairman of the committee \nthat actually has jurisdiction and is in control of the bill, H.R. \n1555, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.\n  I say to the Senator what I said to one of his staff members who was \non the floor. Whenever the Senator is ready, I will relinquish the \nfloor and yield. I am prepared to speak today and tomorrow and however \nlong is necessary until we all get together and get the bill up and get \nthe amendment to it called up. I am not here today to keep others from \nspeaking. My responsibility with reference to the amendment which we \npropose is to start talking about the significance of it and of the \nRudman report to the future security prospects for our nuclear resource \ndevelopment by the Department of Energy.\n  I started on that report of your good friend and mine, Senator \nRudman. This is not a bad breaking point for me if the Senator desires \nto speak.\n  Mr. KERREY. I have a unanimous consent request, and then I am pleased \nto let the Senator continue.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Biden, I ask \nunanimous consent that the privilege of the floor be granted to David \nAuerswald, an American Political Science fellow on the Democratic staff \nof the Foreign Relations Committee, during the pendency of H.R. 1555, \nto authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2000 for intelligence and \nintelligence-related activities for the United States Government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, what I want to do, in the presence of my \nfriend, is recap. I heretofore, I say to the Senator from Nebraska, \nmade the point of why we need some dramatic, drastic, and significant \nreform of the Department of Energy as it applies to nuclear weaponry in \nall its context. I have indicated there are a number of reports that \npoint in the direction of doing something very different, not just some \nnew boxes in the Department.\n  I said I would start with a review of the Rudman report as to what \nthey recommend, because the amendment I will\n\n[[Page S8781]]\n\nbe proposing and of which Senator Kerrey is a cosponsor is our best \neffort to incorporate into the bill language the Rudman \nrecommendations. We are not inventing something new, although some of \nus were on that trail before the Rudman report. It is essentially an \neffort to convert these recommendations, of which my colleagues are \nfully aware, to a bill, and that legislation will be presented when we \nare on the bill. We do not know when that time will come. We are now on \na motion to proceed to that bill.\n  Let me now, in my own way, talk a bit about the Rudman report. The \nSenate is now fully aware of who the commissioners are, what their \norigins are, and the fact that this is the first such report that has \nbeen made public. In the past, Presidents have used them, but they have \nnot made them public. The President asked from the outset that this \nreport be made public. That was prudent because we were in such a state \nof confusion and chaos regarding how much of our future security was \nactually stolen. This was a good way to say some people are \nrecommending ways to fix it. It is public.\n  Let me state to the Senate, and those interested, some of the \nsignificant findings of this report. Remember, the reason the report is \nsignificant is not because it is the only report of its type, but it is \nthe last one recommending drastic change. These findings I am going to \nbe talking about are in support of the bill we want to introduce, \nbecause they are in support of the Rudman commission's recommendations.\n\n  Findings found at pages 1 through 6--I am going to pick out the ones \nI think most adequately present the issue and the reasons for doing \nsomething.\n  No. 1, from my standpoint:\n\n       More than 25 years worth of reports, studies and formal \n     inquiries--by executive branch agencies, Congress, \n     independent panels and even the DOE itself--have identified a \n     multitude of chronic security and counterintelligence \n     problems at all the weapons labs.\n\n  I give this fact at the outset because I am very concerned there \nstill will be some in the public, at the laboratories and in the \nSenate, who will say we need more time. Remember, the finding I just \nstated was that for 25 years there have been reports, studies, and \ninquiries that addressed the issues in this amendment we want to call \nup on the bill.\n  No. 2:\n\n       Organizational disarray, managerial neglect, and a culture \n     of arrogance--both at DOE headquarters and at the labs \n     themselves--conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting \n     to happen.\n\n  Those are not my words. I might have phrased it differently. \nEssentially, in the amendment we want to call up, we are also trying to \nchange the organizational disarray. We are trying to change it so that \nmanagerial neglect will be harder to be vested in this part of the DOE. \nWe are addressing the culture, but we are not destroying the actual \nnecessary component within these laboratories of freedom for \nscientists. But freedom is not absolute for scientists who work on \nnuclear weapons. We want to give them as much freedom as is consistent \nwith minimizing security risks, and that means there has to be pushed \nthrough management a change in the culture without changing the \nscientific excellence.\n\n       . . . DOE headquarters and at the labs themselves--\n     conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting to happen.\n\n  The way it is phrased one would think they were doing something \nintentional in that regard. I would not have used ``conspired.'' It \nhappened that way because of the way it is managed and the way the \nculture has developed.\n  Let me move down to another couple I think are very important:\n\n       DOE has a dysfunctional management structure and culture \n     that only occasionally gave proper credence to the need for \n     rigorous security and counterintelligence programs at the \n     weapons laboratories. For starters, there has been a \n     persistent lack of real leadership and effective management \n     of the DOE.\n\n  They also factually concluded that the Department--and this is very \nimportant--is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is \nincapable of reforming itself. Why do I pull that one out? Because we \nare hearing that we do not need to do everything this report recommends \nbecause the Secretary is going to do it. As a matter of fact, the \nSecretary is a friend of mine. He is from my State. He served in the \nHouse and I in the Senate, and I have great respect for what he did. He \nhas done more in the Department in the past few months than anybody we \nhave had around in terms of seeing that it is really risky and things \nare dangerous there; we have to get on with fixing them.\n\n  The point is, the Rudman commission said the Department's bureaucracy \nis so dysfunctional that it cannot reform itself. For those who will \ncome to the Chamber either in opposition to the amendment or indicating \nwe should go slowly because the Secretary is doing some things, I will \nkeep reading them this statement.\n  This is not our statement. This is the statement of five of the best \npeople around appointed by the President of the United States to tell \nus how to fix this. In fact, I will tell you one of them, Dr. Drell, \nwould be picked by anyone on any five-member commission that was going \nto survey and recommend how we should handle nuclear weapons within our \nbureaucracy better.\n  He is on this, and he agrees. They are saying the Secretary cannot \nfix it because the bureaucracy is so rambunctious, so overlapping, so \ninconsistent that it cannot fix itself.\n  Last:\n\n       Reorganization is clearly warranted to resolve the many \n     specific problems with security and counterintelligence in \n     the . . . laboratories, but also to address the lack of \n     accountability that has become endemic throughout the entire \n     Department.\n\n  I am going to move to a couple more facts. We all know--no, we do not \nall know; some of us know because we have been around here long \nenough--that we can look at who have been the Secretaries of Energy \nover time, and the Rudman report has something to say about that.\n  This is a complicated Department, but if you know anything about it, \nit runs all the nuclear weapons activities in the country. For \nstarters, one would think: Boy, we ought to put somebody in who knows a \nlittle bit about that.\n  The report says:\n\n       The criteria for the selection of Energy Secretaries have \n     been inconsistent in the past. Regardless of the outcome of \n     ongoing or contemplated reforms, the minimum qualifications \n     for Energy Secretary should include experience in not only \n     energy and scientific issues, but national security and \n     intelligence issues. . . .\n  I am not going to list the Secretaries in the last 30 years since the \nDOE was formed, and prior to it ERDA, but I am going to merely say \nthere have not been very many Presidents who gave serious consideration \nto who should be the Secretary in the same context that the five-member \ncommission looked at what should be the qualifications.\n  There will still be some who will say: Well, look, we have a \nSecretary who is trying. This has just come upon us. Let's go a little \nslower.\n  The Rudman commission made another finding, and it is the following:\n\n       However, the Board is extremely skeptical that any reform \n     effort, no matter how well-intentioned, well-designed, and \n     effectively applied, will gain more than a toehold at DOE, \n     given its labyrinthine management structure, fractious and \n     arrogant culture, and the fast-approaching reality of another \n     transition in DOE leadership. Thus we believe that he has \n     overstated the case when he asserts, as he did several weeks \n     ago, that ``Americans can be reassured; our nation's nuclear \n     secrets are, today, safe and secure.''\n\n  That is an allusion to a statement by our Secretary of Energy. I take \nit Secretaries have tried to tell us they are doing everything they can \nwithin the structure they have and that we are moving in the direction \nof making things safe.\n  This board--I frequently call it a commission--the Rudman board, has \ntaken a look at that statement versus what they think you can do in \nthat Department, and they have concluded that things are still kind of \nat risk.\n  I note today, in the presence of the press the new securities czar, \nthe distinguished four-star general who was appointed, is saying: We're \nworking on it, but it is at least a year away in terms of having \nsomething in place. I note that is in the news today.\n  What did this distinguished board--sometimes referred to in my \nremarks as commission--actually recommend by way of reorganizations? I \nwant everyone to know I am going to repeat that there are other \nreports, prior to this, that recommended dramatic changes within the \nDepartment, and I\n\n[[Page S8782]]\n\nhave not yet alluded to them. I am only talking about the Rudman \nrecommendations.\n  They suggest that:\n\n       The panel is convinced that real and lasting security and \n     counterintelligence reform at the weapons labs is simply \n     unworkable within DOE's current structure and culture. To \n     achieve the kind of protection that these sensitive labs must \n     have, they and their functions must have their own autonomous \n     operational structure free of all the other obligations \n     imposed by [the department].\n\n  In order to do that, they say it can be done in one of two ways.\n\n       It could remain an element of DOE but become semi-\n     autonomous--by that we mean strictly segregated from the rest \n     of the Department. This would be accomplished by having an \n     agency director report only to the Secretary of Energy. The \n     agency directorship also could be ``dual-hatted'' as an Under \n     Secretary, thereby investing [him] with extra bureaucratic \n     clout both inside and outside the department.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Regardless of the mold in which this agency is cast, it \n     must have staffing and support functions that are \n     autonomous from the remaining operations at DOE.\n\n  Essentially, when you read the recommendations, the most significant \nwords are their functions must have their own autonomous operational \nstructure free of all other obligations imposed by DOE management.\n  You get that one of two ways. You get it semiautonomously--which I \nhave just read--or you can take it out of the Department of Energy in \ntoto, stand it free, i.e., NASA. They have suggested those are the two \nways.\n  Those of us who have been involved for years think that we ought to \nstart by trying to convince the Senate and House that we should make it \nsemiautonomous, leaving it within the DOE, for a number of reasons, and \nonly if all fails should we go the other route.\n  This Senator is very concerned about the laboratories that make us so \nstrong and contribute so much to our science effectiveness in the \nworld, that they remain the very best. I would not, for a minute, be \ntalking about restructuring if I did not think those laboratories could \ncontinue to do work for others, work for other agencies, and work for \nthe Department of Defense and nuclear weapons. I believe they can and \nthey will. I believe they will, under the amendment about which we are \ntalking.\n  So while there is much more to talk about, in summary, H.R. 1555, \nwhich is the annual intelligence authorization bill, the sooner we can \nget it up on the Senate floor, the sooner we can bring up this \namendment, the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski, et al. amendment, which has \nevery chairman of every committee who is involved in this as \ncosponsors, along with a number of other Senators, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska, who is here on the floor with us, \nSenator Kerrey, and Senator Feinstein of California. As soon as we can \nstart debating it--obviously, we are willing to listen; we do not claim \nthat every ``t'' is crossed right and every ``I'' is in the proper \nplace, but we believe the format to accomplish what the Rudman five-\nmember board recommended is within the four corners of that amendment, \nand that is what we ought to be looking at now in the next few days to \nget it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico has done a \nvery good job of outlining an urgent need to change our law governing \nthe Department of Energy. I have high praise for him and Senators \nWarner, Murkowski, Kyl, and, on our side, Senators Levin, Bingaman, and \nLieberman, who have worked to try to fashion a piece of legislation, a \nlaw that will balance our need for secrecy and our need for security.\n  I appreciate very much, I say to the Senator, his leadership on this \nand the sense of urgency that he has brought to the need to change our \nlaw. My hope is that we, at the end of the day, at the end of this \ndebate--I do not think there is going to be very much objection to \nmoving to this bill--my hope is that we can get a very large majority, \nif not a unanimous vote in support.\n  I know the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, has some amendments he \nwants to offer. He has talked to me a little bit about them. We will \nhave a chance to talk about those, I guess, tomorrow when we come to \nit.\n  But there is no question that the laboratories have been a tremendous \nsource of pride and a tremendous source of discovery and a tremendous \nsuccess story as far as delivering to the United States of America \nthings that have made the United States of America more secure and more \nprosperous.\n  Likewise, there is no question that over the years--over the last 20 \nyears or so--since the Department of Energy was created, there has been \nsort of a gradual buildup of layers of bureaucracy that make it more \nand more difficult for any Secretary of Energy, whether that individual \nhas the requisite skills or not, to know what is going on in the \nlaboratories and to have the authority needed to manage those agencies \nso those laboratories, as Senator Rudman, chairman of the PFIAB says in \nthe title of his report, can get both the best science and the best \nsecurity simultaneously. We unquestionably have the best science. I am \nquite certain the Senator from New Mexico believes the same way I do. \nIn visiting the labs, in particular the lab that is under question, Los \nAlamos, most of the people I have met there described themselves as \nbeing very conservative to extremely conservative on the question of \nsecurity and expressed their concern that their reputation for keeping \nthe United States of America safe has been damaged. Of all the people \nwho are anxious to get the law changed so that the lab's reputation for \nbeing the world's finest both for science and security can be restored, \nthere are no more powerful advocates of that than at Los Alamos \nLaboratory from Dr. Brown on down.\n  This is an unusual opportunity because normally the intelligence \nauthorization bill goes through almost with unanimous consent. Since I \nhave had the opportunity a few years to come here with the chairman, \nwith usually about 15 minutes' worth of conversation and without a lot \nof interest, the bill goes through. The good news this year is that it \nwill not go through quite so quickly. It is good news because it gives \nus an opportunity to examine what it is this bill does and what it is \nthis bill does not do.\n  Unfortunately, current law does not allow us to tell the people of \nthe United States of America either how much we spend on all of our \nintelligence collection, analysis, or dissemination efforts, or does it \nallow us to tell what the individual components of that are. I say \n``unfortunately'' because I do believe quite strongly that we would be \nbetter off changing the law so the public did know both of those \nthings. I believe that unless the people of the United States of \nAmerica support what it is we are doing with our intelligence \nefforts, it is very difficult, over a long period of time, to sustain \nthat effort. I myself am very much concerned that at the moment the \ngeneral public does not either understand what it is we do on the \nintelligence side, or as a consequence of some very highly publicized \nfailures are they terribly confident that we are doing a very good job \nof collecting intelligence, analyzing that intelligence, producing that \nintelligence, and then disseminating that intelligence to either \nwarfighters or to national policymakers.\n\n  I have had the good fortune of watching the men and women who do this \nwork for a number of years. I am not only impressed with their skills, \nbut I am impressed with their patriotism and impressed with their \nsuccesses, most of which I cannot talk about on the floor this \nafternoon.\n  Let me make the case, first of all, for secrecy. I think there are \ntimes when it is absolutely vital and needed. When we have warfighters \non the field, as we recently had in Kosovo, we obviously can't provide \nthe target list to the public and let people know where it is that \nthese pilots are going to be flying. We cannot obviously provide \nbattlefield information. Otherwise, we are going to increase the risk \nto these warfighters. It is always difficult in an environment where it \nis just the United States, let alone where there are 18 allies, to \ncontain that intelligence and not have a terrible example of something \nwhere intelligence information got to our enemies, and as a \nconsequence, they were better prepared, and as a consequence either we \nwere not as successful as we wanted to be or there were casualties as a \nconsequence.\n\n[[Page S8783]]\n\n  It is a life-or-death matter that we keep these secrets. We have \nasked men and women to put their lives at risk, and we have to protect \ntheir interests. Otherwise, we will find it very difficult to find \nvolunteers to go on these missions.\n  It is needed for military operations. It is needed for some covert \noperations as well, where the President has signed a finding. He has \nasked that certain things be done, again, in the interest of the United \nStates, overseen by the Congress. Today, I have very high praise for \nthis administration in that regard. Since the Aldrich Ames spy incident \nwhere Aldrich Ames, traitor to his country, not only gave up U.S. \nsecrets, he gave up secrets that led to the deaths of many men and \nwomen who were working on our behalf, this administration has \nincreasingly come to the oversight committees, one in the House and one \nin the Senate that were created in 1976, with what are called \nnotifications of errors, notifications of problems and mistakes that \nwere made on a weekly basis.\n  We are receiving information that the executive branch thinks we need \nto know in order for us to make judgments about what it is we think the \nUnited States of America ought to be doing. So there is a lot more--in \nfact, it feels like a fire hose at times--notifications that are \noccurring in both the House and the Senate committee.\n  Indeed, our committee was notified about this particular incident in \n1996, and I think we responded appropriately to it at the time. We \npushed back and asked for additional counterintelligence. When I say \n``this particular incident,'' I am talking about the notification of \nthe possibility that the Chinese had acquired what we now know in \npublished accounts to be details about a weapons system known as the W-\n88, our most sophisticated nuclear weapon, that the Chinese had \nacquired that through espionage in the 1980s.\n\n  We were notified of that in 1996, 11 years after it was suspected to \nhave happened. I think the committees were properly notified, and I \nthink the committees properly responded and measured the relative \nthreat to other things in the world and pushed back and responded, I \nthought, in an appropriate fashion. There was much more that we \nprobably could have done. I will let history judge whether or not we \ndid enough. The point is, there are secrets. As a consequence of those \nsecrets, under law, under a resolution we have created, the Senate \nCommittee on Intelligence and the House has done the same. Those \ncommittees have congressional responsibility for hearing these secrets \nand making judgments, first, about what kind of structure, what kind of \nbudget, and what kind of operations we are going to approve.\n  I make the case that secrecy is needed in order to maintain our \nsecurity both for military and for our operations. There are sources \nthat we use, there are methods we use, both of which must be kept \nsecret in order for us to continue to recruit and in order for us to \ncontinue to operate with a maximum amount of safety for, again, the men \nand women who have chosen, as a result of their patriotic love of their \ncountry, to serve their country in these missions. We need to make \ncertain we provide them with the secrecy needed for them to conduct \ntheir operations.\n  However, there are times when secrecy does not equal security. It is \na very important point for us to consider as we both debate this bill \nand try to think about how we want to write our laws and think about \nhow we are going to do our operation. Sometimes secrecy can make \nsecurity more difficult.\n  There is a recently declassified report called the Venona Report that \ndescribes the acquisition of information about spies inside the United \nStates during the post-World War II era. In that report, there is a \nvery interesting moment when General Omar Bradley, who at that time was \nin charge of intelligence, made the decision not to inform the \nPresident of the United States that Klaus Fuchs and others were spies \nfor the Soviet Union. The President was not informed. Secrecy was \nmaintained. General Bradley liked President Truman; he was an Army man \nlike himself. But he made a judgment that secrecy had to be maintained, \nthat the commanding officer of all our forces, that the President, duly \nelected by the people, didn't have a need to know. So a judgment was \nmade to preserve secrecy.\n  I believe, as a consequence, policies didn't turn out to be as good \nas they should have and security was compromised as a consequence. I am \nnot blaming General Bradley. I see it from time to time. Indeed, what \ncaused me to talk about this was my belief that we should change the \nlaw and allow the people of the United States of America to know how \nmuch of their money we are allocating for intelligence and how much in \nthe various categories is being allocated. I fear that all the public \nhas are bad stories about mistakes that are being made, the most recent \none being a mistake in targeting inside of Belgrade.\n  The Chinese Embassy was mistakenly hit one block away from another \ntarget that should have been hit. A great deal of examination of that \nhas already been done. It caused us a great deal of trouble with the \nChinese Ambassador. Under Secretary of State Pickering had to make a \ntrip to China. This all occurred at a very delicate time when we were \ntrying to get the Chinese to agree to some changes in their policy to \nascend to the WTO. It was a big embarrassment.\n\n  I get asked about it all the time: What kind of so-and-so's are over \nthere? Are we getting our money's worth? Are we wasting our money? \nCouldn't they just have spent $2 on a map that was readily available to \nshow where the Chinese Embassy was? Why spend billions of dollars on \nall these folks if they don't even have good enough sense to use a \ncommercially made $2 map?\n  There are questions about the failure to predict the detonation of a \nnuclear weapon in India over a year ago, which was followed by a \ndetonation by Pakistan. A third item I hear a lot is that the CIA \nfailed to predict the end of the Soviet Union, and anybody that can't \npredict that doesn't deserve to get a lot of U.S. tax dollars.\n  It is unfortunate that only the bad stories get out. First of all, on \nthe targeting of the embassy, it was a mistake, but we were in a war, \nfor gosh sakes. We are being asked to deliver targets, asked to \nidentify the targets, and the operation's requirement was to minimize \nthe casualties to the United States and our allies. Not a single \nAmerican or single ally was killed during that entire operation. I \nconsider that a mark of tremendous success. That did not occur by \naccident. There is no shelf of books with one saying ``T'' for targets \nin Belgrade and Kosovo. We had to develop those targets on our own and \nrelatively late. We didn't expect the bombing operation to go on that \nlong. We had--when I say ``we,'' I mean the administration--the \nimpression that possibly it would be over quicker, based upon the \nexperience of 1995.\n  In short, it was a tremendous success. Not only were we able to \nconduct that operation without a single allied casualty, but, in \naddition, we reversed the trend of modern warfare in the 20th century. \nModern warfare in the 20th century has seen an increasing fraction of \ncasualties that are noncombatants. I believe, in this case, except for \nthe casualties produced by the Serbian army and their military police \nand their paramilitary units in Kosovo, there was also success in \nminimizing civilian casualties in this effort.\n  We could not, for example, have implemented Dayton. One of the untold \nstories is the success of the intelligence operations. At that time, it \nwas General Hughes who organized the takeover authority in December of \n1995. It was a United Nations operation, transferred over to NATO. They \nworked night and day to set up a communications system that allowed us \nto know who was and who wasn't abiding by the Dayton agreement--a very, \nvery complicated agreement. The people who were in charge of developing \nour intelligence operation read it, knew it, and disseminated it down \nthe ranks. Everybody understood what had to be done. It was impressive \nthat, in a very small amount of time, we were able to put together an \nintelligence collection and dissemination effort that enabled us to \nimplement the Dayton agreement.\n  There are many other examples, such as the Indian detonation of a \nnuclear weapon. In fact, we had the intelligence collection that \npredicted and prevented one about 18 months earlier.\n\n[[Page S8784]]\n\n Nobody should have been surprised. We don't really need to have \nintelligence officers collecting and predicting a detonation of nuclear \nweapons in India when the successful party in an election promised, and \nmade a part of their campaign a promise, to detonate if they were \nelected, to test a nuclear weapon.\n  Anyway, I think it is very important for me, as somebody who has been \ngiven by my leader the opportunity to sit on this committee and to \nobserve what is going on, to attempt to correct things I thought were \nwrong, make decisions about how much taxpayer money to allocate, about \nhow to respond to mistakes made and intelligence errors that occur, how \nto respond and correct those errors--it is very important for me to say \nto taxpayers that my view is that you are getting your money's worth.\n\n  According to published accounts, we spend $28 billion a year. I wish \nI could provide that number as well as some additional details, but if \nthat is the current dollar amount, according to published accounts, in \nmy view, just watching what is done, the American people are getting \ntheir money's worth. There are tremendous threats in the world that our \nintelligence agencies collect against. They supply that intelligence to \nour warfighters, to our military people. Imagine what it would be like \nto be in charge of U.S. forces in South Korea. You have the most \nheavily militarized area in the world between North and South Korea. \nThere are about 37,000 young men and women in South Korea defending \nagainst a possible attack from North Korea, and the question to their \ncommanding officer is: What are North Korea's intentions? What are they \ndoing? They need an answer.\n  It is an extremely hard target to penetrate and to know what is going \non. Those warfighters need to know that information. They can't operate \nin the dark. Our intelligence collection operators do that time in and \ntime out, day in and day out, try to collect, process, produce, and \ndisseminate intelligence to warfighters and the national policymakers \nand decisionmakers, in order that the United States of America can be \nas safe as it possibly can be. My view is that they have achieved a \nsubstantial success. They are not perfect; none of us are. But their \nsubstantial success deserves a very high amount of praise.\n  Mr. President, a related problem we have with intelligence is that \nmany people presume that the Director of Central Intelligence, who \nmanages the CIA and other national intelligence efforts, controls it \nall. Not true, though the Brown commission report that was assembled \nafter the Aldrich Ames betrayal recommended that increased authority be \ngiven to the Director of Central Intelligence to budget and select \npersonnel for these other areas. For many reasons, these authorities \nwere not granted the Director. The current Director, Mr. Tenet, \ncontrols far less than they realize, under law.\n  I don't believe that is a healthy situation. We were successful 2 \nyears ago in getting the Director, under statute, some additional \nauthorities. But my view is that it is not enough to match authority \nwith responsibility. We have not done that. We are holding the Director \nresponsible for intelligence failures in many areas over which he has \nno real direct budget authority or personnel authority.\n  So the distinguished Senator from New Mexico has properly identified \na problem at the laboratories, as a result of the structure of the law \nthat governs the Department of Energy, that needs to be fixed. The \nconcern is that through some set of facts--today, we don't even know \nwhat the set of facts are--the Chinese probably acquired information \nabout our nuclear secrets, and, as a consequence, they may have the \ncapacity to build and deploy very dangerous weapons. They stole \nsecrets from us, and, as a consequence, we are concerned about how to \nincrease the secrecy of these labs.\n\n  I underscore with this statement that secrecy does not in all cases \nequal security. There are times when secrecy will make security more \ndifficult to achieve. My own view is that the failure under law to let \nthe public know what our expenditures are, and how those moneys are \nspent, decreases our security because, unless I am mistaken in just \nsensing citizens' attitudes toward our intelligence agencies, they do \nnot have a sufficient amount of confidence that they are getting their \nmoney's worth. As a consequence of that lack of confidence, I think we \nare having a difficult time acquiring the resources necessary in a \nworld that is more complicated and a world that, in many ways, is more \ndangerous than it was prior to the end of the cold war.\n  My hope is that this debate about the Department of Energy can occur \nrelatively quickly, that we can get to it tomorrow, that we can resolve \nthe remaining conflicts, and that we can get this intelligence \nauthorization bill passed. Both the chairman and I see the year 2000 as \na watershed year. We were successful last year in increasing the \nresources given to our intelligence checks and analysis and production \nand dissemination efforts. We need to continue that trend.\n  We have been downsizing in the 1990s. I believe very strongly that \nthat downsizing must stop if we are going to be able to honestly say \nyes to the American people, that we are doing all we can to keep them \nas safe as possible against a real range of threats which are still out \nthere in the world.\n  The United States of America is the leading nation on this planet. We \nhave the strongest economy. We have the strongest military. We have the \nlongest running democracy. We tend to take sides on issues, whether it \nis in the Middle East, Northern Ireland, or someplace else on the \nplanet. We clearly take sides when it comes to fighting for individual \nfreedom--for the freedom of people in China, for the freedom of people \nin Russia, and throughout this planet. We put our resources and our \nreputation and our lives on the line.\n  In 1996--it has been so long ago--Americans stationed in Saudi Arabia \nafter the gulf war, flying missions and supporting missions in the \nsouthern area, were killed. We suspect a variety of possibilities as \nperpetrators. But they were killed not because they were in Saudi \nArabia by accident; they were in Saudi Arabia defending U.S. interests, \nand they were killed because they were targeted by people who didn't \nwant them in Saudi Arabia.\n  We take sides, and, as a consequence, we are targets. We are targets \nas well because we have been successful. There is jealousy and hatred \ntowards the people of the United States of America.\n  We understand the interconnected nature of our economy and of our \ndiplomacy throughout the world. A problem in Angola can be a problem in \nOmaha, NE relatively quickly.\n  So we forward-deploy our resources. We don't just have missions in \nNATO or missions that involve the United Nations. We are forward-\ndeployed throughout the world in an attempt to make the world more \npeaceful, more democratic, and more prosperous. It is a mission the \nUnited States of America has selected for itself. I thank God that it \nhas. It is a mission that has resulted in enormous success.\n  I don't know how the rest of my colleagues felt at the time, but I \nremember quite vividly and was very moved for moments during Joint \nSessions of Congress--not that Presidents haven't moved me with their \nState of the Union Addresses. But far more moving to me was Vaclav \nHavel, Nelson Mandela, Lech Walesa, and Kim Dae-jung of South Korea.\n  All four of these men came to a Joint Session of Congress and said to \nthe representatives of the people of this country: Thank you; you have \nput your lives on the line for our freedom; you put your money on the \nline for our freedom; you stayed the course, and we are free.\n  Since Kim Dae-jung of South Korea gave that address, if I ever ran \ninto a man who fought in the ``forgotten war'' in South Korea in the \n1950s, I am quick to say this. I know there are many criticisms of that \nwar. Many people wondered whether or not it was worthwhile. Let me tell \nyou, on behalf of the President of South Korea and the people of South \nKorea, that that war was worth fighting.\n  All one has to do is look at the difference between living in freedom \nin South Korea--an imperfect democracy, as many are; but, nonetheless, \nthe people of South Korea are free; their standard of living is higher; \nthey have the liberty to practice their religion, to speak on the \nstreets--and North Korea, which is a nation of great suffering and \ngreat anguish. Large numbers of people\n\n[[Page S8785]]\n\nare dying as a consequence of malnutrition. The country is arguably in \nthe worst condition of any country on the face of this Earth.\n  That didn't occur by accident. The world marketplace didn't get that \ndone. I am a big fan of the marketplace and a big fan of what business \ncan do. The intervention that liberated the people of South Korea was \nnot the intervention of Sears & Roebuck; it was the intervention of \nAmerican forces, American will, American blood, and American money. The \npeople of South Korea are free as a consequence.\n  We didn't make a decision based on the shape of their eyes or based \non the color of their skin or based upon their religion. We didn't do \nit based upon a desire to own territory or a desire to own wealth or a \ndesire to establish a colony. We did it based upon a desire to fight \nand to keep the people of South Korea free.\n  When you take a stand such as that, as the distinguished occupant of \nthe Chair knows--he has been in politics a very long time, an \noutstanding public servant--you know when you take a stand, especially \non a controversial subject, you are apt to provoke some enemies; you \nare apt to get people organized against you. They don't agree with the \nposition on this, that, or the other thing.\n  The United States has enemies as a result of taking a stand and as a \nresult of our having taken a stand throughout the world in general on \nbehalf of freedom.\n  We provoke animosity in many ways. We are at risk, as a consequence, \nnot just from nation states--that is the older world where nation \nstates were the No. 1 threat--today, it is nonnation state actors such \nas Osama bin Laden and other terrorists who organize themselves away \nfrom the normal powers and structures of government. Cyber warfare, \nbiological and chemical warfare--all of these things we have discussed \nat length are real and present dangers to the people of the United \nStates of America.\n  It is certainly true that our diplomats at the State Department and \nour diplomats in other areas of Government have to try to use our \nintelligence and produce diplomatic successes, as well as to reduce \nthreats. But the State Department, the Department of Justice, the \nDepartment of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Department of \nAgriculture--throughout Government--the Congress, and the President of \nthe United States regularly receive analysis that has occurred after \nchecks have been done, after analysis has been done, after production \nhas occurred, and then it is disseminated to people who make decisions \nall the time and, hopefully, make better decisions as a consequence of \nthe intelligence delivered to them.\n  My view is that this budget decline we have experienced in the 1990s \nneeds to stop. I hope that this intelligence authorization bill will be \npassed by the Senate, that we can go to conference quickly with the \nHouse, and get it to the President for his signature. I have no doubt \nthat the President, subject to our not putting things on here that the \nPresident can't support, will sign the bill.\n  One of the things that I think undercuts our ability to do that is \nthe continued belief we have to keep from the American people how much \nmoney is being spent. I have said that often enough now. I am not going \nto offer an amendment. I can count votes. I know that amendment would \nnot succeed. But I intend to continue to make the point and try to \npersuade, especially my friends on the other side of the aisle, that we \nwill increase the Nation's security by making this information publicly \navailable to the American people.\n  Again, the point here is that 100 percent secrecy does not always \nequal 100 percent security. Sometimes 100 percent secrecy can actually \ndecrease the security, as a consequence of the right people not getting \nthe information. As a consequence of discussions not proceeding subject \nto compartmentalization that prevented one key person from talking to \nanother key person, and, as a consequence, neither one of them knew \nwhat the other was doing, the result is that a bad decision was made.\n  I also would like to discuss an issue that, to me, is extremely \nimportant. I don't know if the Senator from New Mexico has additional \nthings he wants to say.\n  Does the Senator from Michigan desire to speak? Since I will be \nassigned to sit down for a long period of time, Senators may want to \nmove on. I think I will have plenty of time to talk about this bill.\n  Mr. President, I presume they would like to speak. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Nebraska and my \nfriend from New Mexico for their courtesies in sharing the floor so \nthat we can chat about some of the issues which we will be taking up \nwhen we move to this bill tomorrow, which I hope and expect we will.\n  One of the issues we are going to be taking up, which will probably \ntake more time than other issues in this bill, is the Department of \nEnergy reorganization issue. This comes to the floor on this bill. \nWhether it is the best place or not, it is going to happen. I think \neveryone wants this reorganization issue to be resolved, hopefully, in \nsome kind of a consensus manner, if possible, in a way that it can \nbecome law.\n  There is strong opposition in the House to the reorganization of the \nDepartment of Energy being added to either the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill or to this appropriations bill, this intelligence \nappropriation. That is a fact of life we have to deal with.\n  I suggest the more we are able to come together in a bill which has \nmore of a consensus support, the stronger position we are going to be \nin, in trying to persuade the House to take up this matter promptly, \nfor all the reasons the Senator from New Mexico gave, as well as to get \nthe President to sign the bill. I hope we will take these hours between \nnow and the time this bill is before the Senate to attempt to work out \nsome of the differences that do exist.\n  I simply want to summarize where at least I am in terms of the \nrecommendations of the Rudman commission. I am for those \nrecommendations. The label of the agency is not as important to me as \nthe powers of this new agency--semiautonomous agency, separately \norganized agencies, as they are called, including DARPA. I believe we \nshould have a separately organized agency which is synonymous with, I \npresume, a semiautonomous agency.\n  That does not resolve the issue, simply to agree on a label. The \nquestion then is: What powers will that agency have and what is the \nrelationship of that new agency to the Department of Energy? That is \nthe issue we should try to resolve in a consensus manner if we possibly \ncan.\n  We want two things to be true: We want this agency to have a \nsignificant degree of autonomy, independence, separate organization, \nseparate staff, legal advice, personnel advice. We want them to have \ntheir own set of staff so they can operate in a significantly \nindependent way.\n  On the other hand, we want the Secretary to be able to run his \nagency, to run the overall agency. If it is going to be in the Energy \nDepartment, if it is not going to be carved out of the Energy \nDepartment--which was the other alternative that Rudman suggested as a \npossibility--if it is going to be inside the Energy Department, then we \nhave to have the Secretary be able to implement the policies of the \nDepartment of Energy, which have to apply to all parts of the \nDepartment of Energy, whether or not they are ``separately organized'' \nagencies within the Department.\n  That is the balance we are trying to strike. I will come to that a \nlittle bit later, as to how other separately organized agencies within \nthe Department of Defense have struck that balance. Reaching a \nconsensus, instead of having a significantly divided vote, is going to \nstrengthen the prospects for reorganization of the Department of Energy \nalong the lines Senator Rudman has proposed.\n  Do we need to reorganize the Department? We sure do. For 20 years or \nlonger, there have been reports after reports after reports of lack of \naccountability, of duplication, of an inability for this Department to \nfunction in a very smooth and strong way, particularly as it relates to \nelements of national security. We should do something about it. We \nshould do it now. It\n\n[[Page S8786]]\n\ndoesn't mean we should simply say let's delay it for some later time. \nOn that, I think, there is a consensus. We ought to fix this \nDepartment, not just say let's do it at a later time.\n  I hope there is also some agreement that we ought to take the few \ndays that may be necessary to try to put together a reorganized DOE--\none which has a separately organized agency to handle these nuclear \nissues--so we can have a stronger chance of this becoming law. We have \nall been frustrated by the breakdown in security which the Cox \ncommission report highlighted by the so-called PFIAB report, the \nPresident's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, which Senator Rudman \nchaired. That frustration has been compounded by the fact that past \nadministrations and past Congresses have received literally dozens of \nintelligence studies, GAO reports, FBI briefings, going back to the \nmid-1970s, detailing inadequate security safeguards at the Department \nof Energy labs and detailing foreign espionage efforts to obtain \nsensitive U.S. technology. This has been going on for over 20 years.\n  This is what Senator Rudman said at a joint hearing of four Senate \ncommittees:\n\n       I had our staffs sit down and add up the number of reports \n     that have found problems with the security of the DOE for the \n     past 20 years. The numbers are astounding. 29 reports from \n     the General Accounting Office, 61 internal DOE reports and \n     more than a dozen reports from special task forces and ad hoc \n     panels. Altogether, that is more than 100 reports, or an \n     average of five critical reports a year for the past two \n     decades.\n\n  Here we are, 20 years down the road, Senator Rudman said, still \nbattling with the same issues. I think you would agree with me, that is \ntotally unacceptable. All Members listening that day I think were \nnodding our heads, without exception.\n  As Senator Rudman noted last month, security at the Department of \nEnergy has been an accident waiting to happen for over 20 years. Three \nadministrations and Congress share the responsibility for not doing \nmore over the years to heed the warnings of those reports to legislate \ncorrective action. The challenge is to put that frustration, which we \nall share, to constructive use and to put in place an effective and \nworkable management structure, the Department of Energy's nuclear \nweapons program, that ensures our vital national security secrets are \nnot compromised in the future.\n\n  The Rudman recommendations include not just putting in place a \nseparately organized agency but also putting that agency under the \neffective direction and control of the Secretary of Energy. That is \ngoing to be, it seems to me, what we have to resolve. We want it \nseparately organized, but we want the Secretary to have effective \ndirection and control of that agency. Those are two goals. Those two \ngoals can be harmonized. They have been with other separately organized \nagencies, including some that I will mention in the Department of \nDefense which are used by Senator Rudman as his model, including DARPA.\n  We should seek both things: That semiautonomy, or that separate \norganization, which will put some focus and accountability inside that \nagency. If we are going to leave it in the Department of Energy--and \nthat seems to be the consensus, that we leave it inside the \nDepartment--we must be able to have a Secretary who can effectively \ndirect and control that semiautonomous or separately organized agency \nwithin his Department. It is a real challenge, but it is doable. We \nwill do it with some care. They are both legitimate goals.\n  There have been some steps taken already to achieve those goals. As \nthe Senator from New Mexico pointed out, we had a Presidential Decision \nDirective No. 61 which President Clinton signed over a year ago. The \nRudman report noted, to its credit, in the past 2 years the Clinton \nadministration has proposed and begun to implement some of the most \nfar-reaching reforms in DOE's history. In February of 1998 that \ndirective was signed. The Rudman report highlighted 5 of the most \nsignificant of the 13 initiatives in Presidential Directive No. 61.\n  First, counterintelligence and foreign intelligence elements in DOE \nwould be reconfigured into two independent offices and report directly \nto the Secretary of Energy.\n  Second, the Director of the new Office of Counterintelligence would \nbe a senior executive from the FBI and would have direct access to the \nSecretary of Energy. That is a very important question we are going to \nhave to resolve and take up again, whether or not we want the director \nof a new Office of Counterintelligence to be not only a senior \nexecutive from the FBI but to have direct access to the Secretary of \nEnergy. If we want to hold the Secretary of Energy accountable, which I \ndo, then we have to access to him directly, it seems to me, a director \nof a new Office of Counterintelligence. That will be one of the issues \nwe will be discussing and hopefully resolve.\n\n  Third, existing DOE contracts with the labs would be amended to \ninclude counterintelligence program goals, objectives, and performance \nmeasures to evaluate compliance with these contractual obligations.\n  Counterintelligence personnel assigned to the labs would have direct \naccess to lab directors and would report concurrently to the Director \nof the Office of Counterintelligence.\n  The Senate has also acted in a number of ways. We passed significant \nlegislation this year under the leadership of Chairman Warner in the \nArmed Services Committee. We have adopted a series of measures in the \nNational Defense Authorization Act which were designed to enhance \ncounterintelligence, security, and intelligence activities at DOE \nfacilities.\n  These measures include putting in statute most of the specific \nrecommendations on security and counterintelligence contained in PDD-\n61. For instance, our bill, which is now in conference, includes a \nprovision establishing separate offices of counterintelligence and \nsecurity at DOE, each reporting to the Secretary. That provision, which \nthe Senate already adopted, is in the DOD authorization conference, \nwhich is going on right now. It is taking up a Senate provision which \nestablishes an office of counterintelligence and security at the DOE \nreporting directly to the Secretary.\n  That is not inconsistent, in my book, with having a \ncounterintelligence chief at the agency. I do not view that as being \ninconsistent. On the other hand, we have to be clear one way or the \nother as to whether or not we believe there is an inconsistency in \nhaving both a counterintelligence person for the entire agency directly \nreporting to the Secretary, as well as having this new agency having \nits own counterintelligence chief. To me, that is not inconsistent, but \nthe people who are offering the amendment may view that as being an \ninconsistency.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On page 5 of the amendment, which I think my colleagues \nhave, we adopted the language that is in the Armed Services bill:\n\n       The Chief of Nuclear Stewardship Counterintelligence shall \n     have direct access to the Secretary.\n\n  Secretary of Energy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is somewhat different than the provision in the \nSenate bill which established the separate Office of \nCounterintelligence and Security at the DOE reporting directly to the \nSecretary. We have to work out whether we intend that to be the same or \nwhether we intend that to be two separate offices of \ncounterintelligence.\n  For instance, the new agency, I say to my good friend, is going to \npresumably have its own personnel director and its own programs \ninspector general and its own general counsel, but so is the Department \nof Energy going to have its own general counsel and its own personnel \ndirector and its own inspector general. There will be an office in that \nseparate agency, and there will be an office at the Department. That is \nnot inherently inconsistent. We do similar things with DARPA and with \nother separately organized agencies.\n\n  It seems to me, to make sure that we are not creating confusion and \nlack of accountability, we would want to make that clear in the \namendment that we, indeed, are talking about an office at the \ndepartmental level, as well as now a separate office with some of these \nstaff functions at this separately organized agency.\n  Again, that is the kind of language which I think is important we \nattempt to work out.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not know how much longer the \nSenator wants to speak, but I can only be here\n\n[[Page S8787]]\n\nabout 15 or 20 minutes and I still have a few comments. I want to \nlisten attentively to what he is saying.\n  I believe I heard the Senator mention four or five things. I ticked \nthem off as he mentioned them, and we find there may be two that are \nnot in the bill which were thought to be management techniques. Three \nout of five or three out of six are in the bill. I am willing to work \non anything my colleagues want to work on, except I want to make sure \nof what I consider to be the most important recommendation of all, when \nthe Rudman report says:\n\n       To achieve the kind of protection that all these \n     laboratories have, they and their functions must have their \n     own autonomous operational structure free of all the other \n     obligations of DOE management.\n\n  If we start with that, then I think we can work on that in terms of \nhow you get there and make sure it means what you want it to mean. \nFrankly, I am very pleased this afternoon because I heard both the \nSenator from Michigan and the cochairman of the Committee on \nIntelligence say they want to get on with the bill and they want to try \nto work on the amendment to get it as bipartisan as we can.\n  Frankly, if that is the way we are moving, I am ready to say, let's \nwork on it. I have given my colleagues my draft. It is the final draft. \nAs soon as my colleagues have amendments, we want to look at them. I \nhave three or four Senators to check with, and I am sure my colleagues \nhave, too, but I do think you clearly understand, in the way the \nSenator has expressed it, that it will have its autonomous functions \nwithin that agency.\n  The Senator has a great concern, and if I was not positive that we \nhad satisfied it, I would not be here.\n  On the second page, paragraph (C), we say:\n\n       The Secretary shall be responsible for all policies of the \n     agency. The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship shall \n     report solely and directly to the Secretary and shall be \n     subject to the supervision and direction of the Secretary.\n\n  That was put in because everybody said we ought to do that. It was a \nlittle earlier than some of you think. My colleagues missed it for a \nwhile. It is there.\n  At the end of the page we also say:\n\n       That the Secretary may direct other officials of the \n     Department who are not within the agency for nuclear \n     stewardship to review the agency's programs and to make \n     recommendations to the Secretary regarding the administration \n     of these programs, including consistency with similar \n     programs and activities of the Department.\n\n  The Senator from Michigan has expressed a concern about that one. \nThis may not be exactly the wording he would like, but I believe it \nmoves in the direction of one of his previous concerns.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Mexico. Senator \nRudman has said the following, in addition to the quotation my \ncolleague cited:\n\n       That the Secretary is still responsible for developing and \n     promulgating DOE-wide policy on these matters.\n\n  Then he said, and this is in his memorandum of clarification dated \nJune 30, the second paragraph from the bottom:\n\n       He is still responsible----\n\n  Talking about the Secretary----\n\n     for promulgating DOE-wide policy on these matters, and it \n     makes sense to us that a Secretary would want advisers on his \n     or her immediate staff to assist in this vein. We understand \n     that is why Secretary Richardson recently created DOE-wide \n     czars to advise him on security and counterintelligence.\n\n  There is a need for a Secretary who is running a Department to have, \nas Senator Rudman points out, advisers on his or her immediate staff to \nassist him in developing and promulgating DOE-wide policy on these \nmatters.\n  I want to take up the suggestion of my friend from New Mexico. It is \npossible we can achieve both, as the DOD does with DARPA and other \nseparately organized agencies, or what I think the Senator from New \nMexico would indicate are semi-autonomous agencies, agencies which are \nnot separate from a Cabinet-level agency; they are not separate from \nthe Department. We are not creating a new department, and I do not \nthink the Senator from New Mexico wants to create a new department. We \nwant this inside a department which is subject to departmental-wide \npolicies and a Secretary who is able to effectuate those policies.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can I comment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Sure.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is a fair statement that the Senator made about \nwhat I would like to see. I also stated on Friday past, the first time \nI ever said this as a Senator who has been involved with these nuclear \nactivities since I arrived--and I have been chairman of the \nsubcommittee that appropriates it for almost 6 years--if the \nsemiautonomous agency is weakened, to the extent it is really just \nanother of blocks on a chart, I will wholeheartedly support taking it \nall out of the Energy Department and making it a freestanding \ndepartment. In fact, I am almost looking at this that if it were a \nfreestanding agency like NASA, and moved within the Department, how \nwould the Secretary control it? I am beginning to think of it that way. \nHe still would have to control it so long as it is in his Department. \nBut I think we have said that in the amendment.\n\n  We are willing to work with you on whether there are better ways to \nmake sure he still is the boss; that is what you are talking about, \nthat he is in control. The Under Secretary in charge of this new \nsemiautonomous agency is not totally independent or we would not call \nhim ``semiautonomous.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. Exactly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If we wanted him independent, we would put him out here \nlike NASA and call him an Administrator or Director. So as long as we \nare thinking the same way, we are willing to work with you.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As I understand what you are saying, you want one \nSecretary to be able to have effective direction and control of this \nquasi-autonomous agency that is in his Department. With that standard, \nif that is a standard which you also accept, it seems to me that we \nought to be able to find common ground. Whether that includes all the \nother Senators who have interests in this, neither of us can say. But \nas far as I am concerned, the test for me is whether or not we leave \nthe Secretary of Energy like the Secretary of Defense with DARPA, \nhaving effective direction and control of that separately organized \nagency which has been called here a semiautonomous agency. That is my \nstandard.\n  I am going to continue to work with colleagues on both sides of the \naisle; and our staffs will share some amendment language which at least \nthis Senator is working on. There are other Senators who have \namendments as well. We will get you our amendment language by the end \nof the day in the spirit of trying to achieve some kind of a joint \nposition on this going into the debate tomorrow.\n  I am happy to yield the floor. I heard my friend from New Mexico \nindicate that he is only able to stay a few more minutes. I am \nbasically done. There are a few more thoughts I have about some of the \nseparately organized agencies inside the Department of Defense and the \nway they are organized. They were used as the models by Senator Rudman. \nIf we follow those models, I think--not exactly and not precisely--but \nif we follow the spirit of those models, we will have a Secretary of \nEnergy who can effectively direct and control his semiautonomous agency \nthat would be created, including, it seems to me, to be effective, the \nuse, as Senator Rudman pointed out, of advisers on his immediate staff \nto assist him in effectively directing and controlling--which are my \nlast words, not Senator Rudman's.\n  I yield the floor and thank my friend from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, I will not take very long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank you for recognizing me.\n  I say to Senator Levin, I have read that part of the Rudman report \nwhich talks about the Secretary having adequate input and having staff \nto make input. Let me tell you what I would be very worried about; and \nI remain worried about it as we talk with the members of the staff of \nthe Secretary.\n  I think the worst thing we could do is to create this semiautonomous \nagency on paper but make it still like it is subject in every detail to \nthe Secretary of Energy and his staff. So I am not going to sit by and \ntell you I agree because I do not agree that we should say on the one \nhand an Under Secretary is going to run it, and it is created with \nautonomous authority for him, and then say\n\n[[Page S8788]]\n\nthe Secretary's office can, with various staffers, run it day by day. \nBecause then all we have done is created autonomy and then taken it \naway.\n  There are two ways to take it away. One is very direct. For example, \njust take out the environment and say they do not have control of the \nenvironment. That is one way. The other is to put it all back into the \nSecretary in detail so his staff can be running it.\n  I think you and I would be serving our country terribly if we created \nit, in a poor manner, semiautonomous and then found in 5 years, when it \nwas set up, that three strong men in the Secretary's office were \nrunning it. I think that would be the worst ending we could have \nbecause we would be back to seeing how good they were at things; and \nwithout that, it would be an unsuccessful operation. There would be \nmore masters rather than just the one we are looking for.\n  Having said that, I want to speak for a moment--because I forgot to \nduring my opening remarks--about the kind of science that exists at \nthese laboratories, especially our three deterrent laboratories and two \nthat help them that are partially in this mode, and a little bit about \nthe origin of all this work.\n  I want to start by ticking off a few names. This is by far not the \nentire list.\n  This whole scientific entourage that we have here which we call the \nnuclear weapons laboratories, the great crown treasures of our science-\nbased research, was started in an era when America did not have enough \nscientists of its own who were nationalists, American born and raised, \neducated in America.\n  So guess what the list of the early Manhattan Project scientists who \nhelped us get a bomb sounded like. They sounded like Italians. Enrico \nFermi; he was an Italian. He was at one of the other laboratories in \nthe country. Both he and his wife were taken to Los Alamos and they \nbecame some of the principal players. It sounded like Hans Bethe; it \nsounded liked Edward Teller, Carl Fuchs--and the list goes on.\n  Frankly, we were taking a real gamble because they knew what they \nwere doing, each and every one of them. Collectively, they knew they \nwere preparing an atomic bomb for the United States of America to \neither win the Second World War or to use it to stop it. They were \nworking at a ferocious pace to get it done before the Germans got it \ndone. We all remember that as we read about it.\n  Those scientists had contacts all over the world, whatever kind of \nworld it was at that point in time. The same thing is happening today. \nWe should not be surprised that we have marvelous Chinese scientists at \nour laboratories. They are American born, American educated, and I \nassume some are naturalized citizens, and they are among our best.\n  It just so happens that the Chinese seem to have breached our \nsecurity in some intricate ways, not the way the Russians did it. They \ndid not come along with a big bribe and pay somebody off. They did it \nin an intricate way by little bits and pieces. Since the Chinese \nscientists who make their nuclear program work are intimate about \nAmericans in science, would you believe that it is our understanding \nthat the chief scientist in charge of their nuclear weapons development \nhas a Ph.D. from one of our universities? You do not think he knows \nAmerican scientists of his era? He was apparently a very good nuclear \nphysicist or scientist--Ph.D.--from one of our universities. We \nunderstand in the hierarchy there may be six or seven who were educated \nas MIT or Caltech or someplace, and they are running their program.\n\n  The point of it is, we cannot, in some fit or frenzy, put a wall up \naround these laboratories and say these scientists cannot exchange \nviews around the world; they cannot travel to conferences.\n  Let me ask you, do you think they would stay at the laboratories, if \nthey are among the greatest minds around, if you told them they can be \nonly half a scientist, that they cannot go to a conference where \nChinese scientists are coming who may exchange views on something \nextraordinarily new in the field of physics which has nothing \nnecessarily to do with nuclear bombs? The truth of the matter is, if \nyou try it, do you know who the losers will be? The losers will be the \nAmerican people, because we won't have the greatest scientists in those \nlaboratories. What has made us the most secure nuclear power in the \nworld? Our scientists. We talk about everything else, but it is the \nscientists over the last 40 years, successors to this list I gave --\nincidentally, I did not mean to imply that there weren't many early \nscientists who were American; obviously there were. Some of the leaders \nwere Americans, no question about it. We should not leave the \nimpression that we don't want scientists, whatever their national \norigin is or whatever their basic culture is, working in our \nlaboratories and we want to muzzle them; for if we put a wall around \nthe laboratories, it will be a matter of a decade and nobody will want \nin the laboratories, much less out of the laboratories. Instead of \nworrying about getting secrets out, we will have to worry about getting \nenough good things to happen where there are some secrets.\n  I want to make that point so everyone will know that my approach and \nthe approach I am working on with other Senators to create this \nsemiautonomous agency is not directed at closing these laboratories, \nclosing the lips and the brains of scientists and putting them behind a \nbar up there.\n  When I was a young boy, believe it or not, we had a family that could \nall fit in one big car. On a number of occasions we drove from \nAlbuquerque to Los Alamos because we were inquisitive. We had heard \nthat if you went up there, they wouldn't let you in. So we would drive \nup, and they wouldn't let us in. We would drive up to these big gates, \nand that was the Los Alamos scientific laboratory. No trespassing. So I \nwas there. That was the early version of this. Now they have grown into \nmuch larger institutions, much more sophisticated kinds of science.\n\n  In addition, because my friend Senator Levin has been talking about \nthings that concern him, I will mention two or three things that I want \neveryone to know.\n  First, what is a semiautonomous agency and what is an independent \nagency? The best I can tell Senators is, a model of independence would \nprobably be NASA. I don't know the best model for a semiautonomous \nagency within a department, but I will tell my colleagues that what it \nmeans is described very clearly in the Rudman report, that the \nfunctions of this agency must be autonomous and not subject to the \neveryday rule of the larger department.\n  If we are not prepared to do that, then let's not kid ourselves and \nsay we have done it halfway. It must be done in a way that is \nconsistent with the agency director reporting only to the Secretary of \nEnergy and in a manner that would assure that its functions are \nautonomous, even if it means we must have a duplication of functions. \nBecause if there is one set of functions, we are back where we are. If \nit is not subject to the Secretary's power, then it is not \nsemiautonomous; it is autonomous.\n  I think we are on the same side, trying to make it semiautonomous, \nwhich means the Secretary is still all powerful. Having said that, let \nme say that as we proceed, I am willing to look at the document line by \nline as it gets introduced--it has been circulated--and cite where I \nbelieve we have covered most of the aspects that are of concern and \nthat have been expressed as of concern on the floor, save two.\n  One of them has to do with the laboratories being able to take work \nfor other agencies, for the Defense Department and from the Energy \nDepartment, and thus remain laboratories that are diversified, that \nare, thus, very attractive to scientists. I will insert in the Record, \nand not read much from it, testimony given in the Committee on Commerce \nSubcommittee on Energy and Power and the Committee on Science \nSubcommittee on Energy in the House, by William Happer.\n  Dr. Happer is one of the distinguished scientists in the United \nStates and used to be in the department. He concludes in the statement, \nin reference to the new agency:\n\n       I do not think that the ANS need hinder the support by \n     other parts of DOE, or by outside agencies, of science at the \n     Weapons Laboratories. As a former director of the Office of \n     Energy Research, I saw, at very close quarters, how work was \n     funded by my office at the Weapons Laboratories, and how \n     other Federal agencies--for example, the National\n\n[[Page S8789]]\n\n     Institutes of Health, or DARPA--arrange to have work done. \n     The creation of an ANS within DOE might actually help the \n     interactions between the Science Laboratories and the Weapons \n     Laboratories if it leads to better management [at the \n     semiautonomous agency].\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Happer statement of July 13 in its \nentirety be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Testimony of William Happer\n\n       Thank you for this opportunity to testify on current \n     proposals to restructure the DOE. I am a Professor of Physics \n     at Princeton University and Chair of the University Research \n     Board. I am also the Chairman of the Board and one of the \n     founders of a high-tech startup company, Magnetic Imaging \n     Technologies, Inc., which makes images of human lungs with \n     laser-polarized gases. So I have experience with the business \n     world outside of academia. I have had a long familiarity with \n     the activities of DOE, as a practicing scientist, as a member \n     of advisory committees for DOE Weapons Laboratories and \n     Science Laboratories, and as the Director of the Office of \n     Energy Research under Secretary of Energy James Watkins \n     during the Bush administration.\n       The DOE has many missions, but none more important than \n     nuclear stewardship, that is, ensuring the safety, security \n     and reliability of the US nuclear stockpile. Connected with \n     this mission are--or at least used to be--many others, the \n     construction and operation of nuclear reactors for the \n     production of special nuclear materials, the enrichment of \n     stable isotopes, the construction of scientific facilities to \n     learn more about the fundamental scientific issues connected \n     with nuclear weapons, and how to ensure the safety of those \n     working with dangerous materials--radioactive, toxic or both. \n     I could go on, but my point is that the DOE weapons program \n     is so challenging that it needs the most capable technical, \n     scientific and managerial talents available. As long as the \n     United States maintains its own nuclear weapons and feels it \n     necessary to cope with those of others, we must ensure that \n     the part of DOE responsible for nuclear weapons functions as \n     well as possible.\n       Regretfully, I must agree with various assessments, \n     stretching back many years, that DOE's missions--including \n     the nuclear weapons mission--are often poorly managed. The \n     recent Rudman and IDA reports, the Galvin report of a few \n     years ago, and many others have clearly spelled out what is \n     wrong. The DOE has become a bureaucratic morass, with many \n     paper-pushing, regulatory offices competing to build up their \n     staffs of FTE's and SES billets, to take credit for successes \n     of increasingly-harried, front-line scientists, engineers and \n     technicians, and to avoid responsibility for anything that \n     may go wrong. The recent revelations of Chinese espionage and \n     the DOE reaction to it are but one example of how difficult \n     it is for the DOE to cope with serious real and potential \n     problems in the weapons program, and other DOE programs as \n     well. So I support a reorganization of DOE along the lines \n     suggested in the Rudman report. If a reorganized DOE with a \n     more efficiently operating Nuclear Stewardship Agency (NSA) \n     is a result of the Chinese espionage, at least we will have \n     some benefit from the regrettable affair.\n       I have no illusions that a semiautonomous Nuclear \n     Stewardship Agency within DOE will correct all of the \n     problems we are struggling with, but I am sure that the \n     current DOE structure will not work. I say this as a \n     pragmatist and an experimental scientist. We have tried to \n     make the current structure work for many years and it always \n     fails. When one of my experiments does that again and again, \n     I try something else.\n       We have several reasons to be hopeful that a semiautonomous \n     agency could work. The example of NSA within the Department \n     of Defense (DoD) has often been cited as a successful, \n     semiautonomous agency, and there are other precedents like \n     DARPA in DoD or the Naval Reactor Program within DOE. I like \n     the word ``Agency,'' which comes from the Latin root ``to \n     do.'' An agent does something for you. Some in the current \n     structure of DOE and its supervisors seem not to care if \n     anything ever gets done. This is not acceptable for any \n     worthwhile mission, but it is simply not tolerable for \n     Nuclear Stewardship.\n       Nuclear weapons, ours and those of our potential \n     adversaries are real and very dangerous. They are too \n     important not to take very seriously.\n       There is a wise old saying, sometimes ascribed to the \n     Chinese, that ``The best fertilizer for a farm is the feet of \n     the owner.'' Someone has to own the mission of nuclear \n     stewardship, or at the very least someone must be a dedicated \n     Steward. To succeed, the Steward must have the means to \n     manage. As best I understand the proposed the Agency for \n     Nuclear Stewardship, it will give the Steward both ownership \n     and the means to do the job.\n       You cannot be a good Steward of the Nuclear Weapons mission \n     of DOE unless you control all of the key functions, \n     manufacturing, security, research, safety, etc. There is \n     never enough money or enough personnel to do everything that \n     is needed, so the Steward will have to balance many competing \n     needs: the security of plutonium facilities; human resources; \n     environmental, safety and health requirements; research \n     needed to ensure that aging nuclear weapons remain safe and \n     effective; counterintelligence precautions--the list is \n     extremely long and every issue is important. However, someone \n     must make the decision on how to distribute finite resources \n     to do the best possible job. With the current DOE structure, \n     various offices can demand that this action or that be taken \n     with no concern for the broader problem of how to optimize \n     finite resources of funds and people. One unfunded mandate \n     after another comes down from headquarters or the field \n     office. It is not possible to fully respond to all of the \n     mandates. So the poor front-line troops do the best they can, \n     and a year later another GAO report comes out saying that \n     this or that requirement was not met. There is substantial \n     duplication, triplication or even quadruplication of roles in \n     DOE, with the front-line DOE contractor, the DOE site office, \n     the DOE field office and headquarters all contributing to \n     some issues.\n       I have testified before that part of DOE's problem is that \n     it has too many people at headquarters and in the field \n     offices. I would hope that the ANS Steward would not be \n     saddled with making work for every DOE employee currently on \n     a payroll related to the ANS mission. But I am a realist, and \n     if every employee remains, the system could probably still be \n     made to work better with the sort of crisp management \n     structure envisaged for the ANS. Almost all of the DOE civil \n     servants I met during my time there were good and talented \n     people, determined to do something to earn their keep. It is \n     a shame that so many of them are used for counterproductive \n     activities.\n       Some would say letting the ANS Stewart control most of the \n     important oversight now assigned to various independent DOE \n     offices would be letting the fox watch the hen house. I do \n     not think this needs be the case, and in any event the \n     current structure is not working. The proposed ANS Steward \n     will have a clear list of responsibilities, and will have to \n     report annually to the Secretary of Energy--and through the \n     Secretary to the Congress and to the President--on how well \n     these responsibilities have been fulfilled, and why the \n     allocation of funds and people for safety, security, research \n     programs, etc. is optimum. One could also enlist the aid of \n     other federal agencies for periodic tests of how well the ANS \n     is fulfilling its mandate. For example, another competent \n     federal agency could be tasked to try to penetrate the \n     computer security of the ANS.\n       Concerns have been raised about possible bad effects of ANS \n     on DOE science. Indeed, one of the strengths of the DOE \n     weapons laboratories has been the strong basic science done \n     there and the close ties their scientists maintain to other \n     DOE laboratories and to the rest of the scientific world. \n     This has paid important dividends to our country and we do \n     not want to lose these benefits in a restructuring of DOE. \n     One of the benchmarks on which the Nuclear Steward will be \n     judged should be the health of science in the Weapons \n     Laboratories.\n       To help maintain ties of the laboratories to the entire \n     scientific world, visits by foreign scientists to the weapons \n     laboratories should continue, but we should redouble our \n     efforts to be sure such visits do not result in the loss of \n     classified information. Those of you who have visited weapons \n     laboratories realize that non-classified scientific work is \n     often done ``outside the fence'' where security issues are \n     less urgent. The Steward should ensure that there is a graded \n     system of visitor controls. It would be silly to follow the \n     same procedures for a scientist coming to talk to colleagues \n     about human genome sequencing as for one who may be \n     interested in weapons-related topics. Visitor controls should \n     be very stringent in the latter case, but relatively light in \n     the former.\n       I do not think that the ANS need hinder the support by \n     other parts of DOE, or by outside agencies, of science at the \n     Weapons Laboratories. As a former Director of Office of \n     Energy Research, I saw, at very close quarters, how work was \n     funded by my office at the Weapons Laboratories, and how \n     other federal agencies--for example, the National Institutes \n     of Health, or DARPA--arranged to have work done. The creation \n     of an ANS within DOE might actually help the interactions \n     between the Science Laboratories and the Weapons Laboratories \n     if it leads to better management within the ANS.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, this bill doesn't normally get a lot of \nattention, but because of the concern over the loss of secrets through \nour laboratories at the DOE, we are going to have a debate about an \namendment to restructure the Department of Energy.\n  I want to make a point that I made earlier, which is that secrecy and \nsecurity are not the same thing. Sometimes secrecy equals security. \nSometimes secrecy can make security more difficult, harder for us to \naccomplish the mission\n\n[[Page S8790]]\n\nof keeping the United States of America as secure as we possibly can.\n  I am not going to offer an amendment to this bill, because it has \nbeen defeated pretty soundly in the past--although I must say I am \ntempted to do so--to disclose to the American people how much is spent \non intelligence gathering. Right now, under law, we cannot do that. I \nwant to call my colleagues' attention to what is happening. Our first \nvote is on cloture. I think cloture will be invoked pretty easily. Our \nleader is not going to hold anybody up from voting for cloture. Maybe \nwe can go right to the bill.\n  Listening to Senators Domenici and Levin earlier, I think they may be \nable to solve their differences. The vote may end up being unanimous, \nwhich is my wish. I hope we can continue to move closer together on \nthat piece of legislation, an important piece of legislation on which \nSenator Domenici and others have been working.\n  I want to call my colleagues' attention to what we do every year \nbasically, and that is, the authorization of appropriations for the \nintelligence bill is very small, as a consequence of not being able to \ndisclose to the American people what is in the bill. The House bill \ncontains six titles. The Senate bill, which will be offered as a \nsubstitute for the House bill, also contains six titles. The first two \ntitles are identical. Titles I and II in the House bills are identical. \nThen there are general provisions, and then each bill has additional \nthings in there.\n  But you can see the problem we have getting public support for \nintelligence collection. That is one step in the process of \nintelligence. We collect with imaging efforts, we collect with signals \nintercepts, we collect with human intelligence, and we have measurement \nintelligence. We have all sorts of various what are called INTs that \nare used to gather raw data.\n  Then somebody has to take that data and analyze it. What does it \nmean? What does this data mean? What is the interpretation of it? \nOftentimes secrecy can be a problem because one compartment may not be \ntalking to another.\n  This administration and others have worked to try to bring various \npeople together so there is more consultation than there has been in \nthe past. But oftentimes decisions have to be made very quickly. \nSometimes interpretations of public information are made, and an \nadjustment is made.\n  Let me be very specific. About 80 percent, in my view, of the \ndecisions that most elected people make in Congress having to do with \nnational security are made as a result of something they acquired in a \nnonclassified fashion in a TV report, in a radio report, in a newspaper \nreport, or a published document. Staff analyze it and come and say: \nThis is what we think is going on--about 80 percent of the information \nthat we process.\n  I would say that would probably be on the low side. It may be even \nhigher than that. Indeed, the President may be in a similar situation. \nHe may be making a decision on a very high percentage of publicly \naccessible information as opposed to classified information.\n  That is quite the trend. The trend is both healthy and at times \ndisturbing because more and more information is being made available to \nthe public that was not available in the past. The good news is \ncitizens have more information. They process that information. We have \na lot of independent analysts out there.\n  In a couple of years, when metering satellite photographs are \navailable, we are going to see competing analyses being done over \nimages. This is what I see when I take that photograph.\n  I say this because I think it is true that it is very difficult, for \nany length of time for the Congress and the President to do something \nthe public doesn't support, especially when it comes to spending their \nmoney.\n  In this case, I just hazard a guess. I never polled on this. But \ncertainly I take a lot of anecdotal stories on board from citizens who \nquestion whether or not they are getting their money's worth. Is all \nthe money we are spending worthwhile when we aren't able to tell where \nthe Chinese Embassy is in Belgrade? A $2 map would have told us where \nit was. When we were unable to forecast a class of facility, when we \nwere unable to foresee that India was going to test a nuclear weapon \nfollowing an election, during which the party that was successful \ncampaigned, and their platform said, if we are elected and we come to \npower, we are going to test a nuclear weapon? Many failures, in short, \nare out in the public, and the public acquires the information. I think \nit has caused them to lose confidence that they are getting their \nmoney's worth.\n  It is a real crisis for us. It is a real challenge for us because, \nagain, if you look at the document we will be voting on sometime in the \nnext couple of days--usually this thing goes through very quickly and \nwe don't have much time to consider it. In an odd way, I thank the \nSenator from New Mexico for bringing so much attention to the \nDepartment of Energy's need for restructuring because it has given us \nsome time to pause and look at this piece of legislation.\n  As I said, the two most important titles, the ones you will see in \nalmost every intelligence authorization bill, is title I and title II. \nTitle I has five sections. It authorizes appropriations. It give us \nclassified schedule authorization, personnel ceiling adjustment \nauthorization, community management account authorization, and \nemergency supplemental appropriations. That is in the House bill. The \nSenate bill has four titles. It is quite revealing when you go into \ntitle I.\n  Again, normally, if this is a Department of Defense authorization, \neach one of these titles would provide the detailed and specific number \nof how much is being spent, all the way down to the very small \nindividual accounts that would be disclosed to the public. There would \nbe a great debate going on. The committee report comes out. The budget \ncomes out. The bill is reported by the Armed Services Committee. \nEditorials are written. Journalists and specialists say we are spending \ntoo little; we are spending too much; we need to build this weapons \nsystem, and so forth. A great public debate then ensues when the \ncommittee brings the bill up and reports it out for full consideration \nby the Senate.\n  I think that debate is healthy. The public participates and helps us \ndecide what it is we ought not be doing. Sometimes we still put things \nin we shouldn't and some things we should. We still make mistakes. That \npublic debate helps us.\n  Under this authorization, what you see in section 101 is the \nfollowing: The funds are hereby authorized to be appropriated for \nfiscal year 2000 for the conduct of intelligence and intelligence-\nrelated activities of the following elements of the U.S. Government: \nthe CIA, the Department of Defense, the Defense Intelligence Agency, \nthe National Security Agency, the Department of the Army, the \nDepartment of the Navy, the Department of Air Force, the Department of \nState, the Department of Treasury, the Department of Energy, the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, the National Conference Office, and \nthe National Imagery and Mapping Agency--11 different Government \nagencies are named but no dollar figure is included. The only dollar \nfigure in this entire budget comes in section 104 where the public \nlearns we are authorizing $171 million to be appropriated for the \nCommunity Management Act of the Director of Central Intelligence. We \nhave that piece of information.\n\n  Later in the bill that we will be voting on, we learn $27 million is \navailable for the National Drug Intelligence Center. Then later, a \nthird time we get another number. We learn $209.1 million is authorized \nto be appropriated to the Central Intelligence Agency's retirement and \ndisability fund for fiscal year 2000.\n  That is all the public learns. That is all the public knows. The \npublic does not know how much we spend in each one of these agencies, \nnor how much the committee is recommending in this authorization bill, \nnor the total amount of dollars being spent.\n  We have had debates about this before. There are good arguments \nusually filed against it: This is going to deteriorate our national \nsecurity; we need to maintain, in short, a secret in order to preserve \nnational security.\n  I have reached the opposite conclusion, that this is a situation \nwhere the preservation of a secret deteriorates our national security \nas a consequence, first of all, of not having a public debate about \nwhether this is the right allocation but, most importantly, as a\n\n[[Page S8791]]\n\nconsequence of deteriorating citizens' confidence that we are \nauthorizing and appropriating the correct amount.\n  In short, keeping this secret from the American people has caused \ndifficulty in retaining their consensus that we ought to be spending an \namount of money they do not know in order to collect, analyze, produce, \nand disseminate intelligence. I think that is a problem for us.\n  Again, I have not done any polling on this, so I don't know. I \ntypically don't poll before I make a decision, to the consternation of \nmy staff and supporters. But my guess is, just from anecdotes, there is \na deterioration of confidence.\n  It bothers me because my term on the Intelligence Committee--thanks \nto the original appointment by our former Democratic leader, George \nMitchell, from the great State of Maine, and also Leader Daschle's \nconfidence in retaining me on this committee--over time my confidence \nhas increased.\n  Indeed, the argument in my opening statement about this bill is that \nwe have drawn down intelligence investments in the 1990s as we have \ndrawn down our military from roughly 2 million men and women under \nactive duty uniform to 1.35 million. We have also drawn down our \nintelligence efforts to a point where I don't believe we can do all of \nthe things that need to be done either today or in the future.\n  As I said, I have to collect intelligence. I have to analyze the \ninformation. I have skilled people who can analyze it. These images \ndelivered from space very often mean nothing to me when I look at them. \nIt requires somebody who is not only skilled but can process it in a \nhurry and can make something of it in a hurry.\n  In the situation with India, where we had difficulty warning the \nPresident that a test might occur, again, according to published \naccounts, the Indians were aware that we, first, were able to identify \na year earlier they were about to test, and we warned them not to test, \nas a result of overhead imaging. And they took evasive measures in the \nfuture.\n  These are very difficult things to tell. You have to hire skilled \npeople to do it. That is the analysis. The next piece is the \nproduction. It is getting very exciting but also very complicated. \nThere is a lot of competition with the private sector to do this \nproduction work.\n  Back in the ice age when I was on the U.S. Navy SEAL team, we were \ngiven a map if we were going to do an operation in an area in Vietnam. \nWe would look at a map and say: This is the area we will operate in. \nThe map might be 10 years old. Then we would supplement that with human \nintelligence. Somebody would say: There are some changes here that \naren't quite the same as the map.\n  Today an image is used. It is enhanced. It is remarkable how quickly \nwe can deliver very accurate pictures of theaters of operation to the \nwarfighter to disseminate differently, produced in a much different \nway, and enable that warfighter to have a competitive edge on the \nbattlefield.\n  Indeed, anybody who is thinking about becoming an enemy of the United \nStates of America knows we have tremendous capability on the \nintelligence side. We get warnings, and those warnings are delivered \nwhen threats begin to build. Oftentimes a mere warning enables the \nheading off of a potential threat that could have erupted into a \nserious conflict and would have resulted in a loss of lives.\n  The effort to collect, analyze, produce, and disseminate to the right \nperson at the right time, and to make a decision, is not only \ncomplicated, but it is also quite expensive. It is not done \naccidentally.\n  I hope this year is a watershed year and we are able to authorize \nadditional resources for our intelligence agencies. If we don't, at \nsome point we will have a Director of Central Intelligence in the \nfuture deliver the bad news to Congress that there is something we want \nto do but we can't because we cannot accomplish the mission we want to \naccomplish--not just because of resources but also because it is \ngetting harder and harder to do things we have in the past taken for \ngranted, such as intercept signals, conversations, or communications of \nsome kind between one bad person and another bad person with hostile \nintent against the United States.\n  Increasingly, we are seeing a shift in two big ways away from nation \nstates. In the old days, we could pass sanctions legislation or do \nsomething against a government that was doing something we didn't like. \nWhat do we do if Osama bin Laden starts killing Americans or \nnarcoterrorists or cyberterrorists say they hate the United States of \nAmerica and are going to take action against us? It is very difficult--\nindeed, it is impossible--for diplomacy to reduce that threat. We need \nto intercept and try to prevent it and, very often, try to prevent it \nwith a forceful intervention.\n  Not only is it shifting away from the nation state, making it harder \nboth to collect and to do the other work--the analysis, the processing \nand dissemination, or production of dissemination--the signals are \nbecoming more complex and difficult to process, and they are becoming \nmore and more encrypted.\n  I have had conversations with the private sector, people in the \nsoftware business, who say we have to change this export regimen that \nmakes it difficult for these companies to sell encryption overseas. \nThis administration has made tremendous accommodation within the \nindustry to try to accommodate their need to sell to companies that are \ndoing business all over the world.\n  Don't doubt there is a national security issue here. There is \nsignificant interception, both on the national security side and the \nlaw enforcement side. That encryption at 128 bits or higher is actually \ndeployed. We will find our people in the intelligence side coming back \nand saying: Look, I know something bad happened, and do you want to \nknow why I didn't know? I will tell you why I didn't know. I couldn't \nmake sense of the signal. We intercept, and all we get is a buzz and \nbackground noise. We cannot interpret it. We can't convert it.\n\n  In the old days, we converted with a linguist or some other \ntechnological application. In the new world, we are being increasingly \ndenied access to the signals. As described by the technical advisory \ngroup that was established on the Intelligence Committee, it was \ndescribed as number of needles in the haystack but the haystack is \ngetting larger and larger and harder, as a result, for the intelligence \npeople to do the work they need to do.\n  The chairman is moving to the floor. I know he will make a brilliant \nand articulate statement.\n  Earlier, the Senator from New Mexico offered a statement on his \namendment that he hopes to offer tomorrow. Senator Levin was here as \nwell. I believe there is reason to be encouraged that we will move this \nbill quickly tomorrow, and reasonably encouraged, as well, that the \ndifferences which still exist on this bill can be resolved, and we can \nget a big bipartisan vote and move this on to conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I have been listening in my office, \nbefore I came to the floor, to Senator Kerrey's comments. While we \ndon't agree on everything, we agree on most things working on the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  I want to say this about the distinguished Senator from Nebraska who \nis the vice chairman of the committee. We have tried to work together \non very tough issues in the Intelligence Committee and tried to bring \nthem to the floor of the Senate together--not separately. I think it \nsays a lot when we can do this. I certainly have a lot of respect for \nthe Senator from Nebraska and enjoy working with him. One thing about \nhim, he is candid, and that goes a long way on anything.\n  I think we have to devote our time and our effort in the Intelligence \nCommittee and in the Senate to what works, what works best on basic \nintelligence gathering, as well as counterintelligence, where there is \na shortfall.\n  In that spirit, Madam President, I rise in support of the motion to \nproceed to consideration of H.R. 1555, the Intelligence Authorization \nAct of Fiscal Year 2000.\n  As chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I am \ndeeply disappointed that certain Members of the minority have decided \nto oppose this motion. I hope it will be short lived. The intelligence \nbill, I believe, is\n\n[[Page S8792]]\n\na balanced, thoroughly bipartisan piece of legislation that is critical \nto our national security.\n  Some Senators are objecting to the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment \nto restructure the Department of Energy, not the underlying bill. I am \na cosponsor of that amendment, as is the distinguished vice chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee, Senator Kerrey.\n  Basically, this is essentially the same proposal that prompted a \nfilibuster threat when it first was offered to the Defense \nauthorization bill back before the Memorial Day recess. At that time, \nthe argument was, ``it's too soon, it's premature, there haven't been \nany hearings yet.''\n  Whatever the merit of those arguments at the time, I believe, they \nare wholly without merit today. The Intelligence Committee has held two \nopen hearings on the Kyl amendment and DOE security and \ncounterintelligence issues, including a joint hearing with the Energy, \nArmed Services, and Government Affairs Committees that more than 60 \nSenators had the opportunity to attend. The Intelligence Committee also \nheld a detailed, closed briefing on the report of the President's \nForeign Intelligence Advisory Board, also known as the Rudman report.\n  We heard testimony from Secretary of Energy Richardson twice, from \nSenator Rudman twice, and from the sponsors of this amendment.\n  I also should point out that, long before the current controversy, \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee, on a bipartisan basis, identified \nproblems in DOE's counterintelligence program and took steps to address \nthose weaknesses. Most importantly, it sought to energize the \nDepartment of Energy to allocate the necessary resources, and take the \nnecessary steps, to eliminate these vulnerabilities.\n  Since the Kyl et al amendment was first offered, the sponsors have \nnegotiated extensively, and in good faith, with the Department of \nEnergy in order to address the concerns that Secretary Richardson has \nexpressed, without changing the underlying thrust of the amendment, \nwhich is to create a semiautonomous agency for nuclear security within \nthe Department of Energy.\n  Last month, the need for action was dramatically reinforced by the \npublication of the Rudman report, entitled ``Science at its Best; \nSecurity at its Worst: A Report on Security Problems at the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy''--a report on security problems at the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy.\n  I commend former Senator Rudman and also Dr. Drell, and others, who \nwere so involved in this work.\n  The Rudman report found among other things, that:\n\n       At the birth of DOE, the brilliant scientific breakthroughs \n     of the nuclear weapons laboratories came with a troubling \n     record of security administration. Twenty years later, \n     virtually every one of its original problems persists. . . . \n     Multiple chains of command and standards of performance \n     negated accountability, resulting in pervasive inefficiency, \n     confusion, and mistrust. . . .\n       In response to these problems, the Department has been the \n     subject of a nearly unbroken history of dire warnings and \n     attempted but aborted reforms.\n\n  Building on the conclusions of the 1997 Institute for Defense \nAnalyses report and the 1999 Chiles Commission, the Rudman panel \nconcluded that:\n\n       The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy \n     that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself. . . .  \n     Reorganization is clearly warranted to resolve the many \n     specific problems . . . in the weapons laboratories, but also \n     to address the lack of accountability that has become endemic \n     throughout the entire Department.\n       The panel is convinced that real and lasting security and \n     counterintelligence reform at the weapons labs is simply \n     unworkable within DOE's current structure and culture. . . . \n     To achieve the kind of protection that these sensitive labs \n     must have, they and their functions must have their own \n     autonomous operational structure free of all the other \n     obligations imposed by DOE management.\n\n  To provide ``deep and lasting structural change that will give the \nweapons laboratories the accountability, clear lines of authority, and \npriority they deserve,'' the Rudman report endorsed two possible \nsolutions:\n  One was the creation of a wholly independent agency, such as NASA, to \nperform weapons research and nuclear stockpile management functions; or \ntwo, placing weapons research and nuclear stockpile management \nfunctions in a ``new semiautonomous agency within DOE that has a clear \nmission, streamlined bureaucracy, and drastically simplified lines of \nauthority and accountability.''\n  The latter option, or the second approach, is the one contained in \nthe Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski; amendment. Examples of organizations of \nthis type are the National Security Agency and the Defense Advanced \nResearch Projects Agency, DARPA, within the Defense Department.\n  The new semi-autonomous agency, the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, \nwould be a single agency, within the DOE, with responsibility for all \nactivities of our nuclear weapons complex, including the National \nLaboratories--nuclear weapons, nonproliferation, and disposition of \nfissle materials.\n  This agency will be led by an Under Secretary. The Under Secretary \nwill be in charge of, and responsible for, all aspects of the agency's \nwork, who will report--and this is very important--who will report \ndirectly and solely to the Secretary of Energy, and who will be subject \nto the supervision and direction of the Secretary of Energy. The \nSecretary of Energy will have full authority over all activities of \nthis agency. Thus, for the first time--yes, Madam President the first \ntime--this critical function of our national Government will have the \nclear chain of command that it requires.\n  As recommended by the Rudman report, the new agency will have its own \nsenior officials responsible for counterintelligence and security \nmatters within the agency. These officials will carry out the \ncounterintelligence and security policies established by the Secretary \nand will report to the Under Secretary and have direct access to the \nSecretary. It is very important that this happen. The agency will have \na senior official responsible for the analysis and assessment of \nintelligence within the agency who will also report to the Under \nSecretary and have direct access to the Secretary.\n  The Rudman report concluded that purely administrative \nreorganizational changes are inadequate to the challenge at hand: They \nsay: ``To ensure its long-term success, this new agency must be \nestablished by statute.''\n  For if the history of attempts to reform DOE underscores one thing, \nit is the ability of the DOE and the labs to hunker down and outwait \nand outlast Secretaries and other would-be agents of change--yes, even \nPresidents.\n  For example, as documented by Senator Rudman and his colleagues, \n``even after President Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive \n61 ordering that the Department make fundamental changes in security \nprocedures, compliance by Department bureaucrats was grudging and \nbelated.''\n  At the same time, we in the Senate should recognize that our work \nwill not be done even after this amendment is adopted and enacted into \nlaw. As the Rudman report warned, ``DOE cannot be fixed by a single \nlegislative act: management must follows mandate. . . . Thus, both \nCongress and the Executive branch . . . should be prepared to monitor \nthe progress of the Department's reforms for years to come.''\n  It is an indication of how badly the Department of Energy is broken \nthat it took over 100 studies of counterintelligence, security, and \nmanagement practices--by the FBI and other intelligence agencies, the \nGAO, the DOE itself, and others, plus one enormous espionage scandal--\nto create the impetus for change.\n  I am encouraged by what appears to be some progress toward getting to \nthis bill. I think we all are seeking--and I hope we are--the same \nthing: A better and more secure Department of Energy. This nation must \nhave no less.\n  I ask my colleagues: please, do not let the Senate become the lastes \nobstacle to reform at the Department of Energy.\n  Stop the delay. Vote for cloture tomorrow morning, and let's get on \nwith the business of the people and make our labs safe for our future \nand our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise in support of the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski-\nKerrey\n\n[[Page S8793]]\n\namendment. I will first identify the need for the amendment.\n  What we found in this issue concerning the Department of Energy is \nlack of accountability. What this amendment will do, in a nutshell, is \nto create a single agency in the Department of Energy, an Agency for \nNuclear Stewardship, that will undertake all activities of our nuclear \nweapons laboratories programs, including the nuclear weapons \nlaboratories themselves. It puts one person in charge, and that will be \nthe Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship. That is the person in \ncharge of and responsible for all aspects of the new Agency for Nuclear \nStewardship. It creates a clear chain of command, a new Under Secretary \nfor Nuclear Stewardship solely and directly reporting to the Secretary \nof Energy.\n  Why do we need this? I believe all my colleagues will agree that the \nDepartment of Energy, as far as its security arrangements are \nconcerned, is badly broken. To suggest that we should take time to \nevaluate at greater length when we have in the report of the \ninvestigative panel, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory \nBoard--a report which I have before me entitled ``Science At Its Best, \nSecurity At Its Worst.''\n  I am very proud of the role of the laboratories as far as science is \nconcerned, but what we have is a severe breach of our national \nsecurity.\n  In summary, the amendment would create a new agency within the \nDepartment of Energy called the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship.\n  The Agency for Nuclear Stewardship would be semiautonomous because it \nwould be responsible for all of its activities. It provides that the \nSecretary of Energy shall be responsible for all policies of the \nagency; that the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, headed by the Under \nSecretary for Nuclear Stewardship, would be just that, responsible, \nagain, to the Secretary of Energy. The Under Secretary for Nuclear \nStewardship shall report solely and directly to the Secretary; and that \nindividual shall be subject to the supervision and direction of the \nSecretary.\n  Make no mistake about it, the chain of command is to the Secretary of \nEnergy. The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship will have authority \nover all programs at the Department of Energy related to nuclear \nweapons, nonproliferation, and fissile material disposition.\n  The agency's semiautonomy, as recommended by the Rudman report, is \ncreated by making all employees of the agency accountable to the \nSecretary and Under Secretary of Energy but not to other officials of \nthe Department of Energy outside the agency.\n  Specifically, the language reads:\n\n       All personnel of the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, in \n     carrying out any function of the agency, shall be responsible \n     to and subject to the supervision and direction of the \n     Secretary and the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship, or \n     his designee within the agency, and shall not be responsible \n     to or subject to the supervision or direction of any other \n     officer, employee or agent of any other part of the \n     Department of Energy.\n\n  The Secretary, however, may direct other officials, other departments \nwho are not within the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, to review the \nagency's programs and to make recommendations to the Secretary \nregarding the administration of such programs, including consistency \nwith other similar programs and activities in the Department.\n  The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship will have three deputy \ndirectors who will manage programs in the following areas:\n  First, Defense programs; that is, the lab directors and the heads of \nthe production and test sites will report directly to this person; \nsecond, the nonproliferation and fissile materials disposition; and \nthird, the naval reactors.\n  The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship will appoint chiefs of--\nand they are as follows--first, counterintelligence--this must be a \nsenior FBI executive whose selection must be approved by the Secretary \nof Energy and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation--\nsecond, is security; and third is intelligence.\n  These three chiefs shall report to the Under Secretary and shall \nhave, statutorily provided, direct access to the Secretary and all \nother officials of the Department and its contractors concerning these \nmatters. It requires the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship to \nreport annually to the Congress regarding the status and effectiveness \nof security and counterintelligence programs at the nuclear weapons \nfacilities and laboratories, the adequacy of the Department of Energy \nprocedures and policy for protecting national security information, and \nwhether each DOE National Laboratory and nuclear weapons production \ntest site is in full compliance with all departmental security \nrequirements, and, if not, what measures are being taken to bring the \nlab into compliance--security violators at the nuclear weapons \nfacilities and laboratories, foreign visitors at the nuclear weapons \nfacilities and laboratories.\n  In other words, what we have is a complete listing of requirements \nfor the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship to report annually to \nthe Congress. So not only will he report to the Secretary but he will \nreport to the Congress.\n  It requires the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship to keep the \nSecretary and the Congress fully and currently informed regarding \nlosses of national security information and requires every employee of \nthe Department of Energy, the National Laboratories, or associated \ncontractors to alert the Under Secretary whenever they believe there is \na threat to or a loss of national security information.\n\n  In order to address concerns that Department of Energy officials were \nblocked from notifying Congress of security and counterintelligence \nbreaches, the amendment contains a provision stating that the Under \nSecretary shall not be required to obtain the approval of any DOE \nofficial except the Secretary before delivering these reports to the \nCongress and, likewise, prohibits any other Department or agency from \ninterfering.\n  As we look over the history of the debacle associated with the breach \nof our national security regarding the laboratories, clearly, we have \ncase after case, as we look to the former Secretaries, where there was \na lack of an effective transfer of information, transfer of security \nmatters, and just the transfer of everyday activities associated with \nresponsibility and accountability. The system failed.\n  The system failed because various people did not have access to the \nSecretary who were in charge of responsible security areas that \nmandated that they have such access in order to complete the \ncommunication within the chain of command.\n  As a consequence, I support this amendment. We need this amendment to \nprotect the national security. We need it to keep our nuclear weapons \nsecrets from falling into the wrong hands. We have already suffered a \nmajor loss of our nuclear weapons secrets.\n  According to the House Select Committee, the Cox report, the Chinese \nhave stolen design information on all of the United States' most \nadvanced nuclear weapons. This is simply unacceptable.\n  The question we now face is: Will we lose more national security \ninformation if we do not take action? The answer is: Certainly that we \nstand greater exposure. The problem is the management of the Department \nof Energy. The problem is lack of accountability and lack of \nresponsibility.\n  Let me quote from the report of the President's Foreign Intelligence \nAdvisory Board, the Rudman report. Again, I refer to this report, \n``Science at its Best, Security at its Worst.''\n\n       Organizational disarray, managerial neglect, and a culture \n     of arrogance--both at DOE headquarters and the labs \n     themselves--conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting \n     to happen.\n\n  This is in the report itself.\n  Further:\n\n       The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy \n     that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself.\n\n  Right out of this report.\n  I quote further:\n\n       Accountability at the Department of Energy has been spread \n     so thinly and erratically that it is now almost impossible to \n     find.\n\n  Right out of the report.\n  Further:\n\n       Never have the members of the Special Investigative Panel \n     witnessed a bureaucratic culture so thoroughly saturated with \n     cynicism and disregard for authority.\n\n  Further quote:\n\n\n[[Page S8794]]\n\n\n       Never before has this panel found such a cavalier attitude \n     toward one of the most serious responsibilities in the \n     federal government--control of the design information \n     relating to nuclear weapons.\n\n  Further:\n\n       Never before has the panel found an agency with the \n     bureaucratic insolence to dispute, delay, and resist \n     implementation of a Presidential directive on security.\n\n  If that isn't evidence enough that the security is at its worst, I do \nnot know what other points to make. To date, the only DOE people who \nhave been removed from their jobs as a consequence of the question of \nwho is accountable are: Wen Ho Lee, who is alleged to have engaged in \nespionage at Los Alamos, is yet to be even charged with anything--not \neveryone a security violation; a gentleman by the name of Notra \nTrulock, the person who uncovered the alleged espionage and pushed \nperhaps too hard to stop it--which I might add, the Department of \nEnergy felt a little uncomfortable with. He was shuffled off to a \nsideline position in the Department of Energy because he was too \naggressive in bringing this matter to light. A gentleman by the name of \nVic Reis, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Energy for Defense \nPrograms, has, I understand, resigned because he disagrees with the \nofficials down there and happens to support the pending amendment, the \nKyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment.\n\n  Not a single high-level bureaucrat at the Department of Energy, the \nFBI, or the Justice Department has been removed, demoted, or \ndisciplined over this massive failure. One has to wonder with all the \ntalent associated with these agencies who bears the responsibility for \nfailure in this case?\n  The questions we must answer are certainly clear: How long are we \nwilling to put up with this? Do we want to continue with the status \nquo? Our proposal is pending the cloture vote tomorrow. Those that are \nin opposition--who feel perhaps a bit uncomfortable with this--do they \nhave a proposal to fix it? Clearly, they don't. We want to fix the \nproblem.\n  For reasons that I fail to understand, the administration is very \nreluctant to address this problem with a strong proposal for \nidentifying accountability in the Department of Energy. Unfortunately, \nSecretary Richardson is opposed to our amendment as it stands. When it \ncame up the last time on the defense bill, Secretary Richardson sent \ntwo letters threatening a veto by the President. Why doesn't the \nadministration want to do anything significant to correct this problem? \nThey seem to be willing only to rearrange the deck chairs, so to speak. \nThey seem to be willing to make changes, but only those that ultimately \nresult in the status quo.\n  We want to steer the ship in a different direction so that it won't \nhit another iceberg. This Nation should not have to suffer from another \nmassive loss of our most sensitive nuclear weapons secrets. The \nPresident's own intelligence advisory board agrees with our legislative \nsolution. That is what the Rudman report said.\n  Our amendment is patterned after the Rudman report. Let me again \nquote from this report:\n\n       The panel is convinced that real and lasting security and \n     counterintelligence reform at the weapons labs is simply \n     unworkable within the Department of Energy's current \n     structure and culture. Further, to achieve the kind of \n     protection that these sensitive labs must have, they and \n     their functions must have their own autonomous operational \n     structure, free of all of the other obligations imposed by \n     the Department of Energy management.\n\n  Well, today we have a situation where everybody is pointing the \nfinger at everybody else. No one wants to take the responsibility. No \none wants to be held accountable.\n  Fundamentally, the issue is how to create accountability and \nresponsibility at the Department of Energy. I encourage my colleagues \nto examine our amendment because that is just what it does. It creates \naccountability. It creates responsibility. No longer can we have a \nsituation such as we have seen within the Department, where it is \nimpossible to determine who bears the responsibility for the Wen Ho Lee \nbreach of security. It creates accountability and responsibility by \nestablishing a new Agency for Nuclear Stewardship inside of the \nDepartment of Energy to be headed up by a new Under Secretary of \nEnergy.\n  This new agency is now made responsible for all aspects of our \nnuclear weapons programs, including the previously loosely-managed \nlaboratories. If there is a problem in the future, we will know who to \npoint the finger at, who to hold responsible, a single agency with a \nsingle person heading it and in charge of all aspects of nuclear \nweapons programs. Our amendment also requires the new Under Secretary \nto report to the FBI and Congress all threats to our national security. \nNo longer will we be kept in the dark, having to pretty much depend on \nthe New York Times to find out what is going on.\n\n  The Secretary of Energy is uncomfortable with this reorganization. \nEvidently, his idea is to rely on the same old management team, \neveryone in charge but no one responsible, no clear identifiable \naccountability.\n  In conclusion, let me quote the testimony of Mr. Vic Reis. This came \nup late last week. Mr. Reis is the Assistant Secretary of Energy for \nDefense Programs. He testified before the Energy Committee last week.\n  I might add, Mr. Reis' responsibility in the line of command is that \nthe lab directors report directly to Mr. Reis.\n  Mr. Reis said:\n\n       You may recall at previous hearings, Mr. Chairman, you \n     noticed me in the audience and you asked for my opinion as to \n     who or what was to blame for the security issues at the \n     national laboratories. I responded that I didn't think you \n     would find any one individual but that there were \n     organizational structures of the Department of Energy that \n     were so flawed that security lapses are almost inevitable.\n\n  Now, this is the gentleman to whom heads of the labs report. He says \nthat you can't find any individual to blame. The organizational \nstructure was so flawed that security lapses were inevitable.\n  Then Mr. Reis went on to say:\n\n       The root cause of the difficulties at the Department of \n     Energy is simply that the Department of Energy has too many \n     disparate missions to be managed effectively as a cohesive \n     organization. The price of gasoline, refrigerant standards, \n     Quarks, nuclear cleanup and nuclear weapons just don't come \n     together naturally. Because of all this multi-layered \n     crosscutting, there is no one accountable for the operation \n     of any part of the organization except the Secretary, and no \n     Secretary has the time to lead the whole thing effectively. \n     By setting up a semi-autonomous agency, many of these \n     problems will go away.\n\n  Madam President, in short, if you want espionage to continue at the \nlaboratories and maintain the environment where it can occur, then \nstick with the present system. But if you, like me, want to stop this \natmosphere where espionage can flourish, I think you should vote for \nthe motion and invoke cloture for the amendment.\n  What we have here is a situation where I think it is appropriate that \nwe identify where the differences are between the Secretary, Senator \nKyl, Senator Domenici, Senator Kerrey, and Senator Murkowski and in our \namendment. What we do is we create a single semiautonomous agency, as I \nhave indicated, that reports directly to the Secretary of Energy. The \nnew Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship will be responsible for \nboth setting policy and implementation of policy, subject to the \noverall supervision and direct control of the Secretary of Energy.\n  I want to make that clear: Subject to the overall supervision and \ndirect control of the Secretary of Energy.\n  Evidently, that is not what the Secretary wants. The Secretary is \nwilling to allow the new Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship to \nimplement policy but not set policy. There is a big difference, \nimplementing and setting. More significantly, the Secretary wants to \nallow any part of the Department of Energy to set the policies that the \nnew Under Secretary would have to follow. So somebody else is setting \nit.\n  The Secretary's proposal would violate our fundamental concept; that \nis, clear and identifiable lines of authority and responsibility--in \nother words, a direct chain of command. We have been discussing our \ndifferences, but so far we seem to be unable to resolve them.\n  There is one other thing I will mention that was said the other day \nthat relates to this matter under discussion. Two current nuclear \nweapons lab directors and one former lab director said at a hearing \nthat while they could report their problems and issues to Mr. Reis,\n\n[[Page S8795]]\n\nwho is their supervisor, that Mr. Reis has no clear line of authority \nto pass those up through the chain of command to the Secretary.\n  So here we have it. This substantiates the justification for our \namendment. Here is the gentleman who is responsible to have the input \nfrom the lab directors report to him, the three labs, Livermore, \nSandia, Los Alamos.\n  But the gentleman in charge, Mr. Reis, under the current structure \nand chain of command within the Department of Energy, has no clear line \nof authority to pass those recommendations, those matters, up through \nthe chain of command to the Secretary. So here you have the person that \nis responsible to get the information from the lab directors, but there \nis no provision, no requirement, no line of command up to the Secretary \nso that policy matters can be addressed. That one observation with \nthese three lab directors illustrates the problem we are trying to fix \nwith this legislation.\n  As it stands today, there is no chain or lines of authority and \nresponsibility. Right now, everybody is in charge, but nobody is \nresponsible. I guess it is fair to say there are several missing links, \nif you will, in the DOE chain of command and authority. The purpose of \nthe amendment is to fix that problem.\n  I often think back to military concept and a ship at sea. Someone is \nin charge of the CON--in other words, the ship is under the direction \nof the officer in charge, and he has the CON. There is no question of \nwhere the responsibility sets. If he is relieved, the command of the \nship is taken over and that person accepts the responsibility. In the \nDOE, we don't have those clear lines of authority, and that is the \njustification for the amendment pending before this body today.\n  Is this thing broke to the point where it mandates that the Senate \ntake action? I think it is fair to say that the answer is clearly yes. \nThe ineptness, the bungling, the pure mismanagement at all levels are \nthings that have occurred within this agency. The Department of Energy \nnever took the most basic precautions to guard against the theft of the \nnuclear secrets. The FBI conducted feeble investigations. The \nDepartment of Justice, led by Attorney General Reno, virtually ignored \nrequests for warrants to search Wen Ho Lee's computers. What we have \nhere are the results of one of the worst cases in the history of this \nNation of our national security being jeopardized.\n  I have held about 9 hearings as chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee on these matters, and three important discoveries \nwere made by my committee. First, the Department of Energy and the FBI \nbungled the computer waiver issue. I have a chart here. The lab \ndirectors, the attorneys, and directors of counterintelligence all \nagree that the DOE had the authority to search Lee's computer because \nhe signed a waiver. Well, this is the waiver. This is a copy of the \nwaiver that actually Wen Ho Lee signed, dated April 19, 1995:\n\n       Warning: To protect the LAN system from unauthorized use \n     and to ensure that the systems are functioning properly, \n     activities on these systems are monitored and recorded and \n     subject to audit. Use of these systems is expressed consent \n     to such monitoring and recording. Any unauthorized access or \n     use of this LAN is prohibited and could be subject to \n     criminal and civil penalties.\n\n  Here is the part Wen Ho Lee signed:\n\n       I understand and agree to follow these rules in my use of \n     the ENCHANTED LAN. I assume full responsibility for the \n     security of my workstation. I understand that violations may \n     be reported to my supervisor or FSS-14, that I may be denied \n     access to the LAN, and that I may receive a security \n     infraction for a violation of these rules.\n\n  Now, the issue here is that the FBI claimed that the Department of \nEnergy told him there was no waiver; no such waiver existed. The FBI \nwrongly assumed, then, that they needed a warrant to search. What is \nthe result of this inept communication? Well, Lee's computer could have \nbeen searched, but instead was not searched for some three years. When \nthe computer was finally searched, they discovered evidence that Wen Ho \nLee had downloaded legacy codes to an unclassified computer.\n  The fundamental problem is that nobody was looking at the big \npicture. Surely, protecting nuclear secrets and national security \noutweighs the feeble attempts that were made to get a \npossible conviction.\n\n  What we have here is, one, the Department of Energy did not know that \nWen Ho Lee had signed a waiver. They could not find it in his personnel \nfile because the file had been mislaid. Had they known that, as I \nindicated earlier, they could have monitored his computer. Instead, the \nFBI said, no, they were doing an investigation, and since they didn't \nhave a waiver, his computer was not monitored by the Department of \nEnergy. Yet, they found later that the waiver existed, as evidenced by \nthe poster I just showed in evidence.\n  The FBI and the Department of Justice next bungled the \ncounterintelligence warrant or the FISA, as evidenced by chart 2. The \nFBI, not once or twice, but three times requested warrants from the \nDOE. This is chart 2. This is the FISA report. Department of Energy, \nFBI, Department of Justice, and the FISA warrant, approved or rejected. \nNotra Trulock briefs the FBI. An FBI request was made by John Lewis, \nthen assistant director of the FBI National Security Division. An FBI \nrequest was made to Gerald Schroeder, Acting Director, Office of \nIntelligence Policy and Review. It was rejected. Here is the rejection. \nHere is the sequence of events. The first time we had the sequence of \nthe DOE, FBI, and Department of Justice proceeding to authorize the \nFISA warrant to investigate the alleged counterintelligence and \nespionage charges alleged against Wen Ho Lee.\n  The second time, Notra Trulock and others continued to prod FBI's \ninvestigation of Wen Ho Lee. FBI request made to John Lewis, then \nAssistant Director of the FBI National Security Division. FBI request \nmade to Gerald Schroeder. Again, it was rejected. The second time it \nwas rejected by the Department of Justice.\n  Now, then the last time, Mr. Lewis, who is up there in the hierarchy, \nAssistant Director of the FBI, National Security Division, feels so \nfrustrated that he makes a personal plea to Attorney General Janet \nReno. Again, Notra Trulock and others continue to prod the FBI. John \nLewis makes a personal request to the Attorney General because he feels \nso strongly that there is justification to authorize this \ninvestigation. But the personal appeal falls on deaf ears.\n  Why was it rejected? What happened? We don't know. Nothing happened. \nBut we do know that the Attorney General ignored two pleas for help. \nNotra Trulock, then DOE Director of Intelligence, personally briefed \nJanet Reno in ``great detail'' about the Lee case in August of 1997. \nJohn Lewis, FBI Director of Intelligence, also indicated he personally \npled to Janet Reno to approve the FBI's request for a warrant to search \nLee in August of 1997.\n  Why did Attorney General Janet Reno ignore pleas from two top \nnational security advisers? We don't know. We don't know because there \nis a great reluctance to provide the committees of jurisdiction with \nthat information.\n  I am personally disappointed in the FBI and the Department of \nJustice's refusal to testify publicly. Probably 90 percent of what has \nbeen found in closed sessions is not really classified, in my opinion.\n  What we are looking for here is accountability. We in the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee intend to continue to identify those \npersons whose inaction has led to one of the most potentially \ncatastrophic losses in our national security history. Now we have a \nsituation where they seem to want to hide behind the smokescreen of \n``national security'' or to finger-point and say it is not our \nresponsibility. That is simply an unconscionable set of circumstances.\n  Finally, as we address a couple of other points that may come up in \nthe debate which I think deserve consideration, why create one \nsemiautonomous agency within the Department of Energy? We are creating \na hybrid that has no other identifiable comparison. Let me put that \nmyth to rest. There are other semiautonomous agencies that function \nextremely well. That is what we are proposing with the amendment which \nhas been laid down.\n  Let's look at three of those semiautonomous agencies.\n  DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, is a separate \nagency within the Department of Defense under a director appointed by \nthe Secretary of Defense. It works.\n\n[[Page S8796]]\n\n  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is the \nlargest bureau within the Department of Commerce. It is a \nsemiautonomous agency. It works.\n  NSA, the National Security Agency, was established by Presidential \ndirective as a separate department organized as an agency within the \nDepartment of Defense. It was structured in that manner and form \nbecause it was necessary that there be accountability and \nresponsibility within the National Security Agency. It is a \nsemiautonomous agency.\n  I encourage my colleagues as we proceed to vote tomorrow--my \nunderstanding is that we are going to have one hour of debate equally \ndivided on the cloture motion on the amendment--to recognize that the \ntime to address this is now, that the responsibility clearly is within \nthis body, and that the amendment we offered identifies the one thing \nthat was lacking as we look at how this set of security breaches could \nhave occurred, and that is, it addresses accountability and \nresponsibility.\n  For those who feel uncomfortable, I encourage them to recognize that \nthey have a responsibility of coming up with something that will work. \nWe think that the amendment pending, the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski-Kerrey \namendment--I understand that Senators Thompson, Specter, Gregg, \nHutchinson, Shelby, Warner, Bunning, Helms, Fitzgerald, Lott, Kerry, \nFeinstein, and Bob Smith are a few of the other Members of the Senate \nwho are cosponsoring this amendment.\n  It is a responsible amendment. Let's get on with the job. Let's put \nthis issue in the restructured form that provides for accountability \nand responsibility, and move on. The American people and the taxpayers \ncertainly deserve prompt action by this body. We have that obligation. \nThe time is on the vote tomorrow.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I see no other Senator wishing time. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/19/senate-section/article/S8796-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO COACH DAVEY WHITNEY, ALCORN STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I honor a Mississippian who made \nnumerous contributions to Alcorn State University, to countless young \nstudent athletes and to the community. Coach Davey L. Whitney, Head \nCoach of the Men's Basketball team at Alcorn State University, has \nserved as a leader at this educational institution, a professor of \nchampionship athletics and a mentor for many of his players.\n  Nearly 30 years ago, Coach Whitney first arrived on the Lorman, \nMississippi, campus. From the beginning, Davey's tenure at Alcorn was \ndestined for greatness. Within ten years, the Alcorn State Men's \nBasketball team went from little notoriety to groundbreaking \nachievement. His list of accomplishments is exemplary. His \ndetermination is heroic.\n  He was the first coach to lead an historically black college team to \nwins in both NCAA and NIT tournaments. His teams also won nine \nSouthwestern Athletic Conference titles. In 1979, Alcorn accomplished \nsomething that no previous historically black college had done--winning \na National Invitational Tournament game--when they defeated Mississippi \nState University.\n  Coach Whitney has been a mentor to many young men. Many of his \nplayers have become successful businessmen. Several of his players even \nhad successful professional athletic careers in the National Basketball \nAssociation. Larry Smith, who was drafted by the Golden State Warriors, \nis now an assistant coach with the Houston Rockets. He is reproducing \nCoach Whitney's approach of discipline coupled with a warm personal \ndevotion for the players.\n  Coach Whitney's career has not been one without trials. In 1989 he \nwas fired after losing three successive seasons. Still Coach Whitney \nstayed involved in basketball by coaching in the Continental Basketball \nAssociation and the United States Basketball League.\n  Coach Whitney also remained close to Alcorn State for the next eight \nyears, while the Braves struggled and in 1997 Alcorn asked him to \nreturn. After much thought, Coach Whitney returned to the Alcorn State \nUniversity Family as head coach. Within two years, he took the \nstruggling Braves to the 1999 Southwestern Athletic Conference Regular \nSeason Championship where they not only won, they triumphed. This \ntournament championship earned the Braves a berth in the NCAA \nTournament. This marked the first time since the 1986 season that the \nBraves have won the Southwestern Athletic Conference regular season \ntitle. This was also the first time since 1984 that the Braves have won \nthe tournament title and appeared in the NCAA tournament.\n  Coach Whitney's 442 wins in 28 years--with 10 regular season titles, \nfour consecutive titles between 1978-82, twelve post season tourneys \nand five NAIA district titles--earned him nine Southwestern Athletic \nConference Coach of the Year honors. It is a fitting tribute to Coach \nWhitney's accomplishments that he coaches in the complex named after \nhim. Various groups have recognized Coach Whitney for his renowned \nsuccess. USA Today's Reporter Jack Carey wrote, ``At Alcorn State Coach \nDavey Whitney is proving not only that you can go home again, but you \nalso can be darned successful once you get there.'' Whitney is surely a \nman worthy of recognition.\n  Coach Whitney is not only a successful coach but an accomplished \nfamily man. He and his wife of more than 40 years have reared a fine \nfamily of four daughters and one son, all of whom attended Alcorn State \nUniversity. He is a member of the National Association of Coaches, the \nMississippi Association of Coaches, the National Black Association of \nCoaches, and Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., just to name a few.\n  Mr. President, it is a great honor to pay tribute to Coach Davey L. \nWhitney for his athletic accomplishments and his dedication to the \nstudents of Alcorn State University. His efforts are both uplifting and \nencouraging. I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Davey Whitney \nmany more years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/19/senate-section/article/S8796-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8796-S8797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

The budget \nlevels have also been revised to include adjustments made on May 19, \n1999, to reflect the amounts provided and designated as emergency \nrequirements. The estimates show that current level spending is above \nthe budget resolution by $0.4 billion in budget authority and above the \nbudget resolution $0.2 billion in outlays. Current level is $0.2 \nbillion above the revenue floor in 1999. The current estimate of the \ndeficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $56.1 \nbillion, $0.1 billion above the maximum deficit amount of 1999 of $56.0 \nbillion.\n  Since my last report, dated June 21, 1999, the Congress has taken no \naction that changed the current level of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a letter accompanying the report and \nthe budget scorekeeping report printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter and report were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 1999.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I would like to speak for just few minutes \ntoday in support of President Clinton's Executive Order of June 3, \n1999, which ordered the Federal Government to undertake a comprehensive \nprogram to save energy, save money and cut pollution.\n  The Federal Government is the nation's largest consumer of energy, \npurchasing energy to light, heat and cool more than 500,000 buildings \nand power millions of vehicles. Each year the Federal Government \npurchases more than $200 billion worth of products, including enormous \nquantities of energy-intensive goods. Current efficiency programs \nalready save more than $1 billion a year according to an estimate in \nthe Wall Street Journal of July 15, 1999. In addition, the government's \nvast purchases give it significant market influence to impact the \ndevelopment, manufacture and use of clean energy technologies.\n  This Executive Order sets worthwhile--and unfortunately too long \noverlooked--goals, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, \nenergy efficiency improvements, increased use of renewable energy, \nreduced use of petroleum, water conservation and changes in how we \nmeasure energy use. I believe these goals have tremendous merit and \nwill deliver the ``win-win'' results of sound environmental and energy \npolicy, because each goal stresses reduced pollution and reduced costs.\n  To achieve these goals, the Order sets in place several new \nadministrative policies for organization and accountability. To begin, \neach agency will designate a single officer to oversee implementation. \nAgencies will submit a budget request to the Office of Management and \nBudget for investments that will reduce energy use, pollution and life-\ncycle costs, and they will track and report progress. The Order applies \nto all Federal departments and agencies, with an appropriate exception \nfor the Department of Defense when compliance may hinder military \noperations and training.\n  Federal agencies will be able to employ a range of Federal programs \nincluding Energy Star, sustainable building design research from the \nDepartment of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency and \nothers. For example, to the extent practicable, agencies will strive to \nachieve the Energy Star standards for energy performance and indoor \nenvironmental quality for all facilities by 2002. Agencies will apply \nsustainable design principles to the siting, design and construction of \nnew facilities--meaning energy use, costs and reduced pollution will be \noptimized across a facility's life. And such measures will extend to \ntransportation, including the use of efficient and renewable-fuel \nvehicles.\n  Finally, the Executive Order endorses the use of ``source energy'' as \na measure of efficiency. Measuring energy consumption by ``source''--as \nopposed to ``site''--means taking into account not only the energy \nconsumed by a light bulb, appliance or other product to perform a \ncertain function, but also the energy consumed in the generation, \ntransmission and distribution of that energy to the product in \nquestion. Research in energy use increasingly shows that a ``source'' \nmeasurement is a more accurate measure of the total costs that we pay \nto operate appliances and other equipment.\n  Mr. President, I add my sincere appreciation to President Clinton for \nexecuting this Order and endorsing its policies. I believe that if this \nExecutive Order is properly implemented, it will pay dividends for the \nenvironment and taxpayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/19/senate-section/article/S8797-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act, a bill that has been \nreported from the Finance Committee and was filed on July 16th. I \nbelieve this bill is critical for American workers, companies and their \ncommunities. The bill as written would extend authorization for trade \nadjustment assistance for two years, and would allow workers and \ncompanies that are negatively impacted by international trade to \nreceive the assistance currently allowed by law. If we do not pass this \nlegislation, trade adjustment assistance will expire this October, and \nworkers and companies that are presently receiving benefits will be \ncompletely cut off from government support. In specific terms, this\n\n[[Page S8798]]\n\nmeans over 340,000 workers across the country, and several thousand \nworkers in my state of New Mexico, will be without support needed to \nmaintain their lives and re-train for the future. These are real people \nand real lives we are talking about, and we simply can't let this \nhappen. We must act now to ensure the programs continue.\n  Let me briefly explain what this legislation is about. In 1962, when \nthe Trade Expansion Act was under consideration, the Kennedy \nAdministration came up with a very straightforward proposition \nconcerning international trade and American workers and companies: if \nand when Americans lose their jobs as a result of trade agreements \nentered into by the U.S. government, then the U.S. government should \nassist these Americans in finding new employment. If you lose a job \nbecause of U.S. trade policy, you should have some help from the \nfederal government in re-training to get a job.\n  I find this a reasonable and fair proposition. It suggests that the \nU.S. government supports a open trading system, but recognizes that it \nis responsible to repair the negative impacts this policy has on its \ncitizens. It suggests that the U.S. government believes that an open \ntrading system provides long-term advantages for the United States and \nits people, but that the short-terms costs must be addressed if the \npolicy is to continue and the United States is to remain competitive. \nIt suggests that there is a collective interest that must be pursued, \nbut that individual interests must be protected for the greater good.\n  This commitment to American workers and companies has continued over \nthe years, and should not be ended now. The reason for continuity is \nobvious: globalization is only moving at a faster pace, with the \npotential for ever more significant impacts on our country. In my \nopinion, the process of globalization is inevitable. It is not going to \nstop. Therefore, the question for us in this chamber is not whether we \ncan stop it, but how we can manage it to benefit the national interest \nof the United States.\n  The picture we see of globalization is that of a double-edged sword, \nwith some individuals and companies gaining and others losing. The \ngains are clear-cut. Exports now generate over one-third of all \neconomic growth in the United States. Export jobs pay ten to fifteen \npercent more than the average wage. Depending upon who you listen to, \nit has generated anywhere from two to eleven million jobs over the last \nten years. For those who dislike globalization, I say look in your \nkitchen, your living room, your driveway, your office, and see the \nproducts that are there as a result of a more open and interdependent \ntrading system. Without expanded trade brought on as a result of \nglobalization we will end up fighting over an ever-decreasing domestic \neconomic pie.\n  But in spite of these obvious benefits we cannot ignore the problems \ninvolved with globalization. Every day we hear disturbing stories about \nwhat this has meant for people across the country. In my state we have \nseen over the last year a large number of lay-offs and closings in \nsmall rural towns that cannot afford to have this happen. The closing \nof three plants in Roswell, Las Cruces, and Albuquerque meant 1,600 \npeople lost their jobs. Next came lay-offs in the copper mines in my \nhome town of Silver City. These people cannot simply go across the \nstreet and look for new work. They are people who have been dedicated \nto their companies and have played by the rules over the years. What \nthey deserve when they lose their job is an opportunity to get income \nsupport and re-training to rebuild their lives. What they deserve is a \nprogram that creates skills that are needed, that moves them into new \njobs faster, that provides opportunities for the future, that keeps \nfamilies and communities intact.\n  TAA offers the potential for this outcome. Although in need of \nrevision in several key areas--and I am focusing on these areas at this \ntime--it has over the years consistently helped individuals and \ncompanies in communities across the United States deal with the \ntransitions that are an inevitable part of a changing international \neconomic system. It helps people that can work and want to work to \ncontinue to work in productive jobs that contribute to the economic \nwelfare of our country. We have made this promise to workers in every \nadministration, both Democrat and Republican, and we should continue to \ndo so. Although TAA is not without its flaws, it remains the only \nprogram that allows workers and companies to adjust and remain \ncompetitive. Without it, in my opinion we are saying unequivocally that \nwe don't care what happens to you, that we bear no responsibility for \nthe position that you are in, that you are on your own.\n  Senators Roth, Moynihan, and others think otherwise, and I agree \nwholeheartedly with them. I believe that this commitment to individuals \nand companies and communities must be kept. I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport the passage of this bill when it comes to a vote on the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/19/senate-section/article/S8798-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8798-S8799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE F-15 AND ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

While both the Senate and the House have taken steps to \nsave the F-15, the Administration has resisted efforts to preserve a \nplan that is critical for our national security.\n  I was heartened by the recent action of the House Appropriations \nCommittee to follow the Senate's lead and provide additional funding \nfor the F-15. Last month, Senator Bond and I successfully added an \namendment to the Defense Appropriations bill to provide $220 million \nfor four F-15s. Last week, the House Appropriations Committee provided \n$440 million to purchase eight F-15 fighters.\n  While securing domestic dollars is essential to keep the F-15 alive, \nforeign sales are just as important for the long-term health of the \nprogram. Hence, my disappointment that the Israeli Government had \nselected the F-16 to fill their latest Air Force needs goes without \nsaying. As Angelo Codevilla writes today in the Wall Street Journal--\nand I will ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks--the F-15 gives Israel critical \nlong-range strike capability to counter regional threats. As one who is \nkeenly interested in the security of Israel, it was my hope that the \nnew Barak Government would select the F-15 to enhance its long-range \ndeterrent capability.\n  Mr. Codevilla also implies that the Administration was pushing Israel \nto buy the F-16, a less capable plane that would not defend Israel as \nwell--particularly against the threat posed by missiles from Iran, \nIraq, and Syria. While Israel must make its own decisions with regard \nto its security, I sincerely hope the Administration was not pushing \nour ally to purchase a less capable plane just so that Syria or Iran \nwould not be offended. Lasting peace in the Middle East will be based \non a sustainable settlement that can be defended through strength, not \nby pushing Israel to take steps which limit its ability to defend \nitself.\n  Mr. President, sustaining the F-15 is essential for U.S. airpower as \nwe enter the 21st century. Preserving the F-15 is also essential to my \nhome state of Missouri. The 7,000 Missourians who build the F-15 are a \nnational security asset. Both houses of Congress have sent clear \nsignals to the Administration that this plane should be saved. It is \ntime for the President to start listening and take steps immediately to \nensure funding for the F-15 is included in the defense budget.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 19, 1999]\n\n           Clinton's Dreams of Peace Ignore Mideast Realities\n\n                        (By Angelo M. Codevilla)\n\n       What exactly does President Clinton expect from Israel's \n     new prime minister, Ehud Barak? At a joint news conference \n     last week, Mr. Clinton declared that he wants Mr. Barak ``to \n     widen the circle of peace to include Syria and Lebanon and to \n     revitalize talks among Israel and the Arab world and to solve \n     regional problems.'' Mr. Barak spoke more cautiously, \n     declaring his commitment to ``change and renewal'' but also \n     his uneasiness at Americans who have acted ``as a kind of \n     policeman, judge and arbitrator at the same time.''\n       Mr. Barak may be indebted to Mr. Clinton for undermining \n     his predecessor, but he also\n\n[[Page S8799]]\n\n     is a serious military man. Israeli officials are sure to \n     spend the aftermath of Mr. Barak's visit sorting out the vast \n     differences between the assumptions of the Clinton game plan \n     and Israel's military realities.\n       The military threat to Israel used to consist of the massed \n     armies of its immediate neighbors. But today's most ominous \n     threat is weapons of mass destruction carried by missiles \n     from Iraq, Iran, Syria and perhaps Libya. Israel's foes \n     believe they could break Israeli military power in the \n     opening minutes of a war by launching ballistic missile \n     strikes with chemical or biological weapons against \n     mobilization centers and weapons-storage areas. These \n     countries have made an enormous investment in new missiles, \n     most stored in deep tunnels, highly fortified bunkers or \n     mobile launchers.\n       Gen. Eitan Ben Eliahu of the Israeli Air Force has \n     estimated that Syria alone already has some 1,000 ballistic \n     missiles, and that within a few years most will have long \n     ranges. Syria does not need long-range missiles to hit \n     Israel, but with longer ranges, each missile fired from Syria \n     would develop enough re-entry speed to negate Israel's \n     budding antimissile system, the Arrow. Already Iran's Shahib \n     3 missiles--developed with Russian, Chinese and North Korean \n     help--stress the Arrow; the forthcoming Shahib 4's will \n     overwhelm it.\n       To keep up with the increasing capability of enemy \n     missiles, Israel's Arrow needs to be connected to the \n     projected U.S. space-based fire-control system. But the \n     Clinton administration doesn't want this system for the U.S., \n     much less for Israel, for fear of violating the 1973 U.S.-\n     Soviet Antiballistic Missile Treaty. To handle the \n     overwhelming number of enemy missiles, Israel would need a \n     U.S. orbital antimissile device. But the administration has \n     delayed tests of a space-based laser that had been set for \n     2001. So Mr. Barak won't get any missile defense out of Mr. \n     Clinton.\n       The Israeli Air Force has some pretty sophisticated plans \n     for the nearly impossible job of striking enemy missiles \n     before they are launched. But these plans require lots of \n     deep-strike F-15 I aircraft. Israel has only 25; it has been \n     negotiating for 15 more. Washington would rather see Israel \n     buy more F-16's, which can't help Israel with its missile \n     problem. The F-16's are less threatening to Syria, which the \n     administration sees as the key to peace.\n       Instead of military help, the Clinton administration will \n     give Mr. Barak generous instructions in its own conception of \n     peace in the Middle East. Yet Mr. Barak will be compelled to \n     note that Mr. Clinton's view of the world clashes with the \n     one that Israel has been developing for some time, regardless \n     of its dealings with the Palestinians.\n       Following the traditional maxim that foreign policy \n     proceeds from the nature of the regime, Israel has sought \n     alliances with Turkey and Jordan, because their regimes are \n     stable, and because their friendship is secured in part by \n     their enmity with Syria. Israel has talked about cooperation \n     on missile defense with both Ankara and Amman, which see \n     themselves as part of the West against Russian-supported \n     forces in the region. Another main reason why Turkey and \n     Jordan are interested in the alliance is Israel's deep-strike \n     capability against Iran and Iraq.\n       Israel has been wary of Egypt, and even more of Saudi \n     Arabia, because although the governments in these countries \n     U.S. allies, instability would vitiate any deal with them. As \n     for Syria, much as Israel would like a deal with it, its \n     enmity is mitigated only by its instability.\n       The Clinton administration is trying to transcend \n     traditional alliances. In the Wilsonian tradition, it seeks a \n     settlement including all and directed against none. It \n     believes that the path to peace includes exchanging military \n     advantages for goodwill, ``guaranteed'' by some sort of \n     international contact group. Thus the Clinton administration \n     would bless the only deal Syria would accept--Israel's \n     surrender of the Golan Heights--and call it peace.\n       Some Israelis would be happy with this, because it would \n     carry the implicit assurance that the U.S. would assume \n     responsibility for Israel's borders. It should be crystal \n     clear, however, that Washington has neither the interest nor \n     the capacity to hold Syria to any deal, much less to fight \n     for Israel.\n       Here then is the choice Mr. Barak must mull on his way \n     home: He can trust the Clinton team and move his country \n     toward a deal with its enemies that violates normal rules of \n     military prudence. Or he can seek the military means of being \n     useful to his Turkish and Jordanian friends while being \n     fearsome to states that are enemies of America and Israel \n     alike.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/19/senate-section/article/S8799-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/19/senate-section/article/S8799-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8799-S8800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH LIBYA--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 48\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I hereby report to the Congress on the developments since my last \nreport of December 30, 1998, concerning the national emergency with \nrespect to Libya that was declared in Executive Order 12543 of January \n7, 1986. This report is submitted pursuant to section 401(c) of the \nNational Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c); section 204(c) of the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c); \nand section 505(c) of the International Security and Development \nCooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9(c).\n  1. On December 30, 1998, I renewed for another year the national \nemergency with respect to Libya pursuant to IEEPA. This renewal \nextended the current comprehensive financial and trade embargo against \nLibya in effect since 1986. Under these sanctions, virtually all trade \nwith Libya is prohibited, and all assets owned or controlled by the \nGovernment of Libya in the United States or in the possession or \ncontrol of U.S. persons are blocked.\n  2. On April 28, 1999, I announced that the United States will exempt \ncommercial sales of agricultural commodities and products, medicine, \nand medical equipment from future unilateral sanctions regimes. In \naddition, my Administration will extend this policy to existing \nsanctions programs by modifying licensing policies for currently \nembargoed countries to permit case-by-case review of specific proposals \nfor commercial sales of these items. Certain restrictions apply.\n  The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the Department of the \nTreasury is currently drafting amendments to the Libyan Sanctions \nRegulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 550 (the Regulations), to implement this \ninitiative. The amended Regulations will provide for the licensing of \nsales of agricultural commodities and products, medicine, and medical \nsupplies to nongovernmental entities in Libya or to government \nprocurement agencies and parastatals not affiliated with the coercive \norgans of that country. The amended Regulations will also provide for \nthe licensing of all transactions necessary and incident to licensed \nsales transactions, such as insurance and shipping arrangements. \nFinancing for the licensed sales transactions will be permitted in the \nmanner described in the amended Regulations.\n  3. During the reporting period, OFAC reviewed numerous applications \nfor licenses to authorize transactions under the Regulations. \nConsistent with OFAC's ongoing scrutiny of banking transactions, the \nlargest category of license approvals (20) involved types of financial \ntransactions that are consistent with U.S. policy. Most of these \nlicenses authorized personal remittances not involving Libya between \npersons who are not blocked parties to flow through Libyan banks \nlocated outside Libya. Three licenses were issued authorizing certain \ntravel-related transactions. One license was issued to a U.S. firm to \nallow it to protect its intellectual property rights in Libya; another \nauthorized receipt of payment for legal services; and a third \nauthorized payments for telecommunications services. A total of 26 \nlicenses were issued during the reporting period.\n  4. During the current 6-month period, OFAC continued to emphasize to \nthe international banking community in the United States the importance \nof identifying and blocking payments made by or on behalf of Libya. The \noffice worked closely with the banks to assure the effectiveness of \ninterdiction software systems used to identify such payments. During \nthe reporting period, 87 transactions potentially involving Libya, \ntotaling nearly $3.4 million, were interdicted.\n\n[[Page S8800]]\n\n  5. Since my last report, OFAC has collected 7 civil monetary \npenalties totaling $38,000 from 2 U.S. financial institutions, 3 \ncompanies, and 2 individuals for violations of the U.S. sanctions \nagainst Libya. The violations involved export transactions relating to \nLibya and dealings in Government of Libya property or property in which \nthe Government of Libya had an interest.\n\n  On April 23, 1999, a foreign national permanent resident in the \nUnited States was sentenced by the Federal District court for the \nMiddle District of Florida to 2 years in prison and 2 years supervised \nrelease for criminal conspiracy to violate economic sanctions against \nLibya, Iran, and Iraq. He had previously been convicted of violation of \nthe Libyan Sanctions Regulations, the Iranian Transactions Regulations, \nthe Iraqi Sanctions Regulations, and the Export Administration \nRegulations for exportation of industrial equipment to the oil, gas, \npetrochemical, water, and power industries of Libya, Iran, and Iraq.\n  Various enforcement actions carried over from previous reporting \nperiods have continued to be aggressively pursued. Numerous \ninvestigations are ongoing and new reports of violations are being \nscrutinized.\n  6. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from January 7 through July 6, 1999, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of the Libyan national emergency are estimated at \napproximately $4.4 million. Personnel costs were largely centered in \nthe Department of the Treasury (particularly in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, the Office of the General Counsel, and the U.S. Customs \nService), the Department of State, and the Department of Commerce.\n  7. In April 1999, Libya surrendered the 2 suspects in the Lockerbie \nbombing for trial before a Scottish court seated in the Netherlands. In \naccordance with UNSCR 748, upon the suspects' transfer, UN sanctions \nwere immediately suspended. We will insist that Libya fulfill the \nremaining UNSCR requirements for lifting UN sanctions and are working \nwith UN Secretary Annan and UN Security Council members to ensure that \nLibya does so promptly. U.S. unilateral sanctions remain in force, and \nI will continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to apply these \nsanctions fully and effectively, as long as they remain appropriate. I \nwill continue to report periodically to the Congress on significant \ndevelopments as required by law.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to help parents and families reduce drug abuse and \ndrug addiction among adolescents, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                         DRUG FREE FAMILIES ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are all aware that drug use has \ndecreased overall in the last 15 years. One of the principal reasons \nfor this is that we were successful in slowing the rate of \nexperimentation and use among our young people. However, drug use is up \ndramatically among the young in the general population. Children as \nyoung as eight and nine are being confronted with the decision of \nwhether or not to try drugs. This raises the possibility of a new \nepidemic of use and addiction. As you know, much is already being done \nto help children make the right decision. Prevention education is \nprovided by various anti-drug groups, but these groups can't be \neffective in their teachings if prevention education does not begin at \nhome. It is vitally important that parents make the time to school \ntheir children on the dangers of drug use and abuse.\n  Throughtout the years, research has been done on whether or not kids \nlisten to their parents. The fact is kids do listen. It is clear that \nparents have influence in the choices their children make. The problem \nis, when it comes to drugs and alcohol, not all parents see a need to \ninfluence their child's decision or are aware of how serious the \nproblem is. Some are ambivalent about their own past use. Some are in \ndenial about what's happening. And why is that? A survey by the \nPartnership for a Drug Free America shows that less than a quarter of \nthe parents questioned even acknowledge the possibility that their \nchild may have tried marijuana. Unfortunately, of those parents \nsurveyed, 44 percent of their children actually did experiment with \nmarijuana. If parents aren't aware of the reality of the situation, how \ncan they prepare the 6 out of every 10 teenagers who are offered drugs \neach year.\n  The problem isn't that the parents don't care. It is that they don't \nknow. Parents underestimate the reality of drugs. As a result, they \nseldom if every talk to their kids about drugs. According to a recent \nPRIDE survey, only 30 percent of students reported that their parents \ntalked to them often or a lot about drugs. This seems unfortunate when \nwe look at evidence that shows drug use 32 percent lower among kids who \nsaid their parents talked with them a lot about drugs. The harsh \nreality is that 94 percent of parents say they talked to their teens \nabout drugs, yet only 67 percent of teens remembered those discussions. \nEven more disturbing is a public opinion poll by the American Medical \nAssociation that illustrates that 43 percent of parents believe \nchildren using drugs is a serious national crisis, yet only 8 percent \nbelieve it is a crisis in their local schools, and 6 percent in their \nlocal communities.\n  Today, on behalf of Senators DeWine, Sessions, and Coverdell, I am \nintroducing legislation that would bridge the gap between parents and \nthe realities of youth drug use and abuse. The Drug Free Families Act \nwould promote prevention education for parents. The goal is to promote \ncooperation among current national parent efforts. The kind of parent \ncollaboration that the Drug Free Families Act proposes would unite \nparents at the national level to work with community anti-drug \ncoalitions in the fight against drugs. It would not only help to \neducate parents, but help them convey a clear, consistent, no-use \nmessage. Through the Drug Free Families Act, we can give parents the \nresources necessary to educate our youth on the dangers of drugs.\n  It is clear that parents need assistance in educating kids on drug \nuse and abuse. Parents, not Government, are the key to addressing the \ndrug problem. We need to help them. I urge my fellow Members to support \nthe Drug Free Families Act.\n  From my own experience in my State of Iowa, holding, as I did in \n1998, more than 30 town meetings on the issue of drugs, one of the \nthings I learned from the young people--junior high and high school \nyoung people who came to my meeting--was, in their own words, a \nstatement on their part of somewhat frustration with their own \nfamilies, that their families were not telling them about the dangers \nof drugs. There was even the suggestion from some young people that \nwhat we need is a parent education project so parents would be better \nat setting boundaries for kids, the necessity of listening to kids, but \nmost importantly on the issue of drugs: As a parent, get the message \nout to young people about the dangers of drugs.\n  I got the feeling very definitely from young people of my State that \nthey knew more about drugs, even more about the dangers of drugs and \nthe availability of those drugs, than their parents do. I think the \nsurveys I have pointed out today to justify the Drug Free Families Act \njustify and back up what the young people of my State of Iowa told me \nin those hearings last year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 1391. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve \nbenefits for Filipino veterans of World War II, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Veteran's Affairs.\n\n\n          filipino veterans' benefits improvements act of 1999\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Filipino \nVeterans' Benefits Improvements Act of 1999. The measure would increase \nthe disability compensation for those Filipino veterans residing in the \nUnited States. These veterans currently receive compensation at the \n``peso-rate'' standard which is 50 percent of what is received by their \nAmerican counterparts. Second, the measure would make all Filipino \nveterans residing in the United States eligible for veterans' health \ncare. Like their American counterparts, these Filipino veterans would \nbe subject to the same eligibility and means test requirements in order \nto qualify for health benefits. Third, the measure would provide \noutpatient care and services to veterans, Commonwealth Army veterans, \nand new Philippine Scouts residing in the Philippines for the treatment \nof service-connected and non-service connected disabilities at the \nManila VA Outpatient Clinic.\n  The measure further restores funding to provide healthcare services \nto American military personnel and all Filipino veterans residing in \nthe Philippines. Many of my colleagues are aware of my advocacy on \nbehalf of Filipino veterans of World War II. Throughout the years, I \nhave sponsored several measures on their behalf to correct an injustice \nand seek equal treatment for their valiant military service. Members of \nthe Philippine Commonwealth Army were called to serve the United States \nForces of the Far East. Under the command of General Douglas MacArthur, \nthey joined our American soldiers in fighting some of the fiercest \nbattles of World War II. Regretfully, the Congress betrayed our \nFilipino allies by enacting the Rescission Act of 1946. The 1946 Act, \nnow codified as 38 U.S.C. 107, deems the military service of Filipino \nveterans as non-active service for purposes of any law of the United \nStates conferring rights, privileges or benefits. The measure I \nintroduce today will not diminish my efforts to correct this injustice. \nAs long as it takes, I will continue to seek equal treatment on behalf \nof the Filipino veterans of World War II.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill text be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1391\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives for the voluntary conservation of endangered species, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                THE SPECIES CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Species \nConservation Tax Act of 1999.\n  The Endangered Species Act sometimes is referred to as our most \nimportant environmental law. However, it also is one of the most \ncontroversial. Over the past decade, a debate has raged about whether, \nand how, the Act should be revised. In 1995, Congress went so far as to \nimpose a complete moratorium on the listing of species (fortunately, \nthe moratorium has since been lifted). Several bills were introduced, \nand given serious consideration, that would have radically weakened the \nlaw.\n  On a more positive note, last Congress, after several years of work, \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee reported a bipartisan bill, \nsupported by the Clinton Administration, that would have made a series \nof modest, common-sense reforms to the Act. Unfortunately, that bill \nwas never considered by the full Senate.\n  There seems, however, to be an agreement on at least one basic point: \nwe should use more incentives to promote the conservation of threatened \nand endangered species, including tax incentives. For example, in 1995, \na group organized by the Keystone Center reported that ``taxes, \nincluding income taxes, estate taxes, and property taxes, affect all \nlandowners and sometimes significantly affect their land use decisions. \nChanges in tax laws, including some that have a relatively small cost \nto the Treasury, could yield important conservation benefits.''\n  Over the years, we have made some progress. The tax code now contains \ntwo significant incentives for conserving land. One is section 170(h), \nwhich allows a charitable contribution deduction for donations of \nconservation easements in order to, among other things, preserve \nwildlife habitat. The other is section 2031(c), which, with the \nleadership of Senator Chafee, was enacted in 1997; it complements \nsection 170(h) with an estate tax incentive to encourage the \nconservation of land for future generations.\n  The bill that I am introducing today builds on these provisions. It \nenhances the section 170(h) and section 2031(c) incentives, and it adds \na new estate tax incentive for land that is managed to protect \nthreatened or endangered species.\n  Let me briefly describe each provision of the bill.\n\n\n  Income Tax Exclusion for Cost Share Payments Under the Partners for \n                            Wildlife Program\n\n  Tax Code section 126 excludes from income payments received pursuant \nto certain agricultural and silvicultural conservation programs; it \nspecifically excludes payments received pursuant to eight specific \nprograms, then provides two general exclusions, one for payments \nreceived pursuant to certain state programs and another for ``any small \nwatershed program administered by the Secretary of Agriculture which is \ndetermined by the Secretary of the Treasury . . . to be substantially \nsimilar'' to the eight specific programs. The Joint Tax Committee \nexplained the reason for the adoption of this provision, in 1978, as \nfollows:\n\n       In general, these programs relate to improvements which \n     further conservation, protect or restore the environment, \n     improve forests, or provide a habitat for wildlife. These \n     payments ordinarily do not improve the income producing \n     capacity of the property. Also, since these payments \n     represent a portion of an expenditure made by the taxpayer, \n     the taxpayer generally does not have additional funds to pay \n     the tax when such payments are made. The potential adverse \n     tax consequences may operate to discourage certain taxpayers \n     from participating in these programs.\n       For these reasons, Congress believes that it is appropriate \n     to exclude these payments from income, and to provide for \n     their inclusion only at the time the underlying property is \n     disposed of.\n\n  However, this provision does not apply to all of the appropriate \nprograms. In 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service established the \nPartners for Wildlife program, which provides cost-sharing assistance \nto landowners for various wildlife conservation efforts. To date, \n18,000 landowners have participated voluntarily in the program, \nrestoring more than 330,000 acres of wetlands alone. In fiscal year \n1999, about $28 million will be available through the program, of which \nabout $9 million is expected to be paid directly to landowners as cost-\nshare payments.\n  Although cost-share payments made to private landowners under the \nPartners for Wildlife program are similar to the payments that are \nexcluded under section 126, payments under the Partners for Wildlife \nprogram are not eligible for the exclusion, because the Partners \nprogram is not one of the specific programs listed in section 126 and \ncannot qualify as a ``substantially similar'' program because it is not \nadministered by the Secretary of Agriculture. As a result, landowners \nwho receive payments for protecting habitat under the Partners program \nget a 1099 form, from the IRS, stating that the payments must be \ntreated as taxable income. If, for example, the Fish and Wildlife \nService plans to pay a riparian landowner $10,000 to take steps to \nrestore streamside habitat, federal taxes can reduce the value of the \npayment by several thousand dollars. I have received reports that this \nis causing some landowners to decline to participate in the program.\n  Mr. President, the Partners for Wildlife program serves the important \npurpose of promoting federal-state-private partnerships to conserve \nspecies and the habitat upon which they depend. Payments received under \nthe program are similar to those that are excluded under section 126: \nthey promote conservation, they ordinarily do not improve the income \nproducing capacity of the property, they represent a portion of an \nexpenditure made by the taxpayer, and the potential adverse tax\n\n[[Page S8803]]\n\nconsequences may operate to discourage some taxpayers from \nparticipating. For these reasons, it is appropriate to amend section \n126 to treat payments received under the Partners for Wildlife program \nthe same as other conservation payments. The bill would do so.\n\n  There is broad support for this change among both environmentalists \nand landowners: It is supported by the Environmental Defense Fund, the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation, the Center for Marine Conservation, \nAmerican Rivers, the National Woodland Owners Association, the \nDefenders of Wildlife, the Izaak Walton League of America, and the \nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association.\n\nEnhanced Deduction for the Donation of Interests in Real Property that \n               Conserve Threatened or Endangered Species\n\n  Under current law, a taxpayer generally may not take a charitable \ncontribution deduction for the donation of a property interest that is \nless than the taxpayer's entire interest in the property. There are \nseveral exceptions. One is for donations of conservation easements, \nwhich include easements to preserve open space and protect natural \nhabitat. Taxpayers may deduct the value of such contributions, but only \nup to 30% of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income, with a five year \ncarry-forward.\n  The bill would enhance the deduction for contributions of \nconservation easements that are made for the purpose of the \nconservation of a species that has been listed as threatened or \nendangered (or proposed for listing). The deduction is enhanced in \nthree ways: the AGI limitation is increased from 30% to 50%, the carry-\nforward period is increased from five to 20 years, and, if the taxpayer \ndies before then, the entire unused carry-forward amount can be \ndeducted on the decedent's last return.\n  Mr. President, when a landowner donates an interest in property for \nthe purpose of conserving an endangered species, the landowner is \nproviding a public benefit above and beyond the benefit provided by an \nordinary conservation easement. For example, an easement might not only \nassure that farmland remains farmland, but also that there are buffer \nstrips to control runoff in order to protect and endangered fish and \nthat harvesting schedules conform to the needs of migratory waterfowl. \nBy taking such steps voluntarily, landowners reduce the need to take \nother steps to preserve the species, including the imposition of \nregulatory restrictions.\n  By enhancing the deduction for landowners who take such steps, we \ncreate a modest additional incentive for landowners not only to \nconserve land but also to assure that the land is managed in a way that \nhelps conserve and recover endangered species.\n\n Estate Tax Exclusion for Property Subject to a Conservation Agreement\n\n  Under current law, an executor can deduct the value of a conservation \neasement (within the meaning of section 170(h)) from the value of an \nestate. In addition, section 2031(c), an executor can exclude from the \nestate up to 40% of the remaining value of the land subject to the \neasement.\n  For example, if a decedent conveys property worth $1,000,000, subject \nto a conservation easement that reduces the value of the property by \n$300,000, and the property qualifies for the full 40% exclusion, the \ntaxable portion of the estate would be $280,000 (40 percent of the \n$700,000 in remaining value after deducting the $300,000 value of the \neasement).\n  The amount of the exclusion is limited to $500,000 and, under section \n170(h), the conservation easement must be granted in perpetuity.\n  The bill creates a new estate tax incentive for donations of a \npartial interest in property that is subject to an agreement, approved \nby the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce, to carry out activities \nthat would make a major contribution to the conservation of a species \nthat is listed as threatened or endangered, is proposed for listing, or \nis a candidate for listing. The executor may exclude from the estate \nthe entire value of the portion of the property subject to the \nagreement, up to $10,000,000.\n  The conservation agreement need not be in perpetuity; after all, the \npurpose of the agreement is to help recover the species, and once that \ngoal is achieved, land use restrictions may no longer is necessary. \nHowever, if the agreement ends in less than 40 years (i.e., because the \nproperty is sold, there is a material breach of the agreement, or the \nagreement is terminated), the estate must pay a recapture amount, as \nfollows: 100% of the excluded amount if the agreement is terminated in \nless than 10 years; 75% if it is terminated in less than 20 years; 50% \nif it is terminated in less than 30 years; and 25% if it is terminated \nin less than 40 years.\n  Mr. President, current law recognizes that estate tax incentives are \nan appropriate way to encourage landowners to take steps to conserve \nprecious natural resources for future generations.\n  When a landowner or the executor of a landowner's estate enters into \nan agreement to manage land in a way that makes a major contribution to \nthe conservation of an endangered or threatened species, they are, as I \nsaid before, providing a public benefit above and beyond the benefit \nprovided by an ordinary conservation easement. By creating an \nalternative estate tax incentive for landowners who take such steps, we \ncreate a modest additional incentive for landowners not only to \nconserve land but also to assure that the land is managed in a way that \nhelps conserve and recover endangered species.\n\nElimination of the Mileage Limitation For the Estate Tax Exclusion For \n                Land Subject to a Conservation Easement\n\n  Tax code section 2031(c) allows an executor to exclude from a gross \nestate a portion of the value of land that is subject to a conservation \neasement (within the meaning of section 170(h)), but only if the land \nis within 25 miles of a metropolitan area, a wilderness area, or a \nnational park; or is within 10 miles of an Urban National Forest.\n  The bill eliminates 25 and 10 mile limitations, so that an executor \ncan exclude land subject to a conservation agreement regardless of \nwhere the land is located.\n  Mr. President, section 2031(c) serves the important purpose of \nencouraging landowners to conserve open space for future generations, \nrather than forcing heirs to sell undeveloped land to pay estate taxes. \nThe 25 and 10 mile limitations were included in order to reduce the \nrevenue loss and target the incentive to the areas that were likely to \nbe under the greatest development pressure. However, the mileage \nlimitations are a very imperfect proxy. It excludes about one-third of \nthe continental United States; in many cases, the excluded lands are \njust as pristine and sensitive as lands surrounding wilderness areas or \nnational parks--such as lands surrounding national wildlife refuges. \nAnd it excludes many fast-growing areas that do not happen to be \nmetropolitan statistical areas, like areas outside Bozeman and \nKalispell, Montana--two of the fastest growing communities in Montana. \nWhat's more, the mile limitations have a differential impact among \nregions of the country. For example, they have the effect of making \nvirtually the entire Northeast and West Coast eligible for the 2031(c) \nincentive, but exclude large parts of the Great Plains and the Rocky \nMountain West.\n  To eliminate this differential impact, and provide a modest incentive \nfor conservation all across the country, the mileage limitation should \nbe eliminated.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, taken together, these complementary provisions provide \nmodest but important incentives for the conservation of habitat and the \nprotection of endangered species. And, the more we can use tax \nincentives to encourage the conservation of threatened and endangered \nspecies, the more likely we are to reduce the regulatory burdens \nassociated with those species.\n  I should note that there are other significant proposals along \nsimilar lines, including tax proposals introduced by Senators Jeffords \nand Chafee and funding proposals introduced by Senator Boxer. I look \nforward to working with them, and with other interested colleagues, to \nenacted a solid package of conservation tax incentives into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1392\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S8804]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit an \nimportant resolution expressing the sense of the Congress that a \ncommemorative postage stamp should be issued in honor of the U.S.S. New \nJersey, an Iowa class battleship, and all those who served aboard her.\n  From the time of its launch on December 7, 1942, the U.S.S. New \nJersey provided crucial support to numerous naval missions throughout \nthe world. It is the most decorated warship in U.S. naval history, \nhaving earned battle stars, citations, medals, and ribbons from World \nWar II, the Korean conflict, and the Vietnam era. Furthermore, the \nU.S.S. New Jersey was the first U.S. battleship to enter and operate in \nthe Persian Gulf.\n  The New Jersey was decommissioned in 1991, and in the fiscal year \n1999 Defense authorization bill, I authorized a provision to mandate \nthat the Navy donate the U.S.S. New Jersey to a nonprofit entity that \nwill relocate the ship in the state of New Jersey. Now, after the \noverwhelming support and continuous struggle of various groups and \nindividuals in the state, as well as bipartisan efforts from New \nJersey's state and federal legislators, the battleship is scheduled to \nreturn to New Jersey this fall. For this, I would like to extend my \nthanks to the residents of New Jersey who have donated countless hours \nin volunteer time, as well as to the Battleship New Jersey Foundation \nwhose efforts were a driving force in the success of this endeavor.\n  Now that the U.S.S. New Jersey is coming home, it is time to honor \nthis great ship with a commemorative stamp.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/19/senate-section/article/S8806-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8806-S8807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 156--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                             INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL, from the Committee on Indian Affairs, reported the \nfollowing original resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nRules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, Ray Zink, North Dakota Department \nof Transportation Deputy Director for Engineering, retired June 30. In \nhis 40 years with NDDOT, Ray has had a long-standing dedication to \nproviding the best possible transportation system for the people of \nNorth Dakota at the lowest possible cost.\n  Ray Zink joined NDDOT in 1959 as a draftsman, and after subsequent \npromotions, he became chief engineer in 1982. Ray worked successfully \nwith four NDDOT directors, three governors, and both political parties. \nGovernors, legislators, and others in political positions have trusted \nRay throughout the years and respected his integrity and judgement.\n  Ray has held several key positions in AASHTO (the American \nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials), and because \nof his expertise and the respect accorded him, he has been invited to \nrepresent AASHTO and the FHA (Federal Highway Administration) at \nhighway symposiums in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and Johannesburg and \nDurban, South Africa.\n  As North Dakota's chief highway engineer for 17 years, Ray Zink can \nclaim the following accomplishments:\n  Helping to build one of the finest highway systems in the nation: \nBecause the state is so large and people live so far from each other, \nNorth Dakota requires an extensive highway system to move people and \ncommodities. However, it lacks the population base to support the \nsystem it needs. In spite of this, Ray Zink has led NDDOT to create an \nexcellent highway system, by listening to the public, relying on sound \nengineering practices, and industriously using every penny of funding \nin the most effective way.\n  Using Federal aid as quickly as possible: North Dakota has always \nmatched and used every dollar of federal aid available to it. Under \nRay's leadership the state has spent federal aid as quickly and \nefficiently as possible, because every delay reduces the effectiveness \nof the funding through inflation and further highway deterioration. In \nrural America, our roads are critical to keeping us connected to our \nfarms, our jobs, our families, and our cities.\n  Instituting North Dakota's low-load program: To help funnel more \nfunds to where they were most badly needed, Ray initiated the low-load \nprogram. Highways with very low truck traffic are designated ``low-load \nhighways.'' They receive basic maintenance and periodic seal coats but \nare not candidates for other improvements. This lets NDDOT direct its \nresources to heavily-traveled highways that need more attention, which \nmeans that the entire highway system is in better shape and will \ndeteriorate more slowly.\n  As NDDOT maintenance engineer and chief engineer, Ray Zink has helped \ncreate and maintain these vital links between towns and cities and \nfarms, and we are grateful for his careful guardianship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/19/senate-section/article/S8808-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNISH 25TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION ACKNOWLEDGING SENATOR JACOB K.

Celebrating its 25th Anniversary, NISH \nacknowledges the critical role that Senator Javits played in the lives \nof people with disabilities, through the expansion of the program. \nToday, more than 30,000 people with disabilities are employed on \nJavits-Wagner-O'Day projects across the country.\n  It is my pleasure, Mr. President to offer my congratulations and best \nwishes to NISH as it celebrates its 25th Anniversary. Further, I extend \nthe invitation to all of my colleagues in the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives to join me in attending the celebration to honor the \nlegacy of Jacob Javits on July 21st from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. in 902 \nHart Senate Office Building.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/19/senate-section/article/S8808-4", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8808-S8809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING THE WEST VIRGINIA AIR NATIONAL GUARD\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask that we take a moment \ntoday to recognize the enlisted men and women of the West Virginia Air \nNational Guard. Earlier this year, Major General Paul A. Weaver, Jr., \nthe director of the Air National Guard, declared 1999, ``The Year of \nthe Enlisted Force'' in an effort to promote enlisted pride. In a March \n18th proclamation, Governor Cecil H. Underwood, Governor of the great \nState of West Virginia, made this designation effective.\n  The Air National Guard is made up of about 95,000 people, nearly 88 \npercent of whom comprise the enlisted corps. About 65,000 are \ntraditional part-time members and about 30,000 are either full-time \ntechnicians or members of the Active Guard. They average about 12.7 \nyears of satisfactory service and perform 170 different specialty jobs. \nThese enlisted men and women are America's friends, family, neighbors, \nand co-workers. They are educators, bank tellers, repair technicians, \nand builders. At the same time, they serve\n\n[[Page S8809]]\n\nour nation as the enlisted force of the Air National Guard and they \nbring their diverse skills to the job. The enlisted men and women bring \nmaturity and experience to the force and provide a much needed sense of \nstability and commitment.\n  There are two units of the Air National Guard in West Virginia. The \n130th Airlift Wing in Charleston, West Virginia, and the 167th Airlift \nWing in Martinsburg, West Virginia. These two units supported missions \nduring the Korean conflict and in Vietnam. Both units were stationed in \nthe Persian Gulf throughout the Gulf War. Recently these brave men and \nwomen have performed peacekeeping missions in support of the United \nNations and NATO in Eastern Europe. In fact, many of them are there as \nwe speak.\n  The men and women of the West Virginia Air National Guard have won \nmany awards. Some of the most prestigious include Air National Guard \nDistinguished Flying Unit Awards, four Air Force Outstanding Unit \nAwards, and four Spaatz trophies. It is important that we all take note \nof the accomplishments of these outstanding enlisted men and women who \nmake up the backbone of the Air National Guard. They bring an \nincredible amount of dedication to their work as they perform jobs \nwhich are crucial to military operations. They deserve our deepest \ngratitude as they continue to serve our country.\n  My sincere congratulations go to the enlisted men and women of the \n130th Airlift Wing in Charleston, West Virginia, and the 167th Airlift \nWing in Martinsburg, West Virginia. I share in your pride and I proudly \nrecognize 1999, as ``The Year of the Enlisted Force.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/19/senate-section/article/S8809-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S.J.

KENNEDY, JR., CAROLYN BESSETTE KENNEDY, AND LAUREN BESSETTE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the Senator from Alaska has offered, on \nbehalf of Senator Daschle and Senator Lott, a resolution dealing with \nthe issue of the apparent tragedy that has befallen John F. Kennedy, \nJr., Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and Lauren Bessette.\n  I want to make a comment about that because I know that, along with \nmost Americans, this weekend when we heard the news of the \ndisappearance of John F. Kennedy, Jr., along with his wife and sister-\nin-law, most of us were quite shocked and deeply saddened by the news.\n  This was a young man whose life had such bright promise. He was born \nthe son of a young, new President of the United States. That \nPresident's life was cut short by assassination just 3 years into his \nterm.\n  I and countless thousands of other young Americans were inspired by \nJohn F. Kennedy, by his energy and by the passion and ideals of his \nadministration. The experience of being in high school and college and \nwatching the emergence of this new, energetic, young President on the \nscene in this country was something that inspired many young Americans \ntowards public service. That includes my early interest in public \nservice.\n  When John F. Kennedy was assassinated, I think most of us who were \ncalled to public service, or at least were called to an interest in \npublic service back in that period, believed there was kind of an \nunfinished nature to the legacy of his administration and his \nPresidency. I think many thought over the years that this young man, \nJohn F. Kennedy, Jr., was in some way destined to complete that legacy \nof public service.\n\n  Now another tragedy has visited this family, that has already given \nso much to this country, and has taken from us this wonderful, unique \nyoung man. I want to join with all of my colleagues in extending our \nsympathies to our colleague, Senator Kennedy, to the entire Kennedy \nfamily, and to the Bessette family. This is a very difficult time for \nall of them. I know all Members of the Senate probably already have \nindividually sent those messages to that family.\n  I have said on other occasions in the Senate, that there is a lot of \npublic debate that goes on that people see between Members of the \nSenate and they tend to think there is a lack of personal relationships \nthat exists in the Senate. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nWhen something happens to the family of a Member of the Senate, others \nhere whose life's work brings us all together, care deeply.\n  When I lost a daughter a few years ago, I recall Senator Hatch \nsending me a white Bible and coming to visit with me. Senator Byrd sent \nme one of the most beautiful pieces of prose I have ever received, and \nso many other Senators expressed their sympathies. That is the way it \nis in the Senate. I know Senator Kennedy and his family are going \nthrough a very difficult time, and our entire country reaches out to \nthem now to express our deepest and most profound regrets and \nsympathies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/19/senate-section/article/S8810-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8810-S8811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I want to discuss an item of very \nsignificant importance that has brought me to the floor of the Senate \nseveral times and brings me here again today. That is the issue of the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n  I earlier mentioned President John F. Kennedy. President John F. \nKennedy was very interested in a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. \nI want to describe why that is the case and relate it to the comments \nmade by my colleague dealing with China in which he talked about \naccountability and responsibility. I agree with those terms and in most \ncases with the use of those terms on the floor of the Senate.\n  It was 54 years ago last Friday that the first nuclear explosion took \nplace on this Earth; the first nuclear bomb was detonated 54 years ago \nlast Friday. Virtually everything changed because of it.\n  Following the detonation of a nuclear device it was used to end the \nSecond World War. Eventually nuclear weapons led to a cold war with the \nSoviet Union in which both sides began to stockpile thousands and \nthousands of nuclear bombs and nuclear weapons of various types. \nPresidents of the United States started talking about the need to stop \nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons, to keep them in as few hands as \npossible among the countries of the world. Many countries aspired to \nhave nuclear bombs, nuclear weapons. However, it was obviously in the \ninterests of the safety of humankind to try to keep nuclear weapons out \nof the hands of those who aspired to have them.\n  President Eisenhower, in May of 1961, spoke about a ban on testing \nnuclear devices. If you can't test a nuclear device, you don't know \nwhether you have one that works. A test ban effectively means that \nanyone who claims to have a nuclear weapon cannot claim to have a \nnuclear weapon that works because they will never know.\n  That is the value of a ban on testing, a ban that was aspired to as \nlong ago as President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who said the following:\n\n       Not achieving a test ban would have to be classed as the \n     greatest disappointment of any administration, of any decade, \n     of any time and of any party.\n\n  He left office deeply disappointed that even in those early days long \nbefore the buildup of nuclear weapons existed so aggressively across \nthe world, he was profoundly disappointed at not getting the test ban.\n\n  President John F. Kennedy got a test ban in place in 1963 dealing \nwith atmospheric tests. The ban on atmospheric tests in 1963 was \npartially successful. He desired a total ban. He said:\n\n       A test ban would place the nuclear powers in a position to \n     deal more effectively with one of the greatest hazards man \n     faces. . . . It would increase our security, it would \n     decrease the prospects of war. Surely this goal is \n     sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit, \n     yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole \n     effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital \n     and responsible safeguards.\n\n  Now, since that time, we have seen more nations achieve the ability \nto build nuclear weapons and the ability to deliver them. We have seen \nour country and the Soviet Union stockpile tens of thousands of nuclear \nweapons. It is quite remarkable, the United States and Russia, \ntogether, currently have more than 30,000 nuclear weapons. China has \nnuclear weapons. The number, to the extent we know, is classified. But, \nit is a minuscule amount as compared to 30,000. We know from recent \nevents that India and Pakistan both have nuclear weapons. Both have \nexploded nuclear devices literally beneath each other's chin--and these \nare two countries that don't like each other. Two countries with a \ncommon border, with a great deal of animosity, both testing nuclear \ndevices in a provocative way. Other countries aspire to achieve or to \nobtain nuclear weapons.\n  What are we doing about all of this? There is a treaty that has been \nnegotiated over a long period of time--in fact, ultimately over \ndecades--and signed by 152 countries. It is a comprehensive nuclear \ntest ban treaty. That comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty is a treaty \nwhich prohibits the testing of nuclear weapons, it bans the explosive \ntesting of nuclear weapons all across this world.\n  We have had some experience with treaties: arms control and arms \nreduction treaties, the START I treaty, Strategic Arms Limitation \nTreaty, SALT I, START II, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. A whole \nseries of treaties have been considered and negotiated and ratified by \nthe Senate.\n  This treaty, the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, was \nnegotiated and signed and sent to the Senate a long while ago--665 days \nago; 665 days ago a treaty that this country negotiated and signed was \nsent to the Senate to be ratified.\n  What has happened with previous treaties? The limited nuclear test \nban treaty in 1963 was sent to the Senate and considered in 3 weeks; \nthe Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty in 1972 took 3 months; the ABM \nTreaty took 10 weeks; the ABM Treaty protocols, 14 months; Conventional \nForces in Europe, 4 months; START I, 11 months.\n  The comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty was sent here over 665 days \nago and it has yet to have had a first day of hearings in the Committee \non Foreign Relations in the Senate.\n  Why? Why would a treaty that is so important to this country languish \nfor nearly 2 years without even an hour, not a day of hearings?\n\n[[Page S8811]]\n\n  We are, as a world, in a much better position than we were some years \nago in the middle of the cold war when the Soviet Union and the United \nStates were headlong in an arms race, building and deploying tens of \nthousands of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union is gone. The cold war is \nover. The arms race has largely diminished.\n  One thing remains constant: Many other countries around the world \nwant to obtain nuclear weapons.\n  Many countries around the world want to obtain delivery systems to \ndeliver nuclear weapons. They are testing medium-range and long-range \nmissiles. They are trying to find ways to produce or obtain the \nmaterials necessary to build a nuclear device. This country, in the \nmiddle of all of this, must provide leadership.\n  It is our responsibility to provide that leadership. We are the \nremaining nuclear superpower. Russia has nuclear devices to be sure, \nbut Russia is not a world power of the type the United States is at \nthis point. We, as a country, must exert some leadership, and one step \nin the right direction towards diminishing the opportunities for other \ncountries to achieve reliable nuclear weapons, is to quickly ratify \nthis treaty, the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.\n  The decision of this country to drag our feet is almost unforgivable. \nIt sends a signal to others around the rest of the world--to China, \nRussia, India, Pakistan and others--that this is not all that \nimportant; it is not a priority to the United States. It ought to be. \nEverybody in this Chamber ought to come to the floor to demand that \nthis be brought before the Senate. It has languished for almost 2 years \nin the Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate. It ought to be \nbrought to the floor, and we ought to have a debate on it.\n  In October of this year, the countries who have ratified this treaty \nwill be meeting to discuss implementing the treaty. They will \napparently be meeting without the United States as an active \nparticipant. It is wrong, in my judgment, for this country to decide \nthat it is not going to provide the leadership necessary on this \ntreaty. The rest of the world looks to us, waits for us, and the Senate \nis dragging its feet. I understand the committees in the Senate have a \ngreat deal of authority and power. I recognize that, but it seems to me \nthere is a compelling national interest that should require this \ncountry to lead, and require this Senate to ratify the comprehensive \nnuclear test ban treaty.\n  I want to, with one additional chart, point out what was said by \nSecretary of State Albright:\n\n       . . .this is the longest-sought, hardest-fought prize in \n     arms control. And it is a price not yet fully won. For \n     American leadership, for our future, the time has come to \n     ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty--this year, this \n     session, now.\n\n  I heard my colleague from Alaska talk about Chinese espionage at the \nNational Labs. That is an unsettling and a very serious issue. It \nraises all kinds of questions about the safeguarding of nuclear \nsecrets, about how much and what kind of secrets might have been \nobtained by those who were spying on behalf of another country, and did \nthese secrets allow that country or those countries to build higher \nyield or smaller nuclear devices.\n  I do not know the answer to those questions, but the words \n``accountability and responsibility'' were used repeatedly in \ndiscussing that issue. Accountability and responsibility--it seems to \nme those two words are appropriate; in fact, those two words are \nexactly what we ought to talk about with respect to the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty.\n  Accountability and responsibility--if this country is responsible, \nand if this country is going to be accountable for its leadership in \nthe world, the leadership away from the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons, the leadership toward a safer world, one with fewer nuclear \nweapons rather than more nuclear weapons, then this country will take \nthe lead now on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It is not the case, \nas some have argued, that the China espionage issue actually undercuts \nratification of this treaty. In fact, that issue strengthens the need \nfor this treaty. It strengthens the need for this treaty.\n  To suggest--and there was a recent article in the Wall Street Journal \nsuggesting there is a linkage--Chinese espionage is why we ought not \nratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is nonsense. In fact, these \nallegations of espionage, in my judgment, underscore why this treaty \nought to be ratified and ought to be ratified now.\n\n  To the extent that China believes it may have acquired the \nopportunity for better nuclear warheads, it will never know that unless \nit is able to test them. And as a signatory to a comprehensive nuclear \ntest ban treaty, it cannot test without violating the treaty.\n  I will be participating in a press conference tomorrow with others in \nthe Senate during which we will announce a recent public opinion poll \nthat has been done on this issue which shows widespread public support \nto ratify this comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. I hope that \nperhaps with some pressure and some thoughtfulness on the part of all \nMembers of the Senate, we will be given an opportunity to debate and \nvote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty soon.\n  Again, I understand how this system works, but it is not a system \nthat ought to work in the regular way for something as important as \nthis: limiting the spread of nuclear weapons. This country ought to \ntake the lead in preventing it, and it ought to do so now. It is just \nplain wrong for the Senate to drag its feet on a treaty of this \nimportance. A treaty negotiated and signed by 152 countries, waiting to \nbe ratified for almost 2 years, and not even have 1 hour of hearings. \nThat is wrong and everybody in this Chamber should know it is wrong.\n  I do hope my colleagues will join me in calling for the Foreign \nRelations Committee in the Senate to bring the comprehensive nuclear \ntest ban treaty before the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/19/senate-section/article/S8811-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FAMILY FARMING\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have been talking about what I hope \nthe agenda of the Senate will be in the next weeks as we turn from the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, which consumed all of last week and which was \na fairly hard-fought debate. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, I hope, \nwill be a part of that.\n  As I indicated on Friday, I also feel very strongly that the majority \nleader and others in this Senate must put at the head of the list of \nitems for consideration a piece of legislation that will deal with the \nemergency needs of family farming.\n  The economy has collapsed in rural America, and we cannot wait. It \nrequires this Congress to act and act soon. We have a farm bill that is \nlargely bankrupt. It does not provide support during tough times. It \npulls the rug out from under family farmers even as market prices have \ncollapse. This Congress must do two things: first, pass an emergency \nbill; and, second, rewrite the farm program in a way that says to \nfamily farmers: You produce food the world needs, we care about that, \nand we are going to help you across price valleys when they occur.\n  I will speak more about that later this week. Madam President, I \nyield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/19/senate-section/article/S8811-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
