He has held many leadership positions within the \nclergy, within the city of Philadelphia, and has been the right arm of \nRev. Leon Sullivan, who may be a giant among giants within Philadelphia \nand around the world.\n  In particular, I refer to his work reaching into Africa, working on \nAIDS projects with the terrible scourge that is crossing Africa today. \nReverend Roman is on the front line urging not only his church but \nother churches to respond to the need in America, as well as the \nwonderful things we have been able to accomplish--Reverend Roman and \nmyself and others--in the community in Philadelphia. He has been a \ngreat leader, someone who has been a real tour de force not only in \nevangelizing the word of God but in putting God's will into action in \nthe community.\n  It is an honor to have him here today. We certainly welcome him \nwholeheartedly to the Senate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Santorum, in words of praise for Rev. Gus Roman. As a fellow \nPhiladelphian, I have had an opportunity to watch his work. He has an \noutstanding record and an outstanding reputation.\n  It was very nice of him to come to Washington and lead the Senate in \nthe opening prayer. When Senator Santorum makes comments about the work \nof Reverend Sullivan, that has been acclaimed nationally and \ninternationally. I had my first opportunity to work with Reverend \nSullivan many years ago when he took a deserted police station in north \nPhiladelphia and turned it into the Opportunities Industrialization \nCorps, providing job training. It is worthy to note that Reverend \nSullivan is in town today. There is an African American summit dinner \ntonight at the ballroom of the Washington Hilton--not to give too many \nadvertisements in conjunction with the prayer.\n  Reverend Sullivan's work, as Reverend Roman's work, is very \ndistinguished and a great contribution to America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5583-6", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5583-S5584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I stand here today to pay tribute to the 22 \nmen who received the Medal of Honor yesterday. As has been indicated by \na number of my colleagues, one of those recipients is my dear friend \nand colleague from Hawaii, Senator Daniel K. Inouye. I extend my \nheartfelt congratulations to:\n  Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Second Lieutenant, 442nd Regimental Combat \nTeam;\n  Rudolph Davila, Staff Sergeant, 3rd Army;\n  Barney Hajiro, Private First Class, 442nd RCT;\n  Mikio Hasemoto, Private, 100th Battalion;\n  Joe Hayashi, Private First Class, 442nd RCT;\n  Shizuya Hayashi, Private, 100th Battalion;\n  Yeiki Kobashigawa, Technical Sergeant, 100th Battalion;\n  Robert Kuroda, Staff Sergeant, 442nd RCT;\n  Kaoru Moto, Private First Class, 100th Battalion;\n  Kiyoshi Muranaga, Private First Class, 442nd RCT;\n  Masato Nakae, Private First Class, 100th Battalion;\n  Sinyei Nakamine, Private, 100th Battalion;\n  William Nakamura, Private First Class, 442nd RCT;\n  Joe Nishimoto, Private, 442nd RCT;\n  Allan Ohata, Staff Sergeant, 100th Battalion;\n  James Okubo, Technical Sergeant, 442nd RCT;\n  Yukio Okutsu, Technical Sergeant, 442nd RCT;\n  Frank Ono, Private First Class, 442nd RCT;\n  Kazuo Otani, Staff Sergeant, 442nd RCT;\n  George Sakato, Private, 442nd RCT;\n  Ted Tanouye, Technical Sergeant, 442nd RCT;\n  Francis Wai, Captain, 34th Division.\n  Mr. President, these 22 Medal of Honor recipients have joined an \nelite group of soldiers honored for exceptional valor in service to our \ncountry. It may have taken half a century, but the passage of time has \nnot diminished the magnificence of their courage. These 22 men truly \nrepresent the best that America has to offer. They answered the call to \nduty and proved that patriotism is solely a circumstance of the heart. \nThese men answered the call of duty with conviction and courage, at a \ntime when these virtues were most in demand by a needy Nation. In the \nface of discrimination and injustice at home, these men set aside \npersonal consideration to defend our great Nation on foreign \nbattlefields. By their actions, these 22 men proved that patriotism is \nnot based on the color of one's skin, but on the courage and strength \nof one's convictions.\n  I am pleased to have contributed to the process that finally led to \nthe appropriate recognition of these soldiers. Legislation initiated by \nthe Senate required the military to review the records of all Asian \nPacific American recipients of the Navy Cross or Distinguished Service \nCross during World War II to determine if any merit upgrade to the \nMedal of Honor.\n  Many times I have been asked why I thought review was necessary. The \nreview provision was offered and adopted out of concern that Asian \nPacific American veterans have never been fully recognized for their \nmilitary contributions during the Second World War.\n  Many in Hawaii know of the exploits of the 100th Infantry Battalion, \n442nd Regimental Combat Team. It came as a surprise that few on the \nmainland were familiar with the service of this famous all-Nisei, \nsecond generation Japanese unit, or of the secret Military Intelligence \nService whose members served in the Pacific.\n  Twenty of the twenty two Medal of Honor recipients honored yesterday \nand today are from the 100th Infantry Battalion, 442nd Regimental \nCombat Team. Of the remaining two recipients, Sergeant Francis Davila \nserved with the 7th Infantry and Captain Francis Wai served with the \n34th Division.\n  Few people realize the history of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. \nOn December 7, 1941, during the attack on Pearl Harbor, a call went out \nfor all University of Hawaii ROTC members to report for duty. These \nstudents, most of whom were Americans of Japanese ancestry, responded \nto the call and were fully prepared to defend the United States. 370 of \nthe Japanese American ROTC cadets were sworn into the Hawaii \nTerritorial Guard and guarded the most sensitive and important \ninstallations in Hawaii.\n  Due to the shock at the attack on Pearl Harbor and an unfortunate \nignorance by some of the culture and racial makeup of the citizens of \nHawaii, there were individuals who opposed Japanese Americans serving \nin the Territorial Guard. The 370 Japanese Americans who had served \nfaithfully, willingly, and patriotically during the weeks following \nPearl Harbor, were dismissed from the Territorial Guard because of \ntheir ancestry. Instead of rebelling, resigning, or protesting, these \nmen wrote to the Commanding General of the Hawaiian Department and \nstated their ``willingness to do their part as loyal Americans in every \nway'' and offered themselves for ``whatever you may see fit to use \nus.''\n  These men formed the Varsity Victory Volunteers and worked at the \nquarries, constructed roads, helped construct warehouses, renovated \nquarters, strung barbed wire, and built chairs, tables, and lamps. They \neven donated blood and bought bonds. We cannot forget that these men \nwere students and could have been making money in white collar jobs.\n  Instead, they devoted their time to doing what they could to help the \nmilitary. It was this group of Japanese American volunteers, the \nVarsity Victory Volunteers, who were eventually given the authorization \nby the War Department to form the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, which \nwould earn the distinction as the ``most decorated unit for its size \nand length of service in the history of the United States.''\n  Their motto, ``Go for Broke,'' is a perfect description of their \nspirit and character as men and as a fighting unit. The 442nd and 100th \nBattalion captured enemy positions and rescued comrades. They completed \nmissions that seemed impossible. Ignoring danger, they repeatedly \nplaced themselves in harm's way, gaining a reputation for fearless and \nfierce fighting. Throughout the Army their bravery earned them the \nnickname the ``Purple Heart Battalion.''\n  In 1943, when the War Department decided to accept Nisei volunteers, \nover 1,000 Hawaii Nisei volunteered on the first day. The spirit and \nattitude of these volunteers is captured in the senior Senator from \nHawaii's memoir, ``Journey to Washington.''\n  I want to read an excerpt from the book describing an exchange \nbetween young Dan Inouye and his father as he left to report for \ninduction.\n\n       After a long period of silence between us, he said \n     unexpectedly, ``You know what `on' means?''\n       ``Yes,'' I replied. On is at the very heart of Japanese \n     culture. On requires that when one man is aided by another, \n     he incurs a debt that is never canceled, one that must be \n     repaid at every opportunity.\n       ``The Inouyes have great on for America,'' my father said. \n     ``It has been good to us. And now it is you who must try to \n     return the goodness. You are my first son, and you are very \n     precious to your mother and me, but you must do what must be \n     done.''\n\n  Mr. President, for over 60 years, my friend and colleague, the senior \nSenator from Hawaii, has returned to\n\n[[Page S5585]]\n\nAmerica the goodness and service to honor his father's admonition. On \nthe field of battle in Italy, in the territorial legislature, and for \nover 40 years in Congress, Dan Inouye has served his country with \ndistinction and courage. His leadership on national defense, civil \nrights, and a host of other issues have made America a stronger and \nbetter country. I am proud to serve with him in the United States \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, the people of Hawaii are also very proud that 12 of \nthe 22 men awarded the Medal of Honor are from Hawaii.\n  My Honolulu office received a call the other day from a constituent \nin Waianae, a small community on the leeward coast of Oahu, who wanted \nto make sure that people knew that three Medal of Honor recipients were \nfrom Waianae.\n  Indeed, the people of Hawaii are proud and grateful for all the local \nboys who have served in defense of our nation. They are well aware of \nthe sacrifice and hardship endured by our men in uniform during World \nWar II and subsequent conflicts.\n  Out of the 22 men honored, 10 were killed in battle. Five of the \nrecipients survived World War II, but have passed on prior to knowing \nthat their medals were upgraded. That leaves us with seven living \nrecipients, five of whom, I am proud to say, are from the State of \nHawaii.\n  I see this as an opportunity to inform the American public about the \ndegree and level of participation of Asian Pacific Americans in the war \neffort. I thank President Clinton, Secretary of Defense William Cohen, \nand Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera for the painstaking and \nthorough manner in which the review and nomination process was \nconducted. I commend Secretary Caldera and all the Army personnel who \nconducted this review in a thorough and professional manner. They \ncarried out the difficult task of identifying the records of more than \none hundred veterans.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the 442nd Veterans Club, and Club \n100 for their unwavering support and assistance in the review process. \nI want to thank Ed Ichiyama, Sakae Takahashi, and Iwao Yokooji for \ntheir tremendous work in recognizing the contributions of Asian Pacific \nAmericans in military intelligence and the frontlines of battle. The \naccounts documented for each of the 104 Distinguished Service Cross \nrecipients underscore our faith in a Nation that produces such heroes \nand are a wonderful legacy for our children and grandchildren.\n  I would also like to pay tribute to the Military Intelligence \nService, whose unit citation was signed by Secretary Caldera last \nnight, because in a profound way, my interest in this area began with \nthe MIS.\n  About 10 years ago, I heard of the late Colonel Richard Sakakida's \nremarkable experiences as an Army undercover agent in the Philippines \nduring World War II. His MIS colleagues worked to have his \nextraordinary service honored by our Government and the Government of \nthe Philippines.\n  While working to have Colonel Sakakida's service acknowledged with \nappropriate decoration, I realized that there were many war heroes \nwhose valiant service had been overlooked. I recalled that only two \nAsian Pacific Americans received the Medal of Honor for service during \nWorld War II. The number seemed too low when you consider the high-\nintensity combat experienced by the 100th and 442nd, the service of \n12,000 Filipino Americans in the U.S. Army, and the dangerous \nassignments taken by the 6,000 members of the MIS.\n  President Truman recognized it for what it was on a rain-drenched day \nin 1945, when during a White House ceremony honoring the 100th and \n442nd, he observed, ``you fought not only the enemy, you fought \nprejudice, and you have won.''\n  Mr. President, these men are not being awarded the Medal of Honor \nbecause of their race. They are being given their due recognition for \ntheir exceptional acts of valor. Fifty-five years ago, our country \nrefused to appropriately recognize that these men distinguished \nthemselves by gallantry and audacious courage, risking their lives in \nservice above and beyond the call of duty.\n  This is a great day to be an American, and I am honored to stand \nbefore the Senate to pay tribute to these 22 men who fought to defend \nour great Nation. In their memory and in celebration of our Nation's \neverlasting commitment to justice and liberty, I honor these 22 men and \ntheir achievements and offer them the highest praise for all they have \ndone to keep us free.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, some people have inquired about why I \nhave been so interested in the award of a Congressional Medal of Honor \nto our distinguished friend from Hawaii, Senator Daniel Inouye. I come \nto the floor to explain that.\n  As a young boy, I attended school in Redondo Beach, CA. That high \nschool was also attended by a substantial number of Japanese students. \nOn December 7 of 1941, we had the terrible attack on the United States. \nFollowing that attack, almost half of the young boys, young men of our \nhigh school class, did not return to school. They were Japanese young \nmen.\n  Within a few weeks, they and their families were interned and taken \nto local racetracks and other places and put into internment camps. I \nnever saw those young men again. They were young men with whom I played \nfootball and knew very well. Many of them joined the same unit Senator \nInouye was in, the 442nd.\n  It was not until 1996, when Senator Akaka, Senator Inouye's \ncolleague, introduced an amendment, that I realized there had been \nprobably one of the greatest mistakes made by the American military in \nits history. On February 10, 1996, Senator Akaka offered an amendment \nthat became section 524 of Public Law 104-106. It was for this purpose:\n\n       Review regarding upgrading of Distinguished-Service Crosses \n     and Navy Crosses awarded to Asian-Americans and Native \n     American Pacific Islanders for World War II service.\n\n  It required the Secretary of the Army to review the records relating \nto the awards of the Distinguished-Service Cross and the Secretary of \nthe Navy to review the records relating to the Navy Cross awarded to \nthese people to determine whether or not the people who had received \nthose awards should be upgraded to the Medal of Honor.\n  As a result of that review, as we all know, yesterday we attended, at \nthe White House, the Medal of Honor ceremony that did result in the \nupgrading of these awards that had been previously made to 21 different \nindividuals. One of them was to my great friend, the Senator from \nHawaii.\n  The Senate will have a reception, sponsored by Senator Byrd and \nmyself, for Senator Inouye this afternoon. At this time, at noon, he is \nbecoming a member of the Medal of Honor Society at the Offices of the \nSecretary of the Army. We have invited every Member of the Senate, and \nI do hope they will come by.\n  The ceremony will start at 4:30. The room will be opened at 4 \no'clock. It is the Caucus Room in the Russell Building. At my request, \nStephen Ambrose, who wrote the D-Day book and other books very well \nknown to our people, will be there to make some remarks concerning \nSenator Inouye.\n  I have decided this citation should appear in the Record. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record as it appears in the \ndocument presented by the President of the United States to those of us \nwho attended the ceremony yesterday.\n  There being no objection, the citation was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            C I T A T I O N\n\n       The President of the United States of America, authorized \n     by Act of Congress, March 3, 1863, has awarded in the name of \n     The Congress the Medal of Honor to:\n\n                   Second Lieutenant Daniel K. Inouye\n\n\n                           united states army\n\n     for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his \n     life above and beyond the call of duty:\n\n     Second Lieutenant Daniel K. Inouye distinguished himself by \n     extraordinary heroism in action on 21 April 1945, in the \n     vicinity of San Terenzo, Italy. While attacking a defended \n     ridge guarding an important road junction, Second Lieutenant \n     Inouye skillfully directed his platoon through a hail of \n     automatic and small arms fire, in a swift enveloping movement \n     that resulted in the capture of an artillery and mortar post \n     and brought his men to within 40 yards of the hostile force. \n     Emplaced in bunkers and rock formations, the enemy halted the \n     advance with crossfire from three machine guns. With complete \n     disregard for his personal safety, Second Lieutenant Inouye \n     crawled up the treacherous slope to within five yards of the \n     nearest machine gun and hurled two grenades, destroying the \n     emplacement. Before the enemy\n\n[[Page S5586]]\n\n     could retaliate, he stood up and neutralized a second machine \n     gun nest. Although wounded by a sniper's bullet, he continued \n     to engage other hostile positions at close range until an \n     exploding grenade shattered his right arm. Despite the \n     intense pain, he refused evacuation and continued to direct \n     his platoon until enemy resistance was broken and his men \n     were again deployed in defensive positions. In the attack, 25 \n     enemy soldiers were killed and eight others captured. By his \n     gallant, aggressive tactics and by his indomitable \n     leadership, Second Lieutenant Inouye enabled his platoon to \n     advance through formidable resistance, and was instrumental \n     in the capture of the ridge. Second Lieutenant Inouye's \n     extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping \n     with the highest traditions of military service and reflect \n     great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are all honored to serve with this \nSenator. I hope every Member of the Senate will attend the reception \nfor him.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, all of us thank Senator Stevens and \nSenator Byrd for having a gathering this afternoon for Senator Inouye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be given 10 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we will shortly be taking up the matter \nof permanent normal trade relations with China.\n  Mr. President, normally, I do not think matters of trade should be \nencumbered by other non-trade considerations; however, in the case of \nChina, the situation is different. Not only are we considering trade \nwith someone other than an ally, someone other than a nation that \nshares our values and outlooks on life, but we are beginning a new \nrelationship with a nation that is actively involved in activities that \ngo against the national security of this nation, and go against the \nsecurity of the entire world. China still is one of the world's leading \nproliferators of weapons of mass destruction. We are right now engaged \nin a debate in this country over a national missile defense because of \nthe activities of certain rogue nations and the weapons of mass \ndestruction that they are rapidly developing. They're developing those \nweapons, Mr. President, in large part because of the assistance they're \ngetting from the Chinese.\n  The Rumsfeld Commission reported in July of 1998 that ``China poses a \nthreat as a significant proliferator of ballistic missiles, weapons of \nmass destruction, and enabling technology. It has carried out extensive \ntransfers to Iran's solid fuel ballistic missile programs, and has \nsupplied Pakistan with the design for nuclear weapons and additional \nnuclear weapons assistance. It has even transferred complete ballistic \nmissile systems to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. China's behavior thus far \nmakes it appear unlikely it will soon effectively reduce its country's \nsizable transfers of critical technology, experts, or expertise, to the \nemerging missile powers.\n  Mr. President, I speak today not to get into the middle of the PNTR \ndebate, because that is yet to come, but because something has come to \nmy attention that I think deserves comment.\n  Under issue cover dated June 22--today--the Far Eastern Economic \nReview reports this:\n\n       Robert Einhorn, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for \n     Nonproliferation, left Hong Kong on June 11 with a small \n     delegation bound for Beijing. Neither the American or Chinese \n     side reported this trip. Einhorn is on a delicate mission to \n     get a commitment from Beijing not to export missile \n     technology and components to Iran and Pakistan. China has \n     agreed in principle to resume nonproliferation discussions \n     with the U.S. in July. But Einhorn's trip has an added \n     urgency because recent U.S. intelligence reports suggest that \n     China may have begun building a missile plant in Pakistan. If \n     true, it would be the second Chinese-built plant there. A \n     senior U.S. official declined comment on the report, but said \n     that Washington is concerned that China has resumed work on \n     an M-11 missile plant it started building in Pakistan in \n     1990. Work stopped in 1996 when Pakistan, facing U.S. \n     sanctions, pledged itself to good behavior.\n\n  Mr. President, if this report is true, I must say it's totally \nconsistent with everything else the Chinese have been doing over the \npast several years. In summary, they have materially assisted \nPakistan's missile program; they have materially assisted North Korea's \nmissile program; they have materially assisted Libya's missile program. \nThey have now been responsible apparently for two missile plants in \nPakistan. The India-Pakistan part of the world is a nuclear tinder box. \nThey are going after one another with tests of missiles with the \nIndians saying they're responding to the Pakistanis' tests. The \nPakistanis in turn are developing capabilities almost solely dependent \non the Chinese. All of this activity by China is in clear violation of \nthe Missile Technology Control Regime, which they have agreed to adhere \nto. In addition, they have assisted in the uranium and plutonium \nproduction in Pakistan. This is in violation of the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty. They have been of major assistance to the Iranian \nmissile program. They have supplied guidance systems to the Iranians. \nThey have helped them test flight their Shahab-3 missile. They have now \nsuccessfully conducted a test flight of that missile. They have \nsupplied raw materials and equipment for North Korea's missile program. \nPlus, in addition, they have supplied cruise missiles to Iran, and they \nhave supplied chemicals and equipment and a plant to Iran to help them \nproduce chemical weapons.\n\n  Now, all of these have to do with reports, most have to do with \nintelligence reports, that we have received in open session before \nCongressional committees year after year after year where the Chinese \nhave promised that they would do better, promised that they would \nadhere to international regimes and norms of conduct, and they have \nconsistently violated them. We cannot turn a blind eye to these factors \nas we consider PTNR.\n  What is to happen to a nation that will not protect itself against \nobvious threats to its national security? That's why, Mr. President, we \nhave introduced a bill that will establish an annual review mechanism \nthat assesses China's behavior with regard to the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. And if it is determined that they continue \nthis conduct, we will have responses. They will be WTO-compliant; for \nthe most part they will not be trade-related. They address things like \nChinese access to our capital markets. They now are raising billions of \ndollars in our capital markets, and there's no transparency. We do not \nknow what the monies are going for. We know precious little about the \ncompanies except that they are basically controlled by the Chinese \ngovernment. Many people feel like the money is going back to enhance \ntheir military and other activities such as that. There needs to be \ntransparency. They need to be told that if they continue with this \npattern of making the world less safe, creating a situation where we \neven need to have to worry about a national missile defense system, \nassisting these rogue nations with the capability of hitting us with \nnuclear and biological and chemical weapons, that there's going to be a \nresponse by this country. It will be measured; it will be calculated; \nit will be careful; it will be tiered-up in severity based upon the \nlevel of their activities. And this is what we're going to be \nconsidering in conjunction with the PTNR debate.\n  I thought it was important that I bring this latest information \nconcerning the Chinese activities in building apparently another \nmissile plant in Pakistan, which is a nuclear tinder box, even at the \ntime--even at the time--that we have under consideration permanent \nnormal trade relations with them. That shows no respect for us; it \nshows no respect for the international regimes which seek to control \nsuch things, and it is time we got their attention. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, are we still in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent if I could proceed in morning \nbusiness for 10 minutes. If the committee is prepared to begin their \ndeliberation, I will withhold.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We are prepared to begin our deliberations, but if the \nSenator from Delaware wants some time, I will defer to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5587]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Before the Senator from Tennessee leaves, let me say that \nI think his rendition of Chinese behavior and proliferation is \naccurate. I remind all Members to keep that in mind when we vote on a \nnational missile defense system.\n  Right now, I point out, as my friend on the Intelligence Committee \nknows, China has a total of 18 intercontinental ballistic missiles. If \nwe go forward with the national missile defense system that we are \ncontemplating, and if we must abrogate the ABM Treaty in order to do \nthat, I am willing to bet any Member on this floor that China goes to \nsomewhere between 200 and 500 ICBMs within 5 years.\n  It is bad that China still proliferates missile technology. It is \neven more awesome that they may decide they are no longer merely going \nto have a ``city buster'' deterrent, which is no threat to our military \ncapability in terms of our hardened targets and silos. If we deploy a \nnational missile defense, they may decide that they must become a truly \nmajor nuclear power.\n  I also point out that, notwithstanding that everything the Senator \nsaid is true, I do believe there is hope in engagement. There is no \nquestion that the reason North Korea is, at least at this moment--and \nno one knows where it will go from here--is withholding missile \ntesting, at least at this moment adhering to the deal made with regard \nto not reprocessing spent nuclear fuel, at least has begun discussions \nwith South Korea, is in no small part because of the intervention of \nChina.\n  As the Senator from Tennessee and the rest of my colleagues know, \nforeign policy is a complicated thing. We may find ourselves having to \nbalance competing interests. I am not defending China's action. As the \nSenator may know, I am the guy who, with Senator Helms 5 years ago, \nattempted to sanction China for their sale of missile technology to \nPakistan. However, I think that as this develops and we look at the \nother complicated issues we will have to vote on, we must keep in mind \nthat, as bad as their behavior is, we sure don't want them \nfundamentally changing their nuclear arsenal. I don't want them MIRVing \nmissiles. I don't want them deciding that they are to become a major \nnuclear power.\n  I respectfully suggest that before we make a decision on national \nmissile defense, we should know what we are about to get, for what we \nare bargaining for. Maybe we can build a defensive system that could \nintercept somewhere between 5 and 8 out of 7 or 10 missiles fired from \nNorth Korea.\n  As they used to say in my day on bumper stickers, ``One nuclear bomb \ncan ruin your day.''\n  I am not sure, when we balance all of the equities of the concerns \nabout what is in the interest of those pages on the Senate floor and \ntheir children, that if deployment of a national missile defense starts \nan arms race in Asia, it is actually in their interest in the long run.\n  I thank the Senator for his pointing out exactly what China is doing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5587-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5587-S5588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the managers from Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee for accepting \nmy amendment yesterday, which was a resolution arguing that we should \nrestore the moneys that we cut from the NADR funding line in the State \nDepartment. The Foreign Operations Appropriation bill cut a lot of \nmoney out of a proposal and recommendation from the authorizing \ncommittee, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  We cut a significant amount of money out of some vital programs that \nwe have to support nonproliferation, antiterrorism, and related \nprograms. As a matter of fact, the 10 programs in this category are all \non the front line of protecting our people from terrorism and weapons \nof mass destruction. Unfortunately, the funding in the Foreign \nOperations bill for 7 of those 10 programs was 37 percent below the \nlevels requested by the President. And that is without counting another \n$30 million that was cut because the Foreign Operations Subcommittee \nconcluded that a new counterterrorism training center had to be funded \nin the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill instead.\n  The national security and the very things my friend from Tennessee is \ntalking about require that we provide substantially more of those \nrequested funds.\n  Let me describe the programs that are treated so badly. In the \nnonproliferation field, we have the Department of State's Export \nControl Assistance program, which helps foreign countries to combat the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Recently, Customs agents \nin Uzbekistan, for example, stopped the shipment of radioactive \ncontraband to Kazakhstan, which was on its way to Iran with an official \ndestination of Pakistan. Press stories suggest that the shipment was \nreally intended for an Afghanistan terrorist group affiliated with \nOsama bin Laden, who would have used it to build a radiological weapon \nfor use against Americans.\n  Those Customs agents were trained in the United States. The equipment \nthey used to detect the radioactive material was provided by the United \nStates. In that case, the funding came from the Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program, which is in another appropriations bill. But the \nExport Control Assistance Program has provided the same sort of \nassistance when the Nunn-Lugar program could not be used, and it \nregularly helps other countries enact the laws and regulations they \nneed in order to be effective in export control. The personal ties that \nare forged by this program with export officials in other countries are \nequally critical in improving other countries' export controls and \ntheir willingness to work with us.\n\n  I cite that as one example. We are cutting by 37 percent on average \nthe non-proliferation and anti-terrorism programs. We are cutting by 37 \npercent on average those programs that allow us to train customs agents \nand others in detecting the transfer of the very material my friend \nfrom the State of Tennessee is talking about being transferred. None of \nthat is transferred in the open. China doesn't say, ``By the way, we \nare about to send to Pakistan the following.'' They don't do that. It \nis all done surreptitiously. How we are cutting funds to deal with the \ntransport of materials that cause the proliferation to rise as it has \nis beyond me. It is absolutely beyond my comprehension.\n  There are many other aspects of the program. Last year Congress \nincreased funding for this program from $10 million to $14 million. \nIndeed, the report for the Foreign Operations Appropriation bill takes \ncredit for the increase. This year the President asked for $14 million \nto maintain the level we set up last year. But what happened? The \nappropriations bill cut it back down to $10 million. I don't get this. \nHello? What is going on here? The committee takes credit for raising \nthis program's budget and then cuts it back down? If there is a logic \nhere, I fail to see it.\n  The fact is that last year, when it came to this program, the \nappropriators were right. This year they should do again just what they \ndid last year. But they did not. That is why my co-sponsors and I \noffered our amendment, and I am grateful to the managers for their \nacceptance of that amendment; I hope the conferees will take it to \nheart.\n  We need more export control assistance to help other countries keep \nnuclear materials out of the hands of their dangerous neighbors. \nEarlier this month the National Commission on Terrorism warned that it:\n\n       . . . was particularly concerned about the persistent lack \n     of adequate security and safeguards for the nuclear material \n     in the former Soviet Union.\n\n  That is a cogent concern, one my friend from Tennessee and I and \nothers have talked about on this floor. Export control assistance is \none of the programs that helps keep those dangerous materials from \ncrossing the former Soviet borders.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee is on record as favoring full funding \nof the request for this program. Indeed, it was suggested by Senator \nHelms we add another $5 million to our security assistance to support \nstrategic cargo X-ray facilities that would be used in the free port of \nMalta. Malta is a crossroads for shipping in the Mediterranean area and \nsometimes it has been the doorway for contraband flowing to Libya. You \nmight think appropriators\n\n[[Page S5588]]\n\nwould pay attention to such a sensible suggestion, but the Foreign \nOperations Appropriation bill did the opposite.\n  Another non-proliferation program, International Science and \nTechnology Centers, would provide safe employment opportunities for \nformer Soviet experts. There are thousands and thousands of Soviet \nexperts, nuclear experts. They are not getting paid. They don't have \nhousing. Their economy is in the toilet. We have a program: We want to \nhire them. We don't want Qadhafi hiring them. We don't want them being \nhired in Libya. We don't want them hired in North Korea. So we have a \nsensible program.\n  I will end with this. There are 4 more examples, but I will not take \nthe time.\n  What do we do? We cut these programs. Then we all stand--and I am not \nspeaking of any particular Senator--and say we are going to fight \nterrorism, and nonproliferation is our greatest concern, and we are \nworried about this technology changing hands. The bottom line is the \nprograms that help to do that are cut. That is why it is so important \nthat our amendment of yesterday be implemented in conference.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before proceeding to the bill, I \ncompliment my colleagues, the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator \nfrom Delaware, for their comments this morning, calling attention to \nthe major international problems on nuclear proliferation. This body \nwill soon be voting on legislation to have permanent normal trade \nrelations with China. As noted by the Senator from Tennessee, the \nPeople's Republic of China happens to be a major violator in \nproliferating nuclear weapons. They sent the M-11 missiles to Pakistan, \nwhich have been the basis for the nuclear arms confrontation between \nIndia and Pakistan. They have helped to proliferate weapons in Iran and \nNorth Korea. It is my view that the best way to restrain the People's \nRepublic of China from posing an enormous international threat is to \ncontinue to give them permanent trade relations on an annual basis.\n  I have discussed this many times with my distinguished colleague from \nTennessee. I hope he will join me in ultimately opposing normal trade \nrelations as the best leverage to try to keep the people's Republic of \nChina in line.\n  We have seen, again and again, problems that the executive branch \ncannot be, candidly, relied upon, with waivers being granted. \nSeparation of powers has been established. The Senate is here and the \nHouse is here in order to see that there is another view about what is \nhappening with China. The most effective leverage is to have an annual \ncheckup on them, and to have the normal trade relations as the \nleverage, which would be very, very important.\n  I urge my colleague from Tennessee and others to consider that when \nthat vote comes up. There is more involved in that issue than just the \nmoney; the future of civilization may be on the line if we do not \ncontain the People's Republic of China from proliferating weapons of \nmass destruction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5588-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3590\n\n  (The text of the amendment (No. 3590) is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to make the opening \nstatement on the pending appropriations bill for the Departments of \nLabor, Health, Human Services and Education. The subcommittee, which \nthe distinguished Senator from Iowa and I work on, has the \nresponsibility for funding these three very important and major \ndepartments. We have come forward with a bill which has program level \nfunding of $104.5 billion. While that seems like a lot of money--and is \na lot of money--by the time you handle the priorities for the nation's \nhealth, by the time you handle the priorities for the nation's \neducation--and the Federal Government is a relatively minor \nparticipant, 7 percent to 8 percent, but an important participant--and \nby the time you take care of the Department of Labor and very important \nitems on worker safety, it is tough to find adequate funding.\n  We have structured this bill in collaboration with requests from \nvirtually all Members of the Senate who have had something to say about \nwhat the funding priorities should be based on their extensive \nexperience across the 50 States of the United States. We have come \nforward on the Department of Education with a funding budget in excess \nof $40 billion, more than $4.6 billion more than last year, and some \n$100 million over the President's request. We have established the \npriorities which the Congress sees fit. We have increased the maximum \nPell grants. We have increased special education by $1.3 billion, \ntrying to do a share of the Federal Government on that important item. \nWe have increased grants for the disadvantaged by almost $400 million.\n  We have moved on the Department of Health and Human Services for a \ntotal budget of over $44 billion, which is an increase of almost $2.5 \nbillion over last year. We have increased Head Start by some $1 \nbillion, so it is now in excess of $6 billion. We have structured a new \ndrug demand reduction initiative, taking the very substantial funds \nwhich are available within our subcommittee, and redirecting $3.7 \nbillion to try to deal with the demand reduction issue.\n  It is my view that demand reduction is the long-range answer--that \nand rehabilitation--to the drug problem in America. We may be spending \nin excess of $1 billion soon in aid to Colombia, and it is my view that \nthere is an imbalance in the $18 billion which we now spend, with two-\nthirds--about $12 billion--going to so-called supply interdiction and \nfighting street crime. They are important. As district attorney of \nPhiladelphia, my office was very active in fighting street crime \nagainst drug dealers.\n  In the long run, unless we are able to reduce demand for drugs in the \nUnited States, suppliers from Latin America will find a way to grow \ndrugs, and sellers on America's street corners will find ways to \ndistribute it, which is why we have made this initiative to try to come \nto grips with the demand side.\n  Last year, we structured a program to deal with youth violence \nprevention. We have increased the funding by some $280 million so that \nnow it is being directed in a coordinated way against youth violence, \nand some substantial progress has been made in the almost intervening \nyear since this program was initiated.\n  A very substantial increase in funding has been provided in this bill \nfor the National Institutes of Health. I would suggest that of all the \nitems for program level funding in this $104.5 billion bill, the \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health may well be the most \nimportant.\n  I frequently say that the NIH is the crown jewel of the Federal \nGovernment, and add to that, in fact, it may be the only jewel of the \nFederal Government. Senator Harkin and I, in conjunction with \nCongressman Porter and Congressman Obey on the House side, have taken \nthe lead on NIH. Four years ago, we added almost $1 billion; 3 years \nago we added $2 billion; last year we added $2.3 billion, which was cut \nslightly in across-the-board cuts to\n\n[[Page S5589]]\n\nabout $2.2 billion; and this year we are adding $2.7 billion.\n  There have been phenomenal achievements by NIH in a broad variety of \nmaladies. There is nothing more important than health. Without health, \nnone of us can function. It is so obvious and so fundamental.\n  These maladies strike virtually all Americans. I will enumerate the \ndiseases which NIH is combating and making enormous progress: \nAlzheimer's disease, AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as \nLou Gehrig's disease, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, \ncancers--leukemia, breast, prostate, pancreatic, lung, ovarian--heart \ndisease, stroke, asthma, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, \nautism, osteoporosis, hepatitis C, arthritis, cystic fibrosis, \ndiabetes, kidney disease, and mental health.\n  I daresay that there is not a family in America not touched directly \nby one of these ailments. For a country which has a gross national \nproduct of $8 trillion and a Federal budget of $1.85 trillion, this is \nnot too much money to be spending on NIH. We are striving to fulfill \nthe commitment that the Senate made to double NIH funding in the course \nof 5 years. We are doing a lot. We are not quite meeting that target, \nbut we are determined to succeed at it.\n  This bill also includes $11.6 billion for the Department of Labor, an \nincrease for Job Corps, an increase for youth offenders, trying to deal \nwith juvenile offenders to stop them from becoming recidivous. There is \nno doubt if one takes a functional illiterate without a trade or skill \nand releases that functional illiterate without a skill from prison, \nthat illiterate, unable to cope in society, is likely to return to a \nlife of crime. Focusing on youthful offenders, we think, is very \nimportant.\n  We have met the President's figures on occupational safety and \nhealth, NLRB, mine safety, and for a specific problem we have topped \nthe President's figure slightly by $2.5 million, seeing the ravages of \nblack lung and mine safety-related programs that I have personally \nobserved both in Pennsylvania's anthracite region in the northeastern \npart of my State and the bituminous area in the western part of my \nState.\n\n  I was dismayed when the subcommittee came forward with its budget to \nhave the President immediately articulate a veto message. I note my \ndistinguished colleague from Iowa nodding in the affirmative. He did a \nlittle more during the Appropriations Committee markup and not in the \naffirmative. I left it to my colleague to have a comment or two about \nthe President of his own party. I learned a long time ago, after coming \nto the Senate, that we have to cross party lines if we want to get \nanything done in this town.\n  I am pleased and proud to say Senator Harkin and I have established a \nworking partnership. When he chaired this subcommittee, I was the \nranking member. I like it better when I chair and he is the ranking \nmember. He spoke up in very forceful terms criticizing the President, \nthe President's men, and the President's women for coming forward with \nthat veto statement when we have strained to put together this total \nbill of $104.5 billion, and it has been tough going to get the \nallocations from the Appropriations Committee.\n  I thank Senator Stevens, the chairman, and Senator Byrd, the ranking \nmember, for coming up with this money. When the President asked for \n$1.3 billion for construction and $1.4 billion for additional teachers \nand class size, we put that money in the budget. We did add, however, \nthat if the local boards make a determination, factually based, that \nthe money is better used in some other line, the local school boards \ncan spend the money in that line, giving priority to what the President \nhas asked for, but recognizing that cookie cutters do not apply to all \nschool districts in America.\n  We have structured some different priorities in this bill. The last \ntime I read the Constitution, it was Congress who had the principal \nauthority on appropriations. It is true the President must sign the \nbill, but to issue a veto threat after the subcommittee reports out a \nbill, before the full committee acts on it, before the full Senate acts \non it, before there is a conference seems to me to be untoward.\n  Regrettably, in the past, this bill has not been finished until after \nthe end of the fiscal year, so we have been unable to engage in a \ndiscussion with the President and a discussion with the American people \nabout what are the priorities established by Congress. I emphasize that \nthis is a bill which receives input from virtually all Members. We have \nhundreds of letters which pour into this subcommittee which we \nconsider, and the same is true on the House side. This is no small \nmatter as to who may be assessing the priorities for America. For the \nPresident to say his priorities are the only ones to be considered \nseems to me untoward.\n  That is as noncritical a word as I can fashion at the moment. I thank \nthe majority leader, Senator Lott, for scheduling this bill early. We \nintend to conference this bill promptly with the House and have a bill \nready for final passage in July--hopefully in early July--and then let \nus see the President's reaction.\n  We are prepared to take to the American people the basic concept that \nif school districts do not need additional buildings, they ought to be \nable to use their share of the $1.3 billion for something else. If some \nschool districts do not have a problem with the number of teachers they \nhave, they ought to be able to use their share of the $1.4 billion for \nsomething else.\n  This is a very brief statement of a very complicated bill.\n  At the outset, I thank my colleague, Senator Harkin, for his \ndiligence and his close cooperation in bringing the bill to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Labor-HHS bill has \nreached the floor relatively early this year. In the past few years, we \nhave been sort of on the caboose end of the train.\n  It is an extremely important bill. It addresses many issues that are \nvital to the strength of our Nation--our health, education, job \ntraining, the administration of Social Security and Medicare, \nbiomedical research, and child care, just to name a few.\n  Given its importance, I think it should be one of the first \nappropriations bills considered. But this is certainly the earliest \nthis bill has gotten to the floor in many years. I am thankful for \nthat.\n  At the outset, I thank my chairman, Senator Specter, and his great \nstaff for their hard work in putting together this bill. As usual, \nSenator Specter has done so in a professional and bipartisan fashion. \nWe all owe him a debt of gratitude for his patience.\n  This is always one of the most difficult bills to put together. This \nyear the job has been especially difficult. I also thank the chairman \nof the full committee, Senator Stevens, and the ranking member, Senator \nByrd, for their support this year. Their help has been invaluable.\n  Before I say a few words about the contents of the bill, I think it \nis important to briefly discuss this year's budget resolution because \nwe operate within its framework.\n  I believe this year's budget resolution shortchanged funding for \nimportant discretionary activities, including education, health, and \njob training. The funds were, instead, used to give tax cuts to the \nwealthy and to give the Department of Defense more money than it even \nrequested. Our subcommittee's inadequate allocation was the inevitable \nresult of that ill-advised budget resolution.\n  But that allocation forced our subcommittee to reach outside its \nnormal jurisdiction to find mandatory offsets to fund the critical \nprograms in this bill. Some may criticize the bill for that reason. \nSome of those criticisms are valid.\n  For example, I hope to work with my colleagues--hopefully when we get \nto conference--to reverse the reductions in social services block \ngrants.\n  There are many good provisions in this bill. It increases funding for \nNIH, as Senator Specter said, by a historic amount, $2.7 billion. \nEducation programs are increased by $4.6 billion. Head Start is \nincreased by $1 billion.\n  The $2.7 billion increase for NIH will keep us on our way to doubling \nNIH funding over 5 years. We are on the verge of tremendous biomedical \nbreakthroughs as we decode the mysteries of the human genome and \nexplore the uses of human stem cells. We are doing the right thing by \ncontinuing to support important biomedical research.\n\n[[Page S5590]]\n\n  The bill increases funding for child care from the $1.2 billion level \nlast year to $2 billion this year. The availability, affordability, and \nquality of child care are major concerns for working families, and they \ndesperately need these funds. Only about 1 in every 10 eligible \nchildren is served by this program. These dollars will go to working \nAmericans who really need the help.\n  Again, I want to make sure the record reflects that last year, during \nour negotiations, our chairman, Senator Specter, guaranteed that we \nwould have this increase this year. He lived up to that commitment. We \nhad a tremendous increase in the child care program, and we thank \nSenator Specter for his commitment and for keeping his word to get that \nincrease for child care this year.\n  I am proud we could also increase funding for education programs by, \nas I said, $4.6 billion. That includes a $350 increase in the maximum \nPell grant to $3,650, the highest ever.\n  In this year that we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, the bill includes a $1.3 billion increase in \nfunding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA.\n  We have also funded a new Office of Disability Policy at the \nDepartment of Labor. At HHS, we were able to add funds for several \nother programs funded under the Developmental Disabilities Act.\n  This bill also places great importance on women's health and includes \nover $4 billion for programs that address the health needs of women. I \nagain might add that Senator Specter and I worked together on a women's \nhealth initiative that is part and parcel of this bill, and that is \nwhat that $4 billion is for.\n  The bill also includes a $50 million line item to address the issue \nof medical errors and to help health care practitioners and health care \ninstitutions, hospitals, and other health care facilities, to begin the \nprocess of developing methodologies and ways of cutting down on medical \nerrors.\n  Medical errors are now the fifth leading cause of death in America. \nAs we have looked at this, we found it is not just one person or one \ninstitution or one cause; there is a whole variety of different \nreasons. Quite frankly, I think our institutions and our practitioners \nhave not kept up with the new technologies of today which in most of \nthe private sector have helped us so much with productivity and which I \nbelieve in the health care sector can really help us cut down on \nmedical errors. But that is what that $50 million is there to do.\n  The bill is not without its problems. As I mentioned, we do have a \nproblem with the social services block grant. Hopefully, we will get \nthis bill to conference and we will be able to fix that at that time.\n  Also, the provisions in the bill that have the money for school \nmodernization and for class size reductions are not targeted enough. \nThey are just broadly thrown in there. Again, we had this battle last \nyear. When it finally came down to it, the Congress agreed with the \nWhite House, in a partnership, that we needed to put the money in there \nfor class size reduction. I believe the same needs to be done for \nschool modernization.\n  We only put in 7 cents out of every dollar that goes for elementary \nand secondary education in America. We only provide 7 cents. A lot of \nthat goes for, as I said, the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct. A lot of that goes for title I programs to help low-income areas. \nWhen it is all over with, we have just a penny or two left of every \ndollar that we can give out to elementary and secondary schools.\n  So when we put in money for school modernization, we ought to make \nsure that is what it goes for. Schools desperately need this money. Our \nproperty taxpayers all over this country are getting hit, time and time \nagain, to pay more in property taxes, which can be very regressive, to \nhelp pay for modernizing their schools.\n  As we know, most of the schools need to be modernized; they have \nleaky roofs, and toilets that won't flush, water that is bad, and air \nconditioning--a lot of times they don't even have air conditioning--\nheating plants that are inadequate. As I pointed out, one out of every \nfour elementary and secondary schools in New York City today are still \nheated by coal. And again, these tend to be in the lowest income areas. \nSo we need to target that money. It is not in this bill. That is one of \nthe problems with it. Again, I hope we can work that out as we go to \nconference.\n  It is a national disgrace that the nicest places our children see are \nshopping malls, sports arenas, and movie theaters, and the most run \ndown places they see are their public schools. Again, we have to fix \nthese in conference.\n  I thank Senator Specter, once again, for being so open and working \nwith us in a very strong bipartisan fashion.\n  We worked together to shape this bill. Overall, it is a good bill, \nwith a few exceptions that we have to fix once we go to conference.\n  I want to make clear, I support the bill in its present form. I hope \nwe get a good vote on it as it leaves here and goes to conference. I \nreserve my right, however, on the conference report, when it comes \nback. I am hopeful we can get it to conference with a strong vote, sit \ndown with our House counterparts, and work out our differences. \nHopefully, we can come back to the floor having fixed the class size, \nschool modernization, and social services block grant problems we have \nin this bill.\n  I thank Chairman Specter for working in a bipartisan fashion. I hope \nwe can get through this bill reasonably rapidly today, hopefully get to \nconference next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the amendment has been offered dealing \nwith ergonomics, and it is not an unexpected amendment. This has been a \ncontentious issue on this bill for many years. We have had the matter \nbefore. I have conferred with Senator Harkin, and there is no doubt we \nought to proceed with the debate and let people have their say and let \nus see how the debate progresses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to make sure we understand late today \nthat we are not the ones who have offered this contentious amendment. \nThis is a very important bill that involves hundreds of billions of \ndollars. The two managers have worked on this, and they have a bill we \ncan make presentable to the rest of the Senate. I just want to make \nsure, when I am called upon, and others are called upon, we are not the \nones who offered this contentious amendment. We are not going to move \noff this amendment--that is the point I am making--until it is resolved \none way or the other. If there is some concern about that, I think the \npeople who want this bill moved should try to invoke cloture. It won't \nbe invoked, but that is the only alternative.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3594, As Modified\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I send a modification of my amendment \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3594), as modified, reads as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word, and insert the following:\n       None of the funds made available in this Act may be used by \n     the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to \n     promulgate, issue, implement, administer, or enforce any \n     proposed, temporary, or final standard on ergonomic \n     protection.\n       This amendment shall take effect October 2, 2000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, let me just make an observation. I hear \nthe threats that they are going to filibuster this amendment. This \namendment deals with Labor-HHS appropriations. The Senate has the right \nto vote on whether or not we are going to spend the money in the \nDepartment of Labor to implement regulations that have a dramatic \nimpact on business, on workers. We have a right to vote on it. The \nHouse voted on it; the Senate is going to vote on it.\n  We have voted on this amendment in one way or another almost every \nyear since 1995. This is not a new issue. So now some people are \nsaying, wait a minute, we are not going to take this tough vote. Didn't \nwe just have a vote on hate crimes? I think we had two. Didn't we have \na vote on campaign finance? Some people didn't want to vote on those \ntwo issues on this side of the aisle. Didn't we vote on a Patients' \nBill of Rights?\n  Really, what the minority is saying is, we want to vote on our \nissues, but not on an issue that is relevant. Every amendment I just \nmentioned was not relevant to the underlying Department of Defense \nauthorization bill. But still we ended up allowing those votes. We \ndidn't have to. Now we have a relevant amendment to the underlying \nbill, Labor-HHS, the Department of Labor appropriations bill. We think \nthe administration is going too far in the proposed regulations which \nthey planned on having effective in December--these regulations the \nClinton administration is trying to run through without significant \nhearings and without oversight and real analysis of how much it would \ncost.\n  Here is an example. On cost alone, the Department of Labor said--OSHA \nsaid--this regulation will cost $4 billion. The Small Business \nAdministration, which they control, said the cost could be 15 times as \nmuch, or $60 billion a year. This Congress is not going to vote on a \nregulation that could cost $60 billion a year as estimated by the Small \nBusiness Administration? The private sector estimates range to over \n$100 billion per year. Wow, that is a lot of money. Shouldn't we vote \non it?\n  Are these good regulations or not? Are we going to be able to stop \nthem or not? Do we want to stop them? What are the regulations? They \ndeal with ergonomics and with motion. OSHA--the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration--is saying: We want to have some control over \nmotion, and we think maybe this is harmful, and therefore we are going \nto control it. It may mean lifting boxes, or sitting at your desk, or \nanything minuscule, or something large.\n  The Department of Labor is coming in and saying: You need a remedy, \nyou need to change the way you do business, because we know how to do \nyour business better, and if it increases costs, that is too bad--not \nto mention the fact that they say we are going to change workers comp \nrules in every State in the Nation. I wonder what Senator Byrd from \nWest Virginia thinks about changing workers comp rules in West \nVirginia.\n  I used to serve in the Oklahoma legislature. I worked on those laws \nand rules in our State. Are we going to have the Federal Government \ncome up with a reimbursement rate of 90 percent when our State already \npassed a workers comp rule of 67 percent? Does the Federal Government \nknow better?\n  My suggestion is that my colleagues from Arkansas and Wyoming, in \nintroducing this amendment, have every right to offer an amendment that \nsays: We are going to withhold funds on this regulation. We don't want \na regulation to go into effect in December without us having additional \ntime to consider it, without knowing how much it is going to cost. \nMaybe it should be postponed or suspended; maybe we should let the next \nadministration deal with it. Let's vote on it.\n\n  For people to say, wait a minute, we don't like this amendment, so we \nare going to filibuster--there are probably a lot of amendments I don't \nlike. Are we going to filibuster all of those? I think that would be \ngrossly irresponsible. We need to let the Senate work its way.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Would the Senator tell us under which Secretary of Labor \nand how long ago this proposed ergonomics rule was promulgated? How \nmany years of study have we put in on it?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The original rule came out, I believe, in 1995, and it \nmade very little sense. The latest proposal had over 600 pages. The \nbusiness community and others who looked at it said it was not \nworkable. The Department of Labor has come back and said let's revise \nit and make it more workable. Did they show us results? No. They said \nlet's overrule the States' workers comp.\n  If this went into effect--and I don't think it will, so maybe that is \nwhy people don't want to vote on it. But does this Congress really want \nto overrule every States' workers comp law? I don't think so. I think \nit would be a mistake.\n  To answer the question, this administration has been trying to \npromulgate this rule for about 5 years. We have been successful most of \nthose years in putting in restrictions to stop them. Unfortunately, we \ndidn't get it in last year. To me, it was one of the biggest mistakes \nCongress made last year--not stopping this administration. Now they are \ntrying to promulgate the rule, I might mention, right after the \nelections, right before the next President. I think a delay is \ncertainly in order.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question on that?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, it was my understanding that it was former \nSecretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole who first committed the Department to \nissue an ergonomic standard to protect workers on carpal tunnel \nsyndrome and MSDs, as they are called. It has been under study for 10 \nyears; is that right?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator is right.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I think he asked me. They may have been working on this \nDepartment of Labor takeover of, I don't know what--workers \ninvolvement. But they issued the rule on November 23 of last year--a \nrule that has 600 pages. They may have been working on it for 10 years, \nbut I doubt that. This administration hasn't been in office quite that \nlong. But with enormous expense.\n  I think, again, we should have a vote. To give an example, I came \nfrom manufacturing, and we lifted and moved a\n\n[[Page S5592]]\n\nlot of heavy things. I don't really think somebody from the Department \nof Labor could come into Nickles Machine Corporation and say: Hey, we \nknow the limits on what somebody can lift as far as pistons and \ncylinders and bearings are concerned. Therefore, we suggest you put a \nmaximum on it. Or maybe every Senator--everybody has a machine shop, or \nevery Senator has a bottling company. Somebody comes into the Senate \nevery day and loads the Coke machines and the Pepsi machines.\n  This rule says that you can't lift that many cases; that you can't \nlift two cases at once, or one case, or maybe you can only lift a six-\npack or something. The net result would be an estimate that bottlers \nwould have to hire twice as many people. Maybe this is an employment \nbill.\n  My point is you could increase costs dramatically with draconian \nresults without even knowing what we are doing.\n  I think a delay and not to have a regulation with this kind of \neconomic consequence coming right after the election and right before \nthe swearing in of a new administration makes good sense.\n  Let's postpone this until the next administration.\n  I thank my colleagues for their efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague has the floor. But could I \nhave my colleagues' forbearance for a 15-second request?\n  Mr. President, I would like to respond to some of what was said by \nthe Senator from Oklahoma; in other words, after Senator Enzi, and go \nback and forth on this, pro-con.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nspeech, Senator Wellstone be recognized as ranking member of the \nsubcommittee that deals with this, and I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Hutchinson be allowed to follow that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member. This is not a \nnew issue for either of us. We have been holding hearings on it. It has \nbeen in the press. We both knew about it. He was here to debate it. \nThis is not a surprise.\n  I am pleased that I am going to be able to make my floor statement. I \nthink perhaps after the floor statement maybe the other side would like \nto join me in proposing this amendment. I think there will definitely \nbe additional Members who will want to join me in this.\n  Mr. President, I rose today and offered an amendment that simply \nprohibits the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, from \nexpending funds to finalize its proposed ergonomics rule for 1 year. It \nwas mentioned before that last year we didn't get a prohibition against \nthem proceeding with it. You will hear in a bit how much that little \nerror has cost us.\n  But before I tell you why this amendment is critically necessary, I \nwant to tell you what this amendment is not about.\n  This amendment is not about whether or not OSHA should have any \nergonomics rule. It is not a prohibition on ergonomics regulations \ngenerally. And it is most definitely not a dispute over the importance \nof protecting American workers. Clearly protecting workplace safety and \nhealth is of paramount importance.\n  As the chairman of the subcommittee that deals with worker safety, I \nfeel a special responsibility to oversee the agency charged with \nsafeguarding these workers. But I am not fulfilling this responsibility \nif I merely rubber stamp anything OSHA does just because OSHA says it \nis acting in the interest of worker safety and health. I have a duty to \nmake certain that OSHA is acting responsibly, appropriately, and in the \nbest interests of workplace safety and health. Sadly, OSHA has not done \nso with this proposed ergonomic rule. That is what this amendment is \nabout.\n  Because of this rule and the way OSHA is going about it, the \namendment merely requires that OSHA wait a reasonable 1-year period \nbefore issuing a final ergonomics rule. That is to keep OSHA from \nmaking drastic mistakes to add to those already made.\n  Let me tell you why it is imperative that Congress act now to require \nOSHA to take this reasonable additional amount of time for this \nrulemaking.\n  In a nutshell, OSHA is using questionable rulemaking procedures; OSHA \nomitted the analysis of the economic impact; OSHA hasn't resolved \nconflicting laws; and this rule infringes on State workers \ncompensation--to name a few of the problems that riddle this overly \nambitious rule. OSHA's haste to get through the rulemaking process is \nvery clear. The rule OSHA has proposed is arguably the largest, \nbroadest, most onerous and most expensive rule in the history of the \nagency--probably any agency. But OSHA has made it very clear that it \nintends to finalize the rule this year--just over a year from the time \nthe proposed rule was published. This narrow-minded commitment to \nyear's end can only mean that OSHA has already made up its mind in \nfavor of the rule and thinks it will leave a mammoth and far-reaching \nlegacy for the current Presidential administration. I would suggest it \nwill be closer to the legacy of the OSHA home office inspections.\n  Perhaps you remember the letter issued by OSHA about the time we left \nfor Christmas recess, the one that suggested OSHA was going to go into \neach home where people work and look for safety violations. From the \ntime we found out about it, it only took 48 hours to see how far-\nreaching, imposing, and stupid that decision was. Of course, the whole \nNation realized the implications of the home inspections even quicker.\n  I am extremely concerned that OSHA is blinded by the motivation to \nget it done during this administration and is not taking the time to \ncarefully consider all the aspects and effects of this important rule.\n\n  For example, the public comment period for the proposed rule was much \nshorter than OSHA typically permits--even for much less significant \nrules. OSHA has never before finalized such a significant rule in a \nyear's time. Moreover, in its haste to get through this rulemaking \nprocess, OSHA, until recently, omitted an analysis of the economic \nimpact of the rule on the U.S. Postal Service, on State and local \ngovernment employees in State plans, and on railroad employees--all \ntogether, over 10 million employees. These aren't optional economic \nimpacts. These are mandatory, in light of the dollars involved. OSHA is \napparently so busy with other things that it did not do the analysis \nfor these entities until the end of last month, despite the fact that \nthe Postal Service requested an analysis 5 months prior.\n  To add insult to injury, OSHA has only given these folks 2\\1/2\\ \nmonths to comment on the complex analysis that OSHA forgot to do, and \nOSHA won't even consider extending the overall comment deadline for \nthese folks.\n  It is because they are trying to get it done this year. They have had \n5 months to prepare it, and they tell the Postal Service that they have \nto analyze it in 2\\1/2\\ months--no extension.\n  Even more troubling than the fact that OSHA is rushing the rule is \nthe way OSHA is going about it. OSHA's ambitions with this rule are so \nbig and overreaching that OSHA has truly bitten off more than it can \nchew, and may be playing fast and loose with the rulemaking process and \nyour tax dollars. In fact, OSHA has bitten off so much with this rule \nthat it is apparently paying others to chew for it--too big a bite. \nThey can't chew it all. So to make it happen in 1 year, they are going \nto pay others to do some of their chewing. I use the word \n``apparently'' because of the difficulty getting answers.\n  Responding to inquiries first made by Congressman David McIntosh, \nOSHA recently disclosed that it has paid at least 70 contractors a \ntotal of $1.75 million--almost $2 million--to help it with the \nergonomics rulemaking. They are paying these contractors with our tax \ndollars in order to speed the process up on a bad rule. Congressman \nMcIntosh's staff discovered that OSHA may have failed to disclose an \nadditional 47 contracts for who knows how much more money. OSHA's own \ndocumentation reveals that it paid 28 contractors $10,000 each to \ntestify at the public rulemaking hearing.\n  Going through some of the accounting information, I even noticed that \none contractor had turned in an\n\n[[Page S5593]]\n\nitemized bill for less--and was still paid the $10,000.\n  When I asked OSHA for evidence of public notification that it was \npaying these witnesses, OSHA gave me none. I am very concerned that \nOSHA is paying so much money for outside contracts for this rulemaking \nthat I intend to hold a hearing to get to the bottom of this issue. Let \nme state things I already know. I think you will be convinced, as I am, \nthat we absolutely need to put the brakes on this rulemaking and force \nOSHA to straighten this mess out before it finalizes the rule.\n  First, OSHA does not seem to want to have me have this information. \nSome of it is just good accounting stuff. As the only accountant in the \nSenate, I am really interested. I have requested documents from OSHA \nthat would give a clear picture of its relationship with some of these \ncontractors, but OSHA has so far refused to give them to me, claiming a \n``privilege.'' That applies to private citizens, not to Congress. We \nhave the right to know where the dollars that we are spending go, \nunequivocally.\n  Now, Congressman McIntosh has been able to obtain some key documents \nfrom the contractors themselves, but OSHA placed strict constraints on \nCongressman McIntosh's ability to share them with fellow lawmakers. \nThis is stuff that came from the contractors, and OSHA can still get \nits hands in and keep us from using it the way it ought to be used. \nOSHA did grudgingly agree that I could look at the documents--not take \nthem or copy them or quote from them--but only in Congressman \nMcIntosh's office. When I asked OSHA, as a courtesy, to permit \nCongressman McIntosh's staff member, Barbara Kahlow, to bring the \ndocuments to me, just to look at them, abiding by the rules, OSHA said \nno.\n  I am so concerned about this issue that I went over to Congressman \nMcIntosh's office last night after I finished working at the Senate to \nlook at these documents for myself. Now, fortunately, Congressman \nMcIntosh's negotiations made that possible.\n  Can anyone believe that documents concerning money we are spending \nhave to have special negotiations before I can look at them? It comes \nunder my committee. I am in charge of the oversight on that committee. \nLet me recap that: I was told that the contracts and expenditures are \nprivileged. I was told that information couldn't be brought to my \noffice. I was told I could not copy any information. I was told I could \nnot quote any information. I was told that I couldn't quote from the \ndocuments. I had to use extra time to go to the House side to even see \nthose documents. I am not afraid of a little walk over to the House. I \njust couldn't understand why OSHA was going to so much trouble to keep \nthe documents from me. I physically went to Congressman McIntosh's \noffice last night and looked at the documents.\n  Because of OSHA, I can't quote these documents. I can't show you \ncopies. But I can tell you what I saw. I saw that not only did OSHA pay \n28 expert witnesses $10,000 a pop, and one of them didn't even ask for \nthat much, it also appears that OSHA did the following: OSHA gave \ndetailed outlines to at least some of the witnesses telling them what \nthey were to say in the testimony; second, they had OSHA lawyers tell \nat least one expert witness that they wanted a stronger statement from \nthe witness regarding the role of physical factors. That is \nan important scientific issue. These are supposed to be experts. They \ntold him to make it stronger. Third, heavily edited testimony of at \nleast some of the witnesses is evidenced. OSHA held practice sessions \nto coach the witnesses in their testimony. I have never heard of that \naround here. This sounds a lot like OSHA told its expert witnesses what \nto say. This sounds like OSHA made up its mind a long time ago in \nfavor, and has been stacking the evidence to support its position.\n\n  I respect OSHA's need to enlist expert assistance in technical or \nscientific rulemaking. I expect them to get the right information. I \nwould like to think it wasn't biased when they got it. And I have to \nsay, I don't respect any agency paying witnesses to say what the agency \ntells them to say, and then holding the witnesses' testimony up as \n``best available evidence.'' Best available evidence is what the OSH \nAct requires to support this standard. It doesn't say anything about \npaying witnesses or coaching witnesses. It doesn't say anything about \ntelling them to change their testimony.\n  How can OSHA expect the public and Congress to have any confidence \nthat it is promulgating regulations in the best interest of worker \nsafety and health if it is asking supposed experts to tell OSHA what it \nwants to hear, so OSHA can promulgate whatever rule the administration \nthinks is in its own interest?\n  That has been the problem with the past years of looking at \nregulating ergonomics. OSHA makes up the rules. OSHA does the tests. \nOSHA says their tests are good. OSHA gets ready to propose a rule and \nrealizes they have made a drastic mistake. That has happened in the \npast. That is why this little document is the first published proposed \nergonomics regulation. It didn't happen until November of last year. \nThis document, this is the first time we have gotten a look at this \ndocument. It is the first time it has been officially printed.\n  How can OSHA expect the public and Congress to have any confidence in \nits promulgating regulations in the best interest of worker safety and \nhealth if it is asking supposed experts to tell OSHA what it wants to \nhear, and has already told them what to say, so that OSHA can \npromulgate whatever rule the administration thinks is in its own \ninterest? No wonder OSHA has promulgated such a greedy, overreaching \nrule.\n  Maybe I could pass all the OSHA reform legislation I wanted if I \ncould pay 28 witnesses $10,000 apiece to come in and say what I wanted \nthem to say in my hearings. Does that seem like a conflict of interest?\n  I wouldn't do things that way. In fact, we had a hearing recently \nabout one of the most objectionable parts of this rule, the work \nrestriction protection provisions. I will talk about those in a few \nminutes. We had to tell one of the witnesses we selected that we \ncouldn't pay his transportation costs--not a $10,000 bonus to testify; \nwe couldn't pay his transportation costs. We did this in part for \nfinancial reasons and in part because we wanted to avoid the appearance \nof impropriety that can result from spending taxpayers' dollars on a \nwitness who is supposed to be giving an unbiased opinion. This witness \ncame to Washington anyway--on his own dime. He didn't have his State \npay for it. He paid for it out of his pocket to testify at my hearing \nbecause he felt so strongly about the terrible effects of this \nergonomics rule.\n  Needless to say, I am very disturbed by what I have seen to date \nabout this issue. OSHA's response is that it has always paid witnesses \nfor their testimony. I can't find that in any public documents. I can't \nfind that disclosure. I can't find where they actually said that they \nwere paying them, and this was paid testimony. It seems that ought to \nbe disclosed. Whether or not this is true, it remains to be seen \nwhether OSHA has ever paid this many witnesses this much money and \nparticipated this thoroughly in crafting the substance of a witness' \ntestimony. OSHA has also tried to give me the typical excuse of a \nteenager caught doing something wrong: Hey, everybody is doing it.\n\n  To that, let me first respond with the typical, but sage parental \nresponse: If everybody were jumping off a bridge, would OSHA jump off a \nbridge, too? That doesn't sound like good safety to me.\n  Second, everybody is most certainly not doing it. Representatives of \nboth the Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection \nAgency, two agencies that promulgate lots of supertechnical \nregulations, dealing with scientific things, have stated publicly that \nthey do not pay expert witnesses, except possibly for travel expenses.\n  Let me say that again. The Department of Transportation and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, agencies that promulgate lots of \nsupertechnical regulations, have stated publicly--you can read it in \nthe paper--that they do not pay expert witnesses, except possibly for \ntravel expenses. As the DOT general counsel put it ``Paying experts \nwould not get us what we need to know.''\n\n  Finally, just because OSHA may have these things in the past, in my \nbook that does not make this practice OK in this instance. On the \ncontrary, it\n\n[[Page S5594]]\n\nmakes any other instances of witness coaching equally objectionable. \nTwo wrongs don't make a right. We can't do anything about past \nrulemakings, but we can do something about this one--if we act now.\n  Clearly, more needs to be learned about this subject, but if we don't \npass this amendment, OSHA is going to forge ahead and finalize a \ndocument that they have already determined is the perfect answer even \nbefore the comments have been sifted through. They will finalize a \npossibly--no, almost assuredly--be a tainted rule, and we won't have \nanother opportunity to stop them. A vote for this amendment makes \ncertain that we will have sufficient time to conduct a thorough \ncongressional investigation into this issue and force OSHA to clean up \nits rulemaking procedures if necessary.\n  Lest you think my concerns about this rule are only procedural, rest \nassured these procedural concerns are only half the problem here. This \nrule has serious substantive flaws. Much has been written and debated \nabout the many problems with this rule--its vagueness, its coverage of \npreexisting and non-work related injuries, the harshness of its single \ntrigger. I expect you have all heard something about these topics and \nmy colleagues will talk more about these later today. In my \ninvestigation of the rule, I found two particularly troubling issues. \nBoth involve the reach of the long arm of this overly ambitious rule \ninto arenas outside of OSHA's jurisdiction--both with disastrous \neffects.\n  First, the rule will have a devastating effect on patients and \nfacilities dependent on Medicaid and Medicare.\n  OSHA has created a potential conflict between the ergonomics rule and \nhealth care regulations. Congress recognized the importance to patient \ndignity of permitting patients to choose how they are moved and how \nthey receive certain types of care when it passed the Nursing Home Act \nof 1987. This act and corresponding regulations mandate this important \nfreedom of choice for patients. The ergonomics rule, on the other hand \nimposes many requirements on all health care facilities and providers \nconcerning patient care and movement. Thus, these facilities and \nproviders may be forced to choose between violating the ergonomics rule \nor violating both the Nursing Home Act and the patient dignity.\n  Moreover, OSHA's rule forces impossible choices about resource \nallocation between patient care versus employee care. The only way for \nbusinesses to absorb the cost of this rule under any situation is to \npass the cost along to consumers. However, some ``consumers'' are \npatients dependent on Medicaid and Medicare. The Federal Government \nsets an absolute cap on what these individuals can pay for medical \nservices. Thus, the facilities that provide care for these patients \nsimply cannot charge a higher cost.\n  Simply put, these facilities and providers are unable to absorb the \ncost of the ergonomics rule. And there is no question these facilities \nwill face a cost. OSHA's own estimate of the cost of compliance in the \nfirst year will total $526 million for nursing and personal care \nfacilities and residential care. And you have to remember, we are \nsaying that they really use conservative, from their point of view, \nestimates of costs. The industry estimates that the per-facility cost \nfor a typical nursing home will be $60,000. But my issue with this rule \nis not that it will cost these facilities so much money--it is that it \nwill cost elderly and poor patients access to quality care. You have \nprobably heard about some of the facilities going out of business \nbecause of some appropriations measures we passed. We have corrected \nthem a little bit. But my issue with this is not what it will cost \nthese facilities, but what it will cost the elderly and the poor in \naccess to quality care. Sadly these patients are already in danger of \nlosing quality care. Many facilities dependent on Medicaid and Medicare \nare in serious financial straits due in part to the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1997. Ten percent of nursing homes are already in bankruptcy. And \nthe Clinton administration just announced a request for an additional \n$20 billion for Medicaid and Medicare so that the reimbursement cap can \nbe raised. All this is before the costly ergonomics rule places its \nadditional tax on an already overtaxed system. Implementing this \nsweeping and expensive proposed ergonomics standard is simply more than \nthis industry can bear.\n\n  Let me assure those who say this Medicaid/Medicare quandary will not \nhave very broad impact--let me assure them that it will. Nearly 80 \npercent of all patients in Nursing Homes and over 8 million home health \npatients are dependent on Medicare or Medicaid. How will these patients \nreceive health care if the ergonomics rule forces nursing homes and \nhome health organizations out of business? The answer is, they won't. \nBut it does not appear that OSHA has even considered that consequence. \nPerhaps OSHA is assuming that Congress will clean up after it by \nraising reimbursement rates to accommodate OSHA's rule? If this is the \ncase, then OSHA itself has invited us to step in, prohibit OSHA from \nfinalizing this rule and OSHA back to the drawing board. A vote in \nfavor of this amendment will ensure that OSHA resolves the mess its \nrule creates for providers and patients before issuing a final rule. \nThat ought to be a basic consideration for us in this body.\n  The second problem I am very concerned with is OSHA's encroachment \ninto State workers' compensation. A provision of the rule would require \nemployers to compensate certain injured employees 90 to 100 percent of \ntheir salary. OSHA calls this requirement ``work restriction \nprotection'' or WRP. But it sounds an awful lot like workers' \ncompensation doesn't it? They told us they don't have the money to do \nthe job, and now OSHA apparently wants a new job--to be a Workers \nCompensation Administration. That is why we held a hearing, to see what \nwas involved in that. But there are two problems with that. First, the \nstatute that created OSHA tells us that OSHA is not to meddle with \nworkers' compensation. Second, OSHA's intrusion into the world of \nworkers' compensation will hinder its ability to perform its true and \nvery important function--improving workplace safety and health. All of \nthe States already do Workers Comp.\n  Thirty years ago, when Congress wrote the Occupational Health and \nSafety Act, it made an explicit statement about OSHA and workers' \ncompensation. It wrote that the act should not be interpreted to:\n\n       . . . supersede or in any manner affect any workmen's \n     compensation law, or to enlarge or diminish or affect in any \n     other manner the common law or statutory rights, duties, or \n     liabilities of employers and employees under any law with \n     respect to injuries, diseases, or death of employees arising \n     out of, or in the course of, employment.\n\n  Twice this provision uses the broad phrase ``affect in any manner'' \nto describe what OSHA should not do to State workers' compensation. As \nsomeone with the privilege of being one of this country's lawmakers, it \nis hard for me to imagine how Congress could have drafted a broader or \nmore explicit prohibition on OSHA's interference with State workers' \ncompensation.\n  Perhaps more importantly, this provision of the law makes good sense. \nAll 50 States have intricate workers' compensation systems that strike \na delicate balance between the employer and employee. Each party gives \nup certain rights in exchange for certain benefits.\n  For example, an employer gives up the ability to argue that a \nworkplace accident was not its fault, but in exchange receives a \npromise that the employee cannot pursue any other remedies against it. \nThe injury gets taken care of, the injury gets paid for, and the worker \ngets compensated.\n  Each State has reached its own balance through years of experience \nand trial and error. Many of us have served in State legislatures where \none of the perpetual questions coming before the legislature is changes \nto workers compensation. It is a very intricate process.\n  Significantly, Congress has never taken this autonomy away from the \nStates by mandating Federal workers compensation requirements and, in \nfact, put those statements in, to which I referred earlier, where they \nare clearly not to get into workers compensation. The States have \nspecial mechanisms set up for resolving disputes and vindicating rights \nunder the workers compensation systems.\n  OSHA wants to create its own Federal workers compensation system, but\n\n[[Page S5595]]\n\nonly for musculoskeletal disorders, MSDs. But OSHA does not have the \nmechanisms or the manpower to decide the numerous disputes that \ninevitably will arise because of the WRP provision. I ask all Senators \nto talk with their State workers compensation people. I have not found \nany of them who did not think this was intrusive, who did not think \nthis gets into their business which they have crafted for years and \nyears.\n  OSHA does not have the mechanisms or the manpower these States have \nto decide the numerous disputes that will arise. All of a sudden, OSHA \nwill have to decide disputes over the existence of medical conditions, \nthe causation of the medical conditions, the right to compensation.\n  But what happens to workplace safety and health while OSHA is being a \nworkers compensation administration? The devastating effect on workers \ncompensation has been recognized by workers compensation commissioners \nacross the country. The Western Governors' Association has issued a \nresolution harshly criticizing the WRP provisions. Moreover, Charles \nJeffress met with a large group of workers compensation administrators, \nand when I asked him how many spoke in favor of this provision, he \nanswered: None. It was not quite that definite, but he answered \ndefinitely none.\n  Significantly, this meeting took place before the proposed rule was \npublished, so Mr. Jeffress obviously did not take their lack of support \nto heart in drafting the proposed rule.\n  If this lack of responsiveness is any indication, we can have no \nconfidence OSHA will take this provision out of the final rule. A vote \nfor this amendment ensures that OSHA will have to take additional time \nto consider all the negative feedback it has received on this issue \nalone. Hopefully, with this additional time, OSHA will recognize that \nit should stay out of the workers compensation business and get back to \nthe important business of truly protecting this country's working men \nand women.\n  From all of these facts and circumstances, I hope it is as clear to \nyou as it is to me that OSHA is not ready to take sensible, informed, \nreliable action on ergonomics. Unfortunately, it is equally clear that \nOSHA is going to push forward anyway unless we take some action. \nBecause of the magnitude of this issue, it is absolutely imperative \nthat cool heads prevail over politics. We must ensure that OSHA takes \nthe time to investigate and solve problems with the rule without taking \nshortcuts. Nobody puts them under the deadline except themselves, but \nthey are obviously convinced of the deadline.\n  If we do not act now to impose a reasonable 1-year delay of the \nfinalization of the rule, OSHA will forge ahead and produce a sloppy \nfinal product that not only fails to advance worker health and safety, \nbut also threatens the viability of State workers compensation, health \ncare, the poor and elderly, not to mention businesses all across the \ncountry.\n  If even one of these issues I raised troubles you--and I think they \nshould all trouble all of us deeply--then you must recognize the \ndesperate need for a 1-year delay.\n  I urge your support of this amendment. I am joined in offering this \namendment by my colleagues, Senators Lott, Nickles, Jeffords, Bond, \nHutchinson, Brownback, Sessions, Hagel, DeWine, Crapo, Bennett, \nThompson, Burns, Collins, Frist, Gregg, Coverdell, Voinovich, \nFitzgerald, Abraham, Snowe, Ashcroft, Grams, Hutchison, Thomas, and \nAllard. I ask unanimous consent that they all be added to the amendment \nas original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the \namendment that will ensure we have this delay to do it right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do not know quite where to start. My \ncolleague from Oklahoma had said earlier, and both my friends from \nWyoming and Arkansas had said, we ought to have a debate. We will. We \nought to be focusing on this issue. We will focus on this issue.\n  There are many important issues we should focus on in the Senate. \nThis is an important issue. I want to speak about it. In my State, by \nthe way, two-thirds of senior citizens have no prescription drug \ncoverage at all. I would like to focus on that issue. I would like to \nmake sure 700,000 Medicare recipients have coverage. Education, title \nI--I would like to talk about a lot of different issues, but this issue \nis before us. I hope we will be able to speak to many different issues \nin several months to come.\n  First, my colleague, Senator Enzi, complains about the rule, but \nthere is no final rule. It is not final yet. That is the point. OSHA, \nwhich is doing exactly what it should do, Secretary Jeffress is doing \nexactly what he should do by law--holding hearings, getting input--they \nare going to issue a final rule. They have not issued a final rule.\n  My colleague jumps to conclusions and joins the effort over 10 years \nto block a rule, but the rule has not been made. There may be \nsignificant changes. When my colleague complains about the rule, let's \nbe clear, they have not finished the process. We do not know what the \nfinal rule is yet. But for some reason, my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle are so anxious to block this basic worker protection that \nthey already feel confident about attacking a rule that does not exist.\n  Second, my colleagues say that OSHA is rushing.\n  Senator Harkin was quite right in saying to Senator Nickles: Wait a \nminute, didn't this go back to Secretary Elizabeth Dole? Wasn't \nSecretary Dole the first to talk about the problem of repetitive stress \ninjury and the need to provide some protection for working men and \nwomen in our country? This has been going on for a decade. And Senator \nJeffords and OSHA and the administration are rushing?\n  By the way, I say to my colleagues, time is not neutral. From the \npoint of view of people--I am going to be giving some examples because \nthis debate needs to be put in personal terms. It is about working \npeople's lives, from the point of view of people who suffer from this \ninjury, from the point of view of people who are in terrible pain, from \nthe point of view of people who may not be able to work, from the point \nof view of people who can have their lives destroyed because of this \ninjury, because of our failure to issue a standard. We are not rushing. \nCan I assure all Senators that we are not rushing from their point of \nview?\n  Then my colleague talks about home office inspections. This is a red \nherring. We agree, OSHA agrees, they are not going to be inspecting \nhome offices. Why bring up an issue that is not an issue?\n  My colleagues talk about the WRP, the work restriction protection, \nand all about the ways in which it will undercut State worker comp \nlaws. But you know what, in our committee hearing, we heard from \nwitnesses that it has no effect on workers comp laws. We will debate \nthat more. But no one, no Senator should be under the illusion that \nOSHA is about to issue a rule that is going to undercut or overturn \nState comp laws.\n  Then I hear my colleague, my good friend, complain about OSHA's use \nof contractors. They have hearings all across the country. They hire \npeople to help them go through all of the paperwork. They hire people \nso that we do not have unnecessary delay. That is exactly what they \nshould be doing. Frankly, I think these arguments that we hear on the \nfloor of the Senate are just arguments in trying to prevent OSHA from \ndoing exactly what its job is.\n  What is its job? There are today 1.8 million workers who suffer from \nwork-related MSDs and 600,000 workers who have serious injuries and \nlost work time. That is a lot of men and women who are in pain and who \nstruggle because of these workplace injuries.\n  Elizabeth Dole, a Republican, Secretary of Labor, recognized this 10 \nyears ago. For 10 years, some of my colleagues have done everything \nthey know how to do to block OSHA from issuing a rule to protect \nworking people in this country. They come up with all these arguments, \ncomplaining about a rule--but we do not know what the rule is--saying \nthat OSHA is rushing--when we have been at this for a decade--talking \nabout the horror of\n\n[[Page S5596]]\n\nhome office inspections--which will not take place; there will be no \nhome office inspections--and so on and so forth.\n  Frankly, I think this is nothing more than an effort to make sure \nthere is no rule issued at all. Because you know what, we are not \narguing about even what kind of rule. That is the irony of this debate. \nI hope it will not become a bitter irony. We are arguing over whether \nOSHA should be allowed to issue any rule. Some of my colleagues are so \ncomfortable with the status quo.\n  We have 600,000 workers with serious injuries, lost work time, and \nthere are those who do not want OSHA to issue any rule.\n\n  Women workers--when you vote on this, one way or the other, remember \nwomen workers are particularly affected by these injuries. Women make \nup 46 percent of the overall workforce, but in 1998 they accounted for \n64 percent of repetitive motion injuries, and they accounted for 71 \npercent of the reported carpal tunnel syndrome cases--women in the \nworkplace, in pain, injured. We do not want to provide any protection?\n  I say to my colleagues, the only rush I see here is not OSHA's rush \nto provide some protection for working men and women, the only rush I \nsee is the rush on the part of my colleagues to block OSHA from \nproviding any protection.\n  Why the rush to block protection for working people in our country? \nThat is my question.\n  The cost of these injuries to workers, employers, and the country as \na whole is enormous. The worker compensation costs are estimated to be \nabout $20 billion annually; overall costs, $60 billion.\n  I will have more to say about this later on in the debate, but when I \nhear about the nursing homes, and how if we have any kind of ergonomic \nstandard, the nursing homes will go out of existence, I think of two \nthings. No. 1, I wonder how many of my colleagues voted for the 1997 \nbalanced budget amendment. I did not. But if you did, you ought to talk \nabout a piece of legislation that was destined, given the draconian \nreductions in Medicare reimbursement, to play havoc especially with our \nhospitals and our nursing homes in rural America, and that is it.\n  Actually ergonomics programs save employers money because you prevent \ninjuries, you cut worker compensation costs, you increase productivity, \nand you decrease employee turnover. I do not think that is really very \ndifficult to grasp.\n  Let me repeat it. Ergonomics programs save employers money, save \nnursing homes money, because if you can prevent the injuries, you can \ncut the worker comp costs, you can increase productivity, and you can \ndecrease employee turnover, which, by the way, is a huge problem in our \nnursing homes, as is the case with child care workers.\n  OSHA's proposed ergonomics rule would prevent about 300,000 injuries \neach year and save about $9 billion in worker compensation and related \ncosts. I don't know, maybe you can come out with a figure of a little \nless or a little more, but that is significant.\n  Ergonomic injuries can be prevented. That is what is so outrageous \nabout this amendment. Ergonomics programs implemented by employers, \nsuch as Ford Motor Company, 3M in my State of Minnesota, and Xerox \nCorporation, have significantly reduced injuries, lowered worker comp \ncosts, and improved worker productivity. But only one-third of \nemployers currently have effective programs.\n  On the House side, first of all, we have had the debate about whether \nor not there would be good science. Initially, back in 1999, we had an \nagreement between the Republicans and the Democratic leaders and the \nClinton administration, which would fund a scientific study by the \nNational Academy of Sciences of the scientific evidence on ergonomics \nwith the understanding that OSHA's ergonomics standard would proceed. \nThat was the understanding. That understanding clearly no longer \ncounts. All the discussion about how we needed good science obviously \nwas not the issue. My colleagues are not interested in any of that. \nThey are only interested in one thing: They want to block OSHA from \nissuing any kind of rule that would provide protection to these working \npeople.\n\n  Again, 1.8 million workers suffer from work-related MSDs, 600,000 \nworkers from serious injuries. My colleagues come out on the floor and \nmake arguments that amount to nothing more than delay because they want \nto block OSHA from issuing any regulation. They don't even want to wait \nto see what the regulation is. They just want to block it. They are for \nthe status quo, but the status quo is not acceptable because we ought \nto provide some protection for these women and men in the workplace.\n  I could, but I will not, spend time with a lot of stories. I want to \ngive my colleagues some sense of what this debate means in personal \nterms. That is what it is really about. It is not about a rule because \nthe rule has not been promulgated. We don't know what the rule is. It \nis not about a rush on the part of OSHA because, if we go back 10 \nyears, it was Elizabeth Dole, a Republican, who was first talking about \nthe problem with these injuries. It is not about the scope of the rule \nbecause we don't know what it is. It is about whether or not we are \ngoing to have political interference to block an agency which has the \nmandate and the mission of protecting working men and women in this \ncountry. It is also about people's lives.\n  I say this to my colleague from Wyoming, whom I like and enjoy as a \nfriend, to the extent people get a chance to spend any time with one \nanother here:\n  I think this debate will be a sharp debate because I think there are \nsome real differences between Senators on this question that make a \nreal difference. I cannot help but express my indignation on the floor \nof the Senate that when you have 600,000 workers seriously injured \nevery single year because we have not issued any kind of ergonomic \nstandard and because there is no protection for them, I find this \neffort to block OSHA from issuing any kind of rule or protection to be \nreally unconscionable. I find it to be unconscionable because we are \ntalking about people's lives.\n  Keta Ortiz is a New York City sewing machine operator. I will quote \nfrom her testimony, which was at one of the public hearings on OSHA's \nproposed ergonomic standard.\n\n       My name is Keta Ortiz. I was sewing machine operator, a \n     member of UNITE Local 89 for 24 years. I was 52 years old in \n     1992 when my whole life came crashing down around me.\n       You know what a cramp is, right? A terrible pain, it lasts \n     a couple of minutes. Imagine you got cramps so powerful and \n     painful they woke you up every night.\n       My cramps lasted one or two hours, without relief. I woke \n     up with hands frozen like claws and I had to soak them in hot \n     water to be able to move my fingers.\n       I was awake two or three hours every night, often crying. \n     Exhausted every day. But I had no choice but to work. In the \n     beginning the pain got better on the weekend. Then it didn't.\n\n  By the way, Mr. President, I was just saying to a close friend this \nmorning as I read Ms. Ortiz's testimony that having struggled with back \npain, my definition of pain is when you can't sleep at night. That is \nthe worst. You get through it during the day, but in the evening you \ncan't sleep because of the pain, and that is real pain.\n\n       This agony lasted months, then a year, and then five long \n     years.\n       There are not words to explain what went through my mind in \n     those hours in the middle of the night. The desperation, the \n     fear that eats at your mind. The terror I felt when I \n     realized I was going to have to stop working and didn't have \n     money to pay the rent.\n       I thought, ``When will this ever end? How can I support my \n     child? God, why have you abandoned me?''\n       I worked and worked through the pain, until I couldn't take \n     it any more. Without work I was disoriented, very depressed, \n     empty. I thought, ``I am useless, a vegetable.'' Negative \n     thoughts invaded my mind and took over my days.\n       Who are these people who oppose an ergonomics standard? \n     Have they ever worked in a factory?\n        Tell them it took me two and a half years before I saw my \n     first workers' comp check. Tell them the operation I needed \n     was delayed over two years by the insurance company . . . \n     that I lost my and my family's health insurance.\n       Tell them that after dedicating so many years to my job, I \n     destroyed my hands, damaged my mental health, and sacrificed \n     the joy I felt in living. And I get barely $120 a week in \n     workers' compensation payments.\n\n  Now, listening to Ms. Ortiz, I think this is a class issue. I think \nit is a class issue. I think that if these workers--these women and men \nlike Ms. Ortiz--were sons and daughters, or brothers or\n\n[[Page S5597]]\n\nsisters, or our mothers and fathers and they were in the upper-income \nclass, or professional class, there would be a hue and cry for an \nimmediate rule to be issued by OSHA to protect them. But they are not \nthe givers, the heavy hitters. This is a reform issue, too. They are \nnot the players. I doubt whether Ms. Ortiz has contributed $500,000 in \nsoft money--to either party, I say to my colleagues, so that I can make \nit clear this isn't aimed at any one individual Senator. I doubt \nwhether she is maxed out at $2,000 a year in the primary and general \nelection. I doubt whether she is enlisted as somebody who contributes \n$200 a year. I doubt whether she hires any lobbyist. But I have no \ndoubt that she is a hard-working factory worker whose life has been \ndestroyed.\n  I have no doubt that we ought to pass this so OSHA should be able to \ndo its work. OSHA should be able to perform its mission of providing \nprotection for workers.\n  I remember when OSHA legislation first passed in the early 1970s. I \nremember that there was a book I used to assign to students, I think, \nby Paul Brodeur, called ``Expendable Americans.'' I think it was about \na group of chemical workers who were working and who basically lost \ntheir lives because of asbestos, and they struggled with asbestosis and \nother lung-related diseases. The author's thesis was that these were \npeople who were expendable.\n  We should not make Ms. Ortiz and other working people expendable. We \nshould pay attention when 1.8 million workers a year struggle because \nof this kind of disease, MSDs, and 600,000 workers are in real \njeopardy, with serious injuries and lost work time. They should not be \nmade expendable.\n  Janie Jones, UNITE Local 2645, Arkadelphia, AR, poultry plant worker:\n\n       Good Morning, my name is Janie Jones. I'm President of \n     Local 2645. I am also a member of the joint Union-Management \n     safety Committee. I work at the Petit Jean Poultry de-boning \n     facility, in Arkadelphia, Arkansas. I've been employed there \n     for 7 years. In 1994, I was diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel \n     Syndrome. At the time of my injury I was de-boning thighs, \n     since then I have been placed on numerous other jobs.\n       Let me describe a few of my previous jobs for you:\n       Breast pulling: the birds come down the dis-assembly line, \n     we pull the breast from the bird, removing the skin as we do \n     this. Approximately 9 birds a minute is required of the \n     workers: one every seven seconds.\n       De-boning the thighs: six people used to do three different \n     cuts to the thigh: arching, opening and de-boning. Now there \n     are only three people doing these three cuts. Also, after the \n     bone is taken from the thigh, a thigh-trimmer inspects and \n     cuts out any bone that may be left. There used to be three \n     people, and now one person cuts out the bone. But the line \n     speed is still 28 per minute.\n       Now, I load the line. This means picking up the birds from \n     a metal bin to my right and placing them on cone on a \n     conveyor belt to my left. We are required to put 28-32 birds \n     a minute on these cones. These birds are cold, sometimes \n     frozen and they can weigh as much as six pounds. That's about \n     67,500 pounds that I have to reach and stretch to lift about \n     2\\1/2\\-5 feet every day.\n       When an injured worker goes to the nurse with pain and \n     swelling, the nurse will usually treat the worker with a rub \n     and arthritis cream and sends you back to your job. If you \n     keep complaining, she'll also give you a heat pad, and then \n     she'll send you back to your job. Then, if you still keep \n     complaining, she'll do the rub, the heat pad, and send you to \n     a light duty job. Sometimes, management then tells her they \n     need this person on their old job, and she just agrees and \n     they put the worker back on the job that injured them.\n       When workers are diagnosed with CTS by their own doctors, \n     company will move you to another job which is not as fast-\n     paced. But as soon as the pain gets better, they send you \n     back to your old job, only to get worse again. This goes on \n     until people can't take it anymore, and then they quit.\n\n  I say to my colleague from Arkansas that this is not a filibuster and \nI will be finished in a few minutes. I know he is anxious to speak. I \nwant to put his mind at rest.\n  Let me give one more example, although if the debate goes on I can \ngive you many, many examples.\n  This is the testimony of Eugenia Barbosa, Randolph, MA, an assembly \nline worker. By the way, this is testimony before OSHA during their \npublic hearings when working men and women came and talked about their \nown lives in the hope that OSHA would be able to perform or fulfill its \nmission by law of providing some protection, which means issuing an \nergonomics standard that can provide people some protection. My \ncolleagues, through this amendment, want to block OSHA from issuing any \nstandard--no standard, no help, no protection.\n  If you are not working at this kind of job, and you are not the one \nwho is suffering from stress injury, it is easy to do. But for these \nworkers, these people--I am a Senator from Minnesota and they are a big \npart of my constituency. They need the protection. That is why this \ndebate is so important. It really is in the words of an old labor song \nby Florence Reece, wrote it, ``Which Side Are You On?'' This is a \nclassic example.\n  I am on the side of Keta Ortiz and Janie Jones.\n\n  Eugenia Barbosa, Randolph, MA an assembly line worker:\n\n       Thank you for giving me this chance to come here today and \n     share my story with all of you. My name is Eugenia Barbosa, \n     an American citizen. I am an Injured Worker.\n       I came to America from Cape Verde with my family and \n     started working at age 17 to help my mother and father. For \n     the last 28 years of my life, I have worked in a factory that \n     manufactures parts for major car companies. I worked in an \n     assembly line making dashboard switches.\n       I produced 400 pieces or more per hour. To make the \n     switches I used my thumb and forefinger to press and insert a \n     rocker switch into the housing. To complete the dashboard \n     switches, I assembled an additional piece using three \n     springs, two pins, and plastic caps, also using my thumb and \n     forefinger.\n       In 1991 I started feeling severe and constant pain in my \n     right wrist. I was sent to the company doctor. I was given a \n     splint and Motrin, and placed on light duty for two weeks. \n     After two weeks I was sent back to my original position with \n     a wristband for my right wrist, which I wore every day.\n       Between 1991 and 1995, I was in constant pain. When I spoke \n     to management, they told me that they would decide when I was \n     in enough pain to go to the doctor. The pain was so severe \n     that I had to hang my arm while working to relieve some of \n     the pain. I suffered emotionally and physically as the pain \n     continued to get more severe.\n\n  That is what this debate is about.\n\n       In October 1995 my life changed. The pain was no longer in \n     my right wrist; it was also in my right shoulder, arm, back, \n     and neck. I told management about the pain which was so \n     severe I couldn't even move. I was ignored.\n       Finally I was sent to the company doctor again. He gave me \n     another splint to be used 24 hours a day, an elbow support \n     and pain medication, and told me to do light modified work \n     with my left hand. He also told me to rest my arm on an arm \n     rest chair while working. The company was supposed to provide \n     me with the arm rest chair but never did.\n       After 5 weeks I was called into my manager's office and was \n     told it was time to remove my splint and go back to the \n     assembly line. I was in so much pain that I started to cry.\n       The company put me on incentive work but with only my left \n     hand to make 975 pieces an hour. I asked my manager why. He \n     told me he didn't want to hear any garbage and that I should \n     go back and do my job.\n       In March 1996 I started having pain in my left wrist, arm, \n     shoulder, back and neck. It became so severe that I was \n     rushed to the Emergency Room. The company doctor said there \n     is nothing wrong with me.\n       I went to see another doctor who tested me and found that I \n     had severe damage to my rotator cuff, radial nerve, and \n     wrist. Since that time, I have had surgery three times, on my \n     right shoulder, arm, and wrist. I still need surgery on my \n     left shoulder and wrist. After my injury my life has complete \n     changed for myself and for my family, and everyday I must \n     deal with my pain. I am no longer able to work, I am now \n     financially struggling to put my son through college, I'm \n     unable to cook and clean for my family and even combing my \n     hair and taking care of my own personal needs is now very \n     difficult for me.\n\n  Their testimony was before an OSHA hearing on this ergonomics \nstandard.\n  Elizabeth Dole, in 1990, tried to help these workers. We have been at \nit 10 years. Assistant Secretary Jeffress of OSHA is trying to move \nforward to issue a rule. They are doing the right thing. This is their \nmandate. This is what they are supposed to do under the law.\n  This amendment amounts to blatant political interference to prevent \nthem from doing their job--which is to hold the hearings; which is to \nhave careful deliberation; which is to decide on the final rule. They \nhave not even decided on the final rule, but keep attacking a rule that \ndoesn't exist, a final rule that will be reasonable and sensible but \nwill provide protection to these workers--to these men and women all \nacross the country.\n  Senators, Democrats and Republicans, there couldn't be a more \nimportant issue before us. This is a real clear\n\n[[Page S5598]]\n\nquestion of where you stand. I think we ought to stand for these \nworking people. I think we ought to make sure that OSHA can do its job. \nI think there should be a rule that provides these workers with some \nprotection. That is the right thing to do.\n  I urge you to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I wish to respond to a few things that \nmy colleague from Minnesota said.\n  First of all, I mention that my father spent more than 20 years in \nthe poultry plants of Arkansas, Alabama, and Mississippi doing exactly \nthe kind of repetitive motion work that the Senator from Minnesota \ndescribed. I believe, if my father were on the floor of the Senate \ntoday, that he would as vehemently and strongly and vigorously oppose \nthis OSHA draconian power move as much as I am going to oppose it.\n  Senator Wellstone emphasized that it is not yet a final rule and \ntherefore it is premature for us to act. I don't think so. I hardly \nthink it would be prudent on our part to wait until after they enacted \nthe rule, and then come back and try to change it when employers would \nhave already faced the rule that was in place. It is anticipated, as I \nunderstand it, that the rule will be finally promulgated by the end of \nthis year. If we are going to act, we must act now.\n  Again, Senator Wellstone said they are not done yet. This is the 600 \npages that they are to right now. I am concerned if we wait much longer \nthat it may be 900 pages before the end of the year. This is the time \nfor us to act.\n  One of the things that I appreciate about my distinguished colleague \nfrom Minnesota is that he believes what he is saying, and he doesn't \nmince words about it. He made it very clear that from his viewpoint \nthis is class warfare. It is those mean, uncaring employers; it is \nthose managers; it is those businesspeople--they just don't care about \ntheir employees. Then we have anecdote after anecdote.\n\n  That assumption is wrong. I think OSHA will state that does not \ndescribe 99.9 percent of the employers in this country. They do care. \nThey have every incentive in the world in caring for those who work for \nthem, ensuring there is a healthy and safe workplace.\n  Beyond that, we ought to talk about the small business man or woman \nwho are struggling to meet every other regulatory burden that this \nGovernment has placed upon them and meet all of the tax burdens we \nplaced upon them, trying to keep their heads above water, trying to \nmake ends meet, trying to provide jobs for their employees, and trying \nto make a contribution to their community. And a rule such as this will \nhave some of the most dramatic effects upon business and upon the \neconomy of any rule ever promulgated by any agency. What about them?\n  As Senator Enzi pointed out, what about the senior citizen on \nMedicare or those senior citizens on Medicaid or those poor people who \nare on Medicaid and dependent upon them? What will happen to their \nhealth care when we tell health care providers they have to meet the \nnew requirement, they have to comply with the new rule?\n  There is no increase in their budget. There is no change in the \nreimbursement formulas. You will get what you got before, but now you \nwill have to meet all of the additional burdens.\n  I suggest those who are going to be hurt the most by this rule are \nthose who are the most vulnerable in our society.\n  The Enzi amendment would simply prevent OSHA from finalizing an \nergonomics program in fiscal year 2001. That is all it does. It gives \nthe National Academy of Sciences the time it deserves to complete its \nongoing, taxpayer-funded study and allow the public to then evaluate \nthe merits of the proposal as well as the NAS study.\n  On Friday, November 19, 1999, Congress adjourned for the year, having \ncompleted its work for the 1st session of the 106th Congress. After we \nleft town to return home, OSHA announced the following Monday its new \nergonomic proposal. As a member of the Senate authorizing committee and \nthe Subcommittee on Employment Safety and Training, I received no \nnotice, no advance warning, no copy of the proposal--nothing. None of \nmy colleagues serving on the committee received that same courtesy, \neither. With Congress heading home, OSHA decided it was in America's \nbest interest to launch the largest regulatory proposal ever to be put \nforth by an administration. Shotgunning the proposal through its hoops \nin less than 12 months, OSHA refused to wait for the completion of the \n$890,000 NAS study, bought and paid for with hard-earned tax dollars.\n  The Subcommittee on Employment, Safety and Training, chaired by \nSenator Enzi, reacted as it should have. After weeks of evaluating the \nimpact this proposal would have if actually enforced, we held our first \nhearing in April, addressing just one of many portions of the OSHA \nproposal, the work restriction protections, WRP. The WRP provisions \nwould require employers to provide temporary work restrictions up to \nand including complete removal from work, based either upon their own \njudgment or on the recommendation of a health care provider. If the \nemployer places work restrictions upon an employee which would allow \nthem to continue to perform some work activities, the employer must \nprovide 100 percent of the employee's after-tax earnings and 100 \npercent of work benefits for up to 6 months. If the employee is \ncompletely removed from work, the employer must still provide 90 \npercent of the employee's after-tax earnings and 100 percent of \nbenefits for up to 6 months.\n\n  The hearing revealed that the WRP provision is a direct violation of \nsection 4b(4) of the 1970 OSH Act. There is no ambiguity in the \nwording. I have it on this chart.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to supersede or in \n     any manner affect any workmen's compensation law or to \n     enlarge or diminish or affect in any other manner the common \n     law or statutory rights, duties, or liabilities of employers \n     and employees under any law with respect to injuries, \n     diseases, or death of employees arising out of, or in the \n     course of employment.\n\n  This is in reference to the State workers compensation act. When the \nOSH Act was enacted back in 1970, the clear intent, explicitly stated, \nwas that OSHA was never to impact the State workers compensation laws. \nBelieve me, what they are proposing in this rule would do so entirely. \nCongress specifically withheld OSHA having that right to supersede or \naffect those State workers compensation laws. Congress did this because \nState workers compensation systems are founded upon the principle that \nemployers and employees have both entered into an agreement to give up \ncertain rights in exchange for certain benefits in the area of work-\nrelated injury and illnesses. Most often, employers give up most of \ntheir legal defenses against liability for the employees' injuries, and \nthe employees give up their right to seek punitive and other types of \ndamages in turn.\n  The crucial factor that makes State workers compensation systems \npossible is that the remedies it provides to employees are the \nexclusive remedies available to them against their employers for work-\nrelated injuries and illnesses.\n  Anyone who served in the State legislature, as Senator Enzi and I \nhave, knows that this is always one of the biggest issues of debate, \ndiscussion, and ultimately, hopefully, consensus between labor and \nmanagement. It has been a workable system. But it is dependent upon \nthat idea that this is the exclusive remedy.\n  WRP's provisions are in direct contradiction of section 4b(4) and \nwill shake the foundation upon which the State workers systems rests \nbecause they will provide another remedy for employees for work-related \ninjuries and illnesses. That is an absolute contradiction of what the \nOSH Act, establishing this agency, intended in 1970.\n  Since WRP provisions conflict with workers compensation systems, \nthere will certainly be confusion to say the least as to who is liable. \nThat is precisely why Congress put section 4b(4) in the act 30 years \nago. To be sure, I dug deeper and found the conference report filed \nDecember 16, 1970, accompanying the act. As it pertains to section \n4b(4) it reads:\n\n       The bill does not affect any Federal or State workmen's \n     compensation laws, or the rights, duties, or liabilities of \n     employers and employees under them.\n\n  It is clear in the language of the statute as well as in the \nconference report, that Congress did not intend OSHA to have the power \nto affect and supersede State workmen's compensation laws. I\n\n[[Page S5599]]\n\nsay to my colleagues, it doesn't get any clearer. How can it be \nmisconstrued by OSHA? And they are simply in violation of the act that \nestablished them.\n\n  OSHA is not listening to Congress. Frankly, it also is not listening, \nnot paying any attention to what other Federal agencies are saying \nabout their proposal. According to the Small Business Administration, \nOSHA has grossly underestimated the cost impact of its proposal. The \nSBA ordered an analysis of OSHA's Data Underlying the Ergonomics \nStandard and Possible Alternatives Discussed by the SBREFA Panel.\n  Policy Planning & Evaluation, Incorporated, PPE, prepared the \nanalysis that was issued September 22, 1999. The PPE reported that:\n\n       OSHA's estimates of the costs in its Preliminary Initial \n     Regulatory Flexibility Analysis of the draft proposed \n     ergonomics standard, as furnished to the SBREFA Panel, may be \n     significantly understated, and that OSHA's estimates of the \n     benefits of the proposed standard may be significantly \n     overstated.\n\n  This is the conclusion that we find another Federal agency coming to \nthat OSHA has overstated what the benefits will be and they have \nsignificantly understated what the costs are going to be. The PPE \nfurther reported that OSHA's estimates of capital expenditures on \nequipment to prevent MSDs--the musculoskeletal disorders--do not \naccount for varying establishment sizes, and seem quite low even for \nthe smallest establishment size category.\n  The PPE attributed the overstatement of benefits that the rule will \nprovide to the fact that OSHA has not accounted for a potentially \ndramatic increase in the number of MSDs resulting in days away from \nwork as workers take advantage of the WRP provisions.\n  OSHA estimated the proposal's cost to be $4.2 billion annually--that \nis OSHA's best estimate. That is their cost estimate upon the economy \nand upon American business, $4.2 billion annually. That is not \ninsignificant. But the PPE estimates that the cost of the proposed \nstandard could be anywhere from 2.5 to 15 times higher than OSHA's \nestimate. That moves the cost from $10.5 billion to as much as $63 \nbillion or higher. That is just one Federal agency versus another. That \nis the Small Business Administration saying what OSHA is preparing to \ndo is going to cost small business in this country $60 billion or more.\n\n  Whom are you going to believe? Are you going to believe OSHA's \nestimate of a minimal impact? Are you going to believe the Small \nBusiness Administration? I don't know, but I don't want to risk the \njobs of the American people. I don't want to risk the economy on \nconflicting opinions by two Federal agencies.\n  Finally, the PPE report for the Small Business Administration shows \nthat the cost-benefit ratio of this rule may be as much as 10 times \nhigher for small businesses than for large businesses. It is very easy \nfor the other side, the proponents of this drastic, dramatic rule \nchange, to come down and rail against big business. Do they not realize \nthat small businesses, the tiny businesses, the mom and pop operations \nstruggling to exist in this country, are going to be impacted 10 times \nmore than large businesses?\n  So if you don't care about the impact upon the economy as a whole, if \nyou don't care about the impact upon large employers, then please \nconsider the impact upon those small businesses out there and what they \nare going to have to pay to try to comply with this ill-advised rule. \nThe cost disparity is not some slight discrepancy. We are talking about \n$60 billion a year.\n  Who covers that cost? Who is going to cover the $60-plus billion a \nyear imposed upon the business community of this country? OSHA has an \nanswer. OSHA's answer is: Pass it off on the consumer. Just pass on the \ncost. That is easy enough. Of course it is inflationary, of course it \nhurts the economy, but we can solve the problem of this added cost. \nJust let the consumer pay.\n  Senator Enzi has well noted that cannot be done in Medicare. It \ncannot be done in Medicaid. It cannot be done on those businesses \nreimbursed by the Federal Government, where their reimbursement is \ncapped. There is nobody to pass the cost to. No bother, OSHA is going \nto push forward anyway, and that is what they have done.\n  I have listened to the opponents of the Enzi argument make the case \nthat if this rule is delayed any longer, thousands of additional \nemployees will suffer. Let's be clear, please, colleagues. Let's be \nclear. With or without this, with or without the 600-page--so far--\nproposed ergonomics regulation, rule, OSHA can still enforce its \ncurrent law. The current law states this in the ergonomics proposal, on \npage 65774. It is on the chart before us. This is it. Let me quote what \ntheir proposed rule says. This is under the general duties provision. \nOSHA says:\n\n       [Every employer] shall furnish to each of his employees \n     employment and a place of employment which are free from \n     recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause \n     death or serious physical harm to his employees; and shall \n     comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Standards \n     promulgated under this Act.\n\n  This is the general duty provision which OSHA has used widely in \nenforcing conditions in the workplace that they believe are detrimental \nto the worker. They already have that tool, and they are not hesitant \nabout using that authority. They don't have to have a new ergonomics \nproposal. They don't have to have a new ergonomics regulation in order \nto protect the American worker.\n\n  By the way, this is not about whether or not we are going to address \nergonomics at some point--we should. But we should do it in the right \nway. We should do it with due scientific study, based upon good \nscientific principles. It is not whether or not there is going to be an \nergonomic standard. The issue is how it is going to be done and whether \nit is going to be done in a thoughtful way, respecting not only the \nworker but the needs of the employer. But I say again, OSHA currently \nhas the authority under this general duty clause, and they can enforce \nergonomics violations currently.\n  According to the proposal:\n\n       OSHA successfully issued over 550 ergonomic citations under \n     the general duty clause.\n\n  They even list a number of employers, too. They have the authority, \nand they are proud of the fact that over 550 times they have issued \ncitations on ergonomics violations under the general duty clause.\n  The point is, OSHA is not a crippled agency--far from it. It is a \nfull-fledged regulatory agency that has the power to put any business \nout of business.\n  This proposal contains serious flaws which just beg the question: Who \nis really calling the shots as OSHA? This is not the first regulatory \nblunder to come out of OSHA in recent days. Just last January, they \nannounced their intention to regulate private residences, our homes. \nPerhaps my distinguished colleague, for whom I have the utmost respect, \nSenator Wellstone, would say whether they are just doing their job in \nthat case?\n  The American people rightly rose in outrage that OSHA would think \nthey have the authority to go into the American home and regulate it as \na workplace. After being publicly ridiculed and repeatedly humiliated, \nOSHA dropped the issue. They didn't drop it, they said they want to \ntalk about it next year. Good thing, too, since 10 percent of working \nAmericans work from home at least part-time, and their pursuance would \nhave caused a chilling effect on modern technology.\n  OSHA's home regulation should be mentioned during this debate because \nmany of the hazards OSHA wanted to regulate would be ergonomic-\nregulated: keyboard height, monitor height, desk height, even the type \nof chair you might sit in, in your home workplace. The list doesn't \nstop there. It also includes other potential OSHA violations including \nthe number of outlets, adequate lighting, exit signs, even the \nbannister height.\n  Neither OSHA nor the 1970 OSH Act provides any guidance as to how to \ncarry out their responsibilities.\n  We raised even more questions: Are employers required to ensure that \nhome offices remain clear of toys at all times so employees don't trip \nand fall? What about an employer's smoking policy? Does that apply to \nthe home, too? Most important, what about liability for employees' \naccidents in their employees' homes? How could employers possibly \nmonitor this based upon what OSHA was asking?\n\n[[Page S5600]]\n\n  In that same vein of questions asked in January, we are here again \nquestioning the validity of OSHA's ergonomics proposal: What statutory \nright does OSHA have to regulate State workers compensation?\n  Senator Wellstone says they are just doing their job. There is no \ndoubt what they have proposed will impact State workers compensation \nlaw in violation of the 1970 OSH Act. What reason does OSHA give to why \nits WRP compensation package would not encourage fraud and abuse? Who \nwould oversee fraud if it did occur? What about the cost estimates \nposed by another Federal agency, the Small Business Administration?\n\n  Again, it is not about how much we are willing to pay for an \nemployee's safety but, rather, one agency's estimates being 15 times \nhigher than another's, and then OSHA saying we have enough information, \nwe have a solid basis to move forward.\n  Why are we funding the Small Business Administration if we are going \nto absolutely ignore their cost estimate in an area they ought to be \nexperts? That is, experts on small business. They say it is 15 times \nhigher than what OSHA says. If OSHA is going to shotgun an ergonomics \nproposal through the rulemaking process, at least I say they should do \nit right.\n  So I say to OSHA, put your love of regulating on hold and listen to \nwhat America is saying. You have 7,000 public comments submitted. \nConsider them all, not just a few that happen to support the agenda you \nseem to be pursuing.\n  Is it a love of regulating? This is a quote I think Senator Enzi used \nearlier. It is by Marthe Kent, who is the director of safety standards, \nthe leader of OSHA's ergonomics effort, recently quoted in the \nSynergist magazine of May 2000. This is what was said:\n\n       I love it; I absolutely love it. I was born to regulate. I \n     don't know why, but that's very true. So long as I am \n     regulating, I'm happy.\n\n  That is one person's statement, though they are deeply involved in \nthe ergonomics issue and the drafting of the ergonomics rule. But I \nthink that might well reflect the way a lot of regulators feel.\n  So, concluding my comments, I just believe there is something much \ndeeper at stake here, a very genuine and real philosophical difference.\n  Senator Wellstone believes, and those on the other side who support \nthis rule believe, OSHA is just doing their job, and I believe we need \nto do our job. OSHA was not elected by the people, we were.\n  Not a day goes by that I do not have constituents in Arkansas call \nour office and complain about some regulatory agency that has gone \nafield, that has gone off on their own agenda.\n  Thomas Jefferson well recognized that the great threat to freedom of \nany individual comes when power becomes concentrated. Concentration of \npower, whether in the private sector, public sector, in a regulatory \nagency, in a corporation, if there is enough power accumulated in a \nsingle place, it threatens the individual's liberty.\n  I believe regulatory agencies today have become a fourth branch of \nGovernment unto themselves, unresponsive to what we say, unresponsive \nto what we do, until we are forced into a position of having only one \ntool left, and that is to cut off the funding for the implementation of \nthe rule. That is what Senator Enzi has sought to do. That is why I \nthink, on a bipartisan basis, so many realize this step is necessary.\n  I say to Chairman Enzi of the Senate Subcommittee on Employment \nSafety and Training that I appreciate his dedication to worker safety--\nno one doubts it--and for taking the high road when dealing with such \nhighly contentious issues. And he has. Nobody told me when I joined his \nsubcommittee that these issues were going to be easy. They have not \nbeen. But that is no reason for us to avoid asking the tough questions \nand, when necessary, taking the tough votes.\n  Until we get the answers--and OSHA does not have them now--until we \nget the answers to these tough questions, I ask my colleagues to take a \nhard, hard look at this ill-advised proposal. Look through it. It may \ntake a week or two, but look through it, and you may understand why the \nEnzi amendment is so essential.\n  I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to simply postpone, \ndelay OSHA moving forward in this fiscal year with an ergonomics \nproposal that is going to dramatically impact the economy of the United \nStates, I believe, and negatively impact the safety and the health of \nsenior citizens on Medicare and Medicaid. Delay it by supporting the \nEnzi amendment. Allow the NAS the time necessary to complete their \nstudy and then maybe move forward with a good ergonomics rule to \nprotect the workplace for American workers on the basis of sound \nscience.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Wyoming. This amendment would prevent the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) from issuing \nergonomic standards to protect workers from back injuries, carpal \ntunnel syndrome and other work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs)\n  MSDs caused by ergonomic hazards are the most widespread safety and \nhealth problem in the workplace today. Every year 1.8 million workers \nsuffer as a result of work-related MSDs bone or muscle disorders and \none-third of those workers lose work time as result of these disorders.\n  These injuries are a burden on workers, and they are a burden on the \neconomy. These injuries result in $20 billion per year in workers' \ncompensation claims. OSHAs proposed ergonomic regulations would cut in \nhalf the cost of workers' compensation claims.\n  Ergonomic programs have slashed costs for businesses throughout \nCalifornia.\n  In 1997, Sun Microsystems average MSD disability claim dropped to \n$3,500, from $55,000, in 1993.\n  The Vale Health Care Center, in San Pablo, California, reduced the \nnumber of back injuries from ten per year to one per year.\n  The Fresno Bee, three years after establishing an ergonomics program, \nreduced workers' compensation costs by over 95 percent, and associated \nlost workdays and surgeries were eliminated.\n  Xandex, in Pentaluma, California; Silicon Graphics, in Mountain View, \nCalifornia; Rohm and Haas, in Hayward, Califoria; Blue Cross of \nCalifornia; Varin Associates, a California electronics manufacturing \nbusiness, the city of San Jose, Pacific Bell, FMC Defense Systems \nCorporation, AT Global Information Systems, in San Diego, and Intel, \nin Santa Clara, California, have all implemented successful ergonomics \nprograms.\n  Ergonomic standards have been studied ad nauseam.\n  There are more than 2,000 published studies on MSDs, and the \nscientific evidence strongly supports the conclusion that ergonomics \nprograms can and do reduce MSDs.\n  In 1991, Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole believed there was \nsufficient scientific evidence that ergonomic injuries were a major \nproblem in the workplace, and she committed the Labor Department to \naddress the issue.\n  In 1991, Secretary of Labor Lynn Martin committed the Department of \nLabor to develop and issue a standard using normal rule-making \nprocedures.\n  In 1998, at the request of the Representatives Livingston and \nBonilla, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) received a $490,000 \ngrant to conduct a literature review of MSDs. Later in 1998, NAS \nreleased its findings. It concluded that ``research clearly \ndemonstrates that specific interventions can reduce the reported rates \nof musculoskeletal disorders for workers who perform high-risk tasks.'' \nIn other words, workplace ergonomic factors cause MSDs, but specific \ninterventions can reduce the number of cases.\n  Congress then appropriated another $890,000 for another NAS \nliterature review on workplace-related MSDs. This study will be \ncompleted early next year.\n  If the results are the same as the previous study, and I assume they \nwill be, we should not prevent the Department of Labor from issuing \nergonomic standards.\n  Ergonomic programs have proven to be effective in reducing motion \ninjuries and other MSDs, and suggest that OSHA must be permitted to go \nforward with sensible regulations to ensure a safe workplace.\n\n[[Page S5601]]\n\n  The problem is real, but it is a problem we can fix, and we can save \nbusinesses billions of dollars in workers' compensation claims by doing \nso.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to help improve workplace safety by \njoining me in opposing this amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to spend a few minutes today \ntalking about the importance of the Department of Labor's ergonomics \nregulation, which seeks to protect the health and safety of American \nworkers. I'd like to urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment \nproposed by Senator Enzi that would prevent the Department of Labor's \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration from issuing any standard \nor regulation addressing ergonomics concerns in the workplace.\n  Mr. President, let's be very clear about the issue before us, about \nthe ergonomics issue, about employer health and safety, about the \nnumber of people nationwide--600,000 each year--that suffer from \nmusculoskeletal injuries. In my state of Massachusetts, last year \nnearly 21,000 workers suffered serious injuries from repetitive motion \nand overexertion. Mr. President, if this amendment were to be passed by \nthis body, then hundreds of thousands of people will continue to \nneedlessly suffer on the job. The solution to this problem is NOT doing \nnothing, Mr. President, and that is what the Enzi amendment purports to \ndo. Ergonomics injuries are real. They are prevalent in the workplace. \nAnd we must respond to this treacherous workplace hazard.\n  Ergonomics is the science of fitting workplace conditions and job \ndemands to the capabilities of the working population. Mr. President, \nthe scientific community understands that effective and successful \nergonomics programs assure high productivity, avoidance of illness and \ninjury risks, and increased satisfaction among the workforce. \nErgonomics disorders include sprains and strains, which affect the \nmuscles, nerves, tendons, ligaments, joints, cartilage, or spinal \ndiscs; repetitive stress injuries, that are typically not the result of \nany instantaneous or acute event, but are usually chronic in nature, \nand precipitated by poorly designed work environments; and carpal \ntunnel syndrome.\n  Many businesses, both large and small, have already responded to the \nthreat of ergonomics injuries in the workplace. Mr. President, when \nbusinesses ensure that their workplaces are safe and protect workers \nfrom these types of injuries, their productivity rises! When workers \nare healthy, employers lose far fewer hours in productivity. Last year \nAssistant Secretary of Labor Charles Jeffress testified before the \nHouse Committee on Small Business and he reported that programs \nimplemented by individual employers reduce total job-related injuries \nand illnesses by an average of 45 percent and lost work time and \nillnesses by an average of 75 percent. Mr. President, these numbers \nmean something, they indicate results, and they prove that making the \nworkplace safe is crucial to increasing worker safety. But let me \nexplain what these numbers really mean.\n  Beth Piknik is a registered nurse at the Cape Cod hospital. Ms. \nPiknik's 21-year career as an intensive care unit nurse was cut short \ndue to a preventable back injury. On February 17, 1992, she suffered a \nback injury while assisting a patient. The injury required major \nsurgery--spinal fusion--and two years of major rehabilitation before \nand after surgery. The injury was devastating to Ms. Piknik, both \nprofessionally and personally. Prior to her injury, Beth led a very \nactive life, enjoying competitive racquetball, water-skiing, and white-\nwater rafting. But most importantly, she enjoyed her work as an ICU \nnurse, which had been her career since 1971. The loss of her ability to \ntake care of patients led to a clinical depression, which lasted four \nand a half years. She now administers TB tests to employees at the \nhospital. Her ability to take care of patients--the reason she became a \nnurse--is gone. Ms. Piknik's injury could have been prevented and so \ncan the crippling injuries suffered by hundreds of thousands of workers \nevery year.\n  In fact, many employers have already taken action and put into place \nworkplace ergonomics programs to prevent these injuries. For example, \nthe Crane Paper Company in Massachusetts had a serious problem with \nergonomics injuries. In 1990, they put in place an ergonomics program \nto identify and control hazards, to train workers and provide medical \nmanagement to intervene before workers developed serious injuries. \nThese efforts paid off. Within 3 years of starting their ergonomics \nprograms, Crane reduced their ergonomic injury rate by more than 40 \npercent.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Labor took public comments on the \nproposed ergonomics regulation through 90 days of written comments and \nnine weeks of public hearings. During the hearings, OSHA heard from \nhundreds of workers and local union members and representatives from \neighteen international unions. These workers and union members--who \nrepresent all sectors of the economy including auto workers, nurses and \nnurses aides, poultry workers, teachers and teachers aides, cashiers, \noffice workers--told OSHA why an ergonomics standard is desperately \nneeded and how ergonomics programs in their workplaces have worked to \nprevent injuries. I would like to share with my colleagues a couple of \nstatements from some of the workers from my state of Massachusetts who \nappeared at the hearings.\n  This is what Nancy Foley, who is a journalist from South Hadley, MA, \nhad to say at one of the hearings. ``I am here today to strongly \nsupport an ergonomic standard. I suffer from serious injuries caused by \na repetitive job. I want to see the ergonomics standard enacted so that \nothers will not be injured as I have been. In 1988 I earned a masters \ndegree in journalism from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Most of \nmy career was spent at the Union-News in Springfield, Massachusetts. As \na reporter, I spent four to five hours a day typing on a computer \nkeyboard. In 1993, I began having pain in my neck and weakness in my \nhands. I did not seek medical attention until 1995 when the pain had \nspread into my left shoulder and left arm, making it difficult for me \nto sit through the workday. Fear prevented me from seeking medical \nattention sooner. I was a part-time reporter, and I was afraid I would \nnever be made full-time if my employer knew the job was hurting me. \nEven after seeking medical attention, I was afraid to go out of work to \nrecover from the injuries. I thought that taking time out of work would \nhurt my career. In October 1998, I went out of work altogether and was \nnever able to return. I settled my workers' compensation case in 1999, \nwith the insurance company taking responsibility for my injuries and \ncontinuing medical payments. I have been diagnosed with repetitive \nstrain injury, carpal tunnel syndrome, cervical strain, thoracic outlet \nsyndrome, and medial epicondylitis. By the time I left the newspaper I \nwas so severely injured, that my recovery has been very slow. I may \nnever fully recover. I live with chronic pain every day. Sitting still \ntriggers pain. I have trouble carrying groceries into my house and \ndoing simple housekeeping tasks. I am trying to retrain to be a \nschoolteacher, but my injuries make the retraining difficult. I do my \nschool work by lying in bed and talking into a voice-activated \ncomputer. That is the way I wrote this statement.''\n\n  Mr. President, these are the real voices, the real people, the \nreality behind the 600,000 injuries. Unfortunately, gauging from the \ndebate so far today my colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem \nuninterested in talking about how devastating musculoskeletal injuries \nare. They are content to lambaste the Department of Labor and OSHA. \nThey are content to nitpick at the rulemaking process, Mr. President, \nbecause they are incapable of refuting the proposed rule on its merit. \nThey cannot deny that 600,000 a year suffer from musculoskeletal \ninjuries. They cannot deny that workplaces that have adopted good \nergonomics policies have increased productivity.\n  Let's be clear about this Mr. President. These types of injuries are \na real problem for American businesses and workers. Industry experts \nhave estimated that injuries and illnesses caused by ergonomics hazards \nare the biggest job safety problem in the workplace today. The 600,000 \nworkers who suffer from back injuries, tendinitis, and other ergonomics \ndisorders cost over $20 billion annually in worker compensation.\n\n[[Page S5602]]\n\n  What is most troubling to me, Mr. President, is that these types of \ninjuries are preventable. Something can be done to protect the American \nworker. In drafting this proposed rule OSHA worked extensively with a \nnumber of stakeholders, including representatives from industry, labor, \nsafety, and health organizations, State governments, trade \nassociations, and insurance companies. OSHA is currently in the process \nof holding stakeholder meetings on the draft rule for all interested \nparties. These comments are made part of the rulemaking record and OSHA \nis required to review these comments as the final rule is prepared. \nJust a few months ago, OSHA's small business liaison met with small \nbusiness representatives in an open roundtable format. Mr. President, \nthis is not a ``command and control'' regulatory action.\n  Mr. President, this proposed rule has been criticized by those on the \nother side of the aisle as unfair, unnecessary, and prohibitively \ncostly for businesses. I disagree. The proposed rule is drafted as an \ninteractive approach between employee and manager to protect the assets \nof the company in ways that are either already being done, or should be \ndone under existing rules. This new rule is a guide and a tool, not an \ninflexible mandate.\n  The rule is a flexible standard that allows employers to tailor their \nprograms to their individual workplaces. Small employers are not \nexpected to have the same kind of program as big employers. The \nproposed rule exempts small businesses from record keeping \nrequirements, so it does not add to small businesses paperwork burdens. \nMoreover, OSHA is reaching out to small businesses to provide them \ninformation on how to control ergonomics hazards through meetings and \nconferences and by providing on-site compliance assistance.\n  According to the Department of Labor, thirty-two states have some \nform of safety and health program. Four states (Alaska, California, \nHawaii, and Washington) have mandated comprehensive programs that have \ncore elements similar to those in OSHA's draft proposal. In these four \nstates, injury and illness rates fell by nearly 18 percent over the \nfive years after implementation, in comparison with national rates over \nthe same period. We are not talking about something that has come out \nof the blue--ergonomics programs are creating positive results for \nworkers all over the country.\n  Mr. President, in spite of the arguments for the Enzi amendment, \nthere bulk of the science and the research proves that an ergonomic \nstandard is needed in the American workplace.\n  The National Academy of Sciences has compiled a report entitled Work-\nRelated Musculoskeletal Disorders. This report summarized 6,000 \nscientific studies on ergonomics-related injuries and concluded that \nthe current state of science reveals that workers exposed to ergonomic \nhazards have a higher level of pain, injury and disability, that there \nis a biological basis for these injuries, and that there exist today \ninterventions to prevent these injuries.\n  In 1997, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health \ncompleted a critical review of epidemiologic evidence for work-related \nmusculoskeletal disorders of the neck, upper extremity, and lower back. \nThis critical review of 600 studies culled from a bibliographic \ndatabase of more than 2,000 found that there is substantial evidence \nfor a causal relationship between physical work factors and \nmusculoskeletal disorders.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, we are not talking about a new \nphenomenon, or the latest fad. Ten years ago in 1990 under a Republican \nPresident, Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole committed the Department \nof Labor to begin working on an ergonomics standard. Then-Secretary \nDole was responding to a growing body of evidence that showed that \nrepetitive stress disorders, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, were the \nfastest growing category of occupational illnesses. This rulemaking has \nbeen almost ten years in the making. Mr. President, it is time to put \nsafeguards in place for the American worker, and this should not be a \npartisan issue.\n  This rule has been delayed for far too long. In 1996, the Senate and \nthe House agreed to language in an appropriations conference report \nthat would prevent OSHA from developing an ergonomics standard in FY \n1997. In 1997, Congress prevented OSHA from spending any of its FY 1998 \nbudget on promulgating an ergonomics standard. Last year, money in the \nFY 1999 budget was set aside for the new National Academy of Sciences \nstudy, and the then-Chairman and Ranking Members of the House \nAppropriations Committee sent a letter to Secretary of Labor Alexis \nHerman, stating that this study ``was not intended to block or delay \nOSHA from moving forward with its ergonomics standard.''\n  Mr. President, we should wait no longer for this standard to be \nproposed and we should certainly not prevent OSHA from issuing its \nfinal ergonomics rule. Workers should not have to wait any longer for \nsafety on the job. The time to protect the American workplace is now.\n  This standard is a win-win for workers and management: the greater \nthe safety workers have on the job, the more time they spend on the \njob. The more time they spend on the job, the more productive the \nworkplace. And it is obvious, but it bears restating, that the more \nproductive the workplace, the more productive this country. Workers \nwant to be at work, and their bosses want them at work.\n  It's been 10 years, Mr. President, since Secretary Dole promised to \ntake action to protect workers from ergonomics injuries and to issue an \nergonomics standard. Since that time, more than 6.1 million workers \nhave suffered from serious injuries as a result of ergonomics hazards--\ninjuries that could have and should have been prevented. Workers have \nwaited too long for protections from ergonomics hazards. It's time to \nstop breaking the promises made to American workers and to support the \npromulgation of a final OSHA ergonomics standard not to protect \nworkers.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment.\n  We should be reducing the hazards that America's workers face--not \nputting roadblocks in the way of increased worker safety.\n  Ergonomic injuries are the single-largest occupational health crisis \nfaced by men and women in our work force today.\n  We should let OSHA--the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration--issue an ergonomics standard.\n  Ergonomic injuries hurt America's workers and America's productivity.\n  Each year, more than 600,000 private sector workers in America are \nforced to miss time from work because of painful musculoskeletal \ndisorders (MSDs).\n  These injuries also hurt America's companies because these disorders \ncan cause workers to miss three full weeks of work or more.\n  Employers pay more than $20 billion annually in workers' compensation \nbenefits due to MSDs and up to $60 billion in lost productivity, \ndisability benefits and other associated costs.\n  The impact of MSDs on women workers is especially serious.\n  While women make up 46% of the total workforce and only make up 33% \nof total injured workers, they receive 63% of all lost work time from \nergonomic injuries and 69% of lost work time because of carpal tunnel \nsyndrome.\n  In addition, women in the health care, retail and textile industries \nare particularly hard hit by MSDs and carpal tunnel syndrome.\n  Women suffer more than 90% of the MSDs among nurses, nurse aides, \nhealth care aides and sewing machine operators.\n  Women also account for 91% of the carpal tunnel cases that occur \namong cashiers.\n  Despite the overwhelming financial and physical impact of MSDs and \nthe disproportionate impact they have on our nation's women, there have \nbeen several efforts over the years to prevent OSHA from issuing an \nergonomics standard.\n  This amendment is intended to stop OSHA from implementing its \nergonomic standard, which is scheduled to take place by the end of this \nyear. We have examined the merits of this rule over and over again.\n  Contrary to what those on the other side of this issue say, the \nscience and data support the need for an ergonomics standard.\n  We shouldn't be placing roadblocks in the way of its implementation.\n  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) \nstudied ergonomics and concluded that\n\n[[Page S5603]]\n\nthere is ``clear and compelling evidence'' that MSDs are caused by work \nand can be reduced and prevented through workplace interventions.\n  The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, the \nworld's largest occupational medical society, agreed with NIOSH and saw \nno reason to delay implementation. The studies and science are \nconclusive.\n  Mr. President, the states are getting this right.\n  My state--the state of Washington--just one month ago became the \nsecond state along with California to adopt an ergonomics rule.\n  The rule will help employers in my state reduce workplace hazards \nthat cripple and injure more than 50,000 Washington workers a year at a \ncost of more than $411 million a year.\n  The estimated benefits to employers from reducing these hazards are \n$340 million per year, with the estimated costs of compliance of only \n$80.4 million per year.\n  Now Washington and California both have ergonomic standards. North \nCarolina proposed an ergonomics standard and I understand that other \nstates are also looking into the possibility of developing their own \nstandards to benefit their workers.\n  We should take the cue from my state and others who have seen the \nwisdom of issuing ergonomics standards.\n  We cannot afford to delay an important standard which will greatly \nimprove workplace safety.\n  Outside of ergonomics, I want to make one general statement about \nanother provision of the underlying bill.\n  The Senate bill underfunds the Dislocated Worker programs by some \n$181 million dollars, and it underfunds vital re-employment services by \n$25 million.\n  This will mean that 100,000 dislocated workers will be denied \ntraining, job search and re-employment services.\n  In addition, the cuts in re-employment services would effectively \ndeny 111,000 people seeking unemployment insurance from getting other \nvital re-employment services.\n  Last year these programs were very helpful to workers in my state who \nwere laid off through no cause of their own.\n  For example, the Boeing company, the largest employer in my state, \nhas been especially hard-hit by the trade consequences of overseas \ncompetition from Airbus. Thousands of workers have been laid off in the \npast few years.\n  Those workers who were laid off have been receiving benefits from \nthese programs, and I think it's irresponsible to abandon these workers \nwho were laid off through no fault of their own. We owe it to the \nworkers of America to fully-fund those programs that benefit them and \ntheir families.\n  I urge my colleagues to correct this funding problem so these workers \naren't left behind.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  We should allow OSHA to issue an ergonomics standard.\n  It will be an important step forward in protecting our nation's \nworkers from crippling injuries.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, in 1970, Congress established the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), to ``assure so \nfar as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and \nhealthful working conditions.'' Therefore, OSHA is responsible for \nensuring that both employers and employees have access to the necessary \ntraining, resources, and support systems to eliminate workplace \ninjuries, illnesses, and deaths. To achieve a safe and healthy \nworkplace, OSHA must be pro-active in identifying workplace safety and \nhealth problems.\n  We, in Congress, must not forget our commitment to America's workers. \nThat is why I am here today to speak on behalf of OSHA's effort to \nestablish ergonomic standards.\n  Each year more than 600,000 workers suffer serious injuries, such as \nback injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome, and tendinitis, as a result of \nergonomic hazards. Last year, in my State of Hawaii, more than 4,400 \nprivate sector workers suffered serious injuries from ergonomic hazards \nat work. Another 700 workers in the public sector suffered such \ninjuries. These injuries are a major problem not only in the State of \nHawaii, but across the nation. It affects not just truck drivers and \nassembly line workers, but also nurses and computer users. Every sector \nof the economy is affected by this problem. The impact can be \ndevastating for workers who suffer from these injuries.\n  It is important to note that ergonomics is not new. It has been \naround as early as World War II, where the designers of our small plane \ncockpits took into consideration the placement of cockpit controls for \nour pilots. And, for OSHA this matter is also not new. OSHA has been \nworking on ergonomic standards for 10 years, of which, for the last \nfive years, OSHA has been delayed from finalizing any ergonomic \nstandard. Opponents of a standard have either prohibited OSHA from \nissuing its standard or delayed its work until such time as the \nNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the \nNational Academy of Sciences (NAS) can complete their studies and \nreport to Congress. Although NIOSH and NAS completed their reports and \nboth indicated that there was credible research showing a consistent \nrelationship between musculoskeletal disorders and certain physical \nfactors, critics were not satisfied and requested another NAS report in \n1998; yet another delaying tactic.\n  It is unfortunate that OSHA has been prevented from issuing any \nergonomic standard for the past five years. It is important to note \nthat some of these delays were part of agreements and promises made to \nproponents for accepting some of these requests. As we see now, the \npromises made have been broken. More specifically, in 1997, the \nleadership of the Appropriations Committee in the House agreed that the \ncoming fiscal year would be the last time in which OSHA would be \nprohibited from spending any of its funds on issuing proposed ergonomic \nstandards, and again, in 1998, House Appropriations Chair Robert \nLivingston and Ranking Member David Obey sent a letter to Secretary of \nLabor Alexis Herman that stated, ``it is in no way our intent to block \nor delay issuance by OSHA of a proposed rule on ergonomics.'' However, \nin 1999, legislation was introduced (H.R. 987 and S. 1070) to block \nOSHA's ergonomic standards, and the House Appropriations Committee \nadopted a rider that would shut down the rulemaking process and block \nOSHA's final rule.\n  American workers cannot afford any more delays. Injuries that result \nfrom ergonomic hazards are serious, disabling, and costly. Carpal \ntunnel syndrome results in workers losing more time from their jobs \nthan any other type of injury. It is estimated that these injuries \naccount for an estimated $20 billion annually in workers compensation.\n  The most compelling reason to allow OSHA to complete this process is \nthat these injuries and illnesses can be prevented. In fact, some \nemployers across the country have already taken action and put in place \nworkplace ergonomics programs to prevent injuries. However, two-thirds \nof employers still do not have adequate ergonomic programs in place.\n  It has been 10 years since Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole promised to \ntake action to protect workers from ergonomic injuries and to issue an \nergonomics standard. Since that time, more than 6.1 million workers \nhave suffered serious injuries as a result of ergonomic hazards. OSHA's \nproposed rule would prevent 300,000 injuries each year and save $9 \nbillion in workers' compensation and related costs. It is time for \nCongress to remember the commitment made to the nation's workforce when \nit established OSHA in 1970, and allow OSHA to continue its issuing of \nan ergonomics standard.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to make a statement for myself as \nwell as Senator Edward Kennedy, Ranking Member of the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee; Senator Susan Collins; \nSenator Christopher Dodd; Senator Olympia Snowe; Senator Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan; Senator Carl Levin; Senator Charles Schumer; Senator Paul \nWellstone; and Senator Patrick Leahy.\n  First, we would like to take this opportunity to commend the hard \nwork and dedication of Senator Arlen Specter. As Chairman of the Labor-\nHHS Appropriations Committee, he has the formidable task of crafting \nlegislation which funds many of the programs under the jurisdiction of \nthe HELP Committee, which I chair. This year's\n\n[[Page S5604]]\n\nbill, like many in recent memory, has proven challenging for Chairman \nSpecter and Ranking Member Tom Harkin, and they have done their best to \ndeliver a fair bill.\n  There is no doubt; funding is tight. However, we would like to make a \nplea to appropriators as they put the finishing touches on the Labor-\nHHS Appropriations bill.\n  This year, 46 Senators signed a letter in support of the Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Specifically, we asked for \n$1.4 billion in regular LIHEAP funding, along with $300 million in \nemergency funding. In addition, we urged $1.5 billion in advance LIHEAP \nfunding for fiscal year 2002. While funding was not as much as we had \nhoped for in FY2001, our concern centers around the lack of advance \nFY2002 LIHEAP funding.\n  As you know, the importance of LIHEAP funding has been demonstrated \nthis past year as many states have faced extreme temperatures and high \nfuel costs. The clear need for timely energy assistance in the form of \nconsistent regular LIHEAP funding has been demonstrated. For planning \npurposes, the states have come to rely on the knowledge that our \nadvance funding mark provides them. An advance appropriation allows for \norderly planning of programs, as well as creating administrative \nsystems for more efficient program management.\n  Advance appropriations for LIHEAP has been an effective tool that \nallows states to determine eligibility, establish the size of the \nbenefits, determine the parameters of the crisis programs and enable \nthe states to properly budget for staffing needs. In addition, states \nneed an idea of the anticipated program's size in order to effectively \nmeet their obligations under the law.\n  In conclusion, we appreciate the difficult work facing the \nAppropriations Committee. However, we feel strongly that this advance \nfunding allocation is a critical tool in assisting our states to have \nthe most effective LIHEAP programs possible, and we look forward to \nworking with Chairman Specter to restore this funding in conference.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the bill the Senate is considering \ntoday addresses some of the nation's most pressing problems and is very \nimportant to my state, the largest state in the nation, with a \npopulation of 34 million people.\n  California's schools face huge challenges--low test scores, crowded \nclassrooms, teacher shortages, booming enrollments, decrepit buildings.\n  California has 5.8 million students, more students than 36 states \nhave in total population and one of the highest projected enrollments \nin the US.\n  California has 40 percent of the nation's immigrants; we have 50 \nlanguages in some schools.\n  Many of California's students have low test scores and are taught by \nuncredentialed teachers.\n  At the college level, the University of California has the most \ndiverse student body in the US. Federal programs provide nearly 55 \npercent of all student financial aid funding that UC students received. \nOur colleges and universities are facing ``Tidal Wave II,'' the \ndemographic bulge created by children of the baby boomers who will \ninundate California's colleges and universities between 2000 and 2010 \nbecause the number of high school graduates will jump by 30 percent.\n  Our needs are huge.\n  I am pleased that the bill before us increases education by $4.6 \nbillion over last year. The federal share of elementary-secondary \neducation funding has declined from 14 percent in 1980 to 6 percent in \n1999.\n  Devoting more resources to education is critical in my state. On May \n17, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a suit against the \nCalifornia Department of Education charging that many of our students \ndo not have the bare essentials for getting an education, basics like \ntextbooks, school supplies, libraries, computers, and credentialed \nteachers. In some classes, there are not enough seats or desks, the air \nconditioning and heating systems are broken and the roofs leak. I do \nnot know what the outcome of this suit will be, but it is certainly a \nsad commentary on the state of our schools.\n  Clearly, we need to do more and this bill makes a start.\n  The bill increases the Title I program, the program for disadvantaged \nstudents, by $278 million. I am grateful that the committee included \ntwo of my requests relating to what is called the ``hold harmless'' \nprovision.\n  In 1994, Congress put in the law a requirement that the Department of \nEducation annually update the number of poor children so that the \nallocation of funds would truly reflect the most recent count of poor \nchildren. This is a very important provision to growing states like \nmine. However, despite my opposition, the hold harmless provision has \nbeen included in the last three annual appropriations bills and this \nbill today, effectively overriding the census update requirement and \nlocking in historic funding amounts for states despite the change in \nthe number of poor children.\n  Secretary Riley said--I whole-heartedly agree--that ``a basic \nprinciple in targeting should be to drive funds to where the poor \nchildren are, not to where they were a decade ago.'' Because of the \nhold harmless, my state has lost over $120 million since 1998 and I am \ndisappointed that my efforts to totally eliminate it were not \nsuccessful. Nevertheless, I appreciate the inclusion of two \nprovisions: (1) a provision that says that the Department of Education \ncannot apply the Title I ``hold harmless'' to other programs that use \nthe Title I formula in whole or in part; and (2) a provision clarifying \nthat the ``hold harmless'' will not apply to any ``new'' funds, funds \nexceeding the FY 2000 level. These are steps forward.\n\n  Head Start is one of the most important federal programs because it \nhas the potential to reach children early in their formative years when \ntheir cognitive skills are just developing. Many studies have confirmed \nthe significance of bringing positive influences to early brain \ndevelopment. But we know that poor children disproportionately start \nschool behind their peers. They are less likely to be able to count or \nto recite the alphabet.\n  Providing low-income children with access to programs that encourage \ncognitive learning and prepare them to enter school ready to learn is \nimportant. Head Start has the potential to reach every low-income \nchild, to help every eligible child learn in the pre-school years.\n  The addition of $1 billion in this bill for Head Start could enroll 1 \nmillion more children by 2002, a 19 percent increase over last year. \nThis is good first step. Nationwide, only 42 percent of eligible \nchildren participate in the Head Start program. I would like to see 100 \npercent of all eligible children enrolled. I think we can do it. \nCalifornia has 764,462 poor children age 5 and under in poverty, but we \nare only serving 13 percent of eligible children. We must do better.\n  The Rand Corporation has found that for every dollar invested in \nearly childhood learning programs, taxpayers save between $4 and $7 \nlater by reducing the need for alcohol and drug treatment programs, \nspecial education programs, mental health services, and the likelihood \nof incarceration. The proposed $1 billion increase is a good step to \nensuring that every child gets a head start.\n  I firmly believe, however, that we must do more with the proposed $1 \nbillion increase than merely enroll more children in the program. We \nmust continue to improve the Head Start program such that children \nleave the program able to count to ten, to recognize sizes and colors, \nand can begin to recite the alphabet, to name a few indicators of \ncognitive learning. We must also continue to raise the standards and \npay of Head Start teachers.\n  We also need to recruit qualified Head Start teachers who have \ndemonstrated knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, early \nchildhood development, and other areas of the preschool curriculum. \nHaving qualified teachers is a critical way to jump-start cognitive \nlearning and ensure that our youngsters start elementary school ready \nto learn.\n  I am disappointed that the bill ``flat funds'' (provides no \nincreases) for helping newly immigrant children. Appropriations were \n$150 million in 1998, $150 million in 1999, and $150 million in 2000 \nand in this bill.\n  California receives $180.00 for each eligible immigrant child which \nhardly begins to address the needs these children bring to the \nclassroom. These are\n\n[[Page S5605]]\n\nthe most at-risk of all children. They speak another language; their \nschooling has been interrupted and they have huge adjustment \nchallenges. We can do better.\n  It is disappointing that the bill does not specifically include the \nPresident's initiatives on school construction and class size \nreduction. These are long overdue.\n  The bill does include in the Title VI block grant $2.7 billion that \nlocal districts can use to reduce class sizes and/or to build schools. \nThis will help my state. California will need 300,000 new teachers by \n2010. Eleven percent or 30,000 of our 285,000 teachers are on emergency \ncredentials. For school construction, modernization and deferred \nmaintenance, California needs $16.5 billion by 2004. Two million \nCalifornia children go to school today in 86,000 portable classrooms.\n  California started reducing class sizes in grades K-3 in the 1996-\n1997 school year. We had then and we still have some of the largest \nclass sizes in the country. And every parent knows that the smaller the \nclass the more individualized attention students receive and the more \neffective the teacher can be.\n\n  I am pleased to see the increase of $817 million for the Child Care \nand Development Block Grant. Quality, affordable child care helps keep \nlow-income working parents employed and off welfare. The increase in \nchild care funds will help increase the number of available child care \n``slots'' and improve the quality of this care.\n  Health care is another important concern of Californians that is \naddressed in this bill in several ways.\n  The California health care system is on the brink of collapse. In my \nstate, 38 hospitals have closed since 1996 and 15 percent more may \nclose by 2005. Over half my state's hospitals are losing money. Seismic \nsafety requirements add more cost strains.\n  We have an uninsured rate of 24 percent (7.3 million people), far \nabove the national rate of 18 percent. Despite a thriving economy, the \nnumber of Californians without health insurance grows by 50,000 per \nmonth.\n  California has the second highest incidence of HIV/AIDS in the US. \nWhile the AIDS death rate has declined, it is still too high; 40,000 \nnew infections develop each year. In California, 100,000 people are \nliving with HIV/AIDS.\n  California ranks 37th overall among states having children immunized \nby the age of 18 to 24 months.\n  For NIH, with a 15 percent increase or $2.7 billion, this bill will \nkeep us on the path toward doubling NIH over five years. Even though \nCongress has given NIH generous increases in the last two years, NIH in \n2000 can only fund 31 percent of grant proposals.\n  Investing in biomedical research has given us longer lives, healthier \nlives, and cures and new treatments and insights into diseases ranging \nfrom asthma to Alzheimers. This is an area of governmental activity \nthat Americans overwhelmingly support. Fifty-five percent of \nCalifornians said they would pay more in taxes for more medical \nresearch.\n  This bill increases cancer funding by almost $500 million, raising \nthe National Cancer Institute to $3.8 billion. Dr. Richard Klausner, \nDirector of NCI, indicated during the Subcommittee's hearing on funding \nfor NIH that in order to fund all the meritorious grant applicants NCI \nwould need a 20 percent increase in funding. I am hopeful that the \nincrease in this bill will bring us closer to a cure and will give us \nthe tools to better treat the 1.2 million Americans that will face \ncancer this year.\n  While the National Cancer Institute is making great strides in \nunderstanding cancer and how to treat cancer, cancer is still the \nsecond leading cause of death for all Americans, meaning that one of \nevery four people dies of cancer. Fifty percent of Americans have had \nsomeone close them die from cancer.\n  There are 1.2 million new cases each year. Over 552,000 Americans \nwill die from cancer this year. Because of the aging of our population, \nthe incidence of cancer will continue to grow and reach staggering \nproportions by 2010, with a 29 percent increase in incidence and a 25 \npercent increase in deaths, at a cost of over $200 billion per year. \nThe cancer burden will balloon especially in the next 10 to 25 years as \nthe country's demographics change.\n  Why invest more in cancer research? The Cancer March Research Task \nForce said we could reduce cancer deaths from 25 to 40 percent over the \nnext 20 year period, saving 150,000 to 225,000 lives each year. Other \nareas that could be enhanced are bringing new cancer drugs from the \nlaboratory to clinical trials; continuing to identify genes involved in \ncancer; improving our understanding of the interaction between genes \nand environmental exposures; finding new ways to detect cancers earlier \nwhen they are small, not invasive and more easily treated.\n\n  We must also improve participation in cancer clinical trials. \nMedicare beneficiaries account for more than 50 percent of all cancer \ndiagnoses and 60 percent of all cancer deaths, but only three to four \npercent participate in clinical trials. Hopefully, with the increases \nin this bill, NIH can improve recruitment into clinical trials to \nadvance science toward more cures.\n  I am disappointed that the bill moves FY 1998 funds for the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program to 2003. Unfortunately, 37 states, \nincluding mine, have not been able to enroll children as quickly as \nthey had hope and have not used all the funds we provided. Without this \nbill, California's unspent CHIP funds would be redistributed to other \nstates. Under this bill, states will have until October 1 to spend \ntheir 1998 CHIP funds and funds allotted to my state to insure children \nwill not go to other states, as they would without this bill.\n  We must do more to ensure that all children are fully-immunized by \nthe age of 2. While the bill has $524 million for CDC's program, a 14 \npercent increase over last year, it falls $75 million short of \nproviding the resources necessary to conduct adequate community \noutreach in under-served areas, parental and provider education about \nnew vaccines, and the development and operation of state-based \nimmunization registries, and $10 million short of providing adequate \nfunding for the purchase of vaccines.\n  Do we really want our children to get polio, measles, mumps, chicken \npox, rubella, and whooping cough--diseases for which we have effective \nvaccines, diseases which we have practically eradicated by widespread \nimmunization? My State ranks 37th overall among States having children \nfully immunized by the age of 18 to 24 months. According to an Annie E. \nCasey Foundation report, 28 percent of California's two-year old \nchildren are not immunized.\n  Every parent knows that vaccines are fundamental to a child's good \nhealth. However, some families do not have access to vaccines through \nhealth insurance. Congress must make certain there is adequate funding \nfor immunization programs so that all children are immunized against \ndisease.\n  The bill increases funds for the Ryan White CARE Act by $55 million, \nfor a total of $1.6 billion. This is important to thousands of \nAmericans with HIV/AIDS. Since 1990, the CARE Act has helped establish \na comprehensive, community-based continuum of care for uninsured and \nunder-insured people living with HIV and AIDS. People who would not \notherwise have access to care are able to receive medical care, drugs, \nand support services.\n  The CARE Act is particularly important to communities of color. AIDS \nis the leading cause of death among African American men and the second \nleading cause of death among African American women between the ages of \n25 and 44. By comparison, AIDS is the fifth leading cause of death \namong all Americans in this age group.\n  A disproportionate number of African Americans and Hispanic/Latinos \nare also living with AIDS. Whereas African Americans represent only 13 \npercent of the total U.S. population, they represent 36 percent of \nreported AIDS cases. Likewise, Latinos represent 9 percent of the \npopulation but 17 percent all of AIDS cases. We must do more to target \nprevention efforts and funding for CARE Act services to the communities \nmost heavily impacted; minority and under-served communities.\n  Two of California's largest cities, Los Angeles and San Francisco, \nare among the top four metropolitan cites with the highest number of \nAIDS cases in the United States. Through the CARE Act, Los Angeles has \nprovided services\n\n[[Page S5606]]\n\nto over 43,160 clients since 1996. San Francisco has provided services \nto 47,440 since 1996. I am disappointed that the Committee's \nrecommendation provides for $70 million less for Ryan White AIDS \nprograms than requested by the administration. We should fully fund the \nCARE Act. The CARE Act is more important now than ever. The epidemic is \nnot over. In fact, it is reaching into lower-income communities, \naffecting more women and minorities than previously. HIV/AIDS remains a \nhealth emergency in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control \nestimates that 40,000 new cases are reported annually. According to the \nCenters for Disease Control, between 650,000 and 900,000 Americans are \ncurrently infected with HIV while the number of AIDS cases has nearly \ndoubled over the past five years.\n\n  Community health center programs are the ``medical home'' to millions \nof uninsured and low-income individuals. Current resources only allow \nhealth centers to serve 10 percent of the Nation's 44 million \nuninsured. This is troubling given that the number of our Nation's \nuninsured continues to grow at a rate of 100,000 per month. At this \nrate, by 2008 we can expect our nation's uninsured to reach 58 million. \nAs the number of uninsured continues to grow, community health centers \nwill become even more important as more people will rely on these \ncenters to access health care.\n  Community health centers are the backbone of our Nation's safety-net. \nI am committed to doubling funding for these centers over the next five \nyears. This requires an increase of at least 15 percent in each of the \nnext five years, including an increase of $150 million in 2001. \nAlthough the $100 million increase in the bill is a good step, it is \nnot enough. We need to add $50 million to the program to meet this \ngoal.\n  Community health centers are vital to California's 7.3 million \nuninsured. Over 80 of California's clinics are located in under served \nareas and provide primary and preventive services to 10 percent of the \nuninsured people in the state. With a much needed increase in funding, \nthese clinics could provide care to more of my State's uninsured. The \ncare provided by health centers reduces hospitalizations and emergency \nroom use, reduce annual Medicaid costs, and help prevent more expensive \nchronic disease and disability. Increasing appropriations to health \ncenters makes good sense.\n  I am disappointed in the cuts in the bill to train health \nprofessionals. Almost one in five Californians lives in a health \nprofessions shortage area. We are facing a nursing shortage and will \nneed 43,000 more nurses by 2010, which is a conservative estimate based \non a projected 23 percent increase in the state's population. I hope \nthese cuts will be restored.\n  The bill reported by the Committee funds the Social Services Block \nGrant at $600 million or 75 percent less than the authorized level of \n$1.7 billion. This drastic reduction in funding for SSBG will result in \ncuts to vital human services for our most vulnerable citizens. I hope \nwe can restore these funds.\n  If the program were fully funded, California would receive $203.8 \nmillion in SSBG funds. If funding is cut to $600 million nationwide, \nCalifornia will receive $71.9 million. This is a reduction of $131.9 \nmillion.\n  California uses this money to fund its developmental disabilities \nprogram, which provides services and support to people with \ndevelopmental disabilities and their families. The State also uses the \nfunds to provide support for in-home care givers to the elderly, blind, \nand disabled. SSBG is a major source of funding for child protective \nservices and for child care in every state.\n  This is a good bill, addressing many of the nation's critical human \nneeds. The bill can be improved in several areas.\n  I hope the leadership and the bill's managers will work hard to \nrestore the cuts I have cited and to send to the President a bill that \naddresses the nation's many critical health, education and human \nservices needs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join a number of our \ncolleagues in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Enzi].\n  I strongly support the efforts of the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration (OSHA) to promulgate fair and responsible ergonomics \nstandards and regulations. I believe that such standards are \ninstrumental in helping to reduce the occurrence of preventable \nworkplace injuries.\n  More than 600,000 American workers suffer from workplace injuries \ncaused by repetitive motions including typing, heavy lifting, and \nsewing. These injuries have an impact on every sector of our economy, \nand are particularly prevalent among women because many of the jobs \nheld predominately by women require repetitive motions or heavy \nlifting. And these preventable injuries, including the painful and \noften debilitating carpal tunnel syndrome, cost more than $60 billion \nannually, $20 billion of which is from workers' compensation costs.\n  I want to say this again, Mr. President, repetitive stress injuries \nare particularly prevalent among women.\n  According to the Department of Labor, almost 230,000 women miss at \nleast some time at work each year because of ergonomics injuries \nrelated to their jobs. To further emphasize the impact that these \ninjuries have on women, let me cite the following statistics from the \nDepartment of Labor:\n  In 1997, women experienced 33 percent of all serious workplace \ninjuries that required time off from work;\n  But women experienced 63 percent of all repetitive motion injuries, \nincluding 91 percent of injuries cause by repetitive typing or keying \nand 61 percent from repetitive placing;\n  These injuries include 62 percent of all work-related tendinitis \ncases and 70 percent of carpal tunnel syndrome cases; and\n  Recuperation from carpal tunnel syndrome, an often debilitating \ncondition, requires an average of 25 days away from work.\n  The proponents of this amendment argue that further study is required \nbefore OSHA can promulgate its final ergonomics standard. I disagree. \nIt is clear that more needs to be done to prevent these needless \ninjuries, and that there is already a significant body of research \noutlining the need for national ergonomics standards from sources \nincluding the National Academy of Sciences, the National Institute for \nOccupational Safety and Health, and the General Accounting Office.\n  And further proof can be found in the existing ergonomics programs. \nCompanies across the country have reduced the instances of preventable \nworkplace injuries by designing and implementing their own ergonomics \nprograms. In my home state of Wisconsin, the popular maker of \nchildren's clothing, OshKosh B'Gosh, redesigned its workstations. This \ncommon sense action cut the company's workers' compensation costs by \none-third, which resulted in a savings of approximately $2.7 million.\n  Another Wisconsin company, Harley-Davidson, cut workplace ergonomics \ninjuries by more than half after implementing an ergonomics program.\n  An employee of a health care facility in my hometown of Janesville, \nWisconsin, said the following about the joint efforts between her \nmanagement and fellow employees to design a program to combat injuries \nthat are all too common among health care workers:\n  Quote--``I am here today to tell OSHA that working in a nursing home \nis demanding and hazardous work. Those hazards include back injuries as \nwell as problems in the hands, arms, shoulders, and other parts of the \nbody. . . . I am also here to testify that the injuries and pain do not \nhave to be part of the job . . . Together [management and labor] have \nidentified jobs where there are risks of back injuries. After getting \ninput from employees, the employer has selected equipment that has \nimproved the comfort [and] the safety of patients as well as the \nemployees.\n  . . . What we are doing at the [nursing home] is proof that it is \npossible to prevent injuries with a commitment from management and the \ninvolvement of employees. Our injury prevention program is win-win for \neverybody: Management, labor, the patients, and their families. I urge \nOSHA to issue an ergonomics rule so that nursing home workers across \nthe country will have the same protection that we have at the health \ncare center.''--End of quote.\n  And there are many other success stories in Wisconsin and around the \nUnited States.\n\n[[Page S5607]]\n\n  I commend the efforts of those companies which have proven that \nresponsible ergonomics programs can--and do--prevent injuries resulting \nfrom repetitive motions. Unfortunately, not all American workers are \nprotected by ergonomics programs like those I have described.\n  For example, one of my constituents who testified at an ergonomics \nevent in my state has endured three surgeries over a ten year period to \nrepair damage to his spine caused by repetitive motions at his job. In \nhis testimony, this man said, quote--``Pain is my constant companion \nand I still need pain medication to get through the day. It is an \neffort just to put my socks on in the morning. I will never be healthy \nand pain free.''--End of quote.\n  Another one of my constituents described the impact that an injury he \nsustained at work while lifting a 60-80 pound basket of auto parts has \nhad on his once active lifestyle. Quote--``This pain has limited me in \nmany ways. . . . I used to teach soccer to kids. Now I can't walk more \nthan half an hour without pain in my legs and spine. I have to prepare \nmyself for fifteen minutes in the morning just to get out of bed.''--\nEnd of quote.\n  Mr. President, injuries such as those suffered by my constituents--\nand indeed by workers in each one of our states--can be prevented \nthrough sensible and responsible national ergonomics standards.\n  Repetitive stress injuries are costing American businesses millions \nof dollars and are costing American workers their health and, in some \ncases, their mobility. This means that some workers will lose the \nability to do certain activities--activities ranging from simple tasks \nlike fastening buttons to more meaningful things including picking up a \nchild or participating in sports.\n  These are real people, Mr. President. They are our constituents, our \nfamily, our friends, our neighbors. We should not block a regulation \nthat will help to stop these preventable injuries from forever changing \nthe lives of countless Americans who are working to provide their \nfamilies and themselves with a decent standard of living.\n  I recognize that some industries and small businesses are concerned \nabout the impact, financial and otherwise, that this proposed standard \nwill have on them. I have written to OSHA on behalf of a number of my \nconstituents to communicate their concerns. I hope that the public \ncomment and hearing phases of this rule-making process have adequately \nbrought these concerns to light. I also hope that OSHA will take these \nconcerns into account as that agency continues the process of \nfinalizing this important rule, taking seriously the concerns of \nemployers who fear the new rule will be too burdensome. We need a new \nrule that protects workers and is fair to all.\n  Mr. President, repetitive motion injuries can and should be \nprevented. And I strongly believe that we should have a national \nstandard that affords all workers the same protections from these \ndebilitating injuries. We should not delay these efforts. The health \nand mobility of countless American workers is at stake.\n  I again urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment and allow OSHA to \nmove forward in its efforts to promulgate fair and responsible \nergonomics standards.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr President, I am pleased to come to the floor of the \nSenate today to speak in support of the Enzi amendment to the Labor-HHS \nAppropriations bill. As my colleagues know, the Enzi amendment is \nnecessary to prevent the Occupational Safety and Hazard Administration \nfrom enacting a costly regulation without adequate scientific \nunderstanding of the very problem they hope to prevent.\n  As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean \nAir, I have seen first hand how this administration refuses to conduct \nthe proper scientific study of regulations they propose to promulgate. \nThe reason, I fear, its rather simple: the scientific evidence does not \nsupport their political agenda. Based on my observations, the rule of \nthumb with this administration is ``if the scientific evidence does not \nsupport the goal, ignore the evidence.'' In this instance, we've been \nasking OSHA to do due diligence concerning the science behind this rule \nfor five years.\n  I am not necessarily opposed to an ergonomics rule, I am simply \nopposed to this rule because it is not backed by sound science. I find \nit very interesting that the National Academy of Sciences is set to \nrelease its findings on ergonomics early next year. Why then the rush. \nThe answer is obvious, OSHA fears the science will not support its \nproposal and wants to rush this into effect before the NAS finishes its \nwork.\n  The speed at which OSHA is moving on this regulation is \nunprecedented; this is the single largest regulatory effort to date and \nOSHA appears to be bending over backwards to avoid congressional \nscrutiny, which of course is not new for this administration. In \naddition to dodging congressional scrutiny, OSHA is ignoring the over \n7,000 public comments concerning the rule.\n  In addition to the process related flaws with this rule, another \nproblem is its unrealistic cost estimate. OSHA estimates the rule will \ncost approximately $4.2 billion per year which is dramatically lower \nthan all other estimates. For instance, the Small Business \nAdministration estimates the cost is $60 billion per year or 15 times \nthat of OSHA's estimate. The disparity of these figures alone should \ngive plenty of reason to rethink this rule.\n  Yet another reason to oppose this rule is the effect of the rule on \nMedicare/Medicaid patients. OSHA has repeatedly stated that business \nshould simply pass on the cost of compliance to consumers. Now, as I \nmentioned above, conservatively that cost will be in excess of $4.2 \nbillion annually. Some of these ``businesses'' OSHA believes should \npass on the cost of the rule are hospitals, nursing homes, home health \ncare agencies, and other Medicare/Medicaid dependent health care \nproviders. No where in the rule, has OSHA mentioned how these health \ncare providers should deal with the newly imposed costs. They cannot \nsimply pass on the cost as OSHA has stated so cavalierly.\n  Medicare/Medicaid providers in my state have been very clear about \nthe existing problems associated with recent cuts in Medicare/Medicaid. \nI can only image what this new burden will mean for our health care \nproviders.\n  In all fairness, OSHA has apparently thought about the cost to \nMedicare/Medicaid because they have done an estimate on the first year \ncompliance cost of the rule. They estimate it will cost about $526 \nmillion for nursing and personal care facilities. Now, I don't know \nabout my colleagues, but from the stories I've heard from my \nconstituents, that $526 million could be much better spent providing \ncare to patients. If OSHA implements this rule, we are setting the \nstage for a greater health care crisis in the country. Are health care \nproviders going to be forced to choose between complying with OSHA \nregulations or providing health care for patients? I, for one, hope \nthis is not the case.\n  Another of the significant problems with this rule is its vagueness. \nIn fact, the rule's lack of clarity has prompted the Washington Post, \nclearly not a mouthpiece of conservative thinking, to say, that the \nrule is too vague and will cause problems.\n  There are many unanswered questions that OSHA readily admits it \ncannot answer and in all probability will never be able to answer. \nAmong these now unanswered questions are: What is a definable \nergonomics hazard? How can these undefined hazards be fixed? How will \nthese undefined hazards be enforced?\n  Since OSHA cannot determine what the potential hazards are or how \nthey can be fixed, it admits that actions that employers take to remedy \nsupposed problems may actually make those problems worse. Since OSHA \nitself does not know what the extent of the problems are, it should \ncome as no surprise that this is the only rule OSHA has ever put \nforward that does not provide employers some guidance for implementing \nappropriate measures to prevent injuries. Instead, the rule, as \ndrafted, only sets forth penalties for employers if they fail to remedy \nthese undefinable dangers.\n  Given these uncertainties, it is clear that the rule is flawed and \nshould be stopped as is our prerogative. We have no choice. We must \nreject this rule and demand that OSHA conduct its due diligence before \npromulgating another.\n\n[[Page S5608]]\n\nI hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the Enzi amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment to \nprohibit OSHA from moving forward with its ergonomics standard. OSHA \nhas been attempting to implement an ergonomics standard for the past 10 \nyears. But each year, Congress has delayed the standard.\n  As long ago as 1990, the Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole in the \nBush Administration called ergonomic injuries ``one of the nation's \nmost debilitating across-the-board worker safety and health \nillnesses.'' Since that time, over 2,000 scientific studies have \nexamined the issue, including a comprehensive review by the National \nAcademy of Sciences.\n  All of these studies tell us the same thing--it's long past time to \nenact an ergonomics standard to protect the health of American workers \nand prevent these debilitating injuries in the workplace.\n  Each year, over 1.7 million workers suffer from ergonomic injuries \nand nearly 600,000 workers lose a day or more of work because of \nergonomic injuries suffered on the job. Ergonomic injuries account for \nover one-third of all serious job-related injuries.\n  These injuries are painful and often crippling. They range from \ncarpal tunnel syndrome, to severe back injuries, to disorders of the \nmuscles and nerves.\n  Carpal tunnel syndrome keeps workers off the job longer than any \nother workplace injury. This injury alone causes workers to lose an \naverage of more than 25 days, compared to 17 days for fractures and 20 \ndays for amputations.\n  Ergonomics is also a women's issue, because women workers are \ndisproportionately affected by these injuries. Women make up 46 percent \nof the overall workforce--but in 1998 they accounted for 64 percent of \nrepetitive motion injuries and 71 percent of carpal tunnel cases.\n  The good news is that these injuries are preventable. The National \nAcademy of Sciences and the National Institute of Occupational Safety \nand Health have both found that obvious adjustments in the workplace \ncan prevent workers from suffering ergonomic injuries and illnesses.\n  Congress has a responsibility to ensure that the nation's worker \nprotection laws keep pace with changes in the workforce. Early in this \ncentury, the industrial age created deadly new conditions for large \nnumbers of the Nation's workers.\n  When miners were killed or maimed in explosion after explosion, we \nenacted the Federal Coal Mine Safety and Health Act. As workplace \nhazards became more subtle, but no less dangerous, we responded by \npassing the Occupational Safety and Health Act to address hazards such \nas asbestos and cotton dust. Now, as the workplace moves from the \nindustrial to the information age, our laws must evolve again to \naddress the emerging dangers to American workers. Ergonomic injuries \nare one of the principal hazards of the modern American workplace--and \nwe owe it to the 600,000 workers who suffer serious ergonomic injuries \neach year to address this problem now.\n  Ergonomic injuries affect the lives of working men and women across \nthe country. They injure nurses who regularly lift and move patients, \nand construction workers who lift heavy objects. They harm assembly \nline workers whose task consists of constant repetitive motions. They \ninjure data entry workers who type on computer keyboards all day long. \nEven if we are not doing these jobs ourselves, we all know people who \ndo. They are mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons and \ndaughters, and neighbors--and they deserve our help.\n  We need to help workers like Beth Piknick from Massachusetts, who was \nan intensive care nurse for 21 years before a preventable back injury \nrequired her to undergo a spinal fusion operation and spend two years \nin rehabilitation. Although she wants to work, she can no longer do so. \nIn her own words, ``The loss of my ability to take care of patients led \nto a clinical depression. * * * My ability to take care of patients--\nthe reason I became a nurse--is gone. My injury--and all the losses it \nhas entailed--were preventable.''\n  We need to help workers like Elly Leary, an auto assembler at the \nnow-closed General Motors Assembly plant in Framingham, Massachusetts. \nLike many, many of her co-workers, she received a series of ergonomic \ninjuries--including carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis. Like others, \nshe tried switching hands to do her job. She tried varying the sequence \nof the routine. She even bid on other jobs. But nothing helped. Today, \nyears after her injury, when she wakes up in the morning, her hands are \nin a claw-like shape. To get them to open, she has to run hot water on \nthem.\n  We need to help workers like Charley Richardson, a shipfitter at \nGeneral Dynamics in Quincy, Massachusetts in the mid-1980's. He \nsuffered a career-ending back injury when he was told to install a 75 \npound piece of steel to reinforce a deck. Although he continued to try \nto work, he found that on many days, he could not endure the lifting \nand the use of heavy tools. For years afterwards, his injury prevented \nhim from participating in basic activities. But the loss that hurt the \nmost was having to tell his children that they couldn't sit on his lap \nfor more than a few minutes, because it was too painful. To this day, \nhe cannot sit for long without pain.\n  We need to protect workers like Wendy Scheinfeld of Brighton, \nMassachusetts, a model employee in the insurance industry. Colleagues \nsay she often put in extra hours at work to ``get the job done.'' She \ndeveloped carpal tunnel syndrome from using the computer at work. As a \nresult, Wendy has lost the use of her hands, and is now permanently \nunable to do her job, drive a car, play the cello, or shop for \ngroceries.\n  Even though it may be too late to help Beth, Elly, Charley and Wendy, \nworkers just like them deserve an ergonomics standard to protect them \nfrom such debilitating injuries.\n  Some in Congress argue that OSHA is rushing the process too much. But \nlet's review the record. OSHA's rulemaking effort began ten years ago \nin the Bush Administration under Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole. \nYears of study and development have laid the groundwork for this \nproposed standard. OSHA held nine stakeholder meetings following its \nAdvance Notice of Public Rulemaking in 1992. OSHA also held 11 best-\npractices conferences between 1997 and the end of 1999. Since November, \n1999, there has been a 100-day pre-hearing comment period and nine \nweeks of public hearings.\n  The Agency is currently in the midst of a 30-day comment period on an \neconomic analysis and a 60-day post-hearing comment period on the \nproposed standard. There will be another public hearing on July 7. All \ntold, the public will have had over 8 months of opportunity for public \ncomment since the publication of the proposed standard last November. \nAfter 10 years of attempting to address this serious problem, this \namendment would delay OSHA's standard yet again.\n  Last fall, when we considered the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, \nopponents of an ergonomics standard wanted us to wait for the National \nAcademy of Sciences to complete a further study before OSHA establishes \na standard. But it was just another delaying tactic. As we said then, \nover 2,000 studies on ergonomics have already been carried out.\n  In 1997, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health \nreviewed 600 of the most important of those studies. In 1998, the \nNational Academy of Sciences reviewed the studies again. Congress even \nasked the General Accounting Office to conduct its own study.\n  The National Academy of Sciences found that work clearly causes \nergonomic injuries. They concluded that ``the positive relationship \nbetween the occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders and the conduct of \nwork is clear.'' The National Institute for Occupational Safety and \nHealth agreed. They found ``strong evidence of an association between \nMSDs and certain work-related physical factors.''\n  The Academy also found that ergonomics programs are effective. As the \nAcademy found, ``Research clearly demonstrates that specific \ninterventions can reduce the reported rate of musculoskeltal disorders \nfor workers who perform high-risk tasks.''\n  Finally, the GAO concluded that ergonomics is good business. Its \nreport declared, ``Officials at all the facilities\n\n[[Page S5609]]\n\nwe visited believed their ergonomics programs yielded benefits, \nincluding reductions in workers' compensation costs.''\n  The truth is that the Labor Department's ergonomics rule is based on \nsound science. In addition to the National Academy of Sciences and the \nNational Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, medical and \nscientific groups have expressed widespread support for moving forward \nwith an ergonomics rule.\n  The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, \nrepresenting over 7,000 physicians, has stated that ``there is * * * no \nreason for OSHA to delay the rule-making process while the NAS panel \nconducts its review.'' The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, \nrepresenting 16,000 surgeons, the American Association of Occupational \nHealth Nurses, representing 13,000 nurses, and the American Public \nHealth Association, representing 50,000 members, all agree that an \nergonomics rule is necessary and based on sound science.\n  Many members of the business community support ergonomics \nprotections, because good ergononics is good business. Currently, \nbusinesses pay out $15 to 20 billion each year in workers' compensation \ncosts related to these disorders. Ergonomic injuries account for one \ndollar in every three dollars spent for workers' compensation. If \nbusinesses reduce these injuries, they will reap the benefits of lower \ncosts, greater productivity, and decreased absenteeism.\n  That's certainly true for Tom Albin of Minnesota Mining and \nManufacturing, who said, ``Our experience has shown that incorporating \ngood ergonomics into our manufacturing and administrative processes can \nbe effective in reducing the number and severity of work-related \nmusculoskeletal disorders, which not only benefits our employees, but \nalso makes good business sense.''\n  Similarly, Peter Meyer of Sequins International Quality Braid has \nsaid, ``We have reduced our compensation claims for carpal tunnel \nsyndrome through an effective ergonomics program. Our productivity has \nincreased dramatically, and our absenteeism has decreased \ndrastically.''\n  This ergonomics rule is necessary, because only one-third of \nemployers currently have effective ergonomics programs.\n  Further delay is unacceptable, because it leaves workers unprotected \nand open to career-ending injuries. Since OSHA began working on this \nstandard in 1990, more than 6.1 million workers have suffered serious \ninjuries from workplace ergonomic hazards.\n  It is time to stop these injuries--and stop all the misinformation \ntoo. This year's attack on OSHA's ergonomics standard is just the \nlatest in a long series of attacks against this important worker \nprotection measure.\n  American employees deserve greater protection, not further delay. \nIt's time to stop breaking the promise made to workers, and start \nsupporting this long overdue ergonomics standard now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                Motion To Commit With Amendment No. 3598\n\n (Purpose: To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide \n coverage of outpatient prescription drugs under the medicare program)\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, this past April when the Senate was debating \nits annual budget resolution, I offered an amendment which stated that \nif Congress was going to consider massive tax cuts this year, it must \nfirst pass legislation that modernizes Medicare through the creation of \na prescription drug benefit. Fifty-one Senators voted in favor of this \namendment, in favor of putting our Nation's seniors before massive tax \ncuts, including six of our colleagues from the other side of the \naisle--Senators Chafee, Specter, Abraham, DeWine, Burns, and the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair.\n  I rise today to follow up on the vote that we took in April and to \nurge a majority of our colleagues to, once again, come together across \nparty lines for our Nation's seniors. Putting seniors before tax cuts \nwas the first step.\n  Now the Senate needs to take up and pass a comprehensive affordable \nprescription drug benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries. \nUnfortunately, it is now mid-June and neither the Senate Finance \nCommittee nor the Senate itself has considered a Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit. With so few legislative days left in the year and so much \nwork to be done, it is crucial that we take this issue up now.\n  The amendment I am offering today will commit this bill back to the \nAppropriations Committee with instructions that they report out a new \nbill that provides a universal, comprehensive, dependable prescription \ndrug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The Medicare Outpatient Drug Act, a bill that I introduced this week \nwith Senators Graham, Bryan, Conrad, Chafee, Baucus, Rockefeller, and \nLincoln, is a moderate bipartisan, commonsense piece of legislation. It \ncombines the best elements of prescription drug proposals offered by \nMembers on both sides of the aisle.\n\n  More important, the Medicare Outpatient Drug Act will help every \nsenior better afford the prescription drugs which they so badly need, \nand the need is real.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING ADDITIONAL \n                   ASSISTANCE FOR MOZAMBIQUE AND SOUTHERN AFRICA\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1) In February and March of 2000, cyclones Gloria, Eline, \n     and Hudah caused extensive flooding in southern Africa, \n     severely affecting the Republic of Mozambique.\n       (2) The floods claimed at least 640 lives and left nearly \n     500,000 people displaced or trapped in flood-isolated areas.\n       (3) The floods contaminated water supplies, destroyed \n     hundreds of miles of roads, and washed away homes, schools, \n     and health clinics.\n       (4) This heavy flooding and the displacement it caused \n     created conditions in which infectious disease has \n     flourished.\n       (5) The southern African floods of 2000 washed previously \n     identified and marked landmines to new, unmarked locations.\n       (6) Prior to the flooding, Mozambique has been making \n     progress toward climbing out of poverty, enjoying economic \n     growth rates of 10% per year.\n       (7) The World Bank estimates that the costs of \n     reconstruction in Mozambique alone will be $430 million, with \n     an additional $215 million in economic costs.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of Congress \n     that an additional $168,000,000 should be made available for \n     disaster assistance in Mozambique and Southern Africa.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this bill for \nworking with me to reach agreement on this modification. I thank them \nfor cosponsoring it. I thank Senator Frist for joining me in offering \nit.\n  This amendment expresses the sense of Congress that the \nadministration's request for flood recovery in southern Africa, and \nparticularly in the Republic of Mozambique, should be fully funded.\n  Right now the foreign operations bill falls far short of fulfilling \nthe administration's request for flood relief in southern Africa. The \nfloods that took so many lives there, and destroyed so many farms, \nbusinesses, schools, and hospitals there, have faded from our \ntelevision screens. But Mr. President, the terrible destruction of \nthese floods has not receded in Mozambique. On the contrary, the longer \nMozambique waits for additional flood relief, the more severe the long-\nterm damage of this disaster will become. In February and March \nMozambique was in the news because it was devastated by flooding. But \nbefore that Mozambique made headlines with the highest economic growth \nrate in the world. The people of Mozambique have proven that they are \nfighters, who worked their way back from a terrible civil war to \nachieve impressive economic and social progress. But today the people \nof Mozambique are in a fight that they can't win without the help of \ntheir African neighbors, and the help of the United States.\n  It was not long ago that Americans saw dramatic images of daring \nrescues and remarkable perseverance in Mozambique. Massive rainstorms \nand furious cyclones inundated the low lands of Mozambique and flooded \nthe rivers that meander through southeastern Africa. The region was \nravage by not one, not two, but three cyclones. As we stand here, \nthousands of miles away on the floor of the Senate, it's hard to \ncomprehend the human cost of this disaster. But these floods claimed \nthe lives of 640 people, and displaced or trapped 491,000 others. \nSchools, business, and clinics were destroyed, and, in a devastating \nblow to rescue efforts and to prospects for economic recovery, hundreds \nof miles of the transportation system were destroyed.\n  The floods washed away roads, contaminated water supplies, and forced \nwhole families onto rooftops--even into trees--for days on end. The \npeople of Mozambique have seen their crops flooded, their homes \ndestroyed, and their loved ones drowned by the worst flooding southern \nAfrica has seen in the last 100 years. Yet, alongside these tragedies, \nwe saw vivid images of hope as fellow African nations rose up to help \ntheir neighbors--most notably South Africa with its courageous \nhelicopter pilots, but also Malawi and even tiny Lesotho, which helped \nto get supplies to those in need as quickly as possible. I was proud of \nthe U.S. involvement in these efforts, and I know that many of my \nconstituents shared that pride. It is my intent, with this amendment, \nto ensure that the people of southern Africa are not forgotten in this \nbill. The administration asked for $193 million to assist the flood-\nravaged countries of southern Africa. This bill provides for only $25 \nmillion. That, Mr. President, is simply not good enough.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember that these floods are particularly \ntragic because the country most seriously affected by them, Mozambique, \nhas made significant strides toward recovery from its long and brutal \ncivil war. Though the country is still affected by extreme poverty, in \nrecent years Mozambique has enjoyed exceptional rates of economic \ngrowth, and while more needs to be done, the country has improved its \nrecord with regard to basic human rights. It has been making great \nstrides ever since the end of a civil war that ended in the early \n1990's. Up until the flood, Mozambique was registering economic growth \nat a rate of 10 percent a year. That's an incredible achievement for \nany nation, Mr. President, and it deserves special recognition as a \nnation of sub-Saharan Africa, where some of its neighbors have \nstruggled to achieve growth rates a fraction of that size.\n  The people of Mozambique have been working hard for a better future--\ntoo hard to see that future swept away by the floodwaters that have \nalready destroyed so much. They need our help. Recovery assistance is \ncritically needed to help the people of Mozambique to hold on to the \nopportunities that lay before them before the waters rose. The World \nBank estimates that the cost of reconstruction in Mozambique alone will \nbe $430 million. The floodwaters washed landmines into new, unmarked \nlocations, and infectious diseases spread quickly in the wake of the \ndisaster. In Mozambique, forecasts suggest that the floods have led to \ngrain production shortfalls of more than 15 percent. And the outlook \nfor the future could be even worse if we don't act. Without repaired \nroads, farmers and small businesses will be unable to function. Without \nworking railroad lines, lost revenues will total an estimated $35 \nmillion per year. And without working hospitals and sanitation \nfacilities, Mozambique will suffer further outbreaks of disease. If we \ndon't reach out to help Mozambique now, it won't be long until were \nread about this nation again in headlines, as the people of Mozambique \nsuffer the consequences of these floods alone without help, Mozambique \nmay never be able to regain its footing on the road to stability and \nprosperity.\n  I am pleased that both Senators Leahy and McConnell intend to work to \naddress this issue in conference. I thank them for their cosponsorship, \ntheir attention to this, and their assistance with this amendment.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that the managers intend to \naccept this amendment. With that understanding, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia is to be recognized to call up two amendments, Nos. 3541 and \n3542, on which there shall be a total of 40 minutes of debate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield, what was the disposition of the \namendment of the Senator from Wisconsin? Was that accepted?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I think people had assumed there would have to be a \nvote. It is my understanding that the managers have no objection, and I \nsuggest it be accepted at this point.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The amendment (No. 3520), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n    Amendments Nos. 3551, As Modified; 3553, As Modified; 3555, As \n                    Modified; and 3569, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be part of the effort here \ntoday--led by Senator Chafee--to put the Senate on record in support of \nUnited States' participation in an international program to lift the \nburden of debt from the poorest countries of the world. That is the \nHIPC program, named for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries for which \nit is intended.\n  With this amendment the Senate is now on record in support of a \nsimple, but powerful, idea.\n  Right now, in the poorest countries of the world, desperately needed \nresources--including both money and some of the best-educated public \nofficials--are used to pay money to the richest industrial economies. \nThat's right--they are sending money to us.\n  That is happening because, over the years, we and our allies have \nloaned substantial amounts to those countries, often to pursue our own \ngoals of fighting communism during the Cold War or for other foreign \npolicy purposes. That often meant that we turned a blind eye to the \nproblems in those countries, including how their governments might \nspend the money, or if they had any hope of repayment.\n  The perverse result is that, while we seek to promote economic growth \nand opportunity in the least developed countries of the world, at the \nsame time we continue to collect payments on those debts. At a time \nwhen foreign assistance of all kinds is shrinking, we continue to \nexpect these countries to send money to us, most commonly to pay the \ninterest to simply service their debts.\n  And this is no small problem for these poor countries. Many of them \nwill spend more on just servicing the interest on their debts than they \ndo on childhood immunizations, or education.\n  That is not just unconscionable, Mr. President, it is bad policy. It \ndefeats many of our best efforts to help those countries turn the \ncorner to more sustainable economic growth and development.\n  There is so little chance that these countries will ever be able to \npay off the principal on these loans that we carry them on our own \nbooks at just a few cents on the dollar. That means that it will cost \nus very little to give a great deal of benefit to these countries.\n  Those benefits come not just from the lifting of the debt itself. The \nHIPC program requires that each country that is to receive debt relief \nmust draw up and stick to a plan for social and economic development, \nreducing poverty and creating sustainable growth.\n  Banks here in the United States and all around the world know that \nwhen there is no chance that a loan will be repaid, you take it off the \nbooks.\n  But the HIPC program is more than just a bookkeeping matter--it is a \nway of leveraging money that we are unlikely to ever see into essential \nresources for the neediest countries.\n  Earlier this year, I made full authorization of the HIPC program my \ntop priority when the Foreign Relations Committee passed its first \nforeign assistance authorization bill in fifteen years. With the \ncooperation of Senator Helms, we reached agreement on all of the pieces \nneeded for full U.S. participation in the HIPC program, participation \nwhich we have already pledged, along with our partners among the \nadvanced industrial nations.\n  That legislation authorized full funding, at the levels requested by \nthe Administration earlier this year, as well as the authorization \nneeded from us to permit the International Monetary Fund to dedicate to \nthe debt relief effort the proceeds from a revaluation of their gold \nholdings.\n  As it stands, the Foreign Operations Bill before us today cuts the \nAdministration's request of $262 million for debt relief by $187 \nmillion--that's a cut of more than 70 percent. That affects both the \nHIPC program and another priority of mine, the Tropical Forest \nProtection Act, a debt-for-nature program that was established with \nstrong bi-partisan support.\n  While this amendment will not change that situation, it does put the \nSenate on record in favor of changing it, when this process is once \nagain engaged later on in this session.\n  Whatever disagreements we have about the IMF, the World Bank, or \nother aspects of foreign assistance, we should all be able to support \nthis program. The HIPC program comes with its own strong program that \nthe poor countries must comply with to be eligible for debt relief.\n  It stands on its own merits and should not be tangled up in other \ndebates. Given the heavy burdens on these poor countries, relief \ndelayed is relief denied. Every day that debt relief is put off, those \nobligations continue to sap their limited resources.\n\n[[Page S5612]]\n\n  This is a program that has the support of a strong, ecumenical, \ninter-faith effort by the world's major religions. The Pope, the \nReverend Billy Graham, and other religious leaders have dedicated their \ntime and effort to making debt relief a reality.\n  Considering the small and shrinking support we give to the poorest \nnations, and the importance to us of their economic health and \nstability, this is an issue where conscience and economic common sense \nagree.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Chafee, Senator Sarbanes, Senator \nHagel, and all of our cosponsors, for keeping this issue before us. I \nam confident that at the end of the day, we will do what is right, and \nfully fund this worthy program.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \namendment sponsored by Senator Chafee from Rhode Island. This amendment \nexpresses the sense that the United States should support bilateral and \nmultilateral debt relief for the world's poorest countries with \nunsustainable debts, and provide the funding for bilateral and \nmultilateral debt relief the Clinton administration has requested.\n  Last year, United States and other industrialized countries agreed to \nprovide $27 billion in debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries \nthat adopt sound economic policies and use the savings for health, \neducation, and poverty reduction efforts, and the Clinton \nadministration pledged to pay four percent of the total. The $435 \nmillion the administration requested for Fiscal Year 2001 is a down-\npayment on our $920 million pledge.\n  The countries that will benefit are classified by the World Bank and \nInternational Monetary Fund as Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs), \nwhich means they have unsustainable debts and are extremely poor.\n  In these countries:\n  One in ten children dies before his or her first birthday;\n  One in three children is malnourished;\n  More than half of all citizens live on less than $1 per day; and\n  HIV infection rates are as high as 20 percent.\n  More than two out of three of these countries spend more on debt \nservice than health care.\n  Every dollar in debt payments these countries make to the United \nStates and other creditors is one fewer dollar to spend on education, \nhealth care, and other basic needs.\n  Many of these countries, including Zambia, Uganda, Togo, Cote \nd'Ivoire, Mozambique, and Tanzania, to name but a few, are in the midst \nof a HIV/AIDS pandemic. Every dollar in debt payments these countries \nmake is one fewer dollar to spend on HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment \nprograms.\n  This debt relief proposal will not solve every problem in these \ncountries, but it will help. Bolivia, our democratic ally, began \nreceiving debt relief in 1997. In 1999, Bolivia saved $77 million in \ndebt service as a result of debt relief provided by multilateral \ninstitutions. Most of the savings went to increased spending on health \ncare and education.\n  Uganda has also received multilateral debt relief. Uganda saved $45 \nmillion in debt service payments in 1999, and it increased spending on \npoverty reduction programs, primary education, and primary health care \nby $55 million. Since 1997, the primary school enrollment rate has \nincreased by 50 percent.\n  Uganda is not the only country in desperate need of debt relief in \nAfrica. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund list 33 \ncountries in Africa as HIPCs, meaning they are extremely poor and have \nunsustainable debts.\n  As Dr. Jeffrey Sachs, the director of the Center for International \nDevelopment at Harvard University, wrote in The Washington Post, on May \n23, 2000, in regard to malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis,\n\n       Debt cancellation for Africa has come down to a matter of \n     life and death. African leaders know very well that for their \n     own countries to muster the internal resources to fight these \n     dread diseases, they will have to be permitted by the \n     creditor nations to shift the funds now spent on debt \n     servicing into public health.\n\n  We must provide debt relief to accountable governments, not to \ndictatorial regimes that waste funds on the military and violate human \nrights.\n  This amendment urges the Senate to fund multilateral debt relief \nefforts carried out by the World Bank and the International Monetary \nFund for countries that use the funds transparently, allow \nparticipation by civil society, do not grossly violate human rights, \nand do not spend excessively on the military.\n  Debt relief will allow Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, which use up \nto 60 percent of their budgets for debt service on loans made by the \nUnited States and other industrialized countries to dictators during \nthe Cold War, to use these precious resources to meet basic needs.\n  The debt burden condemns these countries to poverty. Relieving the \nburden from these debts will give these countries a chance to develop. \nRelieving debts that can never be repaid is the humane thing to do.\n  The Clinton administration has requested $435 million for this \ninitiative to help the world's poorest people. The United States has \ncommitted to this multinational debt relief plan, and we should live up \nto our commitment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I urge my colleagues \nto support funding for debt relief for the world's poorest people. I \nurge my colleagues to do the right thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments, as \nmodified, are agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3551, 3553, 3555, and 3569), as modified, were \nagreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, that leaves amendments by Senator Boxer \nand Senator Byrd as the only amendments left to dispose of.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3531, As Modified\n\n  (Purpose: To provide support for the Defense Classified Activities)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for Mr. Byrd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3531, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in Title VI of the bill insert the \n     following:\n       Sec.  .In addition to amounts provided elsewhere in this \n     Act, $8,500,000 is hereby appropriated to the Department of \n     Defense under the heading, ``Military Construction, Defense \n     Wide'' for classified activities related to, and for the \n     conduct of a utility and feasibility study referenced under \n     the heading of ``Management of MASINT'' in Senate Report 105-\n     279 to accompany S. 2507, to remain available until expended: \n     Provided, That the entire amount is designated by the \n     Congress as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985, as amended: Provided further, That the \n     entire amount provided shall be available only to the extent \n     an official budget request for $8,500,000 that includes \n     designation of the entire amount of the request as an \n     emergency requirement as defined in the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended, is \n     transmitted by the President to the Congress.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the amendment I am proposing would provide \n$8.5 million to the Department of Defense under the heading ``Military \nConstruction, Defense-wide'' for classified activities, to remain \navailable until expended. The entire amount would be designated as an \nemergency requirement and would be available only to the extent that an \nofficial budget request for $8.5 million is transmitted by the \nPresident to the Congress. These funds would be used for the conduct of \na utility and feasibility study referenced under the heading of \n``Management of MASINT'' in Senate Report 106-279. I am constrained \nfrom speaking further about this matter due to the nature of the \nclassification of the amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I urge adoption of the amendment, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The amendment (No. 3531), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S5613]]\n\n                    Amendment No. 3541, As Modified\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send a modification to my amendment No. \n3541 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3541), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . INTERNATIONAL HEALTH EMERGENCIES.\n\n       In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated in this Act, \n     $40 million shall be available for necessary expenses to \n     carry out the provisions of Chapters 1 and 10 of part I of \n     the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, for global health and \n     related activities: Provided, That of the funds appropriated \n     under this section, not less than $30 million shall be made \n     available for programs to combat HIV/AIDS: Provided further, \n     That of the funds appropriated under this section, not less \n     than $10 million shall be made available for the prevention, \n     treatment, and control of tuberculosis: Provided further, \n     That amounts made available under this section are hereby \n     designated by the Congress to be emergency requirements \n     pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985: Provided further, That \n     such amounts shall be made available only after submission to \n     the Congress of a formal budget request by the President that \n     includes designation of the entire amount of the request as \n     an emergency requirement as defined in such Act.\n       On page 155, line 25, strike ``$25,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$35,000,000''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this legislation \non both sides for agreeing to this. It isn't everything I had asked for \nregarding tuberculosis and the HIV/AIDS fight, but it is helpful. It \nwill also take into consideration Senator Feingold's request on the \nflooding in Mozambique. It will give an additional $30 million for the \nworldwide fight against HIV/AIDS, an additional $10 million for the \nworldwide fight against tuberculosis, and $10 million for the flooding \nin Mozambique. I am proud that Senators Feingold, Leahy, Durbin, Dodd, \nand Kerry are sponsors of this amendment.\n  I want to take a moment of the Senate's time, because we won't need \nto have a rollcall on this, to simply say that if we are looking at a \ntrue emergency, we have one here. The U.N. Security Council met on the \nissue of HIV, and it was the first time the Security Council ever met \non an international health issue.\n  Last month, our own National Security Council declared that the \nglobal spread of AIDS is a direct threat to U.S. national security \nbecause of the destabilizing impact of this deadly disease.\n  One of the reasons they so found was that the CIA did something they \ncall the National Intelligence Estimate. They titled it ``The Global \nInfectious Disease Threat and Its Implications for the United States.'' \nI am simply going to read a tiny bit from this report.\n\n       New and reemerging infectious diseases will pose a rising \n     global health threat and compromise U.S. and global security \n     over the next 20 years. These diseases will endanger United \n     States citizens at home and abroad, threaten U.S. Armed \n     Forces deployed overseas, and exacerbate social and political \n     instability and keep countries and regions in which the \n     United States has significant interest.\n\n  I know that my colleagues are very aware of the horrific problem of \nAIDS in Africa, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. Mr. President, 84 \npercent of all the people in the world who have died of AIDS have been \nfrom that region. It is now predominantly a women's disease. Many \nchildren are left as orphans.\n  Lastly, as far as tuberculosis is concerned, this is a disease we \nthought we had eliminated in the 1950s. However, the disease is making \na comeback. The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 2 \nmillion people die of tuberculosis-related conditions annually. One-\nthird of the entire world's population is infected with tuberculosis--\nan extraordinary number when you think about it.\n  I am pleased we have this amendment and it is in agreement. I trust \nand hope and pray for the sake of people all across this world and in \nour own Nation that these numbers will hold up in the conference. \nBelieve me, it means so much. We know how to treat tuberculosis. We \nknow how to stop HIV transmission from mother to child. It would be a \nreal sin, it seems to me, if we didn't push as hard as we could to \nfight these diseases.\n\n  I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I took the floor to thank the Senator \nfrom California and to ask consent I be included as an original \ncosponsor. It is a very important amendment and directly connected to \npeople's lives. I thank the Senator for her fine work.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy for a voice vote, if the manager is ready to \ndo that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3541, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3541), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3542, As Modified\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time remains to explain this next amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 35 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I assure my friends I do not intend to take anything near \nthat time.\n  Mr. President, I send my modified amendment to the desk on behalf of \nMr. Leahy and Mr. Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification of the \namendment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, could we see what is \nbeing modified?\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is, at the suggestion of my friend, for a sense of \nthe Senate. It shows support of rules for engagement in Colombia for \nthe Department of Defense.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there objection to the Senator being able to modify her amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3542), as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC.   . POLICY REGARDING DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE RESOURCES AND \n                   ACTIVITIES IN COLOMBIA.\n\n       (a) Affirmation of Policy.--The United States Senate \n     affirms and supports the Department of Defense policy that \n     United States Armed Forces personnel in Colombia should make \n     every effort to minimize the possibility of confrontation, \n     whether armed or otherwise, with civilians in Colombia, and \n     that funds appropriated by this Act and other resources of \n     the Department of Defense will not be used--\n       (1) to support the training of any Colombian security force \n     unit that engages in counter-insurgency operations;\n       (2) to participate in any law enforcement activity in \n     Colombia, including search, seizure and arrest;\n       (3) to permit any Department of Defense employee to \n     accompany any United States drug enforcement agency \n     personnel, or any law enforcement or military personnel of \n     Colombia with counter-narcotics authority, on any counter-\n     narcotics field operation; and\n       (4) to permit any Department of Defense employee to \n     participate in any activity in which counter-narcotics \n     related hostilities are imminent.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chair clarifies at this time the amount of \ntime now evenly divided under previous agreement. The intention was to \ndivide 20 minutes equally. The Senator from California has 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, after I make just an opening remark, I \nwill yield 5 minutes to my distinguished colleague from Vermont.\n  I am offering an amendment which is completely consistent with the \nDepartment of Defense guidelines on the activities of their own \npersonnel in Colombia. It actually says that we support these \nguidelines, we think it is good to put limits on our involvement, and \nwe should express ourselves on that point.\n  The first part of the amendment supports the prohibition of the DOD \nusing its personnel, equipment, or other resources to get involved in \nthe counterinsurgency; in other words, to get involved in what some \ncall the civil war between the left and the right in that country.\n  Again, written by the Secretary of Defense in March 2000:\n\n\n[[Page S5614]]\n\n\n       I am directing that no DOD personnel, funds, equipment, or \n     resources may be used to support any training program that \n     engages solely in counterinsurgency operations.\n\n  That supports that DOD guideline.\n  The same thing occurs on the second part of my amendment; that we \nsupport the fact they shouldn't be involved, our own personnel, in law \nenforcement activities in Colombia. Again, that mirrors the position of \nour Secretary of Defense.\n  The third part of the amendment says we agree with the Secretaries \nthat our personnel shouldn't conduct any counterdrug field operation in \nwhich counterdrug-related hostilities are imminent. That is to protect \nour people from harm.\n  Finally, we say we agree with the Secretary of Defense that U.S. \nmilitary personnel should make every effort to minimize the possibility \nof confrontations with civilians.\n  Clearly, what we should do here is support our own Secretary of \nDefense and our own administration. I don't think it should be \ncontroversial.\n  I am hopeful it can be accepted because I believe we ought to go on \nrecord in support of these limits. I think it is sensible. I think the \nDOD is correct on this.\n  Yesterday, we voted millions and millions of dollars to send \nadvisers. I think it would be wonderful if we stood with our own DOD \nand said there ought to be limits on the participation of our own \npersonnel.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my friend from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there is \nanother modification on the Boxer amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct. Senator McConnell has offered a \nmodification.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from California if it is \nher understanding that the most recent modification does not undercut \nor diminish in any way the so-called Leahy law that is in effect in \nColombia and in U.S. operations in Colombia?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is certainly my understanding.\n  I ask Senator McConnell if he would comment on that further.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, that is also the understanding of the \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope we can just adopt this as it is and \ndo so by voice vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Has the further modification been sent to the desk?\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 3542 As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I send the further modification we have \njust been discussing to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, the amendment is further modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3542), as further modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC.  . POLICY REGARDING DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE RESOURCES AND \n                   ACTIVITIES IN COLOMBIA.\n\n       (a) Affirmation of Policy.--The United States Senate afirms \n     and supports the Department of Defense policy that United \n     States Armed Forces personnel in Colombia should make every \n     effort to minimize the possibility of confrontation, whether \n     armed or otherwise, with civilians in Colombia, and that \n     funds appropriated by this Act and other resources of the \n     Department of Denfense should not be used--\n       (1) to support the training of any Colombian security force \n     unit that directly engages in counter-insurgency operations;\n       (2) to directly participate in any law enforcement activity \n     in Colombia, including search, seizure and arrest;\n       (3) to permit any Department of Defense employee to \n     accompany any United States drug enforcement agency \n     personnel, or any law enforcement or military personnel of \n     Colombia with counter-narcotics authority, on any counter-\n     narcotics field operation; and\n       (4) to permit any Department of Defense employee to \n     directly participate in any activity in which counter-\n     narcotics related hostilities are imminent.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, what we were hoping to achieve was to \nvoice vote this. A number of Senators are missing important \nconferences.\n  The Senator from Florida is interested in seeing the modification.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to see the final language of \nthis amendment before we vote on it. Would it be appropriate to suggest \nthe absence of a quorum until we have that opportunity?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I raise a point of order against the \npending amendment that it violates rule XVI as legislation on an \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order must await the finalization \nof all time ordered. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I apologize.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do not yield my time back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has not yielded \ntime back.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is there time left on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 9\\1/2\\ minutes remaining to the \nopponents and 5 minutes remaining to the sponsor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield me 3 minutes?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the Senator from Alaska whatever time he \nmay desire of our time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment covers resources in the \nDepartment of Defense and it deals with matters with which we are \ndealing in the supplemental right now. I do not want to mislead the \nSenate. We are trying to settle this matter in a conference on the \nmilitary construction bill with the supplemental portions associated \nwith it. I am perfectly happy to see the Senate express its point of \nview on the Colombia money, but in terms of the item as a place in the \nDepartment of Defense portion of the Colombia money, it really has been \nobjected to by the Department of Defense, and as chairman of the \nDefense Subcommittee, I strenuously object to it.\n\n  We should be in the position of determining how defense money is \nspent, how Armed Forces personnel are governed when they are abroad, \nand we should not take the occasion now to put limitations on the use \nof defense assets in connection with the war on drugs.\n  I just returned from Key West, Tampa, and Alameda in California. I \nknow some of the defense assets we are using to supplement the \nactivities in the war on drugs. I am very reluctant to see the Senate \nact on a bill at this time like this to set down rules that apply to \nthe use of defense personnel, defense assets, and defense money in \nconnection with the war on drugs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am deeply distressed that the Senator \nfrom Alaska raised a point of order. I want to explain why.\n  Yesterday we voted for almost $1 billion to get involved in a very \nserious problem in Colombia. Our people will be exposed to a lot of \ndanger there. All we are simply trying to do with this sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment is to protect them. Further, all we are trying to do \nis say to Secretary Cohen: You are right on your guidelines that you \nhave issued. And those guidelines simply say our people should not be \ninvolved in counterinsurgency, that our people should not be in the \nline of hostile fire. It is very straightforward, and it is very \nsimple.\n  Frankly, the way the Senate has responded to this shows me I did the \nright thing when I never voted for this in the first place. If we \ncannot stand up in the Senate and support the Secretary of Defense in \nhis very straightforward directive, then I am very concerned about what \nwe are getting ourselves into. I hope I am wrong.\n  I am distressed the Senator from Alaska did this. When Senator \nSessions from Alabama, from his side of the aisle, offered legislation \non an appropriations bill yesterday, no one said the amendment of the \nSenator from Alabama, which dealt with this very same subject, was \nlegislation on an appropriations bill. I do not think it is fair to \nhave a double standard. If we are going to use that rule, we ought to \nuse it.\n  I did not like Senator Sessions' amendment yesterday. Frankly, I \nviewed it as a way to get us far more\n\n[[Page S5615]]\n\ninvolved in the counterinsurgency, but I did not make a point of order. \nThe fact the Senator did this is distressing.\n\n  I am not going to ask for a vote on a procedural motion because that \nwould not even be close to the kind of vote I think I could get on this \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment. That is what I fear is happening. People \ndo not seem to want to vote on the sense-of-the-Senate amendment. It is \nnot fair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator does make a good point about the point of \norder. We should either be consistent on these points of order or not \nhave them, one or the other.\n  The Senator is correct that when a similar motion was made from the \nRepublican side of the aisle yesterday, Senators on this side of the \naisle who wanted to make a point of order refrained because there have \nbeen a number of amendments accepted on this bill by both Republicans \nand Democrats that were subject to the point of order of which the \nSenator from California speaks. We all refrained from making them.\n  The Senator from California raises a legitimate point that now, at \nthe end of the bill, on her amendment, which is no more subject to a \npoint of order than those other amendments where a point of order was \nwaived, suddenly she faces the only point of order in this whole bill. \nI can understand her concern, and I share her concern.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I believe it is not fair play, and if \nthere is one thing I expect in the Senate--and I think we all stand for \nit--it is fair play. We voted huge amounts of money into this region of \nthe world. We have horrible problems there. We have a few disagreements \nhere, but I had hoped we could agree that the Secretary of Defense is \ncorrect when he puts limits on the use of DOD personnel.\n  I am very saddened by this. I do not want to keep repeating it, but \nit is sad. The people in this country are going to be upset about it. \nThe people in this country, when we get involved in a foreign place, \nwant to know that we in the Senate put restrictions on the use of our \npersonnel.\n  We have had a lot of experience in this. We have had a lot of tears \nover this. Yet yesterday we had an amendment from Senator Sessions that \nwas clearly legislation on an appropriations bill, which I believe gets \nus deeper involved because it says we should support the military and \nthe political policies of the Government of Colombia, and no one raised \na point of order. But a simple amendment supporting the Secretary of \nDefense, and where are we? We get a point of order.\n  I am not going to play that game. I am not going to get caught in a \nprocedural vote. I will just let it go, but I want to make it clear \nthat we have a lot of options later when this bill comes back. If there \nare going to be things in this bill that violate our parliamentary \nprocedures, some of us are going to get tough on it. It is not right.\n  This is a sad day, frankly, for this Senate. It is also a sad day for \nour men and women in uniform that we cannot vote on a simple sense of \nthe Senate supporting our own Secretary of Defense on his views as to \nhow we can, in fact, make sure our people over there are as safe as \nthey can be.\n  I thank the Chair. I have no need to retain any further time. We will \nawait the decision of the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from California has \nexpired. Who yields time? Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I make the point of order that the pending amendment No. 3542, as \nfurther modified, violates rule XVI as legislation on an appropriations \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair sustains the point of order. The \namendment falls.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Regular order, Mr. President.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3498, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Helms \namendment No. 3498 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, by now it should come as no secret that I \nbelieve that the bill as it stands right now is inadequately funded. \nThe foreign operations appropriation bill is one of the most important \npieces of legislation we pass each year. Yet for the past several years \nCongress has not been devoting the necessary funds to this portion of \nthe budget.\n  Due in large part to the crucial need for the Colombia supplemental I \nam going to vote yes on final passage. The Pastrana government urgently \nand desperately needs these funds to continue its fight against drug \nlords who are not only undermining the stability and viability of \nColombia as a nation, but who are literally killing the people of two \nnations: Colombians through violence, and Americans through drugs. The \ngovernment of Colombia deserves our help as they put their lives on the \nline to stop the production of illegal drugs. I think the outcome of \nthe votes rejecting the Wellstone and Gorton amendments, which would \nhave significantly decreased the amounts available in the supplemental, \nshowed that the majority of my colleagues agree about the severity of \nthe problem in that country and the necessity of U.S. aid.\n  During the course of this debate, we have been faced with having to \nmake several other untenable decisions. I and my colleagues have had to \ncome to the floor and in essence attempt to get blood from a rock. I \nbelieve that we need more money for non-proliferation, anti-terrorism, \nand de-mining. My colleague Senator Feingold rightly believes that the \namount designated for the Mozambique supplemental appropriation needs \nto be increased.\n  Senator Boxer has attempted to channel more funds towards combating \nHIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.\n  In every instance, each of us has been stymied by the fact that there \nis not enough money in this bill. It simply isn't there. So we are left \nwith the option of either not attempting to raise the level of \nappropriations for programs that we think are important, or of using \ndifferent political maneuvers, none of which is particularly effective, \nto get the money that we feel these programs need. We should not have \nto face a choice between helping victims of flooding in Mozambique, and \npreventing the spread of AIDS. The United States should be able to help \nwith these activities as well as drug eradication and non-\nproliferation.\n  I spoke briefly this morning about the shortfall in the NADR \naccounts, and at length yesterday about Plan Colombia. These are not \nthe only accounts about which I am concerned. Development assistance is \nshortchanged, funds for voluntary peacekeeping activities fall below \nrequested amounts, and as the Senator from Wisconsin points out, the \nPresident's request for resources to aid victims of the flooding in \nMozambique is virtually ignored. I will continue to go on record as \nbeing adamantly and staunchly opposed to any attempts to undertake \ndiplomacy on the cheap. That is what the Senate is attempting to do \nhere. By neglecting to grant the administration's request for \ndevelopment assistance and economic support, we are robbing ourselves.\n  According to a report published in April by a nonpartisan research \norganization called the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, \nspending on development aid--defined as all international development \nand humanitarian assistance, as well as economic support fund monies--\nmeasured either as a share of the federal budget or as a share of the \nU.S. economy, will be lower than at any time in the fifty years before \n1998. The report further states that out of the countries belonging to \nthe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United \nStates ranked ``the lowest of all . . . OECD countries examined in the \nshare of national resources devoted to development of poor \ncountries.'' Some would argue that this is because the administration \nhas not asked for enough money. I would answer that constitutionally, \nCongress controls the purse strings, thus we have only ourselves to \nblame. I suggest that we make a commitment to take\n\n[[Page S5616]]\n\ncorrective action, because our foreign assistance programs are vital to \nour national interests.\n\n  Foreign assistance helps us further international peace and security. \nU.S. citizens and citizens of the world benefit from programs that U.S. \nassistance pays for. I spoke before about programs aimed at keeping \nRussian scientists from being employed by states intent on developing \nnuclear and biological weapons of mass destruction. I am sure that we \ncan all agree that keeping these scientists out of countries such as \nIraq makes for a safer world.\n  When the United States provides assistance to Colombia for crop \nsubstitution programs, it is the citizens of the United States who \nbenefit. Less drug production means less drugs on the streets of our \nneighborhoods. When the United States funds vaccines for infectious \ndiseases such as tuberculosis, we are helping to protect our own \ncitizens from being infected by these illnesses.\n  Every time United States economic support funds help bolster a new \ndemocracy, we widen America's sphere of influence in the hopes of \nincreasing security for the United States. And the preceding represent \nonly a few of the ways in which our foreign assistance aids in \npromoting our national security. I could go on at length about the \npositive effects of aid to the Middle East, Russia, and Eastern Europe. \nPrograms in these regions have prevented conflict, helped build \neconomic and financial infrastructure, and combated transnational crime \nand corruption.\n  Let me conclude by saying this: our foreign assistance is a \npreventative tool. The idea behind it is to aid in building a community \nof like-minded states, states free of internal conflict, states that \nget along with their neighbors. If we are able to do that, if we are \nsuccessful with our preventative tools in increasing security, then we \nwill never have to use our corrective tool--that of military action--to \nachieve security. Think about that. If prevention works, correction is \nnot necessary. Given the sentiments of some Members of this chamber \nabout the commitment of our soldiers overseas, doesn't it make sense to \nmake every effort to prevent our troops from having to deploy?\n  Some of my colleagues urge frugality in our foreign assistance \nspending. I agree with the notion that Congress should spend wisely. \nHowever I would caution against an approach that is penny-wise and \npound foolish. Mr. President, I cannot emphasize this point enough, and \nit brings back to what I said at the beginning of my remarks: We cannot \nobtain security on the cheap. By stinting on our foreign assistance \nprograms we are shortchanging our national security.\n  As the administration indicated in their statement regarding this \nbill, if the sum appropriated for our foreign operations is not \nincreased, the President will have no choice but to veto this \nlegislation. I sincerely hope that as the fiscal year comes to a close, \nthe allocation for the foreign operations appropriation is \nsignificantly increased, and conferees distribute any additional \namounts wisely.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Baucus-\nRoberts amendment to engage China on the important issue of rapid \nindustrialization and the environment. The amendment would permit \nappropriated funds for the US-Asia Environmental Partnership (USAEP)--\nan initiative of the U.S. Agency for International Development \n(USAID)--to be used for environmental projects in the People's Republic \nof China (PRC). In other words, the U.S. government would finally be \nable to, for example, help U.S. businesses connect with provincial and \nmunicipal governments in China to initiate badly needed environmental \nengineering projects. This work is necessary to attempt to prevent a \npossible long-term environmental catastrophe resulting from intense \nindustrialization and development in the PRC and Asia in general.\n  Why should one care whether Chinese or Asian people breath clean air \nor drink clean water? Besides the obvious humanitarian concern, a \nruined environment throughout Asia will--at some point--effect us here \nin the United States and our interests. This is common sense.\n  The Baucus-Roberts amendment also sends a strong pro-engagement \nmessage to the PRC since the U.S. excluded de jure or de facto the PRC \nfrom U.S. foreign aid programs with passage and signing of the FY 90-FY \n91 State Department Authorization, specifically section 902 of H.R. \n3792.\n  Our government purports to be concerned about global environmental \nissues, Mr. President, about avoiding contamination of the world's \nwater, air, and soil. Yet, we prohibit ourselves from consulting and \ncooperating on a government to government basis with the one nation \nwith the greatest potential to impact the world's environment over the \nnext 50 to 100 years. That makes no sense.\n  What is the United States-Asia Environmental Partnership? It is a \npublic-private initiative implemented by the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development (USAID). Its aim is to encourage \nenvironmentally sustainable development in Asia as that region \nindustrializes at a phenomenal rate. By ``environmentally sustainable \ndevelopment,'' we mean industrial and urban development that does not \nirreparably damage the air, water, and soil necessary for life. It's \nreally that simple. US-AEP currently works with governments and \nindustries in Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, \nPhilippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. In \ncreating US-AEP, the U.S. government recognized the long-term \nenvironmental hazards of Asia's rapid industrialization and the need \nfor the U.S. government to engage on the issue.\n  The program provides grants to U.S. companies for the purpose of \nfacilitating the transfer of environmentally sound and energy-efficient \ntechnologies to the Asia/Pacific region. Again, the objective is to \naddress the pollution and health challenges of rapid industrialization \nwhile stimulating demand for U.S. technologies. In cooperation with the \nU.S. Department of Commerce, US-AEP has placed Environmental Technology \nRepresentatives in 11 Asian countries to identify trade opportunities \nfor U.S. companies and coordinate meetings between potential Asian and \nU.S. business partners.\n  Mr. President, on the basic issue of the global environmental impact \nof Asian industrialization, specifically Chinese modernization, the \nSenate has the responsibility to authorize at least some cooperation \nbetween Beijing and Washington. I ask for my colleague's support for \nthis common sense amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to speak about one of the \nmost important parts of the proposed aid package for Colombia, the \nhuman rights conditions.\n  Narcotics traffickers, rebel forces, and paramilitary groups present \na clear threat to democracy and economic development in Colombia. The \nbill before us provides $934 million to help the Colombian Government \nmeet this threat. About 75 percent of this aid is for military \nequipment, training, and logistical support. The Colombian Government \nsays it needs this military assistance--especially the helicopters--to \nenable its armed forces to retake the southern part of the country from \nthe narcotraffickers and the rebel forces who protect and profit from \ntheir activities.\n  Like my colleagues, I am interested in ensuring that this aid does \nnot contribute to human rights abuses. While allegations of human \nrights violations by military personnel have decreased in the past \nseveral years, the State Department's 1999 Country Report on Human \nRights Practices concluded that the Colombian Government's human rights \nrecord ``remained poor'' and that ``armed forces and the police \ncommitted numerous, serious violations of human rights throughout the \nyear.'' The Colombian Armed Forces are consistently and credibly linked \nto illegal paramilitary groups, which are now responsible for the \nmajority of serious human rights abuses in Colombia, including an \nestimated 153 massacres in 1999 which claimed 889 lives. These \nparamilitary groups have stepped up their own illegal narcotics \noperations, which, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, \ninclude drug trafficking abroad.\n  When I met with President Pastrana last December, he emphasized his \ncommitment to improving the human rights performance of the Colombian \nArmed Forces, which have a long history of human rights violations. The\n\n[[Page S5617]]\n\nbill before us makes this commitment the basis for new military \nassistance to Colombia. The bill requires the Secretary of State to \ncertify that the Colombian Government has met or is meeting four \nconditions before new military aid can be provided.\n  The first condition requires the Secretary of State to certify that \nthe President of Colombia has directed in writing that Colombian Armed \nForces personnel who are credibly alleged to have committed gross \nviolations of human rights will be brought to justice in Colombia's \ncivilian courts, in accordance with the 1997 ruling of Colombia's \nConstitutional Court.\n  Currently, the military justice system does not aggressively or \nconsistently pursue cases against high-ranking military personnel \naccused of human rights abuses. The 1999 State Department Human Rights \nReport states that ``authorities rarely brought officers of the \nsecurity forces and the police charged with human rights offenses to \njustice, and impunity remains a problem.'' It concludes that the \n``workings of the military judiciary lack transparency and \naccountability, contributing to a generalized lack of confidence in the \nsystem's ability to bring human rights abusers to justice.''\n  To rectify this problem, in August 1997, Colombia's Constitutional \nCourt ruled that ``crimes against humanity'' could never be considered \nacts of military service and that military personnel alleged to have \ncommitted such crimes must be prosecuted in civilian courts. However, \nthe military has consistently challenged civilian court jurisdiction. \nThe military has retained jurisdiction by threatening government \ninvestigators and by arguing that alleged violations of human rights, \nsuch as collusion with paramilitary groups, are simply acts of \nomission. Acts of omission are considered acts of military service, as \nif they were simple dereliction of duty. Most importantly, the military \ncontinues to retain jurisdiction in human rights by relying on the \nsupport of a pro-military block within the Superior Judicial Council, \nthe body responsible for determining the jurisdiction of individual \ncases.\n  The U.S. Government has said that these practices undercut the intent \nof the Constitutional Court ruling. According to the 1999 State \nDepartment Human Rights Report, the Superior Judicial Council \n``regularly employed an extremely broad definition of acts of service, \nthus ensuring that uniformed defendants of any rank, particularly the \nmost senior, were tried in military tribunals.'' In the 8 years the \nSuperior Judicial Council has existed, it has never sent a case of a \ngeneral accused of a human rights violation to a civilian court.\n  As a result of these practices, the military has retained \njurisdiction even in cases of the most egregious atrocities. For \nexample, dozens of civilians were killed, and thousands were forced to \nflee for their lives, in the town of Mapiripan in July 1997. The \nSuperior Judicial Council ruled that the case involved an act of \nomission by General Jaime Uscategui. Therefore, as an act of military \nservice, it belonged before a military court. The General was \neventually forced to resign, but he has yet to be prosecuted for his \ncrimes.\n  The Colombian Armed Forces have claimed that they are abiding by the \nConstitutional Court ruling and accepting civilian court jurisdiction \nin human rights cases. However, a careful analysis of the military's \nown statistics demonstrates the opposite. In a recent publication on \nhuman rights, Colombia's Defense Ministry asserts that, pursuant to the \n1997 Constitutional Court ruling, the Colombian Armed Forces had turned \nover 576 cases of possible human rights violations to civilian courts \nfor investigation and possible prosecution. For 3 months my office has \ntried to obtain a breakdown of this number in order to determine the \nnature of the crimes committed, the number of these cases that were \nactually prosecuted, and the rank of the personnel involved. To date, \nthe Colombian Defense Ministry has only documented 103 of the 576 \ncases. Of these 103 cases, only 39 actually involved human rights \nviolations by members of the Armed Forces. The highest ranking \nofficials were two lieutenant colonels. The remaining 64 cases involved \nabuses by members of the Colombian National Police or common crimes. In \nother words, the Colombian Defense Ministry grossly misrepresented its \nrecord. In fact, the Colombian Armed Forces have transferred only 39 \ncases of human rights violations, committed by low level officials, to \ncivilian courts in the past 2 years--not the 576 cases that the \nColombian Defense Ministry claimed.\n\n  Colombian lawyers have analyzed this matter. The highly respected \nColombian Commission of Jurists concluded that the requirement in the \namendment that the President issue a written directive requiring the \nmilitary to accept civilian jurisdiction in human rights cases is \nconsistent with President Pastrana's role as Commander-in-Chief of the \nArmed Forces. In fact, the Commission recently filed a petition with \nPresident Pastrana requesting that, as Commander-in-Chief, he order the \nmilitary to cease disputing jurisdiction in cases involving credible \nallegations of human rights abuse. This requirement does not compromise \nthe integrity of Colombia's separation of powers or the independence of \nthe executive and judiciary. To the contrary, it would uphold the \njudiciary's power by obligating the military to abide by civilian rule \nand the law.\n  The second condition contained in this bill requires the Secretary of \nState to certify that the Commander General of the Armed Forces is \npromptly suspending from duty any Armed Forces personnel who are \ncredibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human rights or \nto have aided or abetted paramilitary groups.\n  Currently, there is no automatic process for suspending a member of \nthe Colombian Armed Forces alleged to have violated human rights. The \ncase of Colombian Senator Manuel Cepeda is illustrative. Senator Cepeda \nwas murdered in 1994. The investigation carried out by the Attorney \nGeneral's Office revealed that the murder had been carried out by the \nmilitary in collusion with paramilitary groups. Nevertheless, the \naccused officers remained on active duty for five years, from 1994 \nuntil 1999, when they were finally suspended as a result of vigorous \nprotests by the human rights community.\n  In contrast, General Serrano, who just recently resigned as head of \nthe National Police, had the authority to suspend police suspected of \ncorruption, human rights abuses, or other misconduct. To his credit, \nGeneral Serrano discharged over 11,000 officers since taking command in \n1994.\n  This condition supports the recent actions of the Colombian Congress. \nOn March 15, the Colombian Congress passed a law to restructure the \nArmed Forces, including granting the Armed Forces Commander the \nauthority to suspend Armed Forces personnel suspected of misconduct. \nPresident Pastrana was given 6 months, until September, to issue the \nnecessary implementing decrees. If he does not, the law becomes null \nand void.\n  The third condition contained in the bill requires the Secretary of \nState to certify that the Colombian Armed Forces and its Commander \nGeneral are fully complying with the provisions regarding prosecution \nand suspension of Armed Forces personnel credibly alleged to have \ncommitted gross violations of human rights. The Colombian Armed Forces \nmust also cooperate fully with civilian authorities in investigating, \nprosecuting, and punishing in the civilian courts Colombian Armed \nForces personnel who are credibly alleged to have committed such \ncrimes.\n   As I discussed earlier, the Colombian Armed Forces have consistently \nresisted the 1997 Constitutional Court's ruling that transfers \njurisdiction for human rights cases from military to civilian courts. \nThey have failed to ensure that Armed Forces personnel who are credibly \nalleged to have committed human rights abuses are investigated, \nprosecuted, and punished in the civilian courts. They have resisted \nsuspending military personnel who are alleged to be involved in human \nrights violations or to have collaborated with paramilitary groups. And \nthey have grossly misrepresented their record, claiming that 576 human \nrights cases involving Armed Forces personnel were transferred to \ncivilian courts when, in fact, only 39 cases of human rights violations \nwere transferred--and those cases involved low level officials.\n  The fourth condition contained in the bill requires the Secretary of \nState to certify that the Government of Colombia is vigorously \nprosecuting in the\n\n[[Page S5618]]\n\ncivilian courts the leaders and members of paramilitary groups and \nColombian Armed Forces personnel who are aiding or abetting these \ngroups.\n  According to the 1999 State Department Human Rights Report, \nparamilitary groups accounted for about 78 percent of human rights \nabuses in 1999. In a rare televised interview, notorious paramilitary \nleader Carlos Castano recently admitted that cocaine and heroin fund an \nentire unit of 3,200 paramilitary fighters. Overall, he said that 70 \npercent of his war chest is culled from drug trafficking.\n\n  Despite President Pastrana's commitment to eliminate ties between the \nColombian Armed Forces and paramilitary groups, the State Department, \nthe United Nations, and human rights groups have documented continuing \nlinks. The 1999 State Department Human Rights Report stated that the \nArmed Forces and National Police sometimes ``tacitly tolerated'' or \n``aided and abetted'' the activities of paramilitary groups. According \nto the report, ``in some instances, individual members of the security \nforces actively collaborated with members of paramilitary groups by \npassing them through roadblocks, sharing intelligence, and providing \nthem with ammunition. Paramilitary forces find a ready support base \nwithin the military and police.'' The report also concluded that \n``security forces regularly failed to confront paramilitary groups.'' \nThe fact that Carlos Castano appeared on Colombian television in March, \nbut remains invisible to Colombian law enforcement agencies, \ndemonstrates the impunity with which he is able to operate in Colombia.\n  Human Rights Watch has documented links between military and \nparamilitary groups. These links are not only in isolated, rural areas \nbut in Colombia's principal cities. According to evidence collected by \nHuman Rights Watch, half of Colombia's 18 brigade-level units are \nlinked to paramilitary activity.\n  The Colombian military has resisted investigating these links. \nInstead of investigating a credible allegation of military \ncollaboration with paramilitary groups in a civilian massacre that \noccurred in the town of San Jose de Apartado on February 19, 2000, the \nCommander of the 17th Brigade filed suit against the non-governmental \norganization that made these allegations, charging that it had \n``impugned'' the honor of the military. If the Colombian Government is \nserious about severing the links between military and paramilitary \ngroups, it must demonstrate, at all levels of government and the \nmilitary, that these allegations will be investigated promptly and \npunished seriously. These links must be severed if the Colombian \nGovernment, with United States assistance, is to mount a successful \ncounternarcotics campaign and stop the violence committed by illegal \nparamilitary groups. If these links are not severed, our Government \nwill be complicit in the abuses.\n  I recently met with Colombian Senator Piedad Cordoba, the chairman of \nthe Colombian Senate's Human Rights Committee. She personally witnessed \nthis military-paramilitary cooperation during her May 1999 kidnapping \nby paramilitary leader Carlos Castano. Senator Cordoba told me that the \nkidnappers' car passed through eight military roadblocks without being \nstopped or searched. She said that the helicopter that took her to the \njungle camp where she was held landed at an airstrip just a few miles \nfrom a military base. She told me that Castano boasted when he showed \nher transcripts of her private telephone conversations, transcripts \nthat he could have only obtained from military intelligence sources.\n\n  The strong human rights conditions contained in this bill will ensure \nthat the Colombian Government takes concrete steps to prosecute and \npunish military personnel alleged to have committed human rights abuses \nor to have collaborated with paramilitary groups. I commend Senators \nMcConnell and Leahy for including this language in the bill. The \nconditions will also encourage the Colombian Government to arrest and \nprosecute at least some paramilitary leaders and members.\n  During the conference on this bill, I urge the Senate conferees to \ninsist on retaining these strong and well-considered conditions. The \nconditions contained in the House version of the bill, while certainly \nwell-intentioned, are both weak and inconsistent with Colombia's \nConstitution. For example, the requirement to create a Judge Advocate \nGeneral Corps within the Armed Forces to investigate human rights \nabuses is contrary to the 1997 ruling of Colombia's Constitutional \nCourt that requires the investigation and prosecution of these abuses \nin the civilian justice system. The House provision regarding a \nPresidential waiver of the human rights conditions in case of \n``extraordinary circumstances'' seriously degrades the importance of \nhuman rights as a fundamental principle of U.S. foreign policy--a \nprinciple shared on a bipartisan basis over many years. The protection \nof human rights should not be a ``waivable'' foreign policy objective. \nIt should be enforced with the same vigor as our anti-drug goals. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of a May 11 letter from Human Rights \nWatch on the House provisions be included in the Record at the end of \nmy remarks. This letter reflects the strong opposition of the human \nrights community to these House provisions.\n  Two years ago, the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial presented its annual \nHuman Rights Award to four Colombians who are leaders of grassroots \nefforts to defend human rights in Colombia. These Human Rights \nLaureates--Jaime Prieto Mendez, Mario Humberto Calixto, Gloria Ines \nFlorez Schneider, and Berenice Celeyta Alayon--represented groups that \nfight for human rights, the rights of displaced persons, and the rights \nof political prisoners. These courageous individuals, and thousands of \nothers like them throughout Colombia, risk their lives every day. They \nneed and deserve our support. The conditions included in this bill are \nfor them. The conditions are also for us. They will guard against \nAmerica's complicity in human rights violations in Colombia.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have followed the issue of \nnarcotrafficking and other international crimes for years, particularly \nduring my tenure as chairman of the Subcommittee on International \nOperations, Narcotics and Terrorism. Although I have many concerns \nabout this piece of legislation, I believe we have a chance here to \nprovide support to a Colombian administration trying to address its \nlargest problem--drug trafficking.\n  The line between counternarcotics and counterinsurgency is not at all \nclear in Colombia, but we cannot let this stop our extension of aid. \nWithholding aid is not an option. In doing so, we would send the \nmessage to Colombia, our important ally in the war on drugs, that when \nthe going gets tough, they must go it alone. We must be very clear: the \nterrible human rights conditions in Colombia are inextricably tied to \nthe narcoterrorists. That won't change overnight with our support of \nthis assistance package, but it won't change at all without our help. \nAnd just as important as our support for this package will be our \ncontinuing oversight of its implementation. If human rights abuses \ncontinue, or if we begin to get embroiled in the counterinsurgency \nefforts, the Senate must remain vigilant, ending the program if \nnecessary. But we cannot simply turn our backs and walk away.\n  Civil conflict in Colombia has worn on for half a century as the \ngovernment has fought narcoterrorists for control of the country. \nOpposition groups such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia \n[FARC] and the National Liberation Army has made a business of \nguerrilla warfare and continue to terrorize the civilian population. \nParamilitary groups, formed in the 1980's as anti-guerrilla forces, \nhave resorted to many of the same terror tactics. Opposition and \nparamilitary groups control much of the country and the vast majority \nof the drug producing areas. It is clear that drug money fuels the \nfighting. In the last decade, this conflict has claimed over 35,000 \nlives and has created a population of over a million and a half \ninternally displaced persons.\n  Colombian President Andres Pastrana, in sharp contrast to his recent \npredecessor, is trying to improve human rights conditions and promote \ndemocracy, under extremely difficult conditions. Under Pastrana, the \nColombian Government has begun the first peace talks ever with the \nFARC. Though the talks have been slow moving and have encountered \nsetbacks,\n\n[[Page S5619]]\n\nPastrana has clearly made the peace process a top priority.\n  Plan Colombia was developed by President Pastrana as a comprehensive \napproach to strengthening the Colombian economy and promoting \ndemocracy, with heavy emphasis on fighting drug trafficking. In my \nview, any successful approach to Colombia's myriad of problems will \nrequire a strong counterdrug effort. The United States contribution to \nPlan Colombia, as proposed by the administration, does this.\n  Let us be clear, however, that the drug trade in Colombia is not \nsimply a Colombian problem. The United States is the largest and most \nreliable market for the Colombian cocaine and heroin that is at the \ncenter of this conflict. We have approximately 5.8 million cocaine \nusers and 1.4. million heroin users. Based on the most recent National \nHousehold Survey on Drug Abuse estimates, fourteen million Americans \nare current drug users. Clearly we are making a large contribution to \nthe problem and should therefore contribute to finding a solution.\n\n  The United States must seize the opportunity presented by President \nPastrana's current efforts to fight drug trafficking and bring \nstability to Colombia. This legislation offers us a chance to play a \nconstructive role in Colombia while simultaneously promoting American \ninterests.\n  The Plan addresses the major components of the problem. ``Push into \nSouthern Colombia'' is designated to affect the major growing and \nproduction areas in the South. It provides for the training of special \ndedicated narcotics battalions, and the purchase of helicopters for \ntroop transport and interdiction. To complement this effort, \ninterdiction tools will also be upgraded, including aircraft, \nairfields, early warning radar and intelligence gathering. The Plan \nalso provides increased funding for eradication of coca and poppy, and \nthe promotion of alternative crop development and employment. Perhaps \nmost importantly, the Plan calls for and provides resources for \nincreasing protection of human rights, expanding the rule of law, and \npromoting the peace process.\n  As I outlined earlier, Colombia's situation is bleak, and this may be \nits last chance to begin to dig its way out. If we fail to support aid \nto Colombia, we can only sit back and watch it deteriorate even \nfurther. This Plan presents a unique opportunity to support the \nColombian Government's effort to address its problems while at the same \ntime promoting U.S. interests. The Colombian Government, despite \nimmense obstacles, has begun to address significant human rights \nconcerns and is working to instill the rule of law and democratic \ninstitutions. Though the United States is not in the business of \nfighting insurgents, we are in the business of fighting drugs, and this \nis clearly an opportunity to work with a willing partner in doing so.\n  While I support a United States contribution to helping Colombia, I \nbelieve that if we are going to commit, we must do so in the context of \nan ongoing process under constant review to respond to changing needs.\n  My first concern is the fine line that exists between \ncounternarcotics and counterinsurgency operations, particularly since \nthey are so intertwined in Colombia. It is impossible to attack drug \ntrafficking in Colombia without seriously undercutting the insurgents' \noperations. We must acknowledge that the more involved in Colombia's \ncounternarcotics efforts we become the more we will become involved in \nits counterinsurgency, regardless of our intentions to steer clear of \nit. But, because the drug trade is the most destabilizing factor in \nColombia, our cooperation with the government will over the long run, \nadvance the development and expansion of democracy, and will limit the \ninsurgents' ability to terrorize the civilian population. But our \nmilitary involvement in Colombia should go no further than this. \nEfforts to limit number of personnel are designed to address this.\n  I appreciate the concerns expressed by my colleagues that the United \nStates contribution to Plan Colombia is skewed in favor of the \nmilitary, but we must keep in mind that our contribution is only a \npercentage of the total Plan. The total Plan Colombia price tag is \napproximately $7.5 billion. The Colombian Government has already \ncommitted $4 billion to the Plan, and has secured donations and loans \nfrom the International Monetary Fund, the Inter-American Development \nBank, the World Bank, the Andean Development Corporation, and the Latin \nAmerican Reserve Fund. As part of our contribution, and to balance \nmilitary aid, the United States must continue to support Colombian \nrequests for additional funding from international financial \ninstitutions and other EU donors. We must also continue to implement \nstringent human rights vetting and end-use monitoring agreements, and \nmake sure that our Colombia policy does not end with the extension of \naid.\n\n  Second, I am concerned that even if the Plan is successful at \ndestroying coca production and reducing the northward flow of drugs, \nlarge numbers of coca farmers will be displaced, worsening the current \ncrisis of internally displaced people in Colombia. Colombia has the \nlargest population of internally displaced persons in the world, \nestimated at over one and half million in November 1999. Seventy \npercent of those displaced are children, and the vast majority of them \nno longer attend school. There is every indication that as Plan \nColombia is implemented, this population may grow. This problem \nunderscores the importance of supporting the Colombians in their \nefforts to secure economic aid for alternative development. Unless we \nstrongly support loans and additional donations, the danger remains \nthat desperate farmers will simply move across the borders into Peru \nand Bolivia, and undo all the eradication progress that has been made \nin those areas.\n  My third major concern with respect to this aid package is that it \ndoes not adequately address Colombia's human rights problem. The \nColombian Government has made a real effort to address human rights and \nto promote the rule of law. Pastrana has worked to root out members of \nthe military who have committed gross violations of human rights, and \nhas suspended a number of high-level officers. He has also attacked \ncorruption in the legislature, and has come under heavy fire for doing \nso. Despite this progress, there is no question that recent events in \nColombia have raised some cause for concern. The Colombian Government's \nunfortunate decision to send back to the legislature a bill to \ncriminalize genocide and forced disappearance was a significant setback \nfor the promotion of human rights and the rule of law. I would like to \ncommend my colleagues on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee for \nbolstering the human rights component of this legislation. In addition \nto requiring additional reporting from the Secretary of State on the \nhuman rights practices of the Colombian security forces, Senator \nLeahy's provisions for human rights programs in the Colombian police \nand judiciary, a witness protection program and additional human rights \nmonitors in our embassy and Bogota, and Senator Harkin's provision to \nprovide $5 million to Colombian NGOs to protect child soldiers, \ndemonstrate our commitment to improving the human rights situation.\n  Despite my reservations, the potential benefits of this plan are too \nlarge to ignore. In light of the changes made by the committee, I \nbelieve the plan can help advance United States interests by reducing \ndrug trafficking and thereby promoting stability and democracy in \nColombia. We must now work to ensure that our concerns do not become \nrealities. Recognizing that we are not the sole contributors to this \nPlan, we must support Colombia's requests for additional aid from our \nallies, and work closely with them to ensure that additional aid \ncomplements our efforts in the areas of human rights and strengthening \nthe rule of law. The committee report recognizes the importance of \nreducing the drug trade first to build confidence among the Colombian \npeople that progress can be made in other important areas such as \neconomic development and democracy.\n\n  Plan Colombia's counterdrug focus will also benefit the United States \nby reducing the flow of drugs to the United States. The United States \nis faced with a serious drug problem which must be attacked at both \nends--supply and demand. Our consideration of counterdrug aid to \nColombia should force us to look inward, reexamine our domestic \ncounterdrug plan, and find ways strengthen it.\n\n[[Page S5620]]\n\n  The United States has long been the cocaine traffickers' largest and \nmost reliable market, fueling continued and expanded cultivation and \nproduction. Without addressing the problem here at home, we present no \nreason to expect that the growers and traffickers will not continue to \nshift their operations to maintain access to their best market.\n  Increasing funding and expanding drug treatment and prevention \nprograms are absolutely imperative if we are to coordinate an effective \ncounterdrug campaign, particularly if we are to expect any real \nimprovement in the situation in Colombia. Levels of drug abuse in the \nUnited States have remained unacceptably high, despite stepped-up \ninterdiction efforts and increased penalties for drug offenders.\n  Our criminal justice system is flooded with drug offenders. Three-\nquarters of all prisoners can be characterized as alcohol or drug \ninvolved offenders. An estimated 16 percent of convicted jail inmates \ncommitted their offense to get money for drugs, and approximately 70 \npercent of prisoners were actively involved with drugs prior to their \nincarceration.\n  America's drug problem is not limited to our hardened criminals. The \n1997 National Household Survey revealed that 77 million, or 36 percent \nof Americans aged 12 and older reported some use of an illicit drug at \nleast once in their lifetime. The statistics in U.S. high schools are \neven more disturbing. According to a 1998 study by the National \nInstitute on Drug Abuse, 54 percent of high school seniors reported \nthat they had used an illicit drug at least once and 41.4 percent \nreported use of an illicit drug within the past year.\n  As we support Colombia's efforts to attack the sources of illegal \ndrugs, we need to make sure we are addressing our own problems. \nAccording to recent estimates, approximately five million drug users \nneeded immediate treatment in 1998 while only 2.1 million received it. \nIt was also found that some populations--adolescents, women with small \nchildren, and racial and ethnic minorities--are badly underserved by \ntreatment programs. Only 37 percent of substance-abusing mothers of \nminors received treatment in 1997. Drug offenders, when released from \njail, are often not ready or equipped to deal with a return to social \npressures and many return to their old habits if they are not provided \nwith effective treatment while incarcerated and the social safety net \nthey so desperately need upon release.\n  It is clear that drug treatment works, and there is no excuse for the \nhigh numbers of addicts who have been unable to receive treatment. As \nwe increase funding for supply reduction programs in Colombia, we must \nincrease funding for treatment to balance and complement it. Drug \nresearch has made significant strides in recent years, and there are a \nvariety of treatment options now available to help even the most \nhardcore addicts. These treatments have been successful in the lab \nstudies. Now we must allow these methods to be successful in helping \nthe population for whom they were developed. Access to drug abuse \ntreatment in the United States is abysmal when compared to the \nresources we have to provide it.\n  The administration's Office of National Drug Control Policy argues \nthat a balanced approach that addresses both demand reduction and \ncutting off supply at the source is necessary to significantly reduce \ndrug abuse in America. While Plan Colombia works to cut off the drug \nsupply, we must balance that with increased funding for drug abuse \nprevention and better treatment programs that reach more of the \npopulation that so desperately needs it.\n  Plan Colombia is an opportunity to help an important ally attack the \nsources of illegal drug production reduce the flow of cocaine and \nheroin to the United States. The United States must stay engaged with \nthe Pastrana government and support its critical efforts to combat drug \ntrafficking. Instead of being limited by our reservations, we must use \nthem to carefully craft a policy that addresses economic development, \npolitical stability, human rights and the rule of law. Drug trafficking \nis the major obstacle to the advancement of these goals, and it must be \ncurbed if any progress is to be made in our drug war at home.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3546\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the capital city of India, a woman is \nburned to death every 12 hours. Earlier this week, NPR reported the \nstory of a courageous survivor of a phenomenon that is commonly \nreferred to as ``dowry deaths.'' Joti Dowan was held prisoner by her \nhusband and mother-in-law for two years because she refused to ask her \nmother for a $1,000 dowry.\n  Locked in a tiny room, isolated from friends and family, and rationed \nonly two pieces of bread a day, Joti weighed only 55 pounds when \nauthorities found her. Frequent beatings and malnutrition left her too \nweak to stand without help. A long scar covers her arm because, at one \npoint during her torture, her husband and his family tried to kill her \nby dousing her with kerosene. It was only because they feared her \nscreams would alert the neighbors that they extinguished the fire.\n  Shelanie Agerwall was shot and killed by her husband when he became \ndissatisfied with the new car that originally came with her dowry. He \ntraded in the vehicle for a more expensive one and demanded his wife's \nfamily compensate him for the extra cost. When Shelanie Agerwall's \nfamily did not pay him quickly enough, he murdered her.\n  Death resulting from dowry disputes are on the rise. In 1998, 12,600 \nwomen in India were victims of dowry deaths--a 15 percent increase from \nthe previous year. Burning a woman to death is the most common form of \ndowry death. Commonly referred to as ``bride burning,'' women are \ndoused with kerosene and lit on fire. In many cases, their murder is \nplanned to look like a cooking accident.\n  The law provides little or no support for the victims of dowry \ndisputes. Corruption is rampant throughout the system--police are \nbribed by the husbands' families to destroy evidence, doctors are \npersuaded to change their testimony, and the legal system rarely \nconvicts husbands and families guilty of dowry deaths.\n  Dowry has evolved from a custom to a form of extortion. The demand \nfor quick money to buy consumer goods has increased the demands for so-\ncalled ``dowries'' throughout India. As a result, the use of dowries \nhas spread to communities which never before had a dowry custom. The \ngrowing middle class has been met by eager manufacturers. Conspicuous \nconsumption demands greater dowry payments.\n  In April, a 29-year-old Pakistani woman was shot dead in the law \noffice of a leading human rights activist. Her parents had ordered the \nkilling because she had shamed the family by seeking a divorce.\n  Perveen Aktar, a 37-year-old woman living in Pakistan, was severely \nburned in September when her husband, a fruit peddler, threw acid on \nher. According to Aktar, whose face, back, and chest are badly scarred, \nher husband wanted to return to his first wife, and she refused. She \nwent to the police, but her husband paid them a series of bribes, and \nthey did not investigate.\n  These women's struggles are a part of a larger epidemic of ``honor \nkillings''--or culturally sanctioned killing of women in the name of \npreserving a family's honor. ``Honor crimes'' remain a serious problem \nin many countries, including: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt.\n  Few statistics are available on honor crimes, but the independent \nHuman Rights Commission of Pakistan reported that in 1998 and 1999, \nmore than 850 women were killed by their husbands, brothers, fathers or \nother relatives in Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province.\n  In many of those cases, the woman was suspected of what was \nconsidered ``immoral behavior.'' According to lawyers and women's \nrights advocates, many such cases are never brought to trial. Police \nare easily bribed or persuaded by the men's families to dismiss the \ncomplaints as ``domestic accidents.''\n  Some say that the problems of ``dowry deaths'' and ``honor killings'' \nare cultural. These problems are criminal, not cultural, and we have an \nobligation to do something about it.\n  The amendment I offered would encourage the Secretary of State to \nmeet with representatives from countries that have a high incidence of \n``dowry deaths'' and ``honor killings'' to assess ways to work together \nto increase awareness about these problems and to\n\n[[Page S5621]]\n\ndevelop strategies to end these practices.\n  The United States, as a world leader, needs to realize its influence \nin the world. I do not believe it is our place to go into other \ncountries and dictate their traditions. But at the same time, we need \nto send a message to those countries that condone the brutal killings \nof innocent women.\n\n\n               international rule of law program in china\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will my good friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am pleased to yield to my friend the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I note in the committee's report that $2 million is \nbeing designated for the creation of an International Rule of Law \nProgram in China. The report states that the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development is requested to give serious consideration to \nthe proposal of Temple University Law School in cooperation with New \nYork University Law School to establish a Business Law Center in China.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct. It is the intention of the committee to \nsupport these two prestigious institutions in building upon the very \nimportant Temple University Masters of Law Program in Beijing, which is \nthe first and only foreign law degree-granting program in China. After \nreviewing the case of Yongyi Song, a librarian at Dickinson College in \nPennsylvania who was released in January after being held under dubious \ncharges in China, I believe the U.S. Congress should support programs \nthat advance the rule of law in China. At a time when the People's \nRepublic of China is seeking permanent most-favored-nation status and \nseeking entry into the World Trade Organization, it is my hope that the \ngovernment of the PRC will respect basic norms for due process such as \nan open public trial and the right to confer with counsel. \nInternational Rule of Programs such as the Temple University/NYU \nProgram are important means to build understanding and respect for \nthese basic norms in the Chinese legal community.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I agree that this is an important program which the \nCongress should support, and it is my hope that this funding will be \nmaintained as the bill goes to conference with the House. I have one \nfurther question. Is it the committee's intention that the U.S. Agency \nfor International Development provide the full amount of this funding \nto an individual rule of law program in the People's Republic of China, \nsuch as the program by Temple University, in cooperation with New York \nUniversity, for the creation of their Business Law Center in China?\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct. I certainly encourage AID to release \nthe full funding as designated in the committee's report.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my good friend for his helpful clarification.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3547\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, over the years, I have come to the Senate \nfloor on many occasions to talk about female genital mutilation (FGM). \nStill, it is very difficult for me to stand here and talk about \nsomething as repulsive, as cruel and as unusual as the practice of FGM. \nBut ignoring this issue because of the discomfort it causes us does \nnothing but perpetuate the silent acquiescence of its practice.\n  For those who are unfamiliar with this ritual, FGM is the cutting \naway of the female genitals and then sewing up the opening, leaving \nonly a small hole for urine and menstrual flow. In many cases, the \ngirl's legs are bound together for weeks while a permanent scar forms. \nIt is performed on girls between the ages of 4 and 12.\n  This is a practice that has been around for thousands of years and is \nnot going to go away overnight. We need to continue to talk about it \nand insist upon aggressive education of the African communities that \npractice it, as well as the implementation of laws prohibiting it.\n  Several years ago, I passed legislation that requires the Health and \nHuman Services Secretary to identify and compile data on immigrant \ncommunities in the United States who are practicing FGM. I worked to \npass legislation, that is now law, to make criminal the practice of FGM \nin the United States.\n  I have offered two amendments that would keep the United States \nfocused on its work to eliminate FGM abroad. One amendment would allow \nUS AID (US Agency for International Development) to spend up to $1.5 \nmillion on its activities to eradicate FGM. My second amendment \nrequires the Secretary of State to further study FGM and to submit her \nfindings along with a set of recommendations on how the United States \ncan best work to eliminate the practice of FGM to Congress by June 1, \n2001.\n  US AID has a long history of supporting the eradication of FGM, \nhowever, it still has a long way to go. In 1995, Congress mandated that \nUS AID dedicate one million dollars to efforts to end FGM. Since 1995, \nfunding for this program has fluctuated from a low level of $500,000 \nper year to a high level of $800,000 per year. My amendment will \nrestore funding to this important program.\n  It is estimated that 130 million girls are genitally mutilated. Every \nyear, two million girls face FGM--that's 6,000 girls every day.\n  Last year, I met with Waris Dirie, an activist and supermodel, who \nserves as a special ambassador for the Elimination of FGM for the \nUnited Nations Population Fund. A native of Somalia and born to a \nnomadic family, Ms. Dirie survived the traditional form of FGM that \nkills hundreds of women every year--her younger sister and two cousins \ndied from the procedure. At age 13, just before she was to be married \noff to an elderly man, Ms. Dirie ran away from home. She has left the \nglamour of the fashion world to speak out and work to eradicate this \nheinous procedure.\n  As Ms. Dirie will tell you, the initial operation leads to many \nhealth complications that will plague the girl throughout her life--if \nshe does not bleed to death during the procedure. But the immediate \nhealth risks are not over after a couple of months or even a couple of \nyears after the operation. When a girl is married, her husband either \nhas to force himself upon her, or re-cut her in order to have sexual \nintercourse.\n  During child birth, additional cutting and stitching takes place with \neach birth. All of this re-cutting and stitching creates tough scar \ntissue. The procedure is usually performed by female laypeople and is \nmost often performed with a razor, knife, or even a piece of glass.\n  Often, we refer to FGM as a women's issue, but this needs to be seen \nas a child abuse issue as well. A four year-old girl does not have the \nability to consent or to understand the significance and the \nconsequence this ritual will have on her life, on her health, or on her \ndignity. Young girls are tied and held down, they scream in pain and \nare not only physically scarred, they are emotionally scarred for life.\n  We know a lot about the psychological effects of child abuse from \nstudying children of domestic abuse in the United States. Imagine the \npsychological effect this must have on children from the initial \noperation throughout adulthood. The health complications are a constant \nreminder of the mutilation they endured.\n  I understand that this custom is deeply embedded in African culture. \nHowever, that does not mean we should pretend it is not happening. \nAccording to a report by Amnesty International, FGM is practiced in \nAfrican countries where it has already been criminalized. In some of \nthese countries, over 90% of the women undergo FGM, in spite of laws \nprohibiting it.\n  This is a cruel and tortuous procedure performed on young girls \nagainst their will. The United States must make all efforts to condemn \nand to curb this practice.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the fiscal year \n2001 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, which has been moved to \nthird reading.\n  Most immediately, the supplemental emergency funding for Assistance \nto Plan Colombia--requested by the President at the beginning of the \nyear, and passed by the House months ago--can finally be included in \nthe Military Construction Appropriations bill already in Conference.\n  In Colombia, we have a real opportunity to work with a \ndemocratically-elected government which is committed to combatting drug \nproduction\n\n[[Page S5622]]\n\nand trafficking in a country which supplies most of the heroin and \nabout 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I recently visited Colombia to assess what our aid \ncould accomplish. I went to see the scope of drug crop cultivation and \nprocessing, to look into the political context, the human rights \nsituation, the goals of the Pastrana Government, and to assess the \ncapabilities of the military and the police.\n  I went with an open mind, though I was concerned about the horrendous \nabuses of human rights and with the effects of Colombian cocaine and \nheroin on the streets of New Jersey and other states.\n  I left Colombia convinced that we can help Colombia and help America \nby cooperating in the fight against drug production, trafficking, and \nuse. Let me briefly share a few of my observations and conclusions:\n  Aid for Plan Colombia is strongly in the U.S. interest. While there \ncan be legitimate differences of opinion about the exact content of the \naid package, we must use the opportunity to cooperate with a fellow \ndemocracy to fight the scourge of drugs which harms both our people.\n  This is a genuine emergency and should be funded as such. Drug crop \neradication, training, and counter-narcotics military and police \noperations have been curtailed for lack of funds. Other elements of the \npackage--like helicopters and alternative development aid--have longer \nlead times, but the process cannot start until the funds are passed.\n  Every week we delay, 1,000 more acres of coca are planted, so the \nproblem grows ever larger and narcotics-trafficking groups grow \nstronger.\n  Colombia's political will is strong. While the political situation in \nColombia is uncertain, President Pastrana and the Colombian Congress \nhave backed away from forcing early elections and appear to be working \nout their differences. But the Colombian people and their elected \nrepresentatives want an end to the violence.\n  They support peace negotiations with the FARC and ELN guerrillas. And \nthey know the violence will not end as long as it is fueled by drug \ntrafficking and its dirty proceeds.\n  The U.S. and Colombia have a symbiosis of interest in combating drug \nproduction and trafficking.\n  While the Colombians mainly want to end financial support for various \narmed groups, they are highly motivated to cooperate with our main \ngoal--eliminating a major source of narcotics destined for the United \nStates.\n  Colombia's military and police need reform and assistance. I was \nappalled to learn that any conscript with a high school education is \nexempt from combat duty, so only the poorest, least-educated people \nserve in front-line units.\n  Moreover, the standards of training for most military personnel are \nquite low, and the NCO corps is particularly weak. Colombia needs to \naccelerate military reforms, some of which require legislation.\n  But the U.S. can also help a great deal by providing sound training \nto the Counter-Narcotics Battalions which will be most directly \ninvolved in operations supporting the Colombian National Police as they \neradicate crops, destroy laboratories and processing facilities, and \narrest traffickers.\n  We need to improve protection for human rights in Colombia. The \nColombian people face very real risks of murder, kidnapping, extortion, \nand other heinous crimes, so they always live in fear. Hundreds of \nthousands of people have fled the violence. The Colombian Government--\nincluding the military and the police--take human rights issues very \nseriously.\n  We need to hold them to their commitments to make further progress, \nas the Senate bill language Senators Kennedy and Leahy and I authored \nwould do. I was particularly impressed that the independent Prosecutor \nGeneral's Office--known as the Fiscalia --is firmly committed to \nprosecuting criminals, particularly human rights violators.\n  But in meeting with Colombian human rights groups, I learned that the \noverwhelming majority of human rights abuses are committed by the \nparamilitary groups, followed by the guerrillas. Colombia must sever \nany remaining ties between its military and the paramilitary groups and \ntreat them like the drug-running outlaws they are.\n  On the whole, winning the war on drugs in Colombia should do more to \nimprove security and safeguard human rights than anything else we or \nthe Colombian government can do.\n  Mr. President, I reluctantly opposed the Amendment offered by the \nSenator from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone.\n  I share his conviction that we as a country must do more to reduce \nthe demand for illegal drugs in our society.\n  In 1998, the most recent year for which I have these statistics, more \nthan 5 million Americans were chronic, hard-core users of illegal \ndrugs.\n  Just over 2 million--less than half of them--received treatment. I \nfirmly believe that we should provide drug treatment for every drug \naddict willing to make the tremendous effort to overcome his or her \naddiction. In my view, we should ensure that no one leaves our \nprisons--whether federal, state, or local--addicted to narcotics.\n  We absolutely must do more to reduce demand and thus reduce the use \nof dangerous drugs and reduce the terrible toll drug use and related \ncrime takes on our society.\n  Where I differ with the Senator from Minnesota is that I do not \nbelieve we should undermine our Assistance for Plan Colombia to pay for \nincreased domestic drug treatment and prevention programs.\n  Even if we were to fully fund the President's request for Assistance \nto Plan Colombia, our international programs would account for only \nabout one-tenth of our counter-narcotics budget.\n  In Colombia, we have a real opportunity to work with a \ndemocratically-elected government which is committed to combating drug \nproduction and trafficking in a country which supplies most of the \nheroin and about 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United \nStates.\n  In short, Mr. President, I opposed the Wellstone Amendment because I \nbelieve we need to keep working to reduce demand for drugs here in \nAmerica, but not at the expense of cutting efforts to eliminate a major \nsource of drugs to our country.\n  I also opposed the Amendment offered by the Senator from Washington, \nSenator Gorton. I voted against a similar Amendment in the \nAppropriations Committee, and my subsequent visit to Colombia leaves me \nmore convinced than ever that I was right to do so.\n  Our vote on the Gorton Amendment was, quite simply, a vote on the \nproposed Assistance to Plan Colombia. We all know that President \nPastrana's Plan Colombia--which includes an aggressive counternarcotics \neffort--could not go forward with only one hundred or two hundred \nmillion dollars in U.S. aid.\n  Even if the Gorton amendment had merely delayed funding, as its \nsponsor has argued, it would have prevented President Clinton from \nseizing the opportunity to act now. In my view, we have waited too long \nalready to address a major source of the narcotics which bring so much \nharm on the American people.\n  We have a tremendous opportunity--if we are willing to devote a \nreasonable level of funding--to drastically curtail the production \ncocaine and heroin in Colombia while supporting democracy and the rule \nof law in that country.\n  I am concerned that other emergency needs have not been met.\n  The President requested emergency supplemental funds for Kosovo and \nthe Southeast Europe Initiative to help bring peace and stability to \nthat troubled region, but those funds have not been provided.\n  Funding for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, or HIPC, \nmultilateral debt relief trust fund also was not provided, so we cannot \nfulfill our goals to help relieve the world's poorest countries from \nthe crushing burdens of debt. I hope we will be able to address these \ndeficiencies in Conference with the House on emergency supplemental \nappropriations.\n  Let me turn now to the underlying Foreign Operations Appropriations \nfor fiscal year 2001.\n  As I noted when we considered this bill in Committee, I believe \nSubcommittee Chairman McConnell and Ranking Member Leahy, working with \nother Senators and aided by their capable staff, have done a good job \nof allocating the resources available to them.\n\n[[Page S5623]]\n\n  I particularly appreciate their help to include revised language to \nensure our aid in Bosnia and elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia is used \nto help bring war criminals to justice. I also support the creation of \nan account for Global Health, with increased funding for tuberculosis, \nAIDS, and other health challenges. And the bill fully funds support for \nour ally Israel and peace in the Middle East.\n  That said, Mr. President, I am deeply concerned that the funds \nprovided for the Foreign Operations Subcommittee simply are not \nsufficient to sustain America's global leadership as we begin a new \ncentury.\n  President Clinton requested increased funding for international \nprograms in fiscal year 2001, though still far less in real terms than \nwe spent in the mid-1980s.\n  But the bill before us today falls about $1.7 billion short of the \nPresident's request.\n  Let me cite just a few examples of the cuts:\n  Funding for the Global Environment Facility is more than $125 million \nbelow the President's request, so our arrears will continue to mount \nand environmentally-sustainable development projects in poor countries \nwill not be funded. Even the International Development Association, or \nIDA--the main institution known as the World Bank--is funded below last \nyear's level and more than $85 million below the Administration's \nrequest.\n  While I appreciate Chairman McConnell's strong funding for Central \nand Eastern Europe, it's not nearly enough to make up for the Kosovo \nsupplemental which was apparently not funded.\n  Meanwhile, assistance to the Independent States of the former Soviet \nUnion--many of them still at a critical stage in their economic and \npolitical transition--is $55 million below the level requested by the \nAdministration.\n  The International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement and Non-\nProliferation, Anti-Terrorism and Demining accounts are each cut by \nnearly $100 million from the President's request.\n  I don't want to waste the Senate's time citing all the examples, but \nI hope I've made my point.\n  President Clinton sought a more responsible level of international \naffairs spending within his balanced budget, but this bill is more than \n11 percent below the Administration's request.\n  Mr. President, I believe we need to strengthen Foreign Operations \nfunding as this bill goes to Conference with the House. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues on the subcommittee to make that happen, \nso we can avoid having this bill vetoed.\n  We need to work together to achieve a responsible Foreign Operations \nfunding level which will advance America's interest and reflect \nAmerica's values around the world.\n  I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the foreign operations appropriations bill \nthat the Senate completed debate on today contains $934 million to \nlaunch a major counter-narcotics initiative in Colombia. Other \nfinancing attached to the Military Construction and Defense \nAppropriations bills boosts that total to well over a billion dollars.\n  This funding will enable the United States to embark on a massive \nramping up of its counter-narcotics offensive in Colombia. But \ncuriously enough, the bulk of this program is being implemented through \na series of supplemental funding measures. A major anti-narcotics \nprogram in Central America, anchored on the provision of U.S. military \nequipment and U.S. military and State Department advisers, seems to me \nto be a policy issue that begs for in depth Congressional discussion \nand consideration. And yet, we are effectively creating it through \nsupplemental appropriations. This may be an expedient way to deal with \na difficult problem, but I question its efficacy. I wholeheartedly \nsupport aggressive counter-narcotics efforts. Illegal drugs and drug \nabuse are scourges on our society, and we cannot pretend that the \nproblem will go away if we simply ignore it. But I am concerned about \nthe large number of unanswered questions surrounding the President's \nplan.\n  I understand where the money is to be spent, and what it is to be \nspent on, but I am unclear as to what the results are expected to be. \nWhat precise impact is the U.S. assistance expected to have on the \nproduction of cocaine and heroin into the United States? What impact \nwill massive U.S. assistance to Colombia have on drug production in \nother Andean Ridge nations? What impact will intensified U.S. \nassistance to the government of Colombia's have on Colombia's internal \npolitics and simmering civil war? And, most importantly, what impact \nwill this initiative have on reducing drug abuse and the toll of the \nillegal drug trade within the United States.\n  Providing answers to those, and other questions, is the primary \nintent of a provision that I added in Committee to the foreign \noperations appropriations bill. My provision requires the \nAdministration to seek and receive congressional authorization before \nspending any money on U.S. support for the counter-narcotics program in \nColombia, called Plan Colombia, beyond the funding contained in this \nand other relevant spending bills. If this funding is sufficient, all \nwell and good. But if more money is needed to prolong or expand the \nanti-drug effort, then Congress has a responsibility to reevaluate the \nentire program. The purpose of my provision is to prevent the \nU.S. government from slowly but steadily increasing its participation \nin the anti-narcotics effort in Colombia until it finds itself \nembroiled in, at best, a costly and open-ended anti-drug campaign \nthroughout the Andean Ridge, or, at worst, a bloody civil war in \nColombia.\n\n  A secondary goal of my provision is to limit the number of U.S. \npersonnel engaged in the counter-narcotics offensive in Colombia to \nspecific levels unless Congress approves higher levels of U.S. \npersonnel. The provision, which I modified to address concerns raised \nby the Defense Department, imposes a ceiling of 500 U.S. military \npersonnel and 300 U.S. civilian contractors working on Plan Colombia in \nColombia unless Congress authorizes higher levels.\n  In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Defense \nDepartment indicated that it would not be opposed to troop caps. This \nis a prudent measure that Congress should endorse to ensure that U.S. \ninvolvement does not unwittingly spiral out of control in Colombia.\n  In an effort to ensure that my provision does not impede ongoing \ncounter-narcotics operations in Colombia, I amended it to address \nconcerns raised by the Administration regarding the availability of \nfunds provided in the FY 2001 Defense Appropriations Bill, and the \navailability of relevant unobligated balances in other spending bills. \nMy amendment protects ongoing programs without giving the \nAdministration the green light to begin empire building in Colombia.\n  There are those, I am sure, who will say that my provision is too \ncumbersome, that we should simply handle this huge counter-narcotics \noffensive in the normal course of business. That, I believe, would be a \ndangerous course of action, one that would invite mission creep and \ndeep entanglement in the internal affairs of Colombia.\n  U.S. assistance to Plan Colombia is not, and should not be, business \nas usual. If the Administration is sincere in its commitment to launch \na major, coordinated, inter-agency offensive against the burgeoning \ndrug industry in Colombia, then the Administration should welcome the \nspotlight that my provision will shine on its efforts. The \nAdministration should welcome the extra safeguards that this language \nprovides against unintended consequences.\n  Mr. President, winning the war against illegal drugs is vitally \nimportant to the future of our nation and to the future of our \nneighbors, but it is the responsibility of Congress to ensure that we \nare allocating U.S. taxpayers dollars in the most effective manner \npossible. Congress cannot make that determination without fully \nexploring the goals and potential ramifications of this effort to \nprovide assistance to Colombia. My provision provides the minimum \nnecessary safeguards to ensure congressional oversight of Plan \nColombia. I commend the Senate for maintaining the integrity and the \nintent of this provision.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with several of my \ncolleagues, including Senator Chafee, Senator Mack, Senator Biden, and \nSenator Leahy in sponsoring this Sense of\n\n[[Page S5624]]\n\nthe Senate amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill. I \nam also very pleased that agreement has been reached for the amendment \nto be accepted. The amendment calls on the Senate to support full \nauthorization and funding for international debt relief. I worked with \nSenator Mack last year in introducing the ``Debt Relief for Poor \nCountries Act of 1999,'' and am glad to work with him again on this \nimportant issue.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to highlight one of the major \nshortcomings in the Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill, as reported \nout of Committee, which only included $75 million for the purposes of \ndebt relief. That allocation falls far short of what the Administration \nhas requested and what is needed to meet our obligations to the HIPC \n(Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) trust fund and bilateral debt relief \ncommitments. The Administration has requested $210 million for FY 2000 \nfor HIPC and $225 million for FY 2001 ($150 million to HIPC and $75 \nmillion for bilateral debt relief). This money is necessary for us to \nmeet our commitments to the HIPC trust fund, estimated at $600 million \nover the next three years, and our commitments to bilateral debt \nreductions, estimated at $375 million over the same period.\n  The Administration has also requested an authorization from Congress \nto support use for HIPC debt relief of the full earnings on profits \nfrom IMF off-market gold sales.\n  Why is debt relief so important? Many poor countries are saddled with \nlarge debt payments. All too often, payments on the foreign debt--which \naccount for as much as 70 percent of government expenditures in some \ncountries--mean there is little left to meet basic human needs of the \npopulation, such as health, education, nutrition, sanitation, and basic \nsocial services.\n  As a group, HIPCs post some of the world's lowest human development \nindicators: one in ten children dies before their first birthday; one \nin three children is malnourished; the average person attends only \nthree years of school; half of all citizens live on less than $1 dollar \na day; HIV infection rates are as a high as 20 percent.\n  In effect, debt service payments are making it even harder for the \nrecipient governments to enact the kinds of economic and political \nreforms that the loans were designed to encourage, and that are \nnecessary to ensure broad-based growth and future prosperity.\n  Last year, President Clinton pledged to cancel all $5.7 billion of \ndebt owed to the U.S. government by 36 of the poorest countries. \nCanceling the debt will not cost the full $5.7 billion because many of \nthe loans would never have been repaid and are no longer worth their \nfull face-value. It does not make economic sense to keep these loans on \nthe books.\n  Additionally, I believe U.S. leadership is at stake. As the richest \ncountry in the world and as one that has long been interested in the \ndevelopment of poor countries, we risk losing our moral authority in \nthe international arena if we cannot, especially during our country's \ntime of prosperity, alleviate the crushing debt burden of many poor \ncountries.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like once again to address the \nissue of unrequested and unnecessary earmarks in the annual foreign \noperations appropriations bill.\n  It is a constant struggle, Mr. President, to maintain a reasonable--\nif not always adequate--amount of funding for foreign operations when \nthe public overwhelmingly opposes foreign aid programs. It is therefore \nincumbent upon those of us who believe that foreign aid programs are an \nimportant component of U.S. national security policy to spend that \nbudget wisely. As usual, the foreign operations appropriations bill \nbefore us squanders vital financial resources for unnecessary, low-\npriority and unrequested programs. Once again, pressuring the Agency \nfor International Development to fund research into the future welfare \nof the Waboom tree; providing millions of dollars for organizations \nlike the Orangutan Foundation, the Peregrine Fund's Neotropical Raptor \nCenter, the Missouri Botanical Garden, the Dian Fossey Gorrilla Fund, \nand the World Council of Hellenes--none of which was requested by the \nAgency for International Development or the Department of State--was \ndeemed preferential to higher priority activities that unquestionably \ncontribute to regional stability in less developed countries.\n  Mr. President, the notion that funding from the foreign aid budget \nnot requested by the Administration should only go to organizations and \nprograms following an objective, rigorous and competitive process \neludes the Appropriations Committee. I am not reflexively opposed to \nall of the programs for which funding was added in this bill. I do take \nstrong exception to the process by which funding is earmarked for \nparochial reasons. The bill before us today is replete with such \nexamples. A long list of earmarks for university programs, the vast \nmajority of which coincide with membership on the Appropriations \nCommittee, is more evidence than even the O.J. Simpson jury would need \nthat reasonable doubt exists as to whether such objective criteria are \nemployed.\n  United States military forces are being deployed at record levels; \nconflicts in Africa and elsewhere are raging out of control, bringing \nwith them untold misery, and we continue to pass spending bills of such \ndubious merit. I will support passage of the foreign operations \nappropriations bill, but only because it is imperative that funding for \nIsrael, Egypt, refugee and migration assistance, and other vital \nprograms receive the timely assistance they require. But to be forced \nto swallow such questionable earmarks as the $1 million for the Fort \nValley State University agribusiness program in Georgia--and I should \npoint out that the Republic of Georgia has no greater friend in the \nSenate than me--without the benefit of a competitive analytical process \nis more than a little painful. I suppose it is only appropriate that, \nonce again, we are adding funding, this year to the tune of $4 million, \nfor the International Fertilizer Development Center. There is something \nstrangely appropriate that we spend tens of millions of dollars to fund \nthe fertilizer center given the process by which this bill is put \ntogether every year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this statement appear in \nthe Record, accompanied by the list of earmarks and directive language \nthat I have assembled.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \n           Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (S. 2522)\n\n\n                    directive language and earmarks\n\n     Report language provisions\n       Iodine Deficiency/Kiwanis: Recommends that AID provide at \n     least $5 million to Kiwanis International via UNICEF\n       Streetwise Program: Encourages AID to provide $50,000 for \n     the program\n       Morehouse School of Medicine: Expects AID to provide $5.5 \n     million for the Morehouse School of Medicine's International \n     Center for Health and Development\n       Iowa State University: Recommends that $1 million provided \n     to support Iowa State University's International Women in \n     Science and Engineering program\n       International Executive Service Corporation: Strongly \n     supports the efforts of the IESC, believes that AID has \n     underutilized the corporation, and urges AID to grant funds \n     to IESC to expand its programs\n       International Rice Research Institute: Recommends $5 \n     million for the institute\n       Donald Danforth Plant Science Center: Recommends up to \n     $500,000 to train Thai researchers at the center, and \n     recommends up to $500,000 for research into bacterial and \n     virus problems related to rice\n       Tropical Plant and Animal Research Initiative: Urges AID to \n     fund a joint Israel-State of Hawaii research and development \n     project to enhance the competitiveness of the tropical fish \n     and global plant market\n       Protea Germplasm: Urges AID to fund meritorious aspects of \n     a joint South Africa-U.S. protea industry proposal to create \n     a repository to safeguard protea germplasm\n       Missouri Botanical Garden: Directs AID to increase funding \n     for biodiversity conservation above current level and to work \n     with the Missouri Botanical Garden to protect biodiversity\n       Orangutan Foundation: Provides $1.5 million to support \n     organizations such as the Orangutan Foundation\n       Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International and the Karisoke \n     Research Center: Provides $1.5 million to support the fund \n     and the center\n       Peregrine Fund: Recommends $500,000 for the Peregrine \n     Fund's Neotropical Raptor Center\n       Pacific International Center for High Technology Research: \n     Encourages AID to provide up to $500,000 for the center\n       Soils Management Collaborative Research Support Program/\n     Montana State University:\n\n[[Page S5625]]\n\n     Recommends that AID provide $3 million for the SM-CRSP, and \n     encourages AID to provide $500,000 through the SM-CRSP to \n     Montana State University-Bozeman\n       U.S./Israel Cooperative Development Program and Cooperative \n     Development Research Program: Urges an increase in funding \n     for CDP/CDR\n       Patrick J.

Mr. President, the Senate today will pass the foreign \noperations appropriations bill and I rise to speak in support of the \nadditional funding for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) that \nis contained in this legislation. The bill makes additional FY2000 \nfunds available for the DEA to step up efforts against the burgeoning \nepidemic of methamphetamine--commonly called ``meth''. This funding is \nneeded for the DEA to combat the explosive meth problem which is \nemerging as one of the fastest growing threats in our country, \nespecially in Missouri.\n  With its roots on the west coast, the meth epidemic has now exploded \nin middle America. Meth is today what cocaine was to the 1980s and \nheroin was to the 1970s--the hot, ``in'' drug with a catastrophic \npotential to destroy all those it comes in contact with--financially, \nspiritually, and physically. It is currently the largest drug threat we \nface in Missouri. Unfortunately, it is most likely coming soon to a \ncity or town near you.\n\n[[Page S5626]]\n\n  If one wanted to design a drug to have the worst possible effect on \nthe community, one would make methamphetamine. It is highly addictive, \nhighly destructive, cheap, and easy to manufacture.\n  To give my colleagues an idea on the scope of the problem in Missouri \nalone, let me share with you these frightening statistics: during the \nwhole year of 1992, law enforcement seized two clandestine Meth labs in \nMissouri and in 1994, the number of Meth labs seized increased to 14. \nBy 1998, the number of seized labs mushroomed to 679. Based on reports \nof the figures collected in 1999, that number jumped again last year to \nover 900 labs in Missouri alone. According to the latest national \nstatistics from the DEA, reported meth lab seizures in 1999 for the \nentire United States totaled 6,438, up from 5,786 in 1998 and 3,327 in \n1997. This is nearly a 100% increase in only two years.\n  The rapid increase and spread of meth across the country has brought \nwith it the problems that we too often see with illegal drug use. As \nthe ``popularity'' of meth has increased, we have seen the proportional \nincreases in domestic abuse, child abuse, burglaries and drug related \nmurders. In addition, from 1992 to 1998 meth-related emergency room \nincidents increased by 63 percent.\n  What is most unacceptable to me is that meth is ensnaring our \nchildren. In 1998, the percentage of 12th graders who used meth had \ndoubled from the 1992 level. In recent conversations I have had with \nlocal law enforcement officers in Missouri, they estimated that as many \nas 10% of high school students know the recipe for meth. In fact, one \nneed only log-on the Internet to find numerous web sites giving \ndetailed instructions for setting up a meth lab. This is troublesome.\n  We in Congress have taken these indicators seriously. Despite yearly \nappropriations to combat meth abuse and trafficking, the meth problem \ncontinues to grow. I believe it is time to dedicate more resources to \nstopping this scourge once and for all. To that end, earlier this year \nI joined a number of my colleagues in the Senate in sending letters to \nPresident Clinton and Attorney General Reno requesting that at least \n$10,000,000 in additional funds be made available for the DEA to assist \nstate and local law enforcement in the proper removal and disposal of \nhazardous materials recovered from clandestine methamphetamine \nlaboratories. This funding would provide the necessary resources for \nthe DEA and state and local law enforcement officials to combat this \ngrowing meth problem.\n  Meth presents us with a formidable challenge. We have faced other \nchallenges in the past and we can face this one as well. In fact, the \nhistory of America is one of meeting challenges and surpassing people's \nhighest expectations. Meth is no exception. All it takes is that we \nmarshal our will and channel the great indomitable American spirit.\n  In order to successfully combat this growing meth problem, we must \nprovide law enforcement officials with adequate resources to stifle \nthis growing epidemic. To this end, I support the increased level of \nfunding in this foreign operation bill, and I encourage the conferees \nto maintain adequate funding in the Supplemental appropriations measure \nfor fighting the scourge of methamphetamine. Through legislative \nefforts like this to assist law enforcement efforts to combat meth, we \nwill meet this new meth challenge and defeat it.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to thank the managers of \nthis bill, Senators McConnell and Leahy, for accepting a revised \nversion of the amendment I submitted yesterday. This amendment \naddresses international debt relief.\n  Today we are at the dawn of the new millennium--2000 is the Year of \nJubilee. It is in this year that people throughout the world have been \ninspired by the Book of Leviticus in the Hebrew Scriptures. This book \ndescribes a Year of Jubilee, in which slaves are freed, land is \nreturned to original owners, and debts are canceled.\n  The Bible's teachings of the Year of Jubilee has led to a worldwide \nmovement to have the world's wealthiest nations forgive the debt of the \nworld's poorest nations. Great Britain, Canada, the Philippines, \nAustralia, Ireland, Austria, Germany, Sweden, South Africa, and the \nUnited States have national campaigns in this regard. The most \nprominent churches and relief groups worldwide also endorse this goal.\n  This spiritual movement in turn is helping motivate the United States \nand our G-7 allies to put forth the heavily indebted poor countries \n(``HIPC'') initiative. This groundbreaking effort will provide \nsubstantial debt relief to poor nations conditioned on making real \nprogress towards economic growth and poverty reduction. It will also \nemphasize greater budget discipline within recipient countries so that \nscarce resources, rather than being wasted, are directed where they are \nneeded most.\n  Although the President requested $435 million this year for the U.S. \ncontribution to the HIPC initiative, the appropriations bill before the \nSenate today provides just $75 million. The amendment I have authored \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that the United States should \nauthorize and appropriate full funding. This amendment is cosponsored \nby seventeen of my colleagues, including those who have been leaders on \nthis issue during the past several years. Cosponsors of my amendment \nare Senators Mack, Sarbanes, Biden, Hagel, Wellstone, Lieberman, \nLandrieu, Dodd, Jeffords, Lautenberg, Gordon Smith, DeWine, Lugar, \nFeinstein, Grams, Inouye, and Bryan.\n  I believe it is important to draw attention to this critical issue, \nand would again like to thank the bill's managers for accepting my \namendment. I am hopeful that in the coming weeks, we will make further \nprogress towards full U.S. participation in the HIPC initiative. Thank \nyou.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as Americans, we have two vital tasks in \nour relations with Colombia. We are obligated to help a neighbor that \nis struggling to build democracy and civil society, and it is in our \nbest interest to assist them in halting the flow of lethal narcotics \nfrom the Andean mountains of Colombia to American communities. These \nare the two underlying grounds for the Clinton Administration's ``Plan \nColombia,'' a request for $1.07 billion in emergency supplemental funds \nover the next two years to aid Colombia.\n  After a painful decade of violence, the Colombian people have boldly \nelected an unassailable ally of democracy and reconciliation, President \nAndres Pastrana, and they are demanding an end to human rights abuses \nand impunity by both the paramilitaries and the FARC guerillas. At the \nsame time, the lawlessness and violence of southern Colombia have \npermitted the narcotics dealers to widen their cultivation and \nconsolidate their delivery routes into the U.S. With the remarkable \nsuccess of U.S. Government anti-narcotics programs in Peru and Bolivia, \neighty percent of the heroin consumed in the U.S. is now cultivated in \nColombia. We have no choice now but to focus our anti-drug efforts in \nColombia.\n  While I realize that we must bring pressure to bear on the drug \ncartels, my experience with Central America in the 1980s leads me to be \nvery skeptical about the utility of the military response to social and \npolitical problems. I therefore have been wary of the Administration's \nPlan Colombia. My chief concerns with it have been the Colombian \nmilitary campaign against narcotics cultivation, and the abysmal human \nrights record of paramilitary groups that have frequently been linked \nto the military forces. I am also concerned that we not get dragged \ninto a major, long-term counter-insurgency effort which is not our \nfight.\n  In the end, though, I decided to go along with the Administration's \nproposal as significantly improved by the Senate Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee. The Subcommittee downsized the scale of the Colombian \nmilitary effort, and shifted the funding from Blackhawk to Huey \nhelicopters. Smaller and more agile, the Hueys are more suited to \nfighting narcotics cultivation, while the Blackhawks are more suited to \ncounter-insurgency combat. The Subcommittee also increased the bill's \nsizable human rights component, including new programs to bolster the \nrule of law and fight corruption. The Subcommittee also shares my \nconcern for U.S. Government responsibility for this expensive anti-\nnarcotics effort by increased funding for\n\n[[Page S5627]]\n\nend-use monitoring. Given the well-documented human rights problems in \nColombia, heightened monitoring is an extremely important component of \nthis program. Although we will be funding a military effort, I note \nthat U.S. military personnel are barred from any military operation, \nand that the Leahy Amendment puts strict safeguards on the activities \nof any U.S. funded partner, so that the human rights behavior of the \nColombian military will now be under a microscope.\n  An integral component of the final legislation is sizable funding to \nencourage judicial reform, strengthen the rule of law, and improve the \nquality of life for all Colombians. Without greater social and income \nequality and greater respect for human rights, all our efforts will \nfail. The military aid can only provide an opening for those who are \ntrying to build the foundation for civil society. By electing President \nPastrana, the Colombian people have indicated their desire for a future \nfree of drugs and violence. We must ensure that U.S. assistance is \ninstrumental in helping them achieve that goal.\n  Let's make no mistake. If this bill becomes law, the U.S. will have \nmade a major commitment to helping Colombia eradicate the narco-\nbusiness that plagues both it and us. We are pledging to stand beside \nPresident Pastrana, an enlightened and popular leader with a broad \nmandate to pursue this campaign, while he also resolutely holds \nnegotiations with entrenched but highly unpopular insurgents. I think \nthat, for his sake and ours, we must give him the tools and the \nconfidence to see this through.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I voted for S. 2522, the Senate \nversion of the Fiscal Year 2001 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. \nI voted for the bill despite serious reservations about parts of it \nbecause it also funds some very important priorities.\n  First, the bill provides economic and military assistance to some of \nAmerica's most important allies, at the level requested by the \nPresident.\n  The bill includes $450 million for international family planning \nprograms, less than requested by the President but more than last year.\n  S. 2522 also provides funding for many very important international \nprograms, including the Peace Corps, U.N. peacekeeping operations, \nrefugee assistance, and antiterrorism efforts.\n  I am especially pleased that, with the passage of my amendment to add \n$40 million, the final bill includes $51 million for international \ntuberculosis control and treatment and $255 million to fight HIV/AIDS \nin developing countries.\n  Unfortunately, attached to the foreign operations bill this year was \nalmost $1 billion in emergency spending for counter-narcotics efforts \nin Colombia. I am disappointed that the Senate rejected an amendment \noffered by Senator Wellstone, which I cosponsored, which would have \ntransferred the military aid portion--$225 million--to domestic drug \ntreatment programs.\n  We would have done more to fight the so-called drug war by putting \nthose dollars into proven drug treatment programs here to reduce \ndemand. A Rand Corporation study found that for every dollar spent on \ndemand reduction you have to spend 23 dollars on supply reduction in \norder to get the same decrease in drug consumption.\n  And because I fear that the military assistance may lead to further \nU.S. involvement in the 40-year-old civil war in Colombia, I tried to \noffer an amendment to simply affirm current Defense Department policy \nregarding activities of DoD personnel in Colombia. This policy states \nthat DoD funds may not be used to support training for Colombian \ncounter-insurgency operations, participate in law enforcement \nactivities or counternarcotics field missions, or join in any activity \nin which counter-narcotics related hostilities are imminent.\n  I was not allowed a roll call vote on my amendment because the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee made a point of order that it \nwas legislation on an appropriations bill. However, less than 24 hours \nearlier, the Senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions, had an amendment \naccepted which also dealt with U.S. policy toward Colombia, and which \nwas also subject to the very same point of order. But no senator \nobjected to the Sessions amendment.\n  This selective enforcement of Senate rules is a double standard and \nis unfair. I am particularly bothered because I had strong concerns \nabout the Sessions amendment. This is another breakdown in comity and \ncivility in the Senate, and I am very troubled by it.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \namendment offered by my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, to \nincrease funding for the U.S. Peace Corps.\n  This amendment will increase funding for the Peace Corps by $24 \nmillion, restoring funding to the enacted FY2000 level of $244 million. \nEven with passage of this amendment, $244 million is well below the \namount authorized under the four-year Peace Corps Authorization Act \nwhich I sponsored with Senator Dodd and that passed Congress with \noverwhelming bipartisan support last year. The Act authorizes an FY2001 \nlevel of $298 million to expand the Peace Corps to 10,000 volunteers, \njust as President Reagan originally intended fifteen years ago. This \namendment will allow the Peace Corps to keep pace in reaching this \nimportant goal of 10,000 Volunteers within the next five years.\n  I remind my colleagues that the Peace Corps represents just 1 percent \nof the international affairs account. Over the past several years the \nPeace Corps has worked to increase the number of Volunteers through \nmodest increases in its budget and more efficient management that \nreduced costs and staff.\n  As former Director of the Peace Corps, I have learned first-hand of \nthe tremendous impact that the relatively small amount we spend on the \nPeace Corps has throughout the world. Not only does the Peace Corps \ncontinue to be a cost effective tool for providing assistance and \ndeveloping stronger ties with the international community, it has also \ntrained over 150,000 Americans in the cultures and languages of \ncountries around the world. Returned volunteers often use these skills \nand experiences to contribute to myriad sectors of our society--\ngovernment, business, education, health, and social services, just to \nname a few.\n  This amendment will help put the Peace Corps on the firm footing it \nneeds and deserves as we enter the 21st century. I firmly believe that \na rejuvenated Peace Corps will help ensure that America continues to be \nan engaged world leader, and that we continue to share with other \ncountries our own legacy of freedom, independence, and prosperity. This \nis an investment in our country and our world that we need to make.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move we go to third reading.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, all Senators have worked very closely on \nthis. We tried to accommodate Senators on both sides of the aisle. I \nhope we will go to third reading. I am waiting for the chairman of the \nsubcommittee to come back to the floor. I see him on the floor now. We \ncan go to third reading. I hope we will support this bill.\n  This is not a perfect bill, by any means. It does not do anywhere \nnear enough on debt forgiveness, which is something we are going to \nhave to address, I hope, in conference, and I hope we will have a \nlarger allocation for that. It does not do enough on infectious \ndiseases for the poorest of the poor countries, especially in Africa. \nIt does not do enough for Mozambique and other areas. But it is a \nconsiderably well-balanced bill within the resources we had. I do \ncompliment the senior Senator from Kentucky in working as hard as he \nhas to accommodate Senators on both sides of the aisle to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to my good \nfriend from Vermont. I have enjoyed working with him on this bill. And \nI express my particular gratitude to Robin Cleveland, Billy Piper, \nJennifer Chartrand, Jon Meek, Chris Williams, Cara Thanassi, and all of \nmy staff involved in developing this measure.\n  Are we now ready for third reading?\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Shall the bill be engrossed and advanced to third \nreading?\n\n[[Page S5628]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this very important \nlegislation, the foreign operations appropriations bill. It has a lot \nof important provisions in it, funds that are critical to our foreign \npolicy. We did have two very significant votes with regard to the \nColombian aid. I think probably some Members were surprised by the show \nof support, with 89 votes against cutting the funds in one instance and \nmaybe 79 in the other instance.\n  This has been good work. It did take patience by the managers and \nsome cooperation on both sides of the aisle. We were able to get it \ndone in a very short period of time. I thank all concerned for their \ngood work. I hope we can continue that and make real progress on the \nLabor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill this week. After the work \nwe have already done, I think we can show we are doing the people's \nbusiness.\n  I commend Senator McConnell and I commend Senator Leahy for being \nwilling to stay here last night and suggest we were going to have more \nvotes last night. That helped get this done. I thank the Senators.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to also thank the distinguished \nmajority leader for his work in bringing this up. This can sometimes be \na contentious bill, as he knows. His efforts in working also with the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, paid off. And the \ndistinguished majority leader had the patience to allow Senator \nMcConnell and me to work through an awful lot of amendments on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid. We heard \nperiodically the crunch in the Cloakroom as he broke a few arms, but we \nmoved it through and got an overwhelming vote.\n  Senator McConnell showed close cooperation with me and with Senators \non both sides of the aisle throughout the process. I enjoy working with \nhim. I know he agrees we need more resources for some of these issues, \nand we will work together to get them.\n  We have many interests around the world. We know U.S. leadership \ncosts money. I think Senator McConnell and I have tried to show a \nbipartisan cohesion on that.\n  I thank the staff. They spent many long days and late nights, many \nlong weekends in getting this far. I appreciate that. Robin Cleveland, \nSenator McConnell's chief of staff on the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, as always, has been a pleasure to work with. She shows \nenormous competence and knowledge. I appreciate that. Her assistant, \nJennifer Chartrand, was indispensable to this. Jay Kimmitt on the \ncommittee staff and Billy Piper on Senator McConnell's personal staff \nhave all been of great help.\n  On the Democratic side, I mention several. First, I want to mention \nCara Thanassi of my staff who was there from start to finish. Ms. \nThanassi, on the floor now with me, is a Vermonter. She will be heading \nback to graduate school, only after she spends a month in East Timor. I \nam proud of her and what she has done for the Senate. She has shown the \nbest attributes of a true Vermonter.\n  J.P. Dowd, my legislative director, helped on the Senate floor during \nthe many busy times of the last few days. Of course, Tim Rieser, the \nDemocratic clerk on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, has worked on \nthese issues in the Senate for nearly 15 years. He probably has as \ngreat an institutional memory on the foreign policy issues as anybody \nin the Senate staff or Senate and was truly indispensable.\n  Again, I thank the leader for his help in getting the Senate this \nfar.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5628-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5628-S5629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nAPPROPRIATIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES--\n                               Continued\n\n\n                Motion to Commit with Amendment No. 3598\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Therefore, I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I certainly understand that the Senator \nwould want to consider the situation, where we are, and consult with a \nnumber of Senators. In fact, we need to do the same thing on our side.\n  I ask my colleagues on the Democratic side to see if we can't come to \nan agreement that is suitable on both sides of the aisle with regard to \nthe amount of time and that we get a direct vote on this very important \nissue of ergonomics. It is germane to this Department of Labor, HHS, \nand Education appropriations bill.\n  We have had a good working relationship together over the past 2 \nweeks. There is no question we couldn't have made the progress on the \nappropriations bills if we hadn't had diligent work on the Republican \nside and a lot of cooperation on the Democratic side including, \nspecifically, the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, and the whip and \nassistant leader, Harry Reid. All have done good work.\n  I worry now that we are into a situation where we have an amendment \nthat Members feel very strongly about, that is going to have dramatic \nimpact on business and industry in this country, which is germane, and \nthat we are being told we can't give you a time agreement, we are not \ngoing to give you a direct vote.\n  We have had direct votes over the past couple of weeks on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights issue, on hate crimes, on gun violence, on the \nCuba commission, on abortion issues, on education class size--even \nthough on some of the issues we would have preferred not to have voted \nor voted not on them with regard to that particular bill. It would also \ninclude, of course, the disclosure issue, which we think is a good \nissue, which should get voted on, but it was a problem being offered on \nthe Defense authorization bill.\n  We were able to work through that. We got a reasonable agreement. We \ngot a direct vote, and we moved on.\n  I have already talked with Senator Daschle. We are looking for a \nreasonable way to get this done. I hope we can find it because this is \none of the biggest and one of the most important bills the Senate will \nconsider this year. It is the funds for education, for the National \nInstitutes of Health, for the Departments of Health and Human Services \nand Labor.\n  I would hate for it to stop at this point. We can make progress this \nafternoon. We can make progress on Friday. We can make progress on \nMonday. We could be having votes. With a little focus, maybe we can \neven finish this bill by Tuesday night or Wednesday. That is what I \nwant to see happen, but we need to get it done and then go on to the \nInterior appropriations bill, a bill that also is very important and a \nbill, by the way, Senator Gorton has worked very hard to keep off \ncontroversial issues. The so-called rule XVI points will be objected \nto.\n  I urge Senator Reid and my friend, Senator Daschle, to think about \nthis. This is not the end of the trail, but we can have a vote on this \nimportant germane amendment, and then we can move on to other \namendments and get our work done. I know we will be working together in \nthe next few hours to see what we can come up with. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. We have been able to complete, under great difficulty, five \nappropriations bills. They have had hundreds of amendments. We have \nbeen able to finish those bills.\n  I suggest the best thing to do, as I think the leader has already \nsaid he is going to do, is move forward with the debate on this \namendment. There are tremendous feelings on both sides of the issue. \nPeople feel strongly about it. We should debate it for a while and see \nif something can be resolved. I hope, if we cannot do that, we might be \nable to move on to something else that needs to be completed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to support in the strongest \npossible way the Enzi-Bond amendment to the Labor-HHS appropriations \nbill relating to ergonomics. This amendment will save businesses, small \nbusinesses particularly, and other employers, and primarily their \nemployees, from the ravages of OSHA's regulatory impulses running \nrampant.\n  As many in this body know, I have questioned OSHA's approach to \nformulating an ergonomics regulation for several years. Last year, I \nintroduced a bill, which currently has 48 cosponsors, to force OSHA to \nwait for the results of the study that we and the President--and the \nPresident--directed the National Academy of Sciences to conduct on \nwhether there is sufficient scientific evidence to support this \nregulation.\n  This measure is known as the Sensible Ergonomics Scientific Evidence \nAct, or the SENSE Act. Sadly, this issue, as administered by OSHA, has \nbeen lacking in common sense in the years that OSHA has been working on \nit.\n  We were not able to move the SENSE Act last year, nor were we able to \nconvince OSHA they needed to put some common sense into their \nregulatory process before going forward with the proposed rule. At this \ntime last year, we were fearful of what OSHA might come up with because \nit did not look as if they were going about it in a reasonable, \nresponsible way. When the proposed rule was finally published in \nNovember and we found out what they wanted to do, it was worse than we \ncould have imagined.\n  It is tragic that OSHA and this administration have all but \ndisregarded the protections for the rulemaking process that are needed \nfor sound regulations. They moved at an unprecedented pace, and it \nlooked as if they were trying to get this regulation finalized before \nthey even left office.\n  This is a classic example of ready, fire, aim. OSHA needs to be told \nthey have gone too far and they must suspend the regulation so that it \ncan be redrafted and put into some reasonable, workable approach.\n  The Enzi-Bond amendment to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill must be \nadopted, and I urge my colleagues to strongly support it.\n  I have the honor of serving as chairman of the Small Business \nCommittee, and I have heard from literally thousands of small \nbusinesses and their representatives about the utter terror they face \nof having to comply with an impossible regulation that they cannot \nfigure out and they cannot implement.\n  Let me be clear, their fear is not that they will have to protect \ntheir employees or even that they will have to spend some money to \nachieve that goal--they are doing that already because they do not want \nto see their employees have repetitive motion injuries or ergonomic \ninjuries. They want to do what is right for their employees. In many \ncases, these employees in the smallest businesses are like family. They \ntreat them like family members because they work closely with them.\n  Instead, this fear, this terror is that they will be forced to figure \nout what this regulation means, what is expected of them, whether they \ncan satisfy the requirements, whether they will get any results from \nthe huge costs of this regulation, and whether they can convince an \nOSHA inspector they have satisfied a regulation which gives no clear \nguidelines.\n  In some cases, the alternative to complying with the regulation may \nbe to close the company or to move it to another country where they do \nnot have such regulations, or, which is also extremely sad, they may be \nrequired to get rid of employees and buy equipment and replace their \nemployees with equipment.\n\n[[Page S5630]]\n\n  None of these regulatory efforts has to do with assuring protection \nfor employees from repetitive motion injuries. The simple truth is, \nthere is nothing the regulation says that will protect employees. It \ndoes not do what OSHA would have us believe it does. It does not tell \nemployers how they can help their employees. On this basis alone, the \nproposed regulation fails and must be withdrawn.\n  OSHA likes to say this regulation is flexible. So is a bullwhip. What \nOSHA calls flexible is really a level of vagueness such that no \nemployer, no matter how well intentioned, would be able to tell what is \nrequired of them or if they have done enough. Let me give a couple \nexamples to help illustrate the degree of vagueness that permeates this \nproposal. These terms come directly from the language of the proposed \nrule:\n  Throughout the standard, employers are directed to implement \nprovisions and establish program elements ``promptly.''\n  In analyzing a ``problem job,'' employers are instructed to look for \nemployees ``exerting considerable physical effort to complete a \nmotion,'' or employees ``doing the same motion over and over again.''\n  Engineering controls are to be used ``where feasible.'' When \nimplementing the ``incremental abatement'' provisions, employers are to \n``implement controls that reduce MSD hazards to the extent feasible.''\n  For an employer to evaluate its ergonomics program, it is to \n``evaluate the elements of [its] program to ensure they are functioning \nproperly; and evaluate the program to ensure it is eliminating or \nmaterially reducing MSD hazards.''\n  Ergonomics risk factors are defined as: ``(i) force (i.e., forceful \nexertions, including dynamic motions); (ii) repetition; (iii) awkward \npostures; (iv) static postures; (v) contact stress; (vi) vibration; and \n(vii) cold temperatures.''\n  Anytime one lifts a garbage can outside in the winter, one probably \ngoes through all those.\n  To be effective, however, this regulation must tell employers when \ntheir employees will be injured, when an employee will have lifted too \nmuch, when the employee will have done too many repetitions, what an \nemployer can do to prevent injuries or to help an employee recover from \nan injury.\n\n  OSHA loves to say this proposal is supported by adequate science and \nmany studies. Unfortunately, none of these studies have answered these \ncritical questions, or at least OSHA has not bothered to include any of \nthat information in this proposed rule.\n  All other OSHA regulations provide a threshold of exposure to a risk \nbeyond which the employer must not let the employee be exposed without \nprotection or taking a corrective measure.\n  This proposal is unique in its complete absence of any thresholds. I \nguess that is what they mean by ``flexible.'' That bullwhip they use \ncan come down at any time and give them the full benefits of \nflexibility. There is not a single threshold.\n  OSHA is telling employers: We think you have a problem. We cannot \ndefine it. We cannot tell you how to fix it. But you have to go fix it. \nWe will hold you accountable for how well you fix it, even though we \ncannot tell you how to fix it.\n  This is absurd. It would be like driving down a highway where the \nsign said, ``Don't drive too fast,'' but not specifying what the speed \nlimit is. You would never know if you had gone too fast until the \nhighway patrolman pulled you over and told you whether you had gone too \nfast, according to that patrol person's view of what was ``too fast.''\n  This is no way to create an enforceable, workable, worker safety \nregulation in a country that prides itself on being a country governed \nby laws, not people.\n  This proposal is simply unenforceable as it is written. It amounts to \nnothing more than a regulatory trap which will result in more \ncitations, more fines, more litigation, more legal fees, more \nconfusion, and more problems without protecting a single worker or \nmaking a single workplace safer. It is a big bullwhip to threaten \nemployers without telling them how to avoid that which they seek to \nprevent.\n  Whatever other problems this regulation may cause for large \nemployers, the problems will be catastrophic for many small businesses. \nIt is impossible to overstate the complications and the burden this \nregulation could impose on small businesses. Small business owners \nsimply do not have the time, expertise, resources, staff, or \nunderstanding of the issue to deal with this regulation while still \nperforming all the other roles that are demanded of them as \nbusinesspeople as well as family members.\n  The same person who may handle sales, accounting, inventory, customer \nrelations, and environmental compliance may also be responsible for \nsafety compliance. With the vagueness of this proposal, the lack of a \nscientific consensus on what causes these injuries, the lack of a \nmedical consensus on what is an effective remedy, and the naturally \ncomplicated nature of this issue, the typical small business owners \nwill be so overwhelmed with this regulation, it will be a wonder if \nthey decide they can both comply with the regulation and stay in \nbusiness. Every hour they spend on this regulation--and despite OSHA's \nclaims, there will be many--is an hour they will not use to do \nsomething that will further increase their business or create more \njobs. For small business owners, time really is money. And if they are \nnot dealing with all these roles in their business, they are probably \ntrying to set aside a few hours a day to spend with their children and \nfamilies.\n  The Small Business Administration did an analysis of this proposed \nrule. One of the points they made is that small businesses are not just \nlarge businesses with fewer employees, they function in an entirely \ndifferent way. In addition to their lack of resources and staff, they \nmay also have a different cash-flow structure, which means that the \nfinancial burden of this regulation cannot be absorbed as easily.\n  In many small businesses, they are more dependent on financing for \ntheir operating capital, so the cost of implementing this regulation \nwill require the company to take on more debt, thus eroding further its \nopportunity to make a profit and grow and hire more employees.\n  Also, small businesses often exist as niche businesses to serve very \nspecial needs. They may not be able to pass costs along to their \ncustomer easily because the customer may be able to do without the \nniche product or be able to find it cheaper or more easily from a \nlarger source.\n  Small businesses are the engine of this great economic expansion we \nhave been enjoying recently. They are the ones that are creating the \njobs. They are the ones that are creating the opportunity and creating \nthe wealth for many families around this country. This rule will be \nsand that can cause this engine to seize up and stop dead in its \ntracks.\n  The Small Business Administration's study on this proposal found that \nOSHA underestimated the cost of this regulation by a factor of anywhere \nbetween 2 and 15 times. OSHA simply has no idea how much this \nregulation will cost businesses, and particularly small businesses. And \nbusinesses have no idea what they will get for the money they will be \nforced to spend.\n  Employers have no problem investing in safety to protect their \nemployees, but when you ask them to spend excessive amounts, with no \nguarantee of what they will get in return, they are going to object, \nand object strenuously.\n  This weekend, when I was in Missouri, I talked to small businesses, \nsmall businesses that are very much concerned about this. Do you know \nwhat they said to me? They said to me: Look, we don't want to see \nrepetitive motion injuries. We are very much concerned if one of our \nemployees comes up with carpal tunnel syndrome.\n  One small business owner said: I have hired two different safety \nengineers to come in and work with the employees and me to find out \nwhere there might be an injury, to help us develop ways of preventing \nthose injuries. We talk with and listen to our workers and say: What \nare we doing? What can we do differently?\n  He also said: I have paid a lot of money trying to find an answer. \nWherever we can find an answer, we implement it, because it doesn't \nmake any sense for me to lose good workers or to have them suffer the \nphysical pain, which is great, or to have the loss of income which can \ncome from one of\n\n[[Page S5631]]\n\nthese on-the-job injuries. And it certainly does my business no good to \nbe without a valued employee.\n  And he said: When we look at what OSHA is telling us, how come, if \nthey are so smart, they can't tell me what specific things I can do? \nWhat are the standards? I paid these safety engineers to come in and \nhelp me, and they have done everything they can. And OSHA doesn't even \ncome close. They are not even trying. They are just going to pull out \nthat big bullwhip and whack me across the back if there is something I \nmissed and something nobody understands can be done to prevent it.\n  Small businesses are such a vital part of the economy that, 5 years \nago this month, I introduced what we call the Red Tape Reduction Act, \nbut it is technically known as the Small Business Regulatory \nEnforcement Fairness Act, or SBREFA. This act was passed by the Senate \nwithout a dissenting vote and signed by the President in March of 1996.\n  Among other provisions, the Red Tape Reduction Act requires OSHA to \nconvene panels of small businesses to review regulations before they \nare proposed, at the time when their input can have the most impact.\n  OSHA convened their SBREFA panel for the ergonomics regulation in \nMarch 1999. It should be no surprise that the small businesses that \nreviewed this regulation thought it would be a nightmare to comply \nwith. Even those businesses that were generally in favor of doing \nsomething about an ergonomics regulation, because of the possible \nergonomics injuries and the pain they cause, believed that this \nproposal was seriously flawed and totally inadequate. In every category \nof question, the small businesses that reviewed this regulation found \nserious problems. The report was issued, and it contained many \ncriticisms and complaints about the proposal. I will mention a few of \nthem:\n\n       Many [small businesses] felt that OSHA's preliminary cost \n     estimates had underestimated costs.\n       Some [small businesses] felt that there may be substantial \n     costs for firms to understand the rule and to determine \n     whether they are covered by the rule, even for firms not \n     required to have a basic program and who have not had an MSD.\n       Many [small businesses] expressed doubt over their \n     capability to make either the initial determination about \n     whether they need an ergonomics program or to implement an \n     ergonomics program itself. Many [small businesses] felt that \n     they would need the assistance of consultants to set up an \n     ergonomics program and to assist them in their hazard \n     identification and control activities.\n       Almost all of the [small businesses] stated that they would \n     not be able to pass on the costs of an ergonomics program to \n     their customers. The ability to pass through costs may be \n     dependent on the level of domestic and foreign competition.\n       Many [small businesses] questioned OSHA's estimate that \n     consultants would not be necessary for any element of the \n     program except in 10% of those cases involving job fixes.\n       Many [small businesses] had difficulty understanding OSHA's \n     criteria for determining the work-relatedness of MSDs. Many \n     [small businesses] interpreted OSHA's criteria for \n     determining the work-relatedness of MSDs in such a way that, \n     in practice, the two criteria in addition to a recordable MSD \n     would be unworkable or ignored.\n       Some [small businesses] expressed concerns about how \n     certain terms and provisions of the draft rule would be \n     interpreted and enforced by OSHA compliance personnel. Many \n     [small businesses] found it difficult to apply the concepts \n     of feasibility, similar jobs and manual handling, as these \n     are defined in the draft rule.\n       Many [small businesses] . . . were concerned about \n     perceived overlaps between State workers' compensation laws \n     and the draft standards' medical removal protection \n     requirements.\n       Some [small businesses] suggested that employers' increased \n     concern about MSDs could create additional incentives for \n     employers to discriminate against individuals who may be \n     members of protected classes of employees based on the \n     perceived likelihood that such workers would have more MSDs \n     than other workers.\n       Many [small businesses] suggested that non-regulatory \n     guidance would be preferable to a rule.\n       Some [small businesses] recommended that OSHA delay the \n     ergonomics rule until the completion of the National Academy \n     of Sciences study that is now underway.\n\n  Mr. President, those are some of the comments the small business \npanels offered when they looked at this atrocity. You would think with \nall these concerns and recommendations, OSHA would have made major \nchanges to the proposed rule to take into account, as they were \nsupposed to, the legitimate concerns of small business. Unfortunately, \nthat was not the case. The changes that were made were merely cosmetic, \nnot substantive, and did not address any of these issues raised by the \nsmall businesses. In fact, OSHA made so few changes to the draft that \nwhen thousands complained about the short comment period after it was \npublished in November, OSHA claimed the fact that it had been released \nto the panel qualified as giving interested parties sufficient time to \nhelp them develop their comments. OSHA ignored the concerns raised by \nsmall businesses that gave up their time to participate in this process \nin the hopes of helping OSHA fashion a reasonable and responsible, \nbetter regulation.\n  They didn't want to know. They didn't pay attention. This is \nprecisely what the Red Tape Reduction Act was meant to stop, when a \nFederal agency says: Ready, fire; we will worry about the aim later, \nand they didn't care about what aim they took. They didn't care about \nlistening to the small businesses. This is a clear-cut example of abuse \nof the law that is designed to protect small businesses from excessive \noverreaching and inappropriate Federal regulation.\n  Unfortunately, this has been a consistent pattern of OSHA during the \ndevelopment of this regulation. There have been numerous stakeholder \nmeetings and meetings with concerned businesses where OSHA received \nvaluable guidance and suggestions that would have led to a better \nregulation. OSHA has not been willing to work with anyone from the \nemployer community who would have to deal with this regulatory \nmonstrosity. They have pursued their vision of this rule with a myopic \ntunnel vision that has shut out any and all recommendations that could \nmake this regulation palatable and workable. The intransigence of OSHA \nin this rulemaking has been positively staggering. Unfortunately, this \nregulation threatens not only to stagger but to take the breath out of \nsmall businesses in the United States.\n  OSHA would have us believe that they must move forward because of the \nlevels of musculoskeletal disorders occurring among employees. In fact, \nas employers have focused on MSDs, the numbers have been steadily \ndeclining, since 1994, by a total of 24 percent. These injuries now \nmake up only 4 percent of all workplace injuries and illnesses. This \nprogress has come about without an ergonomics regulation.\n  There is more that needs to be done, yes. We need to continue to work \nto find ways to reduce these painful and harmful injuries that cost \ntime and pain to employees and deprive employers and small businesses \nof their ability to turn out product or a service and make a profit. \nBusinesses are willing to consider what makes sense for their employees \nwhen there is a solution available.\n  I told you the story of one small business owner with whom I talked \nthis week in Missouri. I have held conferences. At the National Women's \nSmall Business Conference I held in Kansas City, they talked about \nproblems facing women small business owners. They have problems with \nprocurement. They have problems with access to capital. They are scared \nto death of what can happen to their businesses because they don't want \nto see their employees have MSDs or musculoskeletal disorders, injuries \nfrom repetitive motions.\n\n  They told me they are working on ways to minimize them and eliminate \nthem, but this regulation gives them no help in moving forward in their \nefforts, which they intend to continue, which are voluntary, which are \neffective, unlike this rule. There is no help for them in this \nregulation, just a bull whip, if something goes wrong.\n  This regulation does not provide a solution or any guidance that \nwould be helpful to employers. If OSHA were smart, they would take a \nlook at what is happening and get out of the way, or offer constructive \nassistance, help figure out ways to prevent these injuries. OSHA is \ntrying not to reinvent the wheel but telling the wheel which way to go \nwithout giving it any guidance.\n  OSHA will claim they have made changes in response to the concerns of \nthe businesses. They will point to the grandfather clause they \nincluded. That is truly a laugh. The only problem is the grandfather \nclause is worthless.\n\n[[Page S5632]]\n\nNot a single company in the country which currently has an ergonomics \nprogram could qualify for it. OSHA's grandfather clause requires a \ncompany to put OSHA's program in place so they can be relieved of \nhaving to comply with the OSHA program. That sounds absurd. It doesn't \nmake any sense, but that is what they require. They said: If you will \nput into place this OSHA program, whatever it is--and nobody knows what \nit is--then you will have complied with the grandfather clause. But to \nour knowledge--and OSHA hasn't told us of any--nobody has one in place \nthat meets the impossible and unworkable and unknowable standards of \nthis rule and regulation. Grandfather? That looks like some other kind \nof relative, not often seen at a family picnic when you apply it to \nthis clause.\n  OSHA's pursuit of this regulation has been so single minded, they \nhave cut corners with the rulemaking process. Under the proposed \nregulation, an employer's obligation to implement the full ergonomics \nprogram is triggered when an employee has an OSHA-recordable MSD \ninjury. OSHA's definition of a recordable MSD injury is one where \n``exposure to work caused, contributed to the MSD, or aggravated a pre-\nexisting MSD.'' An employee could actually have an injury caused \nentirely by nonwork-related factors. This regulation would require the \nemployer to implement a full-blown ergonomics program if the employee's \njob requires them to do something as simple as standing, which \naggravates the injury.\n  I have had an ergonomic injury trying to pull up carpet tacks in a \nnew house. I spent a weekend pulling up carpet tacks. I could not move \nmy arm the next day. I went into work. I couldn't use the typewriter, \neven a pen, but I knew what caused that: pulling up the carpet tacks \nand ripping up the rug.\n  Under this rule, if I had gone in and told the employer, darn, I \ncan't use the typewriter, I can't pick up a pencil today, I can't lift \nthe law books, under this definition, that would have been a recordable \nMSD injury for my employer.\n  That would not have made him happy. What is even more remarkable \nabout this regulation is that the language comes directly from OSHA's \n1996 proposal to revise the recordkeeping standard which has not yet \nbeen finalized. OSHA is actually trying to finalize their proposed \nrecordkeeping standard by inserting that language in the ergonomics \nproposal. That is an outrage and a clear violation of the principles of \nfairness and disclosure that underlie the rulemaking process that must \nbe and should be subject to challenge under SBREFA and the appropriate \nprocedures and actions.\n  The fact that OSHA has taken liberties with the rulemaking process is \nhardly new. Most of us remember in January when OSHA tried to impose on \nemployers the obligation to check the homes of employees who \ntelecommute for safety hazards. OSHA was attempting to do this through \na letter of interpretation in response to a legitimate inquiry from an \nemployer. The outcry over this move was so loud and so bipartisan that \nthe Secretary of Labor herself had to withdraw that crazy idea the next \nday.\n  One of the reasons OSHA's attempts blew up in their face so badly was \nbecause of this ergonomics regulation. Employers immediately realized \nthat if they were responsible for safety hazards in an employee's home, \nthe ergonomics regulation would require them to intrude into their \nemployees' private lives far too deeply. The regulation already expects \nemployers to be responsible for injuries that are not caused by \nworkplace exposures. If employers were to be responsible for safety \nissues at home, there would be no limit to what they would have to \ncover. Employers would never be able to control the exposure to \nergonomic risk factors in the home, or distinguish which risks were \npart of work activities and which risks were part of everyday life like \npicking up their children.\n  This is the most expensive, complicated, expansive, burdensome, and \ndestructive regulation that OSHA has ever proposed. That is no small \ntitle to achieve. When you are dealing with OSHA, that is a high stump \nto jump. But they have done it on this one. Indeed, it could be one of \nthe most burdensome regulations ever proposed by the Federal \nGovernment. OSHA is pursuing this regulation with no concern for the \nimpact it would have on employers, or the fact that employees will lose \ntheir jobs because of this regulation.\n  I call on my colleagues to pass the Enzi-Bond amendment to the Labor-\nHHS appropriations bill to stop OSHA from finalizing this horribly \nflawed regulation and force them to reconsider their approach and \nlisten to the scientific evidence and to the people who are making \ntheir best efforts, successful in part already today, to reduce \nergonomics injuries. To vote against this amendment is to say that an \nagency can promulgate a regulation without providing an adequate \nscientific foundation, and they can impose a crushing burden that would \ndrive small businesses out of business and deprive employees of their \njobs without considering the impact. That must not be the case.\n  I strongly urge and beseech my colleagues to support this amendment \nand put a stop to a terribly bad idea before OSHA takes the bull whip \nto small businesses throughout this country.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor.\n  Mr. REID. It is a cloture motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will examine the motion.\n  The Senator has a right to send a cloture motion to the desk without \nhaving the floor.\n  The cloture motion having been presented under rule XXII, the Chair \ndirects the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the motion to \n     commit H.R. 4577 to the Appropriations Committee with \n     instructions to report back forthwith with the amendment No. \n     3598:\n         Jeff Bingaman, Richard Bryan, Daniel Akaka, Joe Biden, \n           Richard Durbin, Bob Graham, Barbara Boxer, Byron \n           Dorgan, Max Cleland, Thomas Daschle, Daniel Inouye, \n           Harry Reid, Paul Wellstone, Joseph Lieberman, Charles \n           Robb, John Rockefeller.\n\n  Mr. REID. I express my appreciation to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri still has the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share some thoughts on \nthe OSHA regulations, these ergonomic regulations.\n  First, I want to say that it is a worthy goal to improve safety and \nhealth in the workplace, but we ought to look at it carefully and we \nought to, as a representative body of the people, look at the \ndemocratic aspect of this process and be prepared to examine these \nregulations before we authorize them to go forward and make sure they \nmeet a scientific standard, and in addition to the extraordinary costs \nwe know they will cause, we need to know that they will actually \nimprove safety and health in the workplace.\n  Last year, before OSHA published its proposed ergonomic rules, \nSenator Bond introduced a bill, which I supported, prohibiting OSHA \nfrom publishing its final ergonomics standard until the National \nAcademy of Sciences completes a congressionally mandated peer-review of \nall the scientific literature concerning ergonomics.\n  Unfortunately, a minority number of Senators in this body were able \nto block its consideration. This year, I am pleased to join with \nSenator Enzi, who has tenaciously and effectively pointed out the \nproblems with this rule and why it ought to be delayed.\n  I just believe that we have to remember that experts have \ncharacterized this legislation as ``the costliest government job \nmandate since the founding of the United States.'' That is a matter \nthat should give us all pause.\n  I believe it is important to base whatever regulations we have on \nsound science, and I don't believe that OSHA has done so. This is an \nimportant issue. I am going to talk about three cases in recent years \nin which OSHA has been found not to have based its regulations\n\n[[Page S5633]]\n\non sound science or justifiable procedures. I do that because a lot of \npeople think, well, if OSHA says it, it must be good. Somehow they are \nblessed with ``all-knowing wisdom.'' But you have already heard from \nSenators who pointed out a number of things that OSHA has done that are \ncertainly not justifiable. It is not what I say to you today, but what \nthe courts have said about this that is important.\n  Certainly, it is important to provide a safe environment. Ergonomics, \nthough, are based upon decisions and recommendations made by \nergonomists and/or engineers, and not physicians, and their medical \ntheories have proven to be controversial.\n  OSHA has attempted to apply ergonomics in three legal cases that they \nlitigated to judgment. In each instance, OSHA suffered major losses. \nThese cases demonstrate the vast uncertainty surrounding these \nregulations and the science OSHA claims supports their implementation. \nEven the ``experts'' on ergonomics at OSHA admit there is a great deal \nof uncertainty in these regulations.\n  OSHA has litigated these claims under the ``general duty'' clause of \nthe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. This clause provides a \ngeneral obligation on every business in America, all employers, to \nprotect workers from ``recognized hazards'' of ``death or serious \nphysical harm'' and functions as a catchall under which OSHA frequently \nattempts to expand its regulatory power.\n  One important aspect in the cases I will discuss is that OSHA had the \nburden of identifying hazardous job conditions. In the cases I am \ntalking about, OSHA had to prove these were hazardous job conditions, \nand they have to show how they would be corrected. In the rule we are \ndebating, the burden will be put on the employers to make these \ndecisions. We are going to find out that OSHA could not do it. Yet they \nare going to demand that every employer in America--many of them small \nbusinesses--are to meet these kinds of standards.\n  No. 1, in the 1995 case, Secretary of Labor v. Beverly Enterprises, \nOSHA sought to prevent nursing home employees from lifting up residents \nin order to care for them and move them about the room. OSHA would have \npreferred carting the elderly residents about with mechanical hoists.\n  In a 31-day trial before a Federal administrative law judge, OSHA \npresented four expert witnesses, each with a Ph.D. in this field. These \nwere some of the leading ergonomics theorists in the Nation, some of \nwhich had done extensive research on the practice of lifting in nursing \nhomes.\n  The federal administrative law judge concluded ``There is no reliable \nepidemiological evidence establishing lifting as a cause of low back \npain. Science has not been successful in showing when and under what \ncircumstances lifting presents a significant risk of harm, none of the \nexperts could say with reasonable medical certainty that any injury \nclaimed by Beverly employees was caused by their job tasks.''\n  With all of the resources of the federal government, including \nnumerous experts, the Department of Labor and OSHA were not able to \nfulfill their obligation to ``define the hazard in such a way as to \nadvise Beverly of its obligations and identify the conditions and \npractices over which Beverly may exercise control so as to reduce or \neliminate the hazard.'' That is a direct quote from the judge. If a \nfederal agency is unsuccessful, how are employers expected to meet this \nburden under the ergonomics rule.\n  The courts have also spoken in regards to the ``flawed'' science that \nis the basis for this proposed ergonomics rule. In the 1998 case \nSecretary of Labor v. Dayton Tire, OSHA launched an attack on 22 \ndifferent manufacturing jobs in a single tire-manufacturing plant.\n  This is yet another case of the federal agency utilizing their large \nfinancial and personnel resources to prove their case. OSHA assigned \nthree compliance personnel to a six-month inspection and investigation \nof the facility. At trial before the administrative law judge it called \nmore than three dozen witnesses, including 31 employees, 4 doctors from \nthe facility, 3 OSHA investigators, and 2 experts.\n  Thousands of man hours were spent in preparation for the trial, \nstudying the jobs they claimed caused the injuries. The trial lasted 6 \nmonths, even though the company only called one witness.\n  The OSHA witnesses had extensive experience with ergonomics, with one \nhaving spent the last six years as an analyst for OSHA whose ``primary \njob'' was conducting ergonomic analysis.\n  OSHA's medical expert in the case was a university professor who was \ncertified as an expert in ergonomics, who with the assistance of three \nother faculty members and six residents, had conducted extensive \nanalysis of the medical records of the Dayton Tire employees who \nallegedly suffered from musculosketetal disorders. The Professor \nconfessed during the trial that ``if he had been the treating \nphysician, he would not have felt comfortable making a diagnosis of the \nconditions, nature and cause'' of those injuries.\n  This uncertainty is quite alarming coming from a man with expertise \nin the area. The fact that he conceded that his study did no more than \n``present a red flag that something may be wrong'' at the plant \nconcerned the judge.\n  The judge ruled and held that this method was ``not trustworthy'', \n``scientifically valid'', or ``scientifically reliable'', stating that \n``Conjectures that are probably wrong are of little use''.\n  Ultimately, the judge concluded that the expert's analysis ``failed \nto meet the minimal requirements for evidentiary reliability \nestablished in Daubert v. Merrel Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the 1993 \nSupreme Court decision that requires judges to exclude ``expert'' \ntestimony that uses scientifically invalid methodology or reasoning. \nThis standard is generally referred to as the ``junk science'' \nstandard.''\n  This testimony was rejected as not even valid testimony under the \n``junk science'' doctrine. That is what OSHA was relying on in that \ncase.\n  The fact that OSHA characterized the methods of their experts in the \nDayton Tire as ``widely used and generally accepted'' among ergonomics \nexperts, clearly shows that when scrutinized the science that is the \nbasis of this ergonomics standard is fundamentally flawed.\n  In the 1997, Pepperidge Farm case, OSHA had its only opportunity to \nhave an ergonomics case decided by the full Occupational Safety and \nHealth Review Commission.\n  The risks that OSHA identified in the case were ``capping'' cookies--\nemployees lifted the top of a sandwich cookie from one assembly line \nand placed it on top of the bottom of the cookie on another assembly \nline in a repetitious fashion.\n  To abate these conditions, OSHA ordered the company to increase its \nstaff, slow assembly line speeds, increase rest periods, or simply \nautomate the entire operation.\n  Automation means job loss. People complain that when we automate we \nare losing jobs. One reason that is happening is these kinds of \nregulations that drive up the costs; and to make it more economic for a \ncompany to avoid these kinds of lawsuits and Federal complaints, they \ncould just go on and create some new form of a machine that could do \nthe work without people.\n  While the commission did accept some of the major premises of \nergonomics, such as repetitive workplace motions causing worker \ninjuries--I am sure under the circumstances that can happen; I would \nnot dispute that--the commission ruled that OSHA failed to show that \nits proposed ergonomics measures were appropriate means of reducing \nmusculoskeletal disorders purportedly caused by the worksites.\n  The Commission found that some ergonomic measures had been \nimplemented by the company and that the additional measures proposed by \nthe agency's expert ergonomists were not shown to be feasible and \neffective.\n  The decision is particularly damaging because OSHA had enlisted \nenormous resources and leading experts to show what the company should \nhave done to avoid worker injury. Yet OSHA and its experts could not \nprove in open court what works, again raising the question of how \nbusinesses can make such determinations when OSHA can't.\n  In these three cases OSHA deployed hundreds of experts and millions \nof dollars to target what they considered to be particularly hazardous \nworksites.\n\n[[Page S5634]]\n\nBut because of the flawed science the agency could not determine what \nif anything was wrong, or how to correct it. And the courts rejected \ntheir view. This is why business is concerned.\n  Some think just because they have the name OSHA, that they do \neverything right. They have been knocked down time and again by the \ncourts. Businesses do not understand and do not have confidence that \nthe 300 pages of these proposed regulations are going to apply fairly, \nand they do not believe it is scientifically based. I can understand \ntheir concerns. Employers should not be held to a standard that has \nconsistently alluded the agency that seeks to regulate them.\n  I believe we should pass Senator Enzi's amendment and delay the \nergonomics standards until the uncertainties regarding the science and \nimplementation of this can be further explored. I don't know the \nanswer. OSHA has, through these three cases, established that they \ndon't have the answers either. Why don't we allow the National Academy \nof Sciences' study to be completed? Why don't we get opinions of the \nphysicians and medical experts who can understand these issues before \nwe rush to force these regulations into play?\n  That is what we should do. That is why I believe the amendment by \nSenator Enzi is the proper amendment.\n  Let's get the scientific basis before we act.\n  I thank the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senators on my side of the aisle \nwho have spoken on the ergonomics amendment and the detrimental method \nby which OSHA is trying to force the standard through.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Domenici be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank Senator Hutchinson for his great delivery on the \nway the rulemaking process works and the way it has been forced in this \ninstance. I thank Senator Bond not only for the speech he gave on the \nfloor a while ago but for his continued interest and knowledge on the \nissue of ergonomics and his particular concern for the small \nbusinessman and how this rule and former ``rumored'' rules would affect \nthem.\n  This is the furthest a standard has ever gotten on ergonomics. It has \nnow been published. It is the first one to be published. Now people \nhave an opportunity to see how harmful or damaging it can be.\n  I am the chairman of the subcommittee on workplace safety and \ntraining. I have worked a number of OSHA issues since I have been here. \nI have always tried to be reasonable on the issues on which I have \nworked. I appreciate comments from the other side of the aisle about \nthe way I have worked with the other people.\n  I need to let everybody know what is happening. There are the votes \nto pass my amendment, so there is a filibuster to keep it from ever \ncoming to a vote. There are people who would prefer not to vote on this \nmeasure at all. If they are listening to the debate, they should be \ninterested in making sure that the rules get the full amount of time \nneeded to decide properly whether that will provide the workplace \nsafety about which we have been talking.\n  I offered an amendment, and there was a motion to commit. Some may \nnot know what a motion to commit is, using another bill. It sends it \nback to committee to put in a completely different provision from \nergonomics. There was an insistence it be read in full. It took only an \nhour and a half out of our day. That is Senate procedure.\n  Now we have an amendment on the bill again that brings us back to the \nergonomics amendment. It is essential we get a vote on this ergonomics \namendment. It is essential the Senators get an opportunity to say \nwhether they think OSHA has been rushing a bad product. You will see a \nvery conclusive vote on that when it comes to a vote.\n  This is a vote about how your Government, more specifically your \nbureaucracy, operates. This is not about safety necessarily, because if \nit was about safety, there are some other approaches OSHA would take. \nOSHA is not necessarily a safety organization. It is about fines, not \nnecessarily prevention.\n  One of the things that has come up since I have been working on the \nOSHA issues is an explanation of how much injuries have increased since \nwe passed the OSHA Act. I decided I would go back another 30 years \nbefore the OSHA Act and see what has been happening with injuries in \nthis country. Do my colleagues know what I discovered? Injuries were \ndecreasing at the same rate since 30 years before we thought of OSHA.\n  Do my colleagues know why that is? It is because businesses are \nconcerned about their people. They are concerned about them. If they do \nnot have a worker there, they are not getting the work done that they \nexpect that person to do. Injuries cost money. Injuries are difficult \nto work with.\n  When we were doing the hearing on the work restriction protection--\nthat is the part where workers comp will supersede State workers comp \non the Federal level, which is poorly designed, very inadequate, and \nthere is no money to do it--during that hearing, we received testimony \nfrom Under Secretary Jeffress. I was pleased to read his testimony. \nWitnesses get a short time before the committee to present testimony. \nDuring the course of that, I will read the rest of the testimony so I \nknow what they intended to say if they could have said everything they \nwanted to say.\n  I ran into a paragraph about New Balance shoe manufacturing \nfacilities. That caught my eye because for years my wife and I ran a \nshoe store in Gillette and in a couple of other places. New Balance was \none of the shoes we sold. I was very pleased they make narrow shoes. It \nis a very good tennis manufacturing company.\n  In the statement, it said this New Balance shoe manufacturing company \ncut their workers compensation costs from $1.2 million to $89,000 a \nyear and reduced their lost and restricted days from 11,000 to 549 \nduring a 3-year period.\n  I asked Secretary Jeffress how much they had to fine this company to \nget them to do that fantastic work. They did not have to fine them. Of \ncourse not. Can you imagine the economics of reducing your cost from \n$1.2 million to $89,000 a year? That is good business. It also saves \nemployees.\n  There are other examples of companies that have reduced their \ninjuries dramatically. I said if OSHA was not there to fine them, how \nwould that possibly have happened? Again, companies, for the most part, \nare extremely concerned about their employees. In fact, when the \nranking member of our subcommittee spoke earlier, he mentioned that in \nhis State of Minnesota, GM and 3M, and some other companies I did not \nget written down, are reducing their injuries dramatically. What I \nwould like for him to do is to call those companies and see if they \nthink this standard is essential to continue to do that.\n\n  The answer will be a resounding no, this will cost them a lot of \nmoney which will be diverted from the things they are already doing.\n  I wonder how many people know that ergonomic injuries, according to \nDepartment of Labor statistics, have gone down 24 percent since 1994. \nImagine that. This rule was not in place. This rule is just proposed. \nYet American business reduced ergonomic injuries 24 percent. There were \nno fines, no penalties, no standard, no rule, just concern for their \nemployees. It is pretty amazing.\n  Can you imagine what those businesses would be able to do if OSHA saw \nas their mission preventing injuries--not fining, I did not say \nfining--preventing injuries and focused their efforts on helping \nbusinesses, particularly the small businesses for which Senator Bond \nexpressed deep concern, the people who do not have all of the experts \non board to make the best care possible? If the focus of OSHA helped \nthose small businesses figure out what they could do differently, I bet \nwe could get that decline rate up to about 50 percent, but it takes \nsome experts helping out, not total concentration on a phony rulemaking \nprocedure.\n  Oh, did I say ``phony''? I am sorry, but not very sorry because when \nI explain how this rulemaking procedure is working this year, everybody \nin this Chamber might agree that it is a phony process.\n  OSHA is paying witnesses to testify. They are not paying expenses, \nthey are\n\n[[Page S5635]]\n\npaying them to testify. They are not just paying them to testify, they \nare even telling them other things they ought to say, ways they can \nbeef up their testimony. If it is a $10,000 expert, don't you think he \ncould write his own testimony? I do.\n  OK, a $10,000 expert, and then they have them come and do a mock \nhearing. An expert needs a mock hearing? I do not think the whole \n$10,000 goes to the testimony, because from some documents I have been \nable to look at, it appears to me $2,000 of that is really supposed to \nbe to tear apart any testimony in opposition OSHA gets. They are paying \npeople to tear other public testimony apart. Does that sound like \nsomething your Government ought to be doing? That is how badly OSHA \nwants this rule.\n  It was mentioned this morning that this is a proposed rule. Of \ncourse, it is a proposed rule. There is a process that it is supposed \nto go through, and it is not supposed to just take a year. That would \nbe a record for OSHA even when they are doing much simpler rules. This \nis a very complicated one, a very expensive one, time consuming, and a \ndamaging one. They are going to force it in a year. Every indication I \nfind says they can do it unless we adopt this amendment. Is that why we \nare getting so much opposition through a filibuster to adopting this \namendment?\n  Yes, this is about your Government, specifically your bureaucracy. \nThis is about how your Government can control the business you work for \nwithout getting anything for the employee in return.\n  We heard some stories this morning about working people's lives, and \nwe are concerned about those working people's lives. I was in small \nbusiness, and when you work with people in small business, it is not a \nboss-employee relationship. If you cannot get along better than that, \nyou probably will not have them as employees.\n  We had some examples of a few people, and there are many throughout \nthe United States, who are being injured through repetitive motion. I \nam asking all of the businesses that deal with that to concentrate on \neliminating the repetitive motion. I am asking OSHA to work with those \nbusinesses in finding ways to eliminate the repetitive motion.\n\n  Earlier we mentioned home office inspections, and everybody got up in \nan uproar saying that was already taken care of. Yes, this same \ndepartment that we are talking about as proposing this rule--the same \none--said that they had the right to go into homes and inspect. That \nraised a lot of interest, a lot of concern, and in about 48 hours--48 \nhours after we discovered it, not 48 hours after it was done--they \ndiscovered how terrible that was and they reversed it.\n  I really think if they think about the process that we are going \nthrough here, they would give some very serious consideration to \nreversing what is going on right now: Forcing a rule through, not \ngiving any indication that any changes would be made, and part of that \ncomes from this paying of witnesses.\n  Another issue we are dealing with around here is one about China, \nPNTR. I am getting a lot of letters on it. I am sure everybody here is. \nHalf of those letters are talking about the way jobs are going to go \noverseas.\n  I am part of the NATO Parliament. I went to the last session of that. \nWe talked about the way the Parliament changes. I was on the economic \ndevelopment committee for that. We talked about the ways that some of \nthese other countries are having economic development. I saw some \nexamples of how they were having economic development.\n  I saw a factory where people work for extremely long hours, every \nday, in complete body outfits, where only their eyes are visible. Their \neyes are visible because they look into microscopes all day and weld on \nhard disc drives. It is an extremely tedious, repetitive motion. Those \npeople get $350 a month. It should not happen.\n  But when we pass rules, by forcing rules through that greatly \nincreases business costs, without protecting the worker at all, we are \nexporting jobs. The unions ought to be up in arms about this rule and \nwhat it will do in exporting American jobs. It concerns me. I hope it \nconcerns everyone.\n  A lot of these things are interconnected. But the issue we are \ntalking about here isn't as much what the rule is as it is the way it \nhas been pursued.\n  I have asked questions to get information about how the process is \nworking. I did not get the information. I found out the House had the \ninformation. I requested the ability to see it. I was told it could not \nbe brought to my office. The House had fortunately made an arrangement \nby which I could look at it. But the arrangement did not say, ``in my \noffice,'' so I had to go over there. But I was willing to do that. I \nwas astounded at what I found when I got over there and figured out why \nit was they wanted me to go to every last bit of effort to look at it \nthat I possibly could.\n  I have shared some of that with you. I would have liked to have \nshared it with you in more detail, but the agreement they had for me to \neven look at it said there was privilege in this that keeps a Senator, \nin an appropriations process, from being able to see the documents he \nneeds to be able to see to know how the money is being spent so he can \nmake decisions about how it will be spent in the future. I think that \nis unbelievable and it is just not right.\n  We have had some testimony in committee. We found out how OSHA \ngathers its testimony. We have found out how the whole process works. \nThat is why I have asked everybody to vote against this.\n\n\n                              Quorum Call\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I could go into more examples of what has \nbeen happening. I could counter some of the things that have been said, \nbut at this point I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. ENZI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk resumed the call of the roll and the following \nSenators entered the Chamber and answered to their names.\n\n                             [Quorum No. 6]\n\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Gorton\n     Harkin\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Lott\n     Reid\n     Smith (OR)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

With the addition of Senators voting who did \nnot answer the quorum call, a quorum is now present.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in a moment I will put in another quorum \ncall. I thought we should go ahead and conclude that vote. We have come \nup with a procedure that I think is fair which will allow the Senate to \ngo forward on the two issues that are now pending before the Senate. We \nare working on both sides of the aisle to make sure Senators are aware \nof what we are proposing. If we are able to get that agreement, there \nwould be a couple of votes stacked in an hour or so. If we cannot get \nit agreed to, then there will be a vote here in the next 15 minutes.\n  I am sorry I cannot give a more certain answer right now. We hope to \nhave some agreement in the next few minutes. We will then put in that \nunanimous consent request and proceed to have some debate agreed to and \nthe two votes, or go straight to the point of order on the pending \nmotion.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nmotion to commit be withdrawn and amendment No. 3594 be withdrawn and \nthe Enzi amendment No. 3593 be laid aside. I further ask consent that \nthe Robb amendment to the instructions be drafted and offered as a \nfirst-degree amendment to the bill.\n  I further ask consent that there be 1 hour for debate equally divided \non both issues to run concurrently, and that at the conclusion of the \ntime, the Senate proceed to vote on the Enzi amendment No. 3593, to be \nfollowed by a vote on the prescription drug amendment, without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I assume \nthat the majority leader is referring here to an up-or-down vote in \nboth cases.\n  Mr. LOTT. Absolutely. That was the understanding that was reached.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Right.\n  Mr. LOTT. Some on both sides had reservations about that, but that \nwas the only way we could bring it to a conclusion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion to commit and the amendment (No. 3594) were withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just so we can have an understanding of \nthis, on our side the time with regard to the Enzi amendment on \nergonomics would be controlled by the Senator from Wyoming, and the \ntime on our side against the Robb amendment would be controlled by \nSenator Roth.\n  I presume Senator Robb would have the time on your side, I say to \nSenator Daschle. Who do you wish to control the time on the other \nissue?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I designate Senator Robb as our manager \non the Robb amendment and in control of the time. The manager in \nopposition to the Enzi amendment will be the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe we are ready to proceed with the debate. I yield \nthe floor.\n\n\n                   Modification To Amendment No. 3598\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the Robb amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Amendment No. 3598 previously proposed by the Senator from \n     Virginia [Mr. Robb], as modified.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Pursuant to the previous order, the modification to the amendment is \nas follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill add the following:\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes of the 15 minutes \nthat are allocated to the affirmative position on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, for the benefit of our colleagues, I would like to \nsummarize this amendment as succinctly as I can. It is a bipartisan \nbill that would guarantee access to a comprehensive, meaningful \nprescription drug benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries. Unlike other \ndrug proposals, our bill would guarantee total coverage for seniors, \nwithout any limits or gaps.\n  Let me say, however, to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nthat this benefit is not some ``big government'' solution to the \nMedicare prescription drug problem. In putting this proposal together, \nour bipartisan group opted to rely on private sector, market-based \nmechanisms to deliver medications to seniors. Competition and choice \nare at the very essence of our bill. For those who suggest that we need \nto take a centrist approach, I say that this bill is that logical \nbipartisan compromise. And we need to act on it now.\n  Mr. President, today is June 22. With the Senate deep into the \nappropriations process, we have very few legislative days left in this \nsession. If we are going to get a prescription drug bill to the \nPresident's desk, we need to consider one now.\n  Mr. President, I've spoken previously today about the stories I heard \nin a series of health care fora held in my state over the past month. \nIn one of them, I spoke to a physician who was prescribing the drug \nTamoxofin for women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and who \nwere Medicare eligible. One woman was sharing her prescription with two \nother women who simply could not afford it--a travesty by any health \ncare standards. I've heard many other stories of similar magnitude.\n  Prescription drugs are clearly a part of modern medicine today. They \nare a necessity, not a luxury. I ask that our colleagues respond \naffirmatively to this chance to provide modern medicine to those who \nare eligible for Medicare.\n  I reserve any time not used.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the so-called Robb amendment, \nnot because I necessarily oppose its terms but because it affects, in \nan adverse manner, the possibility of getting legislation on \nprescription drugs enacted this year.\n  Prescription drugs is a matter before the Finance Committee. It is \nundoubtedly the most important domestic legislation that will be \nconsidered this year. Nothing will happen if we permit this legislation \nto become partisan. We do not need a Democratic bill. We do not need a \nRepublican bill. We need legislation that represents a bipartisan \nconsensus on both sides of the aisle.\n  We have worked very hard in the committee to develop the kind of \ninformation that is essential to design a bill that will meet the needs \nof the American people. We have spent something like 15 days on \nhearings, bringing before us experts as to what we should do to, \nfrankly, modernize our Medicare legislation.\n  The last 2 weeks have been spent in meeting with Republicans and \nDemocrats alike on the various proposals that have been made both by \nRepublicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate.\n  We just completed that process this afternoon. I am very happy to say \nthat I think the end results of these meetings give us a good chance to \ndevelop a bill that can be supported by both Republicans and Democrats.\n  I know there are people who want to make this a partisan issue. I \nknow there are people who want to have a Republican issue on this \nmatter, and the same is true on the Democratic side. But I say that \nthis matter is too important--too important to our senior citizens--to \ntry to rush it through in a political way rather than working together.\n  During our hearings, we had representatives of the AARP and other \nadvocate groups. The one message they gave that came through loud and \nclear was: Do not rush something through.\n\n[[Page S5637]]\n\nMake sure that whatever you do will meet the needs of the American \npeople. They urged, time and again, that it is essential that we act \nwith care.\n  Let me point out, to those who want to have a vote all of a sudden on \na piece of legislation that has not been studied, that in 1987, the \nCongress voted for--and it was signed into law--catastrophic \nlegislation. That was passed in 1987. In 1988, it was revoked because \nthe legislation did not do what the people thought it would do. We must \nnot make that mistake again.\n  It is critically important that as we move ahead, we move ahead with \ncare and understanding. Let me say, I understand full well the \nimportance of this legislation and want to get it done. But it does not \nhelp the process or the development of a good piece of legislation if \nit is handled in a partisan way.\n  This bill was only introduced 2 days ago on June 20. The text of the \nbill has not even been printed in the Congressional Record. Are we \ngoing to act on that today without an understanding of what it includes \nand what it means?\n  It is estimated this legislation would cost, over 10 years, something \nlike $200 to $300 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield myself 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. In 5 years, it is estimated it would cost something like \n$75 billion. Under the budget resolution, we are allowed to spend $20 \nbillion in 5 years, if we have no reform. If we have reform, our \nprogram can consume up to $40 billion. This piece of legislation would \ncost something like $75 billion. The last thing we need to do is move \nahead on legislation that would put our Medicare program at greater \nrisk. Its solvency is already estimated to last only until 2025. In \nadopting what will be admittedly an expensive new program, we want to \nmake sure that it is fiscally sound.\n  I urge and hope my friends on both sides of the aisle will reject \nthis legislation and give the Finance Committee, which has \njurisdiction, the opportunity to develop a bill that will serve the \nneeds of our senior generation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Bryan.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from Virginia \nin offering a Medicare drug program.\n  For the 223,000 Nevadans who are Medicare recipients, no legislation \nwe will debate in this Congress is more important for them. Two-thirds \nof them have either no prescription drug coverage at all or inadequate \ncoverage--this at a time when prescription drug prices are increasing \nat a rate of nearly 20 percent a year.\n  I will talk about what this measure will do. First, it provides \nguaranteed and universal access to prescription drugs. Unlike some of \nthe other proposals being debated, this benefit will actually be \navailable because it is offered as an integral part of the Medicare \nprogram. Second--and this is important--the benefit is comprehensive \nand defined, simple. It is understandable. Beneficiaries understand \nwhat the coverage is, and it will not change from year to year or month \nto month. Moreover, this is the only proposal to offer complete \ncoverage after the deductible. There are no gaps or limits. The bottom \nline: All seniors will be guaranteed access to affordable drugs and \nwill have the peace of mind knowing that full coverage is provided for \nany and all expenses above $4,000. Any expenses for prescription \nmedication above $4,000 are completely handled under this program. \nThird, this benefit is affordable for all beneficiaries. Those with the \nlowest incomes are provided the most assistance.\n  Finally, and critically, this proposal maximizes competition and \nprovides choices. All of us who have been privileged to serve on the \nFinance Committee and to study this issue recognize the element of \ncompetition and choice as being an essential reform. This is not a one-\nsize-fits-all program. Multiple private businesses are used to \nadminister and deliver the benefit so there is competition at two \nlevels: first, in terms of who are being chosen to provide the benefit \nand, second, those who are chosen compete and try to sign up \nbeneficiaries for that program. So there is both competition and \nchoice.\n  In sum, this amendment gives beneficiaries what they need most--long \noverdue coverage of prescription drugs--and it also injects competition \ninto the program and provides choices for beneficiaries. It is the \nfirst proposal to offer universal, guaranteed, affordable, fully-\ndefined comprehensive coverage, no limits, no gaps, no gimmicks. This \nproposal is for real. Beneficiaries will know what they are getting, \nand they will know without a doubt that the benefit will actually be \nprovided.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the proposal of the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia. The time to act is now.\n  I yield the remainder of my unused time to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, does the Senator from Delaware or anyone \nopposing this particular bill wish to speak at this time?\n  Mr. ROTH. The Senator from Virginia may proceed.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Graham.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I commend our colleague, Senator Robb, for \nthe outstanding leadership he is providing on this critical issue. On \nMonday, Senator Robb and I visited the Archbishop McCarthy Residences \nin Opa-Locka, FL. There I met an elderly lady who had this story to \ntell. She had purposefully joined an HMO in order to be able to get \naccess to pharmaceutical coverage.\n  Two months ago, the HMO announced it was dropping all pharmaceutical \ncoverage. This was the first month in which the impact of that was felt \nby this elderly American. What did it do to her? She has five medically \nnecessary prescriptions. She had to decide to forgo three of those five \nbecause she could not afford them. The two she thought she could not \nomit cost her $168 a month out of her very limited income.\n  This is not a theoretical or conceptual issue. This is a real life-\nand-blood issue for millions of Americans.\n  It has become an issue, in part, because of our successes. When \nSocial Security was established in the mid-1930s, the average American \nhad a life expectancy after 65 of 7 years. Today, the average American \nhas a life expectancy after 65 of 17 years. According to the Census \nBureau, 100 years from today, the average American will have a life \nexpectancy of 27 years after they reach 65.\n  Those numbers have fundamentally changed what constitutes effective, \nhumane health care. It has meant that we need to be making an \ninvestment in prevention. If a person is only going to live a few years \nafter retirement, one could argue, why spend the money on prevention. \nBut if a person is going to live 17 or 27 years, that is a big share of \ntheir life.\n  In addition, because of that extended life, there is more emphasis on \ncare for people who have chronic conditions that have to be managed for \nmany years. Both of those, prevention and chronic care, necessitate \naccess to prescription drugs. That is what this plan will do.\n  The year 2000, the beginning of the 21st century, will mark the year \nin which older Americans will no longer have to make the choice that \nthe woman in Opa-Locka did, to drop three of her medically necessary \nprescriptions and then end up paying a very high part of her meager \nincome to buy the two drugs she could not avoid.\n  I congratulate our colleague for bringing this amendment forth. I \nurge all of our colleagues to see this as a kind of opportunity and \npass the Robb amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is simply wrong that many of our \nnation's seniors who live on fixed incomes must choose between medicine \nand food. Our seniors should not be forced to drive over the border to \nCanada to purchase affordable prescription drugs.\n  As I have said many times over, we must work together to develop an \ninitiative for helping America's seniors\n\n[[Page S5638]]\n\nobtain the prescription medication they so desperately need without \nforcing them to chose between groceries and vital medicines. Each of us \nmust put aside partisan politics and work together to help our nation's \nseniors--many of whom are skipping or ignoring their medical needs \nbecause of the exorbitant prices they must pay for medication.\n  But I can not support the proposal before the Senate this evening. I \ncan not support using parliamentary procedures and political posturing \nto force a vote on a proposal that has not been available for extensive \nreview, analysis and input--particularly from our constituents and the \nvery seniors we are trying to help. That is simply wrong.\n  Congress must take great pains to ensure that a Medicare prescription \ndrug plan does not repeat the mistakes of Medicare Catastrophic \nlegislation in the late 1980's. Medicare Catastrophic made broad, \nexpensive reforms in the Medicare system which seniors saw as \nexcessive, unnecessary and unviable. To truly help seniors obtain \nprescription drugs we need to take the time to engage in a thorough \ndebate carefully scrutinizing and vetting the proposal. We must be \nconscious of what America's seniors want and need, and balance that \nwith fiscal restraint and responsibility. We must find a method for \nhelping our nation's seniors have access to prescription drugs that \ndoes not place an unfair and unexpected burden upon them or the \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I respectfully request that my remarks be included in \nthe Record with the debate regarding this amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, let me take just a brief moment to \nexplain to my colleagues why they should join me in opposing the Robb \namendment.\n  I am going to vote against this amendment because this amendment \nwould stall a very important bill, the Labor, Health and Human Services \nAppropriations bill, and send it back to go through the process again. \nI have been meeting on a bipartisan basis in the Finance Committee, \nworking in good faith, to come to an agreement to provide prescription \ndrugs through Medicare. I am disappointed that my colleagues have \ndecided to throw bipartisanship aside and offer this politically \nmotivated amendment. The fact is, Mr. President, I got this amendment \nonly a few minutes ago, and it has not even been printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  I have always been very clear that I support a prescription drug \nbenefit for Medicare beneficiaries, and I have several well drafted \nbills that would help seniors with their drug costs now. I have been \nworking on a bipartisan basis to address the issue of coverage for \nseniors as well as the issue of the inequity of international pricing \ndisparities for prescription drugs.\n  It is very difficult to understand this amendment because it is \nactually missing several pages, but from what I can tell, this bill has \nserious problems that need to be addressed. First, this amendment is \ndrafted in such a way that would threaten the solvency of a Medicare \nprogram that is already in financial trouble. This proposal contains no \nreforms that would make the program more efficient, and in fact could \ncost as much as $300 billion over 10 years--far more than has been set \naside in the Budget. The fact is, this amendment has not been \nconsidered by any Committee, and has only been considered for 30 \nminutes on this floor. In short, Mr. President, this is no way to pass \nlandmark legislation that will affect all of our senior citizens.\n  For these and other reasons that I do not have time to list, I will \njoin a bipartisan group of Senators in voting against this ill-advised \nprocedure and against a politically motivated amendment that will keep \nus from accomplishing a real, bipartisan prescription drug benefit that \nwill help our seniors right now. It is my intent to vote on a real \nprescription drug benefit that will benefit all seniors, and to \ncomplete legislation this year that will address the inequity of \ninternational pricing disparities.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, how much time remains on the side of the \nproponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 6 minutes. The \nSenator from Massachusetts has 15 minutes. The Senator from Delaware \nhas 11 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am concerned about the need for \nprescription drug assistance to needy seniors. I have traveled all \nacross my State and, frankly, I think there are many seniors in need of \nsome stop-loss protection. Those without coverage want to be able to \nbuy drugs at discounted prices like those with coverage can because \nthey are part of a group. This measure brought before us today \nliterally takes longer to read than we have allowed for debate in the \nSenate on it. My staff hasn't been able to get a copy of it, which \ndoesn't provide us with an intelligent and responsible way of making \ndecisions here.\n  I think there are some good concepts here. I like the concept of \nstop-loss protection. In talking to people in my State, they want that. \nThey want some sort of copay for people, but they want this to be \navailable for people at all income levels. We spend a lot of time here \nin the Senate trying to make it possible for people to make good \ndecisions by mandating that there be plain language, or that there be \ntime for people to read things, or time for people to consider things \nin making contracts or otherwise entering into agreements. Yet we are \nbeing asked today, without any strong, valid, and reliable estimation \nas to cost, without an opportunity to actually see what is being \nproposed, to make a commitment, or instruct the Congress to commit to \nthe expenditure of funds that might invade the Social Security surplus, \nwhich might well impair the capacity of this Government to meet its \nother obligations. It is not responsible. It is not the way we ought to \ndo business.\n  So while I very much appreciate the effort, and I believe that we \nought to find ways to help needy seniors to get access to prescription \ndrugs, which can frequently keep them out of the hospital and help them \nremain independent and can save what would be hospital costs under \nMedicare, I think it is reasonable that we would have an opportunity to \nread the legislation, an opportunity to know something about an \naccurate estimate of its cost.\n  So I have to say that I don't think we should pass that which we \nhaven't read, or that which is not available for our inspection. For \nthat reason, regrettably, I announce that I will have to vote against \nthis legislation. I think its intention is good, and I think many of \nits proposals appear to be in line with what the people would want and \nexpect but without having an opportunity to read it and inspect it, to \nunderstand it and understand its cost, I think it is unwise for us to \nvote in its favor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas, Mrs. Lincoln.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I, too, commend my colleague from \nVirginia, Senator Robb, for his wonderful leadership on this issue. My \ncolleagues have already spoken eloquently about the need for \nprescription drug coverage among seniors and, certainly, the basic \ncomponents of this amendment. I won't reiterate what they have said. \nWe, as a body, must make this a priority, and we have not. I think this \namendment is timely because the House is scheduled to act on it today. \nIt is quickly becoming a crisis issue for many seniors in the country \ntoday, and that is why I am here as a supporter of a bipartisan plan in \nthe Senate.\n  As a Senator who represents the State with the highest poverty rate \namong seniors, I am committed to seeing that the Senate act this year \nto implement a prescription drug plan. With all due respect to the \nchairman's comments in terms of timeliness and what must go through \ncommittee, the bottom line is that we are running out of time to do \nsomething on this issue.\n  This plan will provide immediate, affordable, and comprehensive drug \ncoverage to seniors who often have to make the choice between buying \nfood to eat or buying the prescription drugs they need. I want to \nemphasize the importance of the Medicare outpatient drug plan to rural \nseniors. In particular, this plan helps all seniors, particularly those \nwho are low-income and living in rural areas. This is important because \nlow-income and rural seniors\n\n[[Page S5639]]\n\nare less likely to have adequate prescription drug coverage. \nNationally, rural seniors are 60 percent more likely not to be able to \nbuy needed prescription drugs due to their high cost. A greater \nproportion of rural elderly spend a large percentage of their income on \nprescription drugs. Rural beneficiaries need adequate coverage because \nthey are more likely to have poor health and lower income than seniors \nliving in urban areas. In Arkansas, 60 percent of the State's seniors \nlive in rural areas.\n\n  This is a good prescription drug proposal. It is a fiscally sound \nproposal that offers free coverage to our Nation's poorest seniors and \nreasonable benefits to those who can better afford to pay for some of \ntheir benefits. Our seniors deserve to enjoy healthier, longer lives \nwithout having to worry about affording the medicine they need. The \nSenate must act this year and this is an excellent time to do it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in a short time, we are going to have two \nvotes that will define the difference in values between the two \npolitical parties in this Chamber. For 2 or 3 years now, President \nClinton has been calling for a prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare. During that period of time, the Republicans were in control \nof the House of Representatives and the Senate, and a bill never came \nto the floor to deal with this issue, which is paramount in the minds \nof families across America. On the Democratic side, we have asked, from \nday 1, for a chance to bring the President's proposal or our own \nproposal to the floor. The only way this vote came about this evening \non a prescription drug benefit under Medicare is because we had to tie \nthis Chamber into procedural knots to achieve this vote.\n  Well, I commend the Republicans who are supporting this bipartisan \nmeasure, and I hope many of them will cross the aisle and join us in a \nbipartisan show of support for a prescription drug benefit. For those \nwho think they can vote against this prescription drug benefit and go \nhome and explain that it was such a new idea and they didn't have a \nchance to read it, I can tell them the President has had a proposal \nhere for years. This idea has been out here for years. You have been in \ncontrol of the committees and in control of the Senate. We have waited \nfor your prescription drug benefit, but there is nothing for us to \nconsider from the Republican side. The vote that we will cast in a few \nminutes will give Republicans and Democrats alike a chance to go on the \nrecord for a good prescription drug benefit bill under Medicare.\n  The second vote we will cast also defines the values of the parties. \nTo think that each year over 600,000 workers in America get up and go \nto work and do their very best in the workplace and get injured because \nof these so-called musculoskeletal disorders, and they don't have the \nkind of protection they deserve from their Government. This is a call \nto action in this Chamber--a call to action that was heard by Elizabeth \nDole when she was Secretary of Labor. She said we needed a standard, a \ncall to action, which has been heard over and over again from working \nfamilies across America.\n  The Republican position is to turn a deaf ear to these workers, \nignore the fact that they are facing debilitating injuries and \ndisorders in the workplace, which haunt them for the rest of their \nnatural lives. It is the position of the Republican Party to stop this \neffort to bring safety to the workplace. This is nothing new. There has \nnot been a single time in America's history when we have come forward \nwith protection for workers that business interests didn't stand up and \ntry to block it. Whether we are talking about child labor laws, safety \nin the workplace, time and time again, they have said it is too much \nGovernment, too much meddling, it will cost too much.\n  Well, I think the value on human life and the value on safety in the \nworkplace is not too high a price to pay. We have an opportunity today \nto pass a prescription drug benefit that will truly help the seniors \nand the disabled, an opportunity to stand up for millions of workers \nacross America who expect us to be sensitive to their needs. In my \nexperience in life, years ago, I had one of those assembly line jobs. I \nsaw injuries in the workplace. I saw people taken out of the workplace, \ndown to the doctors office, and off the job for weeks at a time for \ninjuries.\n  Perhaps there are some in the Chamber who have never seen that. But \nit is a memory that will be with you for a lifetime. Those workers--men \nand women--and their families expect us to stand up for safety in the \nworkplace. That is our obligation. The response from the Republican \nside is, let's postpone this at least another year, and in another year \nthere will be another 600,000 injured American workers. That is \nunacceptable.\n  The vote we will cast on these two issues really defines the values \nof our parties.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman of Finance \nCommittee for yielding me time to make a couple of brief comments on \nthe issue that is before the Senate.\n  Let me suggest, first of all, that the issue in the Congress is not \nwhether or not this Congress should be for providing prescription drugs \nunder the Medicare program to seniors. There is no difference in that. \nI don't know of any Member of Congress to whom I have talked--either in \nthe House or in the Senate--who is opposed to saying to the Nation's 39 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries that they should be covered for \nprescription drugs. That is a given. The question is not whether they \nshould be covered; the question is, How are we going to do it?\n  I suggest that this is a baby who is not ready yet to be born. What \ndo I mean by that? What I mean is that we are taking 30 minutes to \ndebate an attempt to pass a prescription drug proposal on which a \nnational Medicare bipartisan commission spent a year and a half \nworking. We are, in 30 minutes, trying to pass a bill which has never \ncome through the appropriate committee of jurisdiction--the Finance \nCommittee.\n  We have had 14 days of bipartisan hearings on this issue. This \nafternoon, in a bipartisan fashion in the Senate Finance Committee \nmeeting room, we sat and discussed this same issue--this identical \nissue--on how to construct a Medicare prescription drug plan that can \nwork. We met additionally another time this week on the same subject.\n  It is not the proper process to yank that work product out of the \nresponsible committee and say we are going to have 15 minutes on this \nside to debate a new entitlement program being added to a Medicare \nprogram which is in danger of default. It is in danger of going \nbankrupt. And yet we are going to add a new entitlement program with 15 \nminutes of debate on this side, and 15 minutes of debate on that side, \nand say we have done what is right and proper for the Medicare \nbeneficiaries of this country? I suggest that is not the right way to \ndo it.\n  I commend Senator Chuck Robb, who is a member of our Finance \nCommittee, and Senator Bob Graham, who has spent a great deal of time \ncrafting this amendment. This may be the right way to go, but it is not \nyet ready to get there. We need more analysis. We need to consider if \nyou can do it through an insurance program.\n  Finally, I think it is incredibly important that, whatever we do, we \ndo not just add an entitlement program without doing some real basic \nreform to the Medicare program.\n  We have a Medicare+Choice Program under Medicare right now. Does \nanyone in this body think it is working correctly? It is being \nmicromanaged by HCFA with 4,000 employees, and it is a disaster. We \nshould not be looking backward and doing things the old way. We are \nmoving into the 21st century. We should not be acting as if it is the \n19th century. We should be crafting new ways of solving these problems, \nand not going back to policies that have failed.\n  Medicare was a wonderful program in 1965. But it is frozen in the \n1990s. The challenge we have is not to debate a political issue, but to \ncome together to find a way to solve the problem.\n  There are interesting ideas that are being discussed by the Senator \nfrom Florida, by the Senator from Virginia,\n\n[[Page S5640]]\n\nby myself, and others on the Democratic side, working with Members on \nthe Republican side to come up with something that is creative. Are we \nnot capable of thinking outside of the old style box of just adding \nanother entitlement program to the Medicare program without reforming \nanything? I suggest we should not make that mistake.\n\n  If we want to put ourselves on the Record on prescription drugs, why \nnot pass a Senate concurrent resolution that says, yes, we all think it \nis important that prescription drugs today are as important as a \nhospital bed was in the 1960s, and have a resolution that says that and \nsays we are going to work in a bipartisan fashion to work out an \nagreement instead of debating an issue. I suggest that what we have is \na very narrow opportunity to do that.\n  We are not going to be able to reform the whole program in the 30 \ndays left in this session in a Presidential election year. That is not \ngoing to happen. But if we do prescription drugs, should we not do some \nreform attached to it? I think the suggestion and the answer is \nabsolutely yes. Let the Finance Committee do our work, and bring \nsomething to the floor that is doable and passable. I suggest it is the \nright way to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I just want to make a \ncouple of points.\n  No. 1, prescription drugs, I believe--I say this not only as a \nSenator but also as a physician who has personally taken care of \nthousands and thousands of Medicare patients--that prescription drugs \nabsolutely must be a part of our Medicare program and system if we are \ngoing to really provide health care security for our seniors.\n  The challenge we have is that, indeed, prescription drugs replace the \nsurgeon's knife--which I have used my entire adult life--and replace \nthe hospital bed, which are important dynamics of health care.\n  But the real challenge we have is including that new additional \nbenefit--which, traditionally, over the last several years has been 17 \nto 18 percent a year--into a rigid, inflexible, outdated Medicare \nprogram that we have not been able to reform.\n  The challenge before this Congress is to very thoughtfully \nincorporate prescription drugs coupled with true Medicare reform, to \nbring it up to date, to modernize it in a way that we can truly \nguarantee health care security to our seniors.\n  This particular amendment has not gone through the committee process. \nI can tell you that I for one, having spent the last 7 hours working on \nhealth care in an adjacent room off this Chamber, have never seen this \nparticular amendment nor had the opportunity to read this particular \namendment. So I absolutely am going to oppose this particular \namendment, which is brought to the floor outside of the committee \nprocess and outside of my having had the opportunity even to read the \namendment.\n\n  I have been working on prescription drugs with my colleagues in a \nbipartisan fashion for the last 2 years. I was on the national \nbipartisan Medicare commission, where we talked about prescription \ndrugs. There are other proposals being debated in the House.\n  We have not had the opportunity to see this particular amendment. It \nhas not gone through committee. It should not be introduced tonight, I \nbelieve, and hopefully it will be defeated tonight.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 seconds, and then I will \nyield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I remind my good friends on the other side of the aisle that this \nbill was read in its entirety earlier today, and it has been available \nfor several days. But it has been debated for a very long period of \ntime, and the concept has been debated at length and discussed at \nlength.\n  There was an attempt to put together a prescription drug bill in the \nHouse. The Health Insurance Association of America has stated many \ntimes that the particular proposal from the House simply will not work.\n  At this time, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer and the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  This is really a moral issue, and the question is, Are we going to do \nit? We keep putting it off. We keep talking about it. We keep saying, \nlet's have a commission, let's do a resolution, let's study it some \nmore, let's make the process work perfectly.\n  I spent most of the afternoon in the Finance Committee trying to work \nout a resolution on this. Frankly, at the end, there was some hope. But \nthere was also some discussion about what happens if we don't get to \nvote on prescription drugs. There was a discussion of that.\n  I don't want to see that happen. This will probably be our only vote \non prescription drugs in this entire session. It is a bipartisan bill. \nI have made some compromises. Others have made compromises. It is a \nsolid bill. It is probably the only vote we will have on it.\n  It is a moral issue, not a political issue, a moral issue that \nseniors don't have prescription drugs under Medicare. They ought to. \nJohn Breaux is right: Prescription drugs are like a bed in a hospital \nin 1965; now we are going to modernize it, it is available for all.\n  It is an amendment we should pass. It is a moral, not a political, \nissue. This will probably be the only vote on prescription drugs we \nwill have in this session of the Senate.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to support the Enzi amendment \nand to oppose the ergonomics rule that has been proposed by the \nDepartment of Labor. This is the rule: hundreds of pages long.\n  Senator Durbin said a few minutes ago this vote will be about values. \nI will accept that challenge. It is demagoguery to say because we \noppose this rule we are not for safety in the workplace. I don't think \nanybody sincerely believes that on the other side. I am for a safe and \nhealthy workplace. If we want to talk about values, I hope Members will \nread this and realize what we are imposing on the businesses on this \ncountry. There are going to be workers who lose their jobs because of \nthis rule. There will be small businesses that are going to go bankrupt \nbecause of this rule, if it is not stopped.\n  My colleagues, I am opposed to the ergonomics rules for three \nreasons: It is based upon uncertain science, at best. This body funded \nalmost a $1 million study by the National Academy of Sciences, which is \nnot yet complete. Why do we fund a study by the NAS and then allow OSHA \nto move forward with the rule before we have the scientific basis for \nthe rule? The Enzi amendment simply says let's hold off and wait until \nthe science is in.\n  CRS says there is great uncertainty about what OSHA has proposed. Not \nonly is there uncertain science, there is uncertain cost. While OSHA \nsays it is a $4 billion cost, the Small Business Administration says \nthe cost will be 15 times what OSHA says it will be. I am inclined to \nbelieve the estimates of the Small Business Administration. Private \ngroups believe the cost will be many times beyond that. But we know \nthat it will be very expensive. There is uncertain cost involved.\n\n  Third, I oppose this rule because of its uncertain impact. It is 600 \npages with many unintended consequences. Many times we allow things to \ngo on in these agencies in which there are unintended consequences, but \nwe know that the OSH Act says that OSHA is not to impact workers \ncompensation laws in the States. This will most assuredly do that.\n  As Senator Enzi has rightly pointed out, it is going to negatively \nimpact Medicare, health care dependent upon capped Federal \nreimbursement. They will have to absorb the costs of the ergonomics \nwith no way to recapture those costs.\n  We also know that OSHA has proudly said they have already used their \ngeneral duty clause with over 500 citations on ergonomics. They are not \nhelpless to protect workers in the workplace now. We should not allow \nthem to move forward with an ill-advised rule.\n  The issue is not safety. The issue is not OSHA doing their job. The \nissue is\n\n[[Page S5641]]\n\nwhether we will do our job and whether we will stop an agency that is \nunresponsive, arrogant, and out of control. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Enzi amendment.\n  I retain the remainder of the 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in my State of Iowa, Sioux City, seniors \nregularly take bus trips to Mexico to get their drugs. Drugs that cost \n$68 in Sioux City are $7 in Mexico. Seniors in Waterloo, IA, are being \nbussed to Canada to buy their drugs. Seniors in Cedar Rapids, IA, are \nbeing forced to declare bankruptcy because they have run up their \ncredit care debt so high just to pay for the drugs they need. Mr. \nPresident, $5,000 to $6,000 a year is being paid out of pocket by \nseniors who cannot afford it and are being forced into bankruptcy.\n  We are told this is not the time to do this, that we have to wait \nlonger, that this baby is not ready to be born. The elderly have waited \nlong enough, and they have been gouged deep enough, too deep, to pay \nfor their prescription drugs. Now is the time to stand up for the \nseniors in our country and to vote aye on the Robb motion.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have \ndocuments printed in the Record to respond to some of the accusations \nregarding the Labor Department.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    OSHA's Use of Contractors During the Rulemaking Process: Expert \n                   Witnesses and Consultant Services\n\n       OSHA's use of expert witnesses and consultants is \n     authorized by Congress, approved by the Courts, affirmed by \n     the General Accounting Office, and consistent with OSHA's \n     past practice for over two decades, as well as that of other \n     agencies.\n       1. OSHA's Use of Expert Witnesses and Consultants is \n     Expressly Authorized by Congress.\n       In 1970, Congress passed, and President Nixon signed into \n     law, the Occupational Safety and Health Act (``OSH Act'' or \n     ``The Act'') which expressly authorized OSHA to hire experts \n     and consultants and to compensate them for their service. See \n     29 U.S.C. sec. 651 et seq. Specifically, Section 7(c)(2) of \n     the Act, 29 U.S.C. sec. 656(c)(2) states:\n       ``In carrying out his responsibilities under this Act, the \n     Secretary is authorized to--(2) employ experts and \n     consultants or organizations thereof as authorized by Section \n     3109 of Title 5, United States Code, except that contracts \n     for such employment may be renewed annually; compensate \n     individuals so employed at rates not in excess of the rate \n     specified at the time of service for grade GS-18 under \n     section 5332 of Title 5, United States Code including travel \n     time . . .'' (emphasis added).\n       In addition to the Secretary's specific statutory \n     authorization to hire experts for purposes of administering \n     the OSH Act, Congress authorized the Department of Labor to \n     employ consultants through procurement contracts in the \n     Labor/HHS Appropriations bill (Pub. L. 102-394; 106 Stat. \n     1792, 1825).\n       2. OSHA's Use of Expert Witnesses and Consultants Has Been \n     Affirmed by the Courts.\n       In 1980, the Lead industry made virtually the same \n     challenge to OSHA's use of expert witnesses and consultants \n     in a rulemaking that the opponents of the ergonomics rule are \n     making now. See United Steelworkers of America et al. v. \n     Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189 (D.C. Cir. 1980). In reviewing \n     this challenge, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia recognized that OSHA is empowered to \n     employ experts as part of the rulemaking process. The \n     Court concluded that OSHA properly used its contracted \n     experts and consultants for the following tasks: writing \n     the preamble, on-the-record reports, testimony and \n     posthearing reports. The Court stated that ``The OSHA Act \n     empowers the agency to employ expert consultants . . . and \n     OSHA might have possessed that power even without express \n     statutory authority . . .'' Id. at 1217.\n       The Court found no problems with OSHA's contracting for the \n     services of experts and consultants in the rulemaking \n     process. Id. In fact, the Court stated that ``we generally \n     see no reason to force agencies to hire enormous regular \n     staffs versed in all conceivable technological issues, rather \n     than use their appropriations to hire specific consultants \n     for specific problems.'' Id.\n       In fact, the Court praised agencies' use of experts and \n     consultants as proof that the agencies have taken their \n     statutory missions seriously. Id.\n       3. OSHA's Use of Expert Witnesses and Consultants is \n     Authorized by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.\n       The Federal Acquisition Regulation (``FAR''), Office of \n     Management and Budget Circular No. A-76 and the Federal \n     Activities Inventory Reform Act also authorize agencies to \n     contract for certain functions, including:\n       ``Services that involve or relate to analysis, feasibility \n     studies, and strategy options to be used by agency personnel \n     in developing policy;\n       ``Services which involve or relate to development of \n     regulations; and\n       ``Contractors providing legal advice and interpretation of \n     regulations and statutes to federal officials.''\n       OFFP Policy Letter 92-1, Appendix B numbers 3, 4, and 18; \n     see FAR sec. 7.503(d)(4).\n       4. Experts on OSHA's Rulemaking Processes Recognize OSHA's \n     Use of Expert Witnesses and Consultants in Rulemakings.\n       It is traditional practice for OSHA to hire expert \n     witnesses to testify at its rulemaking hearings. Both of the \n     principal treatises on OSHA law, OSHA, History, Law and \n     Policy, by Benjamin W. Mintz, and Occupational Safety and \n     Health Law, edited by Stephen A. Bokat and Horace A. Thompson \n     III for the American Bar Association, refer to this practice, \n     which goes back at least to 1980, when OSHA arranged for 46 \n     well-known experts to testify on behalf of OSHA's \n     Carcinogens Policy.\n       ABA's ``Guide to Federal Agency Rulemaking'' addresses the \n     use of expert witnesses in OSHA rulemakings, and describes \n     the use of consultants as ``summarizing and evaluating data \n     in the record, and helping draft portions of the final rule \n     and its rationale.'' (Page 243)\n       5. The General Accounting Office Reviewed OSHA's Use of \n     Expert Witnesses and Contractors in an Earlier Rulemaking.\n       In 1989, at the request of a House Subcommittee, GAO \n     examined OSHA's use of contractors and expert witnesses and \n     found that OSHA had used ``over 35 expert witnesses'' in the \n     years 1986-1988, paying them generally ``$10,000 or less,'' \n     and using them to testify during OSHA public hearings on \n     proposed standards and rules. The report said OSHA used its \n     contractors to assist in developing final rules and that they \n     contributed to 36 different rules over three years.\n       6. OSHA has Historically Used Experts to Testify at Public \n     Hearings About Parts of Proposed Rules Which Fall Within \n     Their Areas of Expertise.\n       Among the other OSHA hearings at which experts have been \n     used by are: Lead (1980); Hazard Communications (1983); \n     Ethylene Oxide (1984); a revised asbestos standard (1986); \n     Benzene (1987); and Methylene Chloride (1977).\n       The number of OSHA experts has varied from as few as one in \n     the Excavation in Construction standard to 46 experts in the \n     Carcinogens Policy hearing. Twenty-eight experts will have \n     testified on OSHA's behalf at the conclusion of the \n     ergonomics hearings.\n       7. Other Federal Agencies Use Expert Witnesses and \n     Consultants in Ways Similar to OSHA.\n       EPA, FDA, and DOT make extensive use of consultants in \n     their rulemaking activities, though they do not have hybrid \n     hearings like OSHA's, in which OSHA permits the public to \n     cross-examine their witnesses. EPA's use of consultants has \n     been challenged and upheld by the courts, BASF Wyandotte v. \n     Costle, 598 F2d 637 (1st Cir 1979); Weyerhauser v. Costle, \n     590 F3d 1011 (DC Cir 1978). In the BASF Wyndotte case, the \n     Court found no fault in EPA's use of a private contractor \n     which ``invested 16,500 man hours'' in a rule making process.\n       OSHA's rulemaking process is more open than other agencies \n     because the public can cross examine OSHA's expert witnesses \n     in public hearings. Most other agencies engage experts to \n     submit written testimony on a rule, but these experts do \n     not participate in public hearings and are not available \n     for cross examination as OSHA's expert witnesses are.\n       8. OSHA's Use of Expert Witnesses and Consultants Was \n     Disclosed to the Public and Was Clearly Known to Parties Who \n     Cross-Examined OSHA's Experts at Public Hearings.\n       All of OSHA's expert witnesses appeared on a witness list \n     provided by OSHA under the heading ``OSHA Witnesses.''\n       It is clear that the parties who cross-examined OSHA's \n     experts in the ergonomics hearings were aware that OSHA's \n     experts were paid consultants.\n       When Mr. Sparlin questioned OSHA expert Mr. Oxenburgh, he \n     referenced the ``Expert Witness Contract for Dr. Maurice \n     Oxenburgh.'' (pp. 2637-39).\n       When Ms. Holmes of Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue made a \n     statement regarding her ability to cross-examine OSHA's panel \n     of experts, she referred to OSHA's ``obviously having \n     commissioned written testimony from all these individuals.'' \n     (p. 1440).\n       In questioning Dr. Beale, one of OSHA's attorneys, Ann \n     Rosenthal, clarified for the public record that Dr. Beale was \n     hired as an economist, not as an enforcement expert. (p. \n     2524). Dr. Beale's own written testimony stated that his \n     ``clients in this regulatory work have included OSHA, MSHA, \n     EPA, SBA, the FAA, the Department of Energy, and the IRS.'' \n     (Ex. 37-22).\n       All of this material is part of the public docket and is \n     available on OSHA's webpage.\n       9. OSHA's Expert Witnesses Have No Financial Conflict of \n     Interest in the Outcome of the Ergonomics Rulemaking.\n       Conflict of interest laws and regulations apply only to \n     employees of the federal government. In some instances, \n     agencies hire\n\n[[Page S5642]]\n\n     consultants as ``Special Government Employees'' who are \n     subject to certain provisions of the conflict of interest \n     laws. However, the consultants hired by OSHA for the \n     ergonomics standard were contractors and did not have federal \n     employee status while providing their services. As such, they \n     do not come within the coverage of the conflict of interest \n     laws or regulations.\n\n\n                           access to document\n\n       1. OSHA recognizes the importance of Members of Congress \n     understanding the rulemaking process. That is why we work so \n     hard to provide information to Members of Congress as \n     expeditiously as possible. For example, in response to a \n     request from the House Government Reform Committee dated May \n     10, 2000, OSHA promptly provided a list of contractors who \n     worked on the current ergonomics rulemaking.\n       2. Once the House Committee expressed an interest in \n     reviewing other documents, OSHA worked with the House to \n     provide them with full and complete access to the documents \n     on a timely basis. The House Committee agreed to treat these \n     documents the same way OSHA does, and in a manner that \n     protects the integrity of an ongoing rulemaking.\n       3. Senator Enzi made his first request for information only \n     nine days ago (June 13, 2000). Immediaately following his \n     request, OSHA Assistant Secretary Jeffress talked with \n     Senator Enzi twice about his request for documents. \n     Department of Labor staff and Senator Enzi's staff also \n     talked to figure out how to most expeditiously respond to his \n     request and at the same time protect the integrity of an open \n     and ongoing rulemaking by treating the documents exactly the \n     same way that the House had already agreed to treat them.\n       4. Senator Enzi claimed that OSHA failed to provide him \n     with any information, but just three days after his original \n     request, on June 16, 2000, OSHA responded to Senator Enzi's \n     request and produced two boxes full of documents.\n       5. OSHA offered to meet with Senator Enzi and offered \n     repeatedly to brief Senator Enzi about OSHA's use of expert \n     witnesses in rulemakings.\n       6. On Tuesday, June 20, 2000, Senator Enzi's staff \n     requested, for the first time, access to the materials \n     provided to the House Committee. Under the terms of OSHA's \n     agreement with the House Committee, Senator Enzi always had \n     access to the documents he requested to see.\n       7. In order to accommodate the Senator's desire to review \n     the documents in his office, OSHA offered to photocopy a \n     complete set of the same documents provided to the House \n     Committee immediately. Senator Enzi's staff refused this \n     request because they were unwilling to agree to treat the \n     materials they had requested in the exact same way that the \n     House Committee had already agreed to treat the documents--in \n     a way that protects an open, public rulemaking process as \n     authorized by Congress.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, one problem with this debate is some of \nmy colleagues come to the floor and make these points. Frankly, there \ndoes need to be a response.\n  My good friend from Arkansas says that what will happen with this \nOSHA rule, dealing with repetitive stress injury, is it will do severe \ndamage to workers comp laws in our States.\n  There are some 12 attorneys general who have said in no way--\nincluding one who testified in our subcommittee--will that happen, \nincluding the attorney general from Arkansas who has said this will not \nimpact workers compensation laws.\n  Then my colleagues say, this is a rush, they are rushing to \npromulgate a rule. It was Elizabeth Dole who, as Secretary of Labor, \nfirst pointed out that we needed to have an ergonomics rule because of \nthe injuries taking place. My colleagues believe that this is a rush, \nthough we have 600,000 workers every year who are severely injured.\n  I say to Senators, it is surprising to me when there is so much pain, \nwhen so many workers are injured, when they can no longer work, when \nthey cannot sleep at night, when it has damaged families, when so many \nof the workers are women, that my colleagues don't want OSHA to do its \njob. The mission of OSHA is to protect workers. I am proud of the fact \nthat OSHA is trying to promulgate this rule. I view this amendment as \nbeing nothing but blatant, political interference against this agency \ndoing exactly the job it ought to do.\n  The same Senators who say OSHA is rushing after 10 years to \npromulgate a rule to protect workers, to have a safer workplace, they \nalso believe we are rushing tonight to provide prescription drug \nbenefits for senior citizens. Where have Senators been? On another \nplanet? In Minnesota, 65 percent of senior citizens have no \nprescription drug coverage. It is an important issue to their lives, \ntheir children, and their grandchildren.\n  Do I need to come to the floor and tell Members about people who are \npaying 50 or 60 percent of their monthly budget because of prescription \ndrug costs? And then Members come on the floor and say: It is not time; \nwe are rushing; we better not support this legislation.\n  I don't know when Members think the time will come. I think the time \nhas come. I think Democrats think the time has come. I agree with my \ncolleague, Senator Durbin, this is a values debate. This is about where \nwe stand. As a Senator from Minnesota, I stand with working people. I \nstand for a safer workplace. And I certainly stand for trying to help \nsenior citizens meet prescription drug costs so they are able to get \nthe prescription drugs that are so essential for their health. I need \nnot say anything else.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I rise in support of the Enzi amendment.\n  Senator Enzi's amendment would delay the costliest mandate ever \nimposed on small businesses.\n  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, has \npublished a rule that is the broadest and most expensive rule ever, let \nme say that again, ever proposed by OSHA. There needs to be more study \nof this rule before it is implemented.\n  Ergonomics is the science of fitting the job to the worker.\n  The OSHA proposed ergonomics rule would require employers to \neliminate or materially reduce hazards in the workplace that lead to \ninjuries such as carpal tunnel, tendinitis, and back injuries.\n  OSHA's cost estimate is $4.2 billion a year. Clinton administration's \nown Small Business Administration reports that the true cost would be \n$40-$60 billion a year--at least 10 times OSHA's estimate.\n  The Heritage Foundation estimates that the cost would be $5.7 billion \nto $10.8 billion per year without adding in the cost to state and local \ngovernments, and $6.6 billion to $12.5 billion per year if public-\nsector workers are included. Private industry estimates the bill's cost \nwould be even higher.\n  OSHA expects that the proposed rule will significantly increase the \nnumber of requests for state compliance assistance and consultation \nservices. That means this regulation will cost even more money.\n  The ergonomics rule probably would expand state workers' compensation \nsystems, increasing claims and fraud.\n  This is yet again, an unfunded mandate on the states. Yet the OSHA \nhas a limited public comment period that does not take into \nconsideration the huge cost to business and the probable stress to the \nunprecedented economic growth that the U.S. is currently experiencing.\n  I urge your support for Senator Enzi's amendment, so that OSHA can \nreassess their proposed regulation that would burden the business \ncommunity with a costly regulation.\n  On the prescription drug plan, I oppose the Robb plan. In my hand is \na report, the actuarial report from Norman and Robinson, which says it \nwill cost seniors $40 per month, up to almost $500 a year, and cost \nhundreds of billions of dollars to the taxpayers. That is the Robb \nplan.\n  Senator Allard and I have a plan and we want to try to get the \nattention of the Finance Committee. This plan has no premium increases \non seniors. It saves seniors $550 a year. It is budget neutral. It \ncovers 50 percent of the cost of drugs, up to $5,000.\n  Those are the two alternatives. This was done by King Associates. Guy \nKing was a former actuary at HCFA.\n  I think the distinction is clear. How did we help seniors by raising \npremiums, when we don't have to raise premiums with this plan?\n  I hope my colleagues pay close attention to what Mr. King has said. \nThis plan is sound.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 7 minutes, \nthe Senator from Delaware 3 minutes, and the Senator from Wyoming has 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n\n[[Page S5643]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will sum up where we are on these two \nextremely important issues, one involving safety in the workplace.\n  The whole issue of ergonomics addresses the most important worker \nsafety issue in the workplace. Now we have an amendment of the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, my dear friend, who wants to undermine what has been a \n10-year review and a study about how we can provide protection for \nworkers in the workplace who are affected by ergonomics.\n  As has been pointed out, this whole issue was raised by Secretary \nDole in the Bush administration who called ergonomic injuries one of \nthe Nation's most debilitating across-the-board worker safety and \nhealth issues. Since that time, there have been over 2,000 studies on \nergonomics carried out.\n  In 1997, NIOSH, the principal agency of Government that studies these \nissues, reviewed 600 of the most important of these studies. They made \nrecommendations. In 1998, the National Academy of Sciences reviewed the \nstudies again and again, and they came to the same conclusion. The fact \nis, the science is clear. The question is whether we will have the will \nand the determination to take steps to protect our workers. We know \nwhat needs to be done. The subject has been studied. Now we have the \nchance to take a step to protect American workers.\n  These are the facts: 35 percent of the most harmful injuries in the \nworkplace are ergonomic injuries. That is what is happening today. More \nthan 600,000 workers are affected. When you look at who are \ndisproportionately harmed by ergonomic hazards, in lost time, 67 \npercent who lost working time from repetitive motion injuries were \nwomen, and those who lost work time for carpal tunnel injuries were \nwomen again, 77 percent. This is a woman's issue; this is a worker's \nissue.\n  The science is overwhelming. The fact is, historically we have been \nprepared to take actions to make the workplace safe. We had the great \ndevelopment of our mining systems, and we passed mine safety \nlegislation. Now we need to pass legislation to protect American \nworkers in this area.\n  It has been studied, restudied, and studied again. Once again, we are \nbeing asked to discard the various studies and reviews and put the \nprofits of the private sector ahead of the interests of the workers. \nThat is wrong. That is the issue: Are we going to stand for workers or \nare we going to stand for the profits of the industries in this \ncountry?\n  On the second issue, Medicare, I was there, like most of the Members \nof the Senate, when the President of the United States, in his State of \nthe Union Address, asked the Congress of the United States to pass a \nprescription drug program based upon Medicare that would deal with the \nincredible hardship of so many of our seniors.\n  I was also here in 1964 and 1965 when the Senate eventually passed \nthe Medicare program. This issue was discussed during that period of \ntime: Were we going to pass a prescription drug program. The judgment \nat that time was: Let's pass in Medicare what they are doing in the \nprivate sector. A great majority of the private sector, over 90 \npercent, did not include a prescription drug program, so we did not \npass one in the Medicare program. At that time, less than 3 percent of \nevery dollar expended was used for prescription drugs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2 more minutes.\n  Now it is 20 to 30 percent, as the Senator from Florida has pointed \nout. We now know this is absolutely an essential need for our seniors. \nHow much more does it have to be studied?\n  With all due respect to the Finance Committee, they had a whole set \nof hearings last year. We did not have any legislation reported out \nfrom the Finance Committee. We have not had any legislation reported in \nthe final weeks of this Congress. We have no commitment that the \nchairman of the Finance Committee or the Finance Committee members will \nsay: We will have a prescription drug bill on the floor of the Senate \nfor you in July--absolutely not.\n\n  We have a well-thought-out program that can make the difference for \nour senior citizens. When Medicare was passed, it was a fundamental \ncommitment by the Federal Government to senior citizens: Work hard, \nplay by the rules, and your health care needs will be attended to. That \nwas the commitment in 1964 and 1965.\n  Every day we fail to pass a prescription drug benefit, we are \nviolating that commitment. Every single day, we find our seniors are in \npain and agony and suffering irreparable damage, in many cases because \nthey cannot afford a prescription drug program. That is a fact. That \npromise is being broken every day because Medicare does not cover \nprescription drugs. This is wrong. This is fundamentally wrong. Every \nMember of the Senate knows it in their hearts. Every family in America \nknows it is wrong. Certainly, every senior citizen knows it is wrong.\n  We have a chance to do something right. We have a chance to put the \nhealth care of our senior citizens ahead of the profits of the private \nspecial interests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 1 more minute.\n  That is what this vote is all about. For whom are we going to stand? \nThis is the vote on prescription drugs. This is a program that is tied \nto the Medicare system. Our elderly people understand Medicare. They \nbelieve in Medicare. They know the need for prescription drugs. It is \nas simple and fundamental as that. It is comprehensive, it is all \ninclusive, it is affordable, and it will meet the needs of our senior \ncitizens.\n  That is the vote we are going to have in the Senate, and we should \nmeet our commitments to our senior citizens. We know what their needs \nare. We should meet them. We have that opportunity tonight. Let us not \nfail them.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I congratulate and compliment my friend \nand colleague from Wyoming, as well as the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. \nHutchinson, because they have offered an amendment that is one of the \nmost important amendments we are going to vote on this year. The \nClinton administration is trying to push forward an ergonomics rule \nthat will have a draconian, negative impact on every single business in \nAmerica.\n  I want all my colleagues to know if this amendment is not adopted, if \nthis ergonomics rule goes forward, there will be significant costs. \nEmployers will be coming up to you asking: Why did you do this to me? I \nhave some bureaucrat coming in and telling me how to run my business.\n  I have a quote given by the individual who wrote these regs. She \nsaid:\n\n       I love it; I absolutely love it. I was born to regulate. I \n     don't know why, but that's very true. So as long as I am \n     regulating, I'm happy.\n\n  And she came up with the largest regulation in OSHA's history on \nbusiness. The Small Business Administration estimated it will cost $60 \nbillion a year, 15 times the cost that OSHA said. People in the private \nsector said it will cost over $100 billion a year. And the \nadministration wants this to go forward right after the election, right \nbefore we have a change of administration.\n  Senator Kennedy said this has been studied. Congress passed, in 1998, \n$890,000 for a study by the National Academy of Sciences. They are \ngoing to complete that study in January. We should let them do it. We \nshould base this regulation on science, real science, not on a \npolitical agenda. They want to cram through an extensive regulation \nwhere bureaucrats are telling employees how to run their business, and \nto do that right before the election, before the next administration, \nwill be a serious mistake.\n  We need to stop it, and the way to stop it is to adopt the Enzi \namendment. I say to my colleagues, this is probably the most important \nfree-enterprise, private-sector initiative you'll vote on this year: If \nthis year you believe business should be making decisions, support the \namendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Enzi amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n\n[[Page S5644]]\n\n  The other side today has spent most of the day avoiding the \nergonomics debate. Part of the debate was on the floods in North \nDakota. That is because they do not have an answer to what we have been \nsaying all day. We, too, are concerned about worker safety. We have \nbeen doing things for worker safety. Companies in this country have \nbeen doing things for worker safety. In fact, I appreciate the ranking \nmember of my subcommittee mentioning today a couple of companies in his \nState that have made tremendous strides in worker safety, including \nergonomics.\n  I am so pleased to report that according to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, last year there was a 24-percent decrease in ergonomics \naccidents. Companies are doing something. They are doing what they can \nthink of.\n  If the same $1.8 million that has been spent on getting testimony for \nthis rule had been used and focused particularly on small business to \nmake sure they had the information to make the ergonomics changes in \ntheir work site, we would have even more workplace safety.\n  But, no, we have been paying contractors to testify. Has the \nDepartment disclosed that? No. They think these people have been \nvolunteering their time, just like everybody else. Not only that, they \nedited their text for them. They had mock sessions so these experts \ncould do it correctly. Then they paid them to rip the opposition. That \nis not testimony. That is the expertise that we ought to have in the \nworkers comp department.\n  This will have a drastic effect on Medicare and Medicaid. We place \nlimits on what we pay on Medicare. We are not raising those caps \nthrough the rule. So we will force people to violate some of the \nMedicare and some of the nursing statutes that we already have.\n  Then the work restriction protection--my goodness, we want the United \nStates to get into a workers comp program? Ask your States how much of \na problem they are having administering workers comp, and see if you \nthink that OSHA can do the job. See if you think they can.\n  Incidentally, it was mentioned that there was testimony in our \ncommittee in that there was no opposition from the States. I presented \na letter. I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record. \nIt is from the State of New York Department of Labor, saying they were \nopposed to it.\n  I also ask permission that a similar letter from the State of \nPennsylvania, be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                State of New York,\n\n\n                                          Department of Labor,\n\n                                        Albany, NY, March 1, 2000.\n     OSHA Docket Office,\n     Docket No. S-777, Department of Labor, Washington, DC.\n     To whom it may concern:\n       Enclosed please find comments from the New York State \n     Department of Labor concerning the proposed Ergonomics \n     Standard, 29 CFR Part 1910, published Tuesday, November 23, \n     1999, in Federal Register, Volume 64, Number 225, at page \n     65768.\n       Sincerely,\n                                               Connie J. Varcasia.\n       Enclosure.\n       This constitutes comments by the New York State Department \n     of Labor (NYSDOL) regarding the proposed Ergonomics Standard \n     29 CFR Part 1910.\n       1. We note for the record that OSHA, in the Federal \n     Register notice dated November 23, 1999, (hereinafter \n     referred to as notice), at page 66,054, IX, states, ``In \n     addition, the agency has preliminarily concluded, based on a \n     review of the rulemaking record to date, that few, if any, of \n     the affected employers are state, local and tribal \n     governments.'' Aside from the issue of how OSHA arrived at \n     this conclusion, we agree with the statement. Therefore, we \n     do not expect that the public sector programs of State Plan \n     states' will be required to adopt the proposed standard.\n       2. If, however, OSHA intends to require adoption of this \n     standard by State Plan public sector programs, we object. We \n     object to the standard because OSHA excluded small public \n     sector jurisdictions (small entities under the Small Business \n     Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, hereinafter ``SBREFA'') \n     from the SBREFA process and panel during the course of \n     preparing this rulemaking.\n       3. OSHA's proposal may not be a ``standard'' as defined by \n     the statute. It does not describe means, methods or practices \n     reasonably necessary or appropriate to control occupational \n     safety and health hazards. It is not a ``standard'' about \n     workplace hazards; rather, it proposes to impose a particular \n     management approach on employers.\n       4. OSHA has estimated the cost of initial compliance with \n     this standard at $4.2 billion (OSHA's original estimate was \n     $3.5 billion). Private sector businesses and trade \n     associations have estimated this cost as high as $26 billion \n     and the United States Small Business Administration (SBA) has \n     estimated the same cost at more than $18 billion. A copy of \n     the SBA report is annexed hereto and made a part hereof.\n       Given these disparity of costs, there is not consensus as \n     to the costs of compliance with this proposed standard. It \n     appears that a proper and accurate cost-benefit analysis has \n     not been done, and that OSHA should, at a minimum, address \n     the conclusion of the SBA regarding the cost of this \n     proposal.\n       5. This rulemaking is completely devoid of any mention of \n     the amount of funding that could be appropriated to State \n     Plans for its enforcement. OSHA has not discussed the issue \n     of funding this standard with State Plans in any other forum. \n     Of particular concern are the following:\n       (a) Depending on which ergonomist one believes, ergonomics \n     affects 30%, 40% or 50% of the jobs in America. As a \n     regulatory agency, the NYSDOL can expect at least a \n     30% increase in the number of legitimate complaints (as \n     well as countless unsubstantiated complaints) because of \n     the new standard. Based on sheer numbers, caseload and \n     volume, our public sector State Plan will require an \n     increase in the amount of funding to respond to \n     complaints.\n       (b) Ergonomics is a precise science where incorrect advice \n     can do more damage than no advice at all. New York State does \n     not currently have staff with ergonomics expertise, and we \n     have serious concerns with its lack of availability. No \n     mention is made in this rulemaking of how much money OSHA \n     will provide for staff training in this field. Note that a \n     two-week training session on ergonomics is not sufficient to \n     provide the professional level of service which the regulated \n     community will demand. The number of professionally \n     accredited ergonomists in the United States is wholly \n     inadequate to meet the demand that will be engendered by \n     adoption of this standard throughout the United States (see \n     attached article).\n       (c) The proposed standard is unfair to public sector \n     employers because some of the more frequently utilized \n     abatement measures are not available to them. The public \n     sector workplace is nearly 100% unionized in New York State. \n     It is governed by civil service rules and collective \n     bargaining agreements that describe in detail job tasks to be \n     performed. Accordingly, redesigning a job for one person to \n     include varied tasks not contained within the general job \n     description for that position is not permitted. A public \n     employer cannot change a job unilaterally; it must return to \n     the collective bargaining table for job redesign. Many states \n     have statutes such as our own Taylor Law, which expose an \n     employer to improper practice (unfair labor practice) \n     liability if it were to obey an order based upon the OSHA \n     proposed standard. The employer would also be subject to \n     grievance proceedings under the collective bargaining \n     agreement with the union involved, as changing individual job \n     requirements would constitute a breach of the contract.\n       (d) Another often recommended abatement measure is more \n     frequent rest breaks. Rest breaks, and the timing and \n     duration thereof, are also provided for in collective \n     bargaining agreements and civil service rules. Any public \n     employer altering such breaks unilaterally, without a return \n     to the bargaining table, would again be subject to the \n     sanctions of improper practice charges under the Taylor Law \n     and union grievance for breach of the collective bargaining \n     agreement. As such, these abatement measures are unavailable \n     to public sector employers. The proposed OSHA standard is an \n     infringement of rights granted under collective bargaining \n     agreements and laws to public sector employers and employees.\n       (e) Should a public sector employer attempt to implement \n     altered rest breaks or altered job tasks unilaterally in \n     order to comply a violation of the OSHA standard, the state \n     regulatory agency would be in the position of aiding and \n     abetting the infringement of workers' rights guaranteed under \n     the collective bargaining agreement and state statutes.\n       (f) Regarding the costs of implementing the standard for \n     small public sector entities, the proposed standard would \n     place a tremendous burden on the public sector employer. If \n     one assumes that this will increase costs to public \n     employers, the only way to pay for this will be to increase \n     the taxes of the citizens in its jurisdiction. Public sector \n     small entities include town, village and small city \n     governments, as well as fire districts, volunteer fire \n     departments, school districts, water districts, and many \n     others that would not be able to sustain the cost of this \n     proposed standard without increased taxation.\n       6. The proposed standard does not provide adequate notice \n     to the affected employers or employees. A by-product of this \n     uncertainty is likely to be increased litigation. Many terms \n     are undefined or vague: ``management leadership,'' ``employee \n     participation,'' ``relevant,'' ``become involved,'' \n     ``effective means,'' ``reasonably likely,'' ``promptly,'' \n     ``likely to cause,'' ``likely to contribute,'' ``similar \n     jobs,'' ``minimize,'' ``try,'' ``feasible,'' ``medical \n     management,'' ``periodically as needed,'' ``recovery \n     period,'' ``closely associated,'' ``adequate,'' ``excessive \n     vibration,'' ``recently,'' and ``prolonged'' are either \n     poorly defined or not defined at all. While OSHA offers \n     definitions of some of\n\n[[Page S5645]]\n\n     these terms, many are vague and will need to be defined--a \n     task most likely to be accomplished by courts of competent \n     jurisdiction over the next quarter century.\n       7. We agree with former Acting Assistant Secretary and OSHA \n     Head, Greg Watchman, who said on November 30, 1999, that the \n     proposed ergonomic standard is too broad, triggered too \n     easily, and includes comprehensive requirements that may not \n     be necessary to address one or two signs or symptoms of \n     musculoskeletal disorders. We also agree with his statement \n     that thousands or perhaps millions of employers would be \n     required to implement programs regardless of whether workers \n     are at risk.\n       8. We agree with the Small Business Administration that \n     OSHA failed to fully examine other regulatory approaches, \n     such as using the On Site Consultation Program to educate \n     employers and the public as to precisely what ergonomics is \n     and how studying ergonomics can help individual employers and \n     their workforces.\n       9. We agree with the Women Constructors Forum's statement, \n     ``Women-owned companies are the fastest growing sector of our \n     economy. What we need is information, not regulation. . . . \n     The nature of this standard could force businesses to \n     completely overhaul their safety and health practices and \n     devote more resources to paperwork and compliance.''\n       10. Attached and made a part of these comments are a number \n     of articles and studies marked exhibits 1 through 7. The New \n     York State Department of Labor requests that these be made a \n     part of our comments and asks that OSHA respond to the \n     concerns and questions addressed in them.\n\n                                     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\n\n\n                             Department of Labor and Industry,\n\n                                Harrisburg, PA, February 29, 2000.\n     Re Comments to the Proposed Ergonomic Standard.\n     OSHA Docket Office,\n     Docket No. S-777, Department of Labor, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sir/Madam: Pursuant to the proposed rulemaking \n     published in the Federal Register on November 23, 1999, Vol. \n     64, No. 225, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania submits the \n     attached comments in response to OSHA's ``Proposed Ergonomics \n     Standard.''\n       The proposed standard conflicts with section 4(b)(4) of the \n     OSHA Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 653(b)(4), in that it attempts to \n     supersede and preempt state workers' compensation laws where \n     the OSHA Act specifically prohibits such preemption. \n     Specifically, the proposed standard intrudes upon the states' \n     abilities to respond appropriately to issues of work-related \n     illness and injury, including those relating to \n     musculoskeletal disorders, heretofore addressed by each \n     state's workers' compensation laws. OSHA proposes to replace \n     these systems, which were custom tailored to the needs of the \n     individual states, with a broad, uniform system which at best \n     confuses and at worst conflicts with the various states' \n     workers' compensation programs. Despite OSHA's recognition of \n     its inability to regulate in areas of state workers' \n     compensation law, it has, in the proposed rulemaking, failed \n     to recognize that many issues addressed therein are, in fact, \n     within the province of the states' workers' compensation \n     systems, and are beyond the scope of OSHA's regulatory \n     authority.\n       We believe that Pennsylvania, as well as the other states, \n     will be negatively impacted by the standard which OSHA has \n     proposed. The attached comments articulate in further detail \n     the manner by which the proposed standard confuses issues \n     regarding the provision of health care to injured workers, \n     employers' abilities to adequately respond to workers' \n     compensation claims, the provision of workers' compensation \n     wage loss-benefits, the time for filing of workers' \n     compensation claims, and issues of causation and preexisting \n     conditions.\n       In light of the foregoing, we ask that you reconsider the \n     proposed rulemaking, as it poses substantial difficulties for \n     the citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Thank you \n     for your consideration of this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Johnny J. Butler.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I have lots of letters from different groups that have \nsaid: Don't do work restriction protection. That's workers comp, and \nyou're violating our right to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield myself 1 additional minute.\n  Work restriction protection is prohibited by the OSHA Act. Very clear \nwording in the OSHA Act says you cannot get into workers comp, but they \nare going to with this rule they are trying to push through by \nDecember. I do not know why December is so critical to them. Maybe I \ndo. They are trying to get this thing pushed through at all costs, and \nwithout paying attention to what people are saying to them about things \nthat are wrong about the rule that they are doing.\n  We need a little time to take a look at the rule, particularly in \nlight of how well businesses are doing at fixing ergonomics.\n  Again, I encourage the Department to help people figure out ways they \ncan improve the safety. All we would be doing if we passed this rule is \nwe would be giving OSHA a bigger club to beat people up with, not an \nanswer to the ergonomics problem.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the only time \nleft is controlled by the Senator from Delaware, who has 3 minutes, and \nthe Senator from Wyoming, who has 1 minute.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I say to Senator Breaux, while I was not \nphysically present on the floor when you made your speech, I was \nlistening. I am very privileged and pleased to join you tonight in \nsuggesting that this is not a real vote on Medicare.\n  Most of the time--in the past--Senator Robb is a very realistic and \nforthright Senator. But somehow or other we are getting close to an \nelection, and somebody has suggested to him that this is a way to get a \nreal Medicare vote. The truth of the matter is, everybody listening \nshould know this is not a real Medicare vote.\n  If anything, if we adopt this on an appropriations bill--that funds \nall of the priorities of the other side of the aisle--if they want to \nfund education, it is funded in this bill. If they want to fund \ncommunity centers to treat the people that are poor, they are funded in \nthis bill more than last year. But now they come along and ask us to \nattach an amendment, a huge bill that we have never had a hearing on, \nand we call it prescription drugs for America. We put it on with \neducation, community centers, all the health programs for our seniors, \nand we say, just put it on there and tell the committee, that knows \nnothing about Medicare because they are not expected to, to bring back \na comprehensive Medicare program on an appropriations bill. Then the \nsuggestion to the American senior citizens is, we are doing something \nfor you.\n  What we are doing is trying to force a vote before we have a bill. \nThis is not a bill that has been considered. It is not going to be \nvoted out by our bipartisan effort. A great bipartisan effort is taking \nplace.\n  If I were a member of the Finance Committee--be it Dr. Bill Frist or \nthe Senator from Texas or the distinguished Senators on that side \nworking on it--I would be ashamed today to say: I am going to vote to \nusurp and take away all your power and vote in a so-called prescription \ndrug bill that a few of us have written up. And we are going to pass it \non an appropriations bill where that committee does not know anything \nabout prescription drugs.\n  They are sort of expected to robot out of here and robot back in with \na great prescription drug bill.\n  I submit that we should not vote for it. We should not use our \nprocedures and our processes in this perverted way.\n  I am going to ask five or six questions. They are not answered by \nthis legislation, and they are not answered here.\n  Let me first ask: How does this amendment affect the solvency of \nMedicare? Nobody knows. What are the premiums for drug coverage? Nobody \nknows. I don't know that anybody knows the official cost estimate of \nthis bill. But I know it is expensive. Don't you think we ought to know \nthose answers before we try to convince Americans that we are passing a \nprescription drug bill which could not become law?\n  There are two more questions: Are there taxes in this proposal? If \nthere are, the bill goes nowhere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think we are going to do the right thing and deny \nthis effort to make an issue out of something that is not ready to have \nan issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 1 minute.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield the final minute to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. REID. How much time do you yield?\n  Mr. ENZI. One minute.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has the floor.\n\n[[Page S5646]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Point of personal privilege.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I do not want my 1 minute to start until I start talking. \nIf the Senator wants to talk, let him do it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I do not want to talk; I want to answer.\n  The Senator asked a series of questions, and I am prepared to answer \nthem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has the floor. The \nSenator from Florida is not in order. The Senator from Texas has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have been meeting on a bipartisan basis \nto try to put together a bill in the waning hours of this Congress that \nwill provide for prescription drug insurance for senior Americans. We \nhave been working in good faith.\n  This is a bad faith amendment. This is a politics-first amendment. \nNobody knows what it costs. Nobody knows how it will work. Nobody knows \nwhat it does to the solvency of Medicare. This is politics at its \nworst.\n  I think this body ought to be offended by it. I am offended by it. I \ndo not believe that voters are going to be impressed by circumventing \nthe process. This does not speed it up. This makes it harder for people \nsuch as Senator Roth and Senator Breaux to bring us together to pass a \nbill. This needs to be rejected by an overwhelming vote.\n  I urge those who really want a prescription drug benefit--label this \nfor what it is by voting no, and let's get on with trying to do this on \na bipartisan basis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. All time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nThurmond and Helms as cosponsors of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 3593\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3593. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer) \nand the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record answers to the questions that were asked during the debate \nby the Senator from New Mexico.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSenator Bob Graham's Answers to Senator Domenici's Questions Concerning \n                   the Robb Amendment, June 22, 2000\n\n       1. What is the score of this proposal?\n       Over 10 years the cost of this comprehensive package is \n     approximately $242 billion.\n       2. What impact will this benefit have on the solvency of \n     the Medicare program?\n       This program will not have a direct impact on the solvency \n     of the Medicare program. In fact, the inclusion of a \n     prescription drug benefit may lead to a decrease in hospital \n     stays and other costly outpatient care, which may result in \n     savings to the trust fund.\n       3. What will beneficiary premiums be?\n       In 2003, when the benefit begins, the beneficiary premiums \n     will be approximately $38.50 per month.\n       4. How will this program impact the taxpayer?\n       This program will have no direct implications on the \n     American taxpayer.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to file for the Record CBO estimates as promptly as I can get \nthem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in a moment I believe we will be prepared to \nbegin the vote on the second amendment in this series. I have discussed \nthe schedule with Senator Daschle and the manager of the legislation. \nThis will be the last vote of the night. We will be in session \ntomorrow.\n  We urge Senators who have amendments to offer them tonight--I \nunderstand one is already prepared for tonight--and to be prepared to \nbe here and have amendments in the morning so that we can make \nprogress. We will plan on stacking those votes next week at a time to \nbe determined, and we will let the Members know sometime tomorrow when \nthat will be. But this will be the last vote for tonight and for the \nweek.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3598, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3610.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to \nprotect America's children from exposure to obscene material, child \npornography, or other material deemed inappropriate for minors while \naccessing Internet from a school or library receiving Federal universal \nservice assistance by requiring such schools and libraries to deploy \nblocking or filtering technology on computers used by minors and to \nblock general access to obscene material and child pornography on all \ncomputers. The amendment further requires that schools and libraries \nblock child pornography on all computers.\n  The last few years have seen a dramatic expansion in Internet \nconnection. The Internet connects more than 29 million host computers \nin more than 250 countries. Currently, the Internet is growing at a \nrate of approximately 40 percent to 50 percent annually. Some estimates \nhave the number of U.S. Internet users as high as 62 million.\n  There are approximately 86,000 public schools in the United States. \nThe first program year of the e-rate, 68,220 public schools \nparticipated in the program. That is approximately 68 percent of all \npublic schools. Participation increased by 15 percent in the second \nyear, from July 1, 1999, to June 30, 2000, with 78,722 public schools \nlisted on funded applications. Statistics on libraries participating in \nthe program mirror these dramatic numbers.\n  I lay out these statistics because they represent both the tremendous \npromise and the exponential danger that wiring America's children to \nthe Internet poses. Certainly the Internet represents previously \nunimaginable education and information opportunities for our Nation's \nschoolchildren. However, there are also some very real risks. \nPornography, including obscene material, child pornography, and \nindecent material is widely available on the Internet. This material \nmay be accessed directly or may turn up as the product of a general \nInternet search.\n\n  Seemingly innocuous key word searches such as Barbie doll, \nplayground, boy, and girl can turn up some of the most offensive and \nshocking pornography imaginable.\n  According to the National Journal, there are at least 30,000 \npornographic web sites. This number does not include Usenet news groups \nand pornographic spam.\n  As we have seen through an increasing flurry of shocking media \nreports, the Internet has become the tool of choice for pedophiles who \nutilize the Internet to lure and seduce children into illegal and \nabusive sexual activity. Pedophiles are using this technology to trade \nin child pornography and to lure and seduce our children. In many \ncases, such activity is the product of individuals taking advantage of \nthe anonymity provided by the Internet to stalk children through \nchatrooms and by e-mail. However, an increasingly disturbing trend is \nthat of highly organized and technologically sophisticated groups of \npedophiles who utilize advanced technology to trade in child \npornography and to sexually exploit and abuse children.\n  As we wire America's children to the Internet, we are inviting these \nlowlifes to prey upon our children in every classroom and library in \nAmerica. If this isn't enough, the Internet has now become a tool of \nchoice for disseminating information and propaganda promoting racism, \nanti-Semitism, extremism, and how-to manuals on everything from drugs \nto bombs.\n  Rapid Internet growth has provided an opportunity for those promoting \nhate to reach a much wider and broader audience. Children are uniquely \nsusceptible to these messages of hate, and make no mistake about it, \nthey are the targets of these messages. According to the New York \nTimes: ``They, hate groups, peddle hatred to children, with brightly \ncolored Web pages featuring a coloring book of white supremacist \nsymbols and a crossword puzzle full of racist clues.''\n  Media propaganda has always been used as a means for spreading the \ntoxic message of hate. Magazines, pamphlets, movies, music and other \nmedia have been their traditional tools for those seeking to feed the \ndarker side of our human nature. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer \nreported in an article entitled ``Nazism on the Internet'': ``Many \nsites operated by neo-nazis, skinheads, Ku Klux Klan members and \nfollowers of radical religious sects are growing more sophisticated, \noffering inviting Web environments that are designed to be attractive \nto children and young adults.''\n  The software filtering industry estimates that about 180 new hate or \ndiscrimination pages, 2,500 to 7,500 adult sites, 400 sites dedicated \nto violence, 1,250 dedicated to weapons, and 50 are murder-suicide \nsites are added to the Web every week.\n  Manuals on bomb-making, weapons purchases, drug making and \npurchasing, are widespread on the Internet. Simple word searches using \n``marijuana,'' enables kids to access Web sites instructing them on how \nto cultivate, buy, and consume drugs. Literature such as the \n``Terrorist's Handbook'' is easily available on-line, and provides \nreaders with instruction on everything from how to build guns and \nbombs, to lists of suppliers for the chemicals, and other ingredients \nnecessary to construct such devices.\n  When a school or library accepts Federal dollars through the \nUniversal Service fund, they become a partner with the federal \ngovernment in pursuing the compelling interest of protecting children.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Carl Jung, in 1913, spoke of the importance of \nchildhood in shaping values, and the implications for future \ngenerations. Jung said: ``The little world of childhood with its \nfamiliar surroundings is a model of the greater world. The more \nintensively the family has stamped its character upon the child, the \nmore it will tend to feel and see its earlier miniature world again in \nthe bigger world of adulthood.''\n  As I look upon the landscape of America today, of our children, \ngrowing up in a culture of violence, of a mass media that floods their \ninnocent minds with images of gratuitous sex and senseless violence, as \nI contemplate the likes of predators who stalk our children through \nthis new technology, of pornographers and hate mongers who seek to \ninvade the sanctity of the innocence of childhood to stamp their dark \nvalues on our children, I wonder what the future world of adulthood \nwill look like if we do not act swiftly and decisively to build an \ninviolable wall around our precious children.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nletter from a group of people, including the American Family \nAssociation, Family Research Council, Republican Jewish Coalition, \nTraditional Values Coalition, many others in support of this \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2000.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Russell Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sen. McCain: We are writing to indicate our very \n     strong support for the Children's Internet Protection Act, S. \n     97, which we believe offers a very effective solution to the \n     growing problem of pornography accessible on the Internet by \n     computers in schools and public libraries. Caring parents who \n     wish to shield their children from sexually exploitive \n     material should be able to trust that schools and public \n     libraries are on their side in this battle. Yet, because of \n     the influence of the American Library Association and their \n     allies, which oppose filtering of any material, even illegal \n     pornography, to children, such parents find they are fighting \n     a losing battle. The Children's Internet Protection Act will \n     go a long way in that battle by requiring that obscenity \n     (hard-core pornography), child pornography, and other \n     material inappropriate for minors be blocked when children \n     access the Internet on school and library computers.\n       The Children's Internet Protection Act would help solve an \n     additional problem occurring primarily in public libraries, \n     the use\n\n[[Page S5648]]\n\n     of computers by pedophiles who access child pornography, and \n     then seek to molest children. We are pleased that your bill, \n     unlike some other Internet filtering bills introduced in \n     Congress, requires that child pornography be blocked for all \n     users, adults and children.\n       American needs the Children's Internet Protection Act. \n     Thank you for your leadership on this important matter.\n       American Family Association, Family Research Council, \n     Republican Jewish Coalition, Traditional Values Coalition, \n     Morality in Media, National Law Cntr. for Children & \n     Families, Family Friendly Libraries, Family Association of \n     Minnesota, Family Policy Network, VA, Christian Action \n     League, NC, Citizens for Community Values, OH, American \n     Family Assoc., IN, American Family Assoc., MS, American \n     Family Assoc., NY, American Family Assoc., PA, American \n     Family Assoc., TX, American Family Assoc., AR, American \n     Family Assoc., AL, American Family Assoc., KY, American \n     Family Assoc., GA, American Family Assoc., MO, American \n     Family Assoc., CO, American Family Assoc., OR, American \n     Family Assoc., IA, American Family Assoc., MI, American \n     Family Assoc., OH, American Family Assoc., NJ.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is from Houston Reuters, Thursday, \nJune 15:\n\n       A Georgia man has been arrested in Texas and charged with \n     trying to buy two elementary school boys for sex after FBI \n     agents monitoring the Internet identified him as a pedophile, \n     the agency said on Thursday.\n       Jonathan Christopher Wood was arrested on June 3 after \n     traveling to Houston from Perry, Georgia, with the intention \n     of buying the boys and taking them back to Georgia for \n     illegal sex, the FBI said in a statement.\n       Wood, 53, was arrested after arriving in an agreed-upon \n     meeting place with $12,000 in cash for the purchase, the FBI \n     said.\n       Brian Loader, assistant special agent in charge of the \n     FBI's Houston field office, told Reuters the arrest came as a \n     result of FBI monitoring of Internet chatrooms.\n       ``He was identified by our Crimes against Children task \n     force as a person who was actively seeking to purchase \n     children for sexual exploitation. He was using the \n     Internet,'' Loader said.\n       Loader declined to say whether an FBI agent had posed as a \n     seller but he said that no other arrests had been made.\n       A Federal criminal complaint filed against Wood alleges \n     that he traveled across States lines with intent to engage in \n     prohibited sexual relations with a minor. Woods had recently \n     moved to Georgia from Alabama, where he had owned a company \n     that provided Internet access.\n       Also on Thursday, Texas Attorney General John Cornyn \n     announced the arrest of five men charged with aggravated \n     sexual assault for allegedly having sex with a 12-year-old \n     girl they contacted through an Internet chatroom.\n  Mr. President, I will have a longer statement when we pursue this \namendment later on. I hope we can have an up-or-down vote. Anyone who \nuses the Internet knows of this problem.\n  I am not advocating censorship. The fact is that when Federal dollars \nare used to wire schools and libraries in America, then it seems to me \nthe schools and libraries have an obligation to provide Internet \nfilters and use them according to community standards--only according \nto community standards, in the same fashion that a school or library \nfilters printed material that comes into a school or library. \nOccasionally, a wrong book may be taken off the shelf in a library. But \nI know of no school board or library board that does not filter printed \nmaterial.\n  How in the world can we sit still and have all of this stuff coming \ninto our schools and libraries without the kind of filtering that is \ndone with printed materials? A few years ago, a 13-year-old boy in the \nPhoenix library was viewing pornography on the Internet, and he walked \nout and sexually molested another young boy. This is rampant throughout \nthis country.\n  Some argue that I can't stop everything over the Internet, nor do I \nwish to try that or to enter anybody's home; that is their private \nbusiness. But schools and libraries in this country should exercise \ntheir responsibilities to screen this kind of material according to \ncommunity standards.\n  Why in the world the American Library Association opposes this \nlegislation is one of the great curiosities of my political career. I \nhope we can overcome that opposition. The overwhelming number of \nparents in America want their children protected in schools and \nlibraries as they view the Internet.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to an overwhelming vote in favor of \nthis amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I agree with him that is difficult to conceive \nthat anyone would think that material that comes through the Internet \nwhich would not be allowed in the library in a book should be allowed \nto be in there electronically. It is frustrating to see the National \nLibrary Association, who I have observed over the years have a very \nradical view of absolutely no one telling a librarian what can be \nbrought into a library. I don't think that is legitimate. Their \nsalaries are paid by the taxpayers, and they receive money from the \nFederal Government. They don't have an absolute, unprotected right to \nselect whatever they want in the library.

Mr. President, I rise to commend the passage of the \nbipartisan Kennedy-Smith Amendment--the Local Law Enforcement Act of \n2000. The Senate's consideration of this important measure was long \noverdue and its passage is one of the major civil rights victories of \nthis century.\n  We are all aware of the tragic deaths of James Byrd in Texas and \nMatthew Shepard in Wyoming. James Byrd was murdered because of the \ncolor of his skin. Matthew Shepard was murdered because of his sexual \norientation.\n  In the Byrd killing, the federal government could help.\n  In the Shepard killing, the federal government could not help local \nlaw enforcement. Why? Because our current hate crimes statute is full \nof holes and desperately needs to be updated.\n  Right now the federal hate crimes law does not cover disability, \ngender or sexual orientation. In addition, the federal government can \nprosecute only those crimes where the victim was chosen because he or \nshe was engaged in a ``federally protected activity,'' such as \nattending public school or serving as a juror. That is a very narrow \nbasis on which to bring a lawsuit.\n  Because Matthew Shepard was killed because he was gay, the federal \ngovernment could not provide the resources Laramie, Wyoming's law \nenforcement so desperately needed. This is why our federal hate crimes \nlaw ought to apply whenever a hate crime occurs.\n  Last year Dennis and Judy Shepard, Matthew's parents, came to Capitol \nHill to plead with us to broaden the hate crimes law. I suspect that no \nSenator who met them will ever forget their words or the anguish in \ntheir eyes. It was an anguish that probably only a parent who has lost \na child can possibly understand.\n  During their visit to Capitol Hill, and all across America, the \nShepards have found the strength to talk about their own tragic \nexperience to help prevent other parents from experiencing their \nnightmare. Had we not passed the Kennedy-Smith Amendment we would have \nbeen ignoring their pleas, and the pleas of so many others.\n  The Kennedy-Smith Amendment will end, once and for all, the \ncontortions that federal prosecutors must undertake to exercise \njurisdiction over hate crimes. The Hatch Amendment will not.\n  The Kennedy-Smith Amendment will allow federal authorities to assist \nin state and local prosecutions of hate crimes on the basis of \ndisability, gender and sexual orientation. The Hatch Amendment will \nnot.\n  We don't need to collect more data on hate crimes. We don't need to \nanalyze the problem. We need to solve it.\n  We already collect information on hate crimes and the statistics are \ngrim. In the last year for which we have statistics, 1998, almost 8,000 \nhate crime incidents were reported.\n  And we already know that state and local law enforcement needs our \nhelp because they have told us so. The National Sheriff's Association \nhas told us so. The International Association of Police Chiefs has told \nus so. Both the Sheriff and Police Commander of Laramie, Wyoming have \nurged us to pass the Kennedy-Smith Amendment. The Laramie Sheriff and \nPolice Commander came with Dennis and Judy Shepard to Capitol Hill. \nThey told us what it meant for their departments to be without the \nassistance of the federal government in investigating and prosecuting \nMatthew Shepard's murder. It meant that they had to lay off 5 law \nenforcement officials as a result of the financial strain of the \nprosecution of Matthew Shepard's killers.\n  If the Kennedy-Smith Amendment had been law, those officers would not \nhave been laid off.\n  We all know that only the Kennedy-Smith Amendment will bring about \nsubstantial change. We all know that only the Kennedy-Smith Amendment \nwill provide law enforcement, in places like Laramie, Wyoming, the \ntools they need to investigate and prosecute hate crimes wherever they \noccur. We all know that only the Kennedy-Smith Amendment will send a \nstrong message that the federal government will prosecute every hate \ncrime with vigor.\n  I am proud that this Senate has now stood with Dennis and Judy \nShepard. I am proud this Senate did not let the politics of \nmisunderstanding keep us from enacting a bill that would enable \nprosecutions of crimes motivated by hatred of gays and lesbians--the \nmotivation for some of the most vicious hate crimes.\n  There are those who argued that this amendment was not needed because \nit only affects a small percentage of Americans. I am troubled by this \nsuggestion. Hate crimes diminish us all. Did this Congress say, in \n1965, that we didn't need a Civil Rights Act because racial \ndiscrimination ``only'' affected a small percentage of Americans? No. \nWe are talking about basic protections that all Americans should be \nafforded. If they are denied to any of us, we are all affected.\n  We must make sure that the federal government leaves no American \nunprotected. The Kennedy-Smith Amendment is a bipartisan, reasonable, \nmeasured response to a serious problem. Now we must ensure that it \nbecomes law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5649-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5649-S5650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FLOOD DISASTER\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to alert my colleagues that \nanother series of national disasters have hit my home State of North \nDakota. This newspaper headline from the largest paper in our State \nsays it best with the headline on the front page, ``Swamped.'' The \nnewspaper goes on to say NDSU, the State university, suffered millions \nin damage. In fact, I talked to the president of the university hours \nago. He believes the damage is in excess of $20 million just at North \nDakota State University. This newspaper indicated that the flood filled \nthe Fargo dome where NDSU plays the football games. The dome was filled \nwith over 8 feet of water.\n  This monsoon that hit Fargo, ND, on the night of June 19, absolutely \nflooded the entire town. It was an incredible series of circumstances. \nThis is a picture that shows cars under water. We saw this all over the \ncity of Fargo. Basements are flooded. Every kind of structure is \nflooded with 2 to 3 feet of water in the streets of the city of Fargo, \nthe biggest city in my State.\n  We also saw massive flooding on the outskirts of town. This is the \ninterstate. This is I-94 that connects Fargo to the rest of North \nDakota. It is a major east-west highway in North Dakota. It was under \nwater. Every part of town saw massive flooding. Homes and trailers are \nunder water all across the city of Fargo.\n  North Dakota State University is one of the two major universities in \nour State. They suffered millions in damage, with very little flood \ninsurance. The president of the university told me their insurance \ncarrier tells them for this kind of event they only had $10,000 of \ninsurance coverage--with losses of over $20 million. Even the \npresident's house was wet. The newspaper says the president of the \nuniversity was among many people dealing with the soggy conditions \nafter fighting battles throughout the night, with 2 inches of sewage \nthat entered the basement of the president's house through the failure \nof the sewer system.\n  This disaster was not confined to the city of Fargo, unfortunately. \nIt spread throughout the area. Probably one of the great ironies is \nthat until June 11 we were in a drought in much of eastern North \nDakota. On June 12, 13, and 14, we had heavy rains in the northeastern \npart of the State.\n  I was there last week with FEMA officials assessing the damage. In \nthat part of the State, they received 20 inches of rain in 2 days--\nabsolutely Biblical. I have never seen anything like it--20 inches of \nrain in 2 days. The entire annual precipitation we receive in the State \nof North Dakota came in 2 days.\n  Over 150,000 acres of prime farmland flooded in that series of \nincidents. Of course, that was followed a week later, last Monday \nnight, by this devastation hitting Fargo, ND, the largest city in the \nState. The mayor of Fargo said it perhaps best: ``It's the worst rain \nflood we've ever had.''\n  This is an event unparalleled in North Dakota history. There is \nsomething very odd going on with the weather pattern. I can only say in \nmy State we have had eight Presidential disaster declarations in the \nlast 7 years. We fully anticipate we will have number nine as a result \nof this series of incidents in northeastern North Dakota and then in \nsoutheastern North Dakota. Hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland \nwere flooded. The major\n\n[[Page S5650]]\n\ncity of my State was very badly hurt by this massive flooding.\n\n  I have come before with requests for disaster assistance. I was very \nhopeful we weren't going to have a disaster this year. Until these \ndevastating events, the worst thing happening was that we appeared to \nhave a drought in part of the State. It is truly stunning to get 20 \ninches of rain in 2 days.\n  The damage is incalculable. In North Dakota State University, there \nwasn't a building on the campus that was not flooded. The president \ninformed me today that the basement of the library was badly flooded \nwhere some of the archives were kept. They were in the basement because \nthat is the safest place in a tornado. Fargo is a town that has \npreviously been hit by tornadoes--not frequently, but on occasion. So \nthe most valuable materials were stored in the basement. Then we get \nhit by these massive monsoon rains that flooded every building on that \ncampus, including devastating and destroying some of the archives of \nthe State.\n  This is, again, a disaster of stunning proportion. Tomorrow, top \nofficials of FEMA and I will be going to North Dakota, accompanied by \ntop officials of the USDA, to further assess the damage. I talked to \nthe Governor today. He tells me he is readying a request for disaster \nassistance. Without question, we will be coming to this body once again \nto ask for assistance for a remarkable set of what can only be \ndescribed as almost unimaginable occurrences. It does make me wonder if \nthere is something going on with global climate change that we don't \nfully understand, to have these extraordinary sets of circumstances 8 \nyears in a row. That is the fact. That is the circumstance that we \nface.\n  I wanted to draw my colleagues' attention to it. We in North Dakota \nhave expressed our thanks to our colleagues on repeated occasions for \nthe assistance provided North Dakota in the face of these remarkable \nnatural disasters. I regret very much standing here today again drawing \nmy colleagues' attention to what has occurred in my home State. I think \nit is important for colleagues to know this has occurred, and that, \nonce again, we will be asking for assistance.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5650-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HEADSTONES AND GRAVE MARKERS AMENDMENT TO DEFENSE BILL\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my appreciation to \nthe bill managers, Chairman Warner and Senator Levin, for accepting my \namendment (No. 3549) regarding headstones and grave markers for \nveterans.\n  This amendment entitles each deceased veteran to an official \nheadstone or grave marker in recognition of that veteran's contribution \nto this nation.\n  This amendment is identical to a bill I introduced last year, S. \n1215, which has the support of veterans groups such as The American \nLegion, The Retired Enlisted Association and the Veterans of Foreign \nWars. It is cosponsored by Senators Byrd, Kennedy, Santorum, Conrad, \nLeahy, Kohl, Feingold and Lieberman.\n  There is no more appropriate time for this amendment. Last month, we \ncommemorated Memorial Day. In just a few days our nation will observe \nIndependence Day. Each of these holidays reminds us of the sacrifices \nmade by our veterans. Today our nation is losing one thousand World War \nII veterans each day. And although they do not boast or brag much, we \nare all well aware of their monumental contribution to America's \nremarkable history of freedom, prosperity and political stability.\n  This amendment would enable their country and their families to \nrecognize that contribution.\n  As anyone who has made burial arrangements for a deceased veteran \nknows, the Department of Veterans Affairs must provide a headstone or \ngrave market in recognition of that veteran's service.\n  What some may not know, and what this amendment would change, is that \nonce a family places a private headstone on their veteran's grave, they \nforfeit their veteran's entitlement to the official VA headstone or \nmarker.\n  This law has its origins in the period following the Civil War when \nour nation wanted to ensure that no veteran's grave went unmarked. \nToday, however, when virtually no one is buried in an unmarked grave, \nthe VA headstone or grave marker serves to officially recognize a \nperson's service in the U.S. armed forces.\n  The present policy generates more complaints to the VA than any other \nburial-related issue. About twenty thousand veterans' families contact \nthe VA each year to register their belief that their family member is \ndue some official recognition for his or her military service \nregardless of whether a private headstone has been placed on the grave.\n  A constituent of mine, Mr. Thomas Guzzo, first brought this matter to \nmy attention. His father, Agostino, a U.S. army veteran, passed away in \n1998.\n  Agostino Guzzo is interred in a mausoleum at Cedar Hill Cemetery in \nHartford, but his final resting place does not bear any official \nmilitary reference to his service in the U.S. Army. Agostino Guzzo's \nfamily wants an official VA marker, but, because of the policy I have \ndescribed, they cannot receive one.\n  Faced with this predicament, Thomas Guzzo contacted me, and I \nattempted to straighten out what I thought to be a bureaucratic mix-up. \nI was surprised to realize that Thomas Guzzo's difficulties resulted \nnot from some glitch in the system, but rather from the law itself.\n  I wrote to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs regarding Thomas Guzzo's \nvery reasonable request. The Secretary responded that his hands were \ntied as a result of the obscure law to which I have just referred.\n  This amendment is a modest means of solving an ongoing problem that \ncontinues to be a source of irritation to the families of our veterans. \nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated that it would cost three \nmillion dollars during the first year it is in effect, and about two \nmillion dollars per year thereafter. That is a small price to pay to \nrecognize our deceased veterans and put their families at ease.\n  Prior to November 1, 1990, when a veteran passed away, the VA was \nrequired to provide a headstone or grave marker unless a family bought \na private headstone. For those families, the VA provided a check for \nthe amount, about $77, it would have spent on a headstone. This \namendment will not reenact that policy, which was discontinued due to \ncost considerations. It simply says that an official VA marker or \nheadstone will be provided for those families that ask for one, and may \nbe placed at a site that they deem to be appropriate. In most cases, \nfamilies that have placed a private headstone will request a marker--a \n$20 brass plate--that would be mounted to the headstone. Surely we can \ndo that much for our veterans in this time of budget surpluses.\n  This amendment allows the Department of Veterans Affairs to better \nserve veterans and their families, and I encourage my colleagues to \nlisten to the thousands of veterans' families who simply hope to \nrecognize a family member's military service.\n  The Greatest Generation gave so much to this country in life, this is \nthe least we can do for them when that life comes to an end.\n  They did their duty and answered the call to serve. It is up to us to \ngive them the modest recognition that they deserve.\n  Again, I want to thank the managers for their support and the Senate \nfor adopting the amendment. I am hopeful that this provision will be \nmaintained in the conference report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5650-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5650-S5652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COPING WITH A CHANGING KOREAN PENINSULA: AVOIDING RIGIDITY AND \n                         IRRATIONAL EXUBERANCE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to begin a discussion of the \ntremendous strategic consequences which may flow from events now \nunderway on the Korean Peninsula.\n  As we debate spending on non-proliferation programs--including \nsupport for the Korean Energy Development Organization created by the \n1994 Agreed Framework, which was significantly reduced in the Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Bill just passed by the Senate--it is \nimportant to keep the big picture in mind. We need to remain flexible \nin the face of a changing world, avoiding the twin pitfalls of rigidity \nand what Fed Chairman Alan\n\n[[Page S5651]]\n\nGreenspan refers to as ``irrational exuberance.''\n  Our decisions today will help shape the strategic environment that \nour children and grandchildren will live with tomorrow.\n  I don't pretend to have all the answers, but I think I have a good \nhandle on some of the key questions, and I hope my colleagues will bear \nthem in mind as we move forward.\n  A decade after the end of the cold war, the American people are \nentitled to feel puzzled and dismayed by the continued hostile division \nof the Korean peninsula along the 38th Parallel. More than a million \nsoldiers, including 37,000 Americans, thousands of artillery tubes, and \nhundreds of tanks, are clustered along a heavily-fortified border 155 \nmiles long. If ever a place were ill-named, it would be the so-called \n``Demilitarized Zone'' on the Korean Peninsula.\n  Today, the two Koreas could not be more different.\n  North of the DMZ, people live in unimaginable poverty and hardship. \nAs many as 2 million North Korean have perished as a result of famine \nand disease over the past 4 years.\n  The 22 million who have survived live under one of the most \nrepressive and brutal regimes on the planet.\n  Their leader, Kim Jong-il, was, until recently, a recluse. We didn't \nknow much about him, although there were plenty of rumors. He was said \nto be mad, irrational, a playboy obsessed by Hollywood movies. He was \nthe ``perfect rogue'' in charge of the world's most dangerous \n``rougue'' nation.\n  South of the DMZ, 47 million Koreans live in a flourishing democracy, \none of the most productive societies on the planet. They enjoy one of \nthe highest living standards in Asia, or indeed, in the world. Their \ncountry is completing a remarkable transformation from authoritarian \nrule to full-throated democracy.\n  They are a steadfast U.S. ally, and have shed blood and put their \nlives on the line alongside U.S. forces from Vietnam to the Middle \nEast.\n  South Korea's leader, President Kim Dae-jung, is a visionary and a \nman of peace. Long imprisoned for his support for democracy and \nrapprochement with North Korea, Kim had the courage to extend a hand of \npeace and friendship across that DMZ, and the peninsula may never be \nthe same.\n  Mr. President, the Korean Peninsula is hallowed ground.\n  This is where Americans of the 2nd Infantry division struggled their \nway up Heartbreak Ridge in order to help secure a defensive line which \nhas remained static for the past 50 yrs. It is a battlefield on which \n900,000 Chinese, 520,000 North Korean, 250,000 south Korean, and more \nthan 33,000 American combatants lost their lives. It is ground on which \nas many as 3 million civilians--ten percent of the total population--\nperished during three years of desperate fighting.\n  The Korean Peninsula is also perilous ground.\n  The North has not withdrawn any of its heavy artillery poised along \nthe Demilitarized Zone. It has not yet ended all of its support for \nterrorist organizations. And, perhaps of greatest concern to the U.S., \nNorth Korea has not stopped its development or export of long-range \nballistic missile technology. The North's missile development poses a \nthreat not only to our allies South Korea and Japan, but to others in \nregions destabilized by North Korean arms merchants.\n  In short, the North Korean threat remains today the most obvious \nstrategic rationale for America's forward-deployed military forces in \nthe Pacific Theater. Roughly 100,000 men and women of the armed forces \nsafeguard U.S. interests in East Asia.\n  The North Korean threat is also the most obvious strategic rationale \nfor those who advocate the development and deployment of a limited \nNational Missile Defense. As the expression went back in the early \n1980's, ``One A-bomb can ruin your whole day.''\n  Mr. President, it is too soon to pop the champagne corks. Euphoria is \nnot an emotion that lends itself to sound foreign policy-making. As \nPresident Kim Dae-jung himself has said, we must approach North Korea \nwith a ``warm heart and a cool head.''\n  Having said all of that, it would be the greatest folly for us not to \nconsider the potential significance of what is happening on the Korean \npeninsula, not just for Northeast Asia, but for the future of United \nStates strategic doctrine and our role in the Pacific.\n  Mr. President, the world does not stand still. The ``plate-\ntectonics'' of Northeast Asia are fluid. The realignments underway \ncould have a profound impact on our force posture and role we will \nplay, with out friends and allies, in helping to secure a peaceful and \nstable East Asian environment for our children and grandchildren.\n  With the emergency of Kim Jong-il from what he jokingly admitted was \na ``hermit's'' existence in North Korea, we are beginning to see the \nrewards of patient diplomacy backed by strong deterrence. If \nimplemented, the agreement reached in Pyongyang--especially provisions \nfor family reunion visits, economic cooperation and eventual peaceful \nunification--promises to reduce tensions in this former war zone and \nenhance economic, cultural, environmental, and humanitarian cooperation \non the peninsula.\n  In five year's time, we might be evaluating a new North Korean \nmissile threat. Alternatively, we might be marveling at the creation of \na genuine demilitarized zone linking, rather than separating, North and \nSouth.\n  North Korea appears to have made a strategic decision that reforming \nits moribund economy and normalizing relations with its neighbors are \nthe keys to the survival of the regime.\n  This decision was not made at the summit. It has its origins in the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the \nsuccess of China's economic reforms. Absent Soviet subsidies and \nmilitary, North Korea has become a desperately poor country, unable \neven to feed itself. It has begun to seek accommodation, even on tough \nissues involving national security.\n  Just yesterday, in response to President Clinton's decision to lift \nsome economic sanctions on the North, the North Koreans agreed to \nextend the missile launch moratorium it has observed over the past \nyear.\n  The North also agreed to engage in a new round of talks next week \nwith the Administration. These talks will take time, but they could \nultimately lead to a decision by North Korea to forego future missile \nexports and curtail its development of long range missiles.\n  What would be the consequences of a world in which North Korea no \nlonger posed a significant threat to its neighbors? Where would our \ninterests lie?\n  It's hard to answer the first question without first engaging in \nthorough deliberations not only with our allies South Korea and Japan, \nbut also with others with a stake in preserving peace and stability in \nnortheast Asia, most notably China and Russia. I believe those \ndeliberations should begin now. We should not wait for events to \ndictate an answer to us, as occurred in the Philippines when we \nsuddenly found ourselves without bases on which we had staked much of \nour future in Southeast Asia.\n  It's a little bit easier to answer the second question. I believe our \nenduring interests are clear.\n  First and foremost, will be our desire to preserve peace and \nstability. There are regional tensions beyond the division of the \npeninsula.\n  Japan and South Korea have unresolved territorial disputes and a \nhistorical legacy of war and mistrust. The Perry Initiative has helped \nforge a remarkable trilateral spirit of cooperation, and we should seek \nto ensure that spirit lives on even after the threat of a second Korean \nWar is laid to rest.\n  Japan and Russia have much the same difficulties as do Japan and \nSouth Korea, and we should do our part to help them to resolve their \ndifferences peacefully.\n  Second, we must pursue non-proliferation. The danger of nuclear \nproliferation will not evaporate just because North and South Korea are \nreconciled. U.S. strategic doctrine--especially our decision on whether \nto proceed with the development and deployment of a National Missile \nDefense--will have a huge impact on whether Japan goes nuclear, which \nwould immediately trigger a Korean response, and whether China builds \nmore ICBMs or decides to MIRV a future generation of missiles.\n  The North Korean threat is literally and figuratively a ``moving \ntarget.'' We should make sure that our aim is true, and that we do not \ninadvertently cause more problems than we solve in our haste to address \nit.\n\n[[Page S5652]]\n\n  Third, we will want to foster respect for international norms in the \nareas of human rights and the environment. This will be particularly \nimportant in our relationship with China.\n  Fourth, we will continue to seek economic openness, including \nsecuring sea lanes of communication. A decision looms before the Senate \non whether to extend permanent normal Trade Relations to China.\n  I support PNTR for China, in part because I believe it is an \nessential ingredient of an overall strategy which secures a place for \nus in more prosperous and economically integrated East Asia.\n  For all of these objectives, maintenance of robust U.S. military \ncapabilities, forward deployed in the region, will be essential, \nalthough the composition of those forces is likely to change as their \nroles and missions evolve. Our forward-deployed forces and the \nmaintenance of strong strategic airlift capabilities at home enable us \nto respond swiftly and effectively to regional contingencies, \nhumanitarian disasters, and political instability which might impact \nour vital interests.\n  Mr. President, as I said at the outset, I think we may be witnessing \nsomething extraordinary underway in Northeast Asia. We don't know \nexactly how it is all going to play out. But we had best begin now to \ndiscuss the potential implications. The decisions we make today will \nshape the strategic environment and the tools we have to advance our \ninterests in East Asia tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5652-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr President, I rise today to speak about the tragedy that \nis gun violence.\n  On May 21, 1998, 15 year-old Kip Kinkel walked into Thurston High \nSchool in Springfield, OR and opened fire with a semiautomatic rifle in \na crowded cafeteria, killing two classmates and wounding two others. \nKinkel had been arrested the day before the shooting for bringing a gun \nto school. However, police decided that he was not a threat and \nreleased him to his parents. The next morning, Kip Kinkel shot his \nparents to death at home before he went to school and opened fire on \nhis classmates.\n  The entire state of Oregon went into shock. The Mayor of Springfield \ncalled upon lawmakers to institute a mandatory detention period for \nstudents caught bringing guns to school. In response, Senator Gordon \nSmith and I introduced S. 2169, a bill that would provide a 25 percent \nincrease in juvenile justice prevention funds to those states that \nimplemented a 72-hour detention period for any student who brought a \ngun to school.\n  The idea behind the bill is straightforward. If a student brings a \ngun to school, he or she must be removed from the school and moved to a \nsecure place where the student can be evaluated and the community \nprotected.\n  A month later, on July 23, 1999 Senator Smith and I offered a \nmodified version of S. 2169 as an amendment to the Senate Commerce-\nJustice-State Appropriations bill. The ``24 Hour Rapid Response for \nKids who Bring a Gun to School,'' amendment passed unanimously. \nUnfortunately, conservative House members, with close ties to the \nNational Rifle Association, objected to any so called ``gun measures'' \non the bill, and the amendment was removed.\n  On May 19, 1999, Senators Smith, Hatch, and I teamed up to offer a \nrevised version of the 24-hour Rapid Response amendment to S. 254, the \nJuvenile Justice bill. The amendment was accepted by the bill managers. \nSadly, the bill has languished in the Conference Committee since that \ntime.\n  Consequently, I have offered the 24-hour Rapid Response amendment on \nS. 1134, the Education Savings Act and S. 2, the Educational \nOpportunities Act, and will continue to offer it until such time that \nschools are safe for all our children. This is not about guns. It's \nabout safety.\n  Since this amendment has not been enacted and because the legislation \nthat would give law enforcement the tools to stop gun violence have \nbeen stalled, I come to the floor today to continue reading the names \nof those who fallen to gun violence.\n  Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by \ngunfire one year ago today, June 22, 1999:\n\n       Sean Atkins, 33, Baltimore, MD; Cedric Biglow, 22, Oklahoma \n     City, OK; Michael A.

Mr. President, recently, the National Reading Panel \nsubmitted its report to Congress. That report shows the best current \nresearch on how children learn to read. One of the significant studies \nincluded in the research is the product of the National Institute for \nChild Health and Human Development. The research actually began as a \nresult of the 1985 Health Research Extension Act which charged NICHD \nwith the research task of finding out why children have trouble \nlearning to read.\n  The U.S. Department of Education reports a 42% increase in the number \nof students with specific learning disabilities receiving special \neducation services over the past decade, with 2.7 million students ages \n6-21 currently being served under the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act. As many as 90 percent of these students have \nsignificant, if not primary, special education needs in the area of \nreading.\n  In the NICHD study, one of the most important discoveries was that \n90-95% of those children with reading difficulties could be on track \nwith their peers by third grade if they are identified at an early age \nand given the appropriate training. And that, Mr. President, is the \ngreatest step we can make toward successful learning for these \nchildren.\n  Currently, there is no readily available, scientifically based, easy-\nto-use screening tool to test children for reading readiness skills. \nAnd, there is no coordinated effort for parents and other early care \nproviders to identify children who show signs of early literacy \ndifficulties and to provide them research-based information and \nsupport.\n  The National Center for Learning Disabilities has recently completed \na plan to provide parents, early childhood professionals, and other \ncare providers with an easy to use early literacy screening tool, \naccess to information about the critical importance of early oral \nlanguage and literacy experiences, and resources that will inform and \nenhance early instruction and learning. The Report to the House-passed \nversion of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related \nAgencies Appropriations bill includes a recommendation that NICHD fund \nthis initiative.\n  I hope that as we work through the differences in this bill, adequate \nfunds will be provided to NICHD to fund the National Early Literacy \nScreening Initiative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5652-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5652-S5653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NOMINATION OF EDWARD GNEHM, JR.

It's \nsomething we would have never dreamed we would be a part of back in the \ndays when we were rooming together just down the street from the United \nStates Capitol at George Washington University.\n  I first met Edward Gnehm, Jr., or ``Skip'' as everyone has come to \nknow him, years ago and we quickly became friends. In fact, Skip was my \nfraternity brother and he is the only brother that I have ever had--of \nany kind--in my life. He was my roommate for three years and he's been \nmy friend ever since. As I hit the books and studied about accounting \nand business, he was working on learning the nuances of International \nRelations in the hope that it would help him become a career Ambassador \nfor the United States of America. I watched him work and dedicate his \nevery waking moment to his dream. You can't help but be inspired by \nsomeone who has that kind of dedication. He was a brilliant guy, but he\n\n[[Page S5653]]\n\nwas also modest about it. He had high expectations for his college \nyears--his teachers did, too. Skip's hard work and determination \nallowed him to exceed and surpass them all. None of us who knew him \nwere surprised by his success.\n  We graduated from college and then, as the years passed, we took on \nthe challenges of our lives. For me, a career as a small businessman \ngave way to a second career in politics. For Skip it was one post, one \nassignment after another, as his work took him literally all over the \nworld.\n  So much of what I know about the world and the people of different \ncountries comes from having seen so much of it through my friend Skip's \neyes. He first served in Katmandu, the capital of Nepal. He also worked \nin many parts of the Middle East. As Ambassador, he faced danger and \nshowed a unique kind of bravery in Kuwait when Saddam Hussein's Army \ntook up residence across the street. Through it all, Skip never \nwavered, and he never lost sight of what he most wanted to do--and that \nwas to serve his country to the best of his ability.\n  That may sound a bit corny to some, but that's all right. In this day \nand age we need more like him who are dedicated to God, country and \nfamily and who live that philosophy from the heart every day. It's \ncalled walking your talk and Skip knows all about that. I know that \nabout him because I know him so well. I canoed with him in the swamps \nof Georgia. You get to know a lot about someone when it's the two of \nyou sharing the experience of being lost in the midst of some \nmysterious aspect of God's creation. Those are quiet times that lead to \nthoughtful reflection and a shared focus on the things that are \nimportant in life.\n\n  Another of the things we have in common was our incredible good \nfortune in picking a spouse. Skip and his wife Peggy and I and my wife \nDiana have built a relationship based on trust, cooperation, \ncommunication and understanding. That kind of bond has helped Skip and \nPeggy to serve their country as Ambassadors overseas and it has helped \nDiana and me to serve the people of Wyoming here in the Senate.\n  He and I have sons and daughters who are the same age. His son, Ed, \nis married to the daughter of the couple who introduced me to my wife, \nDiana. They met at my swearing-in ceremony. The two dads were part of \nmy wedding. And I was there to see their children's marriage in \nWyoming.\n  He recently had a break in his assignments which brought him back to \nWashington where he served at the State Department. It was always good \nto see him and to watch him continue to serve in so many different \ncapacities with the same strength, courage and professionalism he \nbrought to any task. On other assignments here, he worked with the \nDefense Department as State Department Liaison, with Senator Kennedy on \nforeign relations issues and he has also held several other posts. He \nhas served in the United Nations.\n  Although he was doing well ``back home'' Skip wanted to get back on \nthe road and head out for another adventure, another challenge in his \nlife. Now, with the action taken by the Senate today, he has received \nhis next call.\n  I want to thank all of those who made Skip's placement possible. \nFirst, let me acknowledge the efforts of Craig Thomas, my friend and \ncolleague from Wyoming, who held hearings on Skip's nomination. He went \nbeyond the call of duty to get his part of the job done in a timely \nfashion.\n  Senator Helms, too, deserves our appreciation for his expeditious \nwork with the full Committee to get the nomination brought before the \nfull Senate for our consideration.\n  Now, all those years of planning, preparing, and public service have \npaid off. For Skip, it means another post in an already distinguished \ncareer. For us, it means we have a truly dedicated career officer who \nwill be serving us in Australia. I can't think of a better Ambassador \nand representative of the people of the United States than Skip Gnehm. \nHe will love being there and Australia will love coming to know Skip. \nIt's another perfect match!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5653-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT MAJOR OF THE ARMY ROBERT E. HALL\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President. I would like to take this opportunity to \npay tribute to Sergeant Major of the Army (SMA) Robert E. Hall, who \nwill retire today, June 22, 2000. SMA Hall's service to our nation \nspanned more than 32 years, during which he distinguished himself as a \nsoldier, leader, mentor, and advisor to the Chief of Staff of the Army.\n  A native of Gaffney, South Carolina, SMA Hall enlisted in the U.S. \nArmy in February 1968. During his more than three decades of loyal \nservice to the nation, he has held and served in every enlisted \nleadership position from squad leader to command sergeant major. He is \na combat tested leader, serving in Desert Shield/Desert Storm with the \n24th Infantry Division Artillery as its command sergeant major. Before \nbecoming the 11th Sergeant Major of the United States Army, he was \ncommand sergeant major of U.S. Central Command, MacDill Air Force Base, \nTampa, Florida. He also served as command sergeant major, 1st \nBattalion, 5th Air Defense Artillery, Fort Steward, Georgia; \nCommandant, 24th Infantry Division Noncommissioned Officer Academy, \nFort Steward, Georgia; the 24th Division Artillery, Saudi Arabia and \nIraq; the 2nd Infantry Division, Korea; and First U.S. Army, Fort \nMeade, Maryland.\n  During SMA Hall's tenure as advisor to the Chief of Staff of the \nArmy, he made individual soldiers' issues a priority, focusing on \nimproving the quality of life for them and their families. He \nconcentrated on providing servicemen and their loved ones with accurate \nand timely information so that they could make educated and informed \ndecisions about their future in a transforming Army. His personal \nefforts provided significant assistance and helped to ensure the \nsuccessful repeal of the REDUX retirement system. In addition, he \nhelped lay the foundation for pay table reform. This was achieved \nthrough regular interviews with both internal and external media \nsources. He also testified and visited with congressmen more than 19 \ntimes during his tenure as Sergeant Major of the Army. In doing so, he \nestablished a reputation, trust, and rapport with Congress as a caring \nleader who conveyed the needs of enlisted soldiers.\n  SMA Hall's distinguished 32-year career epitomizes the consummate \nprofessional soldier. But above all, he is a loving and caring husband \nand father whose service was enhanced by his wife, Carole, and their \nthree children, Apra, Rea, and Jason.\n  I am certain that my colleagues in the Senate join me in commending \nSMA Hall on his dedicated service to the nation and the United States \nArmy, and wish him well in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5653-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5653-S5654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GUN SAFETY CAMPAIGN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, when six-year old Kayla Rolland, from Mt. \nMorris Township, Michigan, was shot by a fellow classmate, it moved \nmost Americans to tears. Months later, the tears dried and the images \nfaded from view for some, while others turned those tears into action. \nOf course, the most active group has been the Million Moms, who marched \nin my home state of Michigan and around the country to demonstrate for \nsafer, more sensible gun laws.\n  The mothers and others marched on Mothers' Day, 2000 because they are \nfed up with Congress and our continual failure to pass responsible gun \nmeasures that will help protect America's children. Since the school \nshooting in Colorado, and the more recent one in Michigan, Congress has \nfailed to act, so Americans have started to take gun safety into their \nown hands. One of those Americans is Joe Yax of Midland, Michigan.\n  Mr. Yax was driven to action by the school shooting of Kayla Rolland. \nYax said he felt nauseated when he first heard news of the shooting, \nand immediately thought of his own young children, and the unlocked \nguns he kept at home. Yax told the press that he had always planned to \npurchase locking devices for his guns, but he never found the time. \nWhen young Kayla was shot, not only did Mr. Yax find the time to \npurchase trigger locks to make his own children safer, Mr. Yax, who is \na store employee of the Midwest superstore, Meijer, e-mailed the \ncompany's president to see how he could make his community safer.\n\n[[Page S5654]]\n\n  As a result of that e-mail, Meijer, which does not sell guns, but \ndoes sell ammunition, hunting licenses and other supplies, implemented \na gun safety campaign at all of their stores. Sporting-good employees \nnow wear buttons reading, ``Is your home gun safe? Trigger lock `em'' \nand trigger locks are displayed prominently at the sporting-goods \ncounter. In addition, Meijer reduced the price of trigger locking \ndevices to encourage more purchases.\n  I am pleased that Joe Yax took this initiative, and I think he and \nMeijer should be commended for their efforts. Corporate responsibility \nis a necessity if we are going to reduce gun violence. Nevertheless, \nwhile Mr. Yax did what he could to improve gun safety, it is not \nenough. It's time for Congress to follow the lead of Mr. Yax and act to \nmake sure our own children--America's children--are safer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5654-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEDICARE LOCKBOX\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak for a few moments \nto call attention and applaud the actions of the House of \nRepresentatives this week in taking a fundamentally important step \ntoward protecting both the Medicare and Social Security programs.\n  I want all Americans to know that the full House passed Medicare \nLockbox legislation--H.R. 3859, sponsored by Representative Wally \nHerger--by an overwhelming 420-2 margin. What months ago some inside \nthe Beltway said was impossible has happened--one chamber of Congress \nhas spoken in an almost unanimous voice to protect the Medicare and \nSocial Security surpluses.\n  For decades, Congress and the President have used Social Security and \nMedicare surpluses to finance additional government deficits. Last \nyear, for the first time since 1957, Congress balanced the budget \nwithout spending a penny of the Social Security surplus.\n  When Congress accomplished this important goal, I immediately set my \nsights on a higher goal--that is, to protect the Medicare Part A \nsurplus in the same manner. So on November 18, 1999, I introduced S. \n1962, the Social Security and Medicare Safe Deposit Box Act. The bill \nthe House passed yesterday is very similar to my legislation, and I am \nencouraged about the prospects of passing the Medicare Lockbox in the \nSenate and seeing it signed into law.\n  We need to ensure that the payroll taxes Americans contribute to pay \nfor Social Security and Medicare are used solely to pay Social Security \nand Medicare benefits. Any surpluses in these accounts should be used \nto reduce publicly-held debt. It is wrong for Washington to spend this \nmoney on additional government programs or to finance additional \ngovernment deficits.\n  The Medicare lockbox will wall off the surpluses in the Social \nSecurity and Medicare Part A Trust Funds, barring Congress from even \nconsidering a budget that used Social Security or Medicare surpluses to \nfinance deficits in the rest of the government; only a three-fifth vote \nin the Senate and a majority in the House could override the new rule.\n  It will impose discipline and clarity on the spending practices in \nWashington. If Congress or the President wants to spend Medicare Part A \nor Social Security surpluses, Congress will need to have a separate \nvote to suspend the Lockbox protections in order to do so.\n  Not only have nearly all Republicans and Democrats in the House \nendorsed the Lockbox concept; Vice President Al Gore announced several \nweeks ago that he, too, supports erecting a wall of protection around \nthe Medicare surplus. His support is welcome, and his assistance in \nhelping to pass this measure is eagerly anticipated.\n  I urge the leadership on both sides of the aisle to agree to call up \nand pass the Medicare Lockbox. By doing this, we will send the powerful \nmessage that protecting both Medicare and Social Security is our \nhighest priority.\n  It is essential that we make this change. Social Security is \nscheduled to go bankrupt by 2037. Medicare is projected to become \ninsolvent even sooner, in 2023. It is vitally important that we ensure \nthat the government not spend monies dedicated for the trust funds that \nsustain these essential programs.\n  While protecting the Medicare surplus seemed to be an unattainable \ngoal just a few short years ago, this goal is now within our reach. In \naddition to funding the government for fiscal year 2000 without \nspending a penny out of the Social Security trust fund, CBO's new \nprojections will demonstrate that we will have enough revenue available \nto protect the $22 billion Part A Medicare surplus as well.\n\n  It is imperative that we limit spending this year so that we do not \ndip into the Medicare surplus in FY 2001 and in years to come.\n  Both Medicare and Social Security are funded out of payroll taxes \nspecifically delineated for their respective purposes, and are supposed \nto be reserved for those purposes. If there are surpluses in these \naccounts, if these accounts take in more money than is necessary for \ntheir stated purposes in a specific year, then that money should not \nsuddenly be available for general government spending.\n  Any and all surpluses in those two accounts should be reserved for \ntheir stated purpose, or be used to help shore up those accounts. The \nMedicare Lockbox promotes honest accounting, and requires the \ngovernment to use funds for their advertised purposes.\n  Lockboxing Social Security and Medicare surpluses is an essential \nfirst step in securing the long term financial solvency of Medicare and \nSocial Security.\n  The Medicare Lockbox will change the way business is done in \nWashington. I commend the House and Congressman Herger for taking the \nfirst step in protecting the Medicare Part A trust fund.\n  The House bill is not perfect, but it will protect all of the \nMedicare Part A and Social Security trust funds. It also has the \nsupport of 420 members of the House of Representatives. The \noverwhelming support for the Medicare lockbox in the House should send \na powerful signal to the Senate to take up and pass this bill.\n  Passing this law will be the next step on our journey to secure the \nlong term solvency of Social Security and Medicare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5654-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I want to share some thoughts tonight \nabout a major development concerning the investigation involving the \nfinancing of the Vice President's 1996 reelection campaign. First, \nhowever, I would like to say that this matter should have been over \nsome time ago, but the Attorney General declined to appoint an \nIndependent Counsel. The Justice Department attorneys who were involved \nin the investigation of the campaign financing matter have recently \ntestified before the Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, which is \nchaired by Senator Specter and of which I am a\n\n[[Page S5655]]\n\nmember. In my opinion, these attorneys have not produced credible and \njustifiable reasons for the lack of an appointment of an Indpendent \nCounsel or for the extraordinary delays that have incurred in the \ncampaign finance investigation.\n  My 15 years of experience as a prosecutor in the Department of \nJustice convince me that if the Department of Justice was not going to \ncall for an outside prosecutor--an Independent Counsel--to investigate \nVice President Gore, it had an imperative obligation to investigate the \nmatter thoroughly, promptly, and fairly and to bring it to a \nconclusion. But the attorneys for the Department of Justice who have \nbeen involved in this matter for years did not do that.\n  Late this afternoon, the Associated Press and the New York Times \nreported that Robert Conrad, the new head of the Justice Department's \nCampaign Finance Task Force, has requested that Attorney General Reno \nappoint a ``special counsel.'' After the expiration of the Independent \nCounsel Statute, Attorney General Reno has the authority to appoint a \nspecial counsel to investigate Vice President Gore's involvement in the \n1996 campaign fundraising matters.\n  This is the most recent in a long line of highly respected officials \nwithin and without the Department of Justice who have asked for a \ncomplete and independent investigation of various aspects of the Vice \nPresident's fundraising activities. Unfortunately, each and every \nprevious request for an independent investigation has been denied.\n  FBI Director Louis Freeh, himself a former Federal judge and a former \nexperienced and skilled Federal prosecutor who personally prosecuted \nsome of this country's most complex cases, recommended the appointment \nof an Independent Counsel in the fall of 1996.\n  FBI General Counsel Larry Parkinson also recommended an Independent \nCounsel.\n  The former head of the Justice Department's Campaign Finance Task \nForce, Mr. Charles La Bella, also recommended that an Independent \nCounsel be appointed. He actually did so several times after he took \nover as head of the task force in the fall of 1997. He eventually \nresigned from that position.\n  Chief FBI Investigator DeSarno joined in La Bella's recommendations.\n  Ms. Judy Feigin, Mr. La Bella's chief prosecutor in 1998, also \nrecommended that an Independent Counsel be appointed in the campaign \nfinance matter.\n  Finally, Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Bob Litt--the \nassociate Attorney General third in line to Janet Reno at the \nDepartment of Justice, an individual she picked and was approved by the \nPresident--recommended the appointment of an Independent Counsel. He \nswitched his position after opposing such an appointment for some time. \nEven Mr. Litt recommended an Independent Counsel in 1998. But no \nindependent investigation has been approved to date.\n  Mr. Conrad testified before our subcommittee a few days ago. He \nimpressed me as a solid prosecutor with over 10 years experience, with \na substantial record of trying courtroom cases. He understood his duty. \nHe was soft spoken. He was solid. He would never be led into saying \nthings he did not think were proper. We were very impressed with him. \nSince his involvement with the case began approximately six months ago, \nsome five people have pleaded guilty or been convicted of criminal \noffenses arising from the financing of the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign. \nSo his recommendation for an independent investigation is entitled to \nsubstantial weight and is very, very important for America.\n  I sincerely and earnestly request that the Attorney General not deny \nthis most recent request to investigate the Vice President regarding \nthe receipt of illegal campaign contributions.\n  Yesterday, at our hearing, chaired by Senator Specter, Mr. Conrad \ntestified that he had personally interviewed Vice President Gore in \nApril. Mr. Radek, a top Department of Justice official, has recently \nconfirmed, in an NBC Meet the Press interview, that Vice President \nGore's Buddhist temple fundraiser is ``still under investigation by the \ntask force. And if any evidence shows up that Vice President Gore knew \nabout the crimes that were involved there, of course, that would, \nagain, cause a triggering of the now independent counsel regulations in \nthe department.'' I believe Mr. Radek was referring to the new special \ncounsel provisions.\n  News accounts in the New York Post recently reported that at the \ninterview, the Vice President ``blew his top . . . because they asked \nabout his illegal Buddhist temple fundraiser for the first time.''  \nFurther, the Vice President ``seemed stunned'' and ``fumed'' when \nconfronted with these allegations, and the interview ``ended in a \nyelling match between Gore and federal investigators.''\n\n  These are the investigations of Mr. Conrad. After four years, finally \nVice President was asked about this. That is the description of that \ninterview. I would think the Vice President would want to clear up the \nmatter and be candid and forthcoming with the investigator. It would \ncertainly be better for the country. It would certainly allow the \nmatter to have been concluded sooner.\n  What is this campaign financing matter about? Why is it that this \nBuddhist temple matter simply will not go away?\n  On April 29, 1996, in Hacienda Heights, California, Vice President \nGore held a fundraiser at a Buddhist temple--a tax-exempt institution \nwhere you shouldn't be able to hold a fundraiser. Several questions \narose from this fundraiser.\n  Who were the people surrounding Vice President Gore at this event? \nWere the people involved in this event involved in illegal foreign-\nsource contributions?\n  What was the role of the Vice President's staff and DNC staff \nregarding this event? What was the Vice President's role regarding this \nfund-raising event?\n  The poster shows a picture of Vice President Gore at the Buddhist \ntemple fund raiser. To his far right is Maria Hsia, his long-time \nfriend and fund-raiser of more than 10 years, who was recently \nconvicted on 5 felony counts. Her convictions stem directly from the \nBuddhist temple fund-raiser. It is important to note that the \ninvestigation by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee concluded \nthat Maria Hsia is an ``agent of the Chinese government, that she acted \nknowingly in support of it, and that she has attempted to conceal her \nrelationship with the Chinese government.''\n  To Vice President Gore's immediate left is Ted Sieong, who fled the \ncountry as soon as he was implicated in the fund-raising scandals and \nwho we believe remains under criminal investigation. Ted Sioeng is an \noverseas businessman who has been tied to hundreds of thousands of \ndollars in illegal contributions during the 1996 campaign, and the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee concluded that he ``worked, and \nperhaps still works, on behalf of the Chinese government.'' Behind and \nto Vice President Gore's right is John Huang, a Vice Chairman of the \nDNC staff who helped the Vice President plan the Buddhist temple event. \nMr. Huang also subsequently pleaded guilty to a felony count. He raised \nover a million in illegal foreign-source contributions.\n  Finally, behind the Vice President and to his far right is Man Ho \nShih a Buddhist Nun who admitted to another Committee of the Senate \nthat she and others set about destroying documents relating to the \ntemple fund raiser. According to one of her fellow monastics, those \ndocuments were destroyed because they ``did not want to embarrass the \nVice President.'' She also fled the country before she was scheduled to \ntestify in a court of law, and is now under indictment, but evading \ncustody.\n  Moreover, another key piece of evidence which could shed some light \non this issue, the videotape of the event, has never been found. This \nis a serious matter. The rule of law is a serious matter. A legitimate \ninvestigation is required.\n  I make no suggestion that the Vice President is guilty of any crime \nrelated to this event and I sincerely hope that he is not.\n  I am deeply troubled that senior officials in the Justice Department \nhave refused for four years to allow investigators the opportunity to \nask the necessary questions of the Vice President and other senior \nadministration officials so that this matter can be resolved one way or \nthe other.\n\n[[Page S5656]]\n\n  Indeed, we had testimony in our subcommittee, and we went over it two \ndays ago with Mr. Mansfield the former Assistant United States Attorney \nin Los Angeles who started the initial investigation of the Buddhist \ntemple fundraiser.\n  When this news broke late in the 1996 Presidential campaign, Mr. \nMansfield, who had previously and successfully prosecuted a Republican \nCongressman for campaign fraud, was preparing his investigative plan \nfor this event. He testified that in these kind of cases you need to \nmove quickly to get records and documents and interview witnesses. But \nhe was stopped by a political appointee, the chief of the Public \nIntegrity Section in the Department of Justice, by written direction. \nAnd he was not allowed to proceed to interview witnesses, or to issue \nsubpoenas for documents. And, indeed, the Department of Justice \nsubsequently declared that no Independent Counsel was required, \nrejecting the suggestion of Senator McCain, who previously talked on \nthis floor and who wrote at that time calling for an Independent \nCounsel to be appointed. And five other Members joined in that letter.\n  But the Department of Justice attorneys who stopped Mr. Mansfield's \ninvestigation did not interview any witnesses or do any significant \ninvestigation.\n  That is why I believe it is important that Mr. Conrad's request for \nthe appointment of a special counsel should be granted. The Attorney \nGeneral has one more chance to do what I believe is her duty.\n  Mr. Conrad has a reputation as a man of integrity and a solid \nprosecutor who gets results. As the current chief prosecutor who has \nbeen in place for only a few months, has done a fine job in securing 5 \nconvictions and guilty plea agreements in several key cases. One of \nthese involved Pauline Kanchanalak, who was responsible for funneling \napproximately $690,000 of illegal foreign money to the Democratic \nNational Committee and 5 state Democratic parties. More than $457,000 \nof this amount was related to one White House coffee on June 18, 1996, \norganized by John Huang and attended by President Clinton. Another case \ninvolved the conviction of Maria Hsia on March 2, 2000, which resulted, \nin part, from her involvement in the California Buddhist Temple \nfundraiser to funnel more than $100,000 of illegal foreign money into \nthe Clinton-Gore 1996 reelection campaign. Even after her conviction on \nfive felony counts, Maria Hsia is still not in jail. In fact, Judge \nFriedman granted her request to have her passport returned so she can \ntravel freely between China and the United States.\n  At any rate, some progress apparently is being made.

Mr. President, the Nation has been engaged in a raging \ndebate in recent days on whether Gary Graham should be executed in \nTexas.\n  Supporters of the death penalty, including Governor Bush, have said \nthere is no conclusive proof that Texas or any State has killed an \ninnocent person. But apparently Gary Graham, who had the courthouse \ndoors slammed shut on his claim of innocence, won't have a chance to \nprove that he is innocent.\n  I understand, at this moment, that all appeals have now been \ndenied. Mr. Graham is scheduled to be executed before midnight tonight.\n\n  Mr. President, Mr. Graham's plight symbolizes some of the most \nserious concerns with the fairness and accuracy in the administration \nof the death penalty. Don't get me wrong, Mr. Graham is not a good guy. \nHe is a criminal, and, in fact, a very serious offender who deserves \nvery serious punishment.\n  But we need to realize what is about to happen. He is still a human \nbeing who is about to be executed at the hands of the State of Texas. \nThis is a capital matter.\n  Mr. Graham may not have committed a murder for which he is about to \nbe executed. This case raised very serious issues of woefully \nincompetent trial counsel, eyewitness testimony that has never been \nheard by a jury, a conviction based on the sole testimony of just one \neyewitness, and exculpatory ballistic testing data that was not shown \nto the jury.\n  Despite the claims of those who would support the death penalty, Gary \nGraham is not alone. There are other examples of people--in places like \nVirginia, Florida and even Texas--who have been put to death in the \nface of grave doubt about their guilt. We don't have absolute proof of \ntheir innocence. But some day soon, if we continue to let this system \nrun amok, there will be a case where an irrefutably innocent person is \nexecuted.\n  One Governor got it right. Governor Ryan of Illinois called a halt to \nexecutions in his State and appointed a blue ribbon commission to study \nwhether the system could be fixed. Some say, I think essentially with \nno basis, that, yes, that was the right thing to do in Illinois but \nthat Illinois is an aberration. Mr. President, I don't believe for a \nminute that Illinois is an aberration when it comes to the problems \nwith the administration of the death penalty in this country. Governor \nRyan was right when he said that he wanted absolute certainty that the \nperson scheduled to die is guilty. The same certainty should apply to \nthe State of Texas this very evening.\n  A recent study by Columbia University documented that 52 percent of \ndeath penalty cases in Texas were overturned on appeal during the time \nperiod for which the study was done. Nationwide, the Columbia study \nfound an average reversal rate of nearly 7 out of 10 capital cases.\n  What does the Governor of Texas say? He says he is certain that every \nsingle one of the over 100 people executed under his watch as Governor \nwas guilty. I have heard him say this many times. He only considers two \nfactors: Whether the person is guilty, and whether he or she had full \naccess to the courts.\n  This is a matter of life and death. They found out in Illinois that \nit is not that simple. It is not just whether the person is guilty and \nwhether they had full access to the courts. I have no doubt that the \nintense media and public scrutiny of Texas and Governor Bush's \nleadership is warranted in this case. The same kind of problems are \narising in Texas that were discovered in Illinois and that forced \nGovernor Ryan to take the action he did. In Illinois, it was not the \ncriminal justice system that discovered its defects, it was \nundergraduate journalism students at Northwestern University who \nuncovered some of the cases of actual innocence. One person was on \ndeath row 2 days from his execution and ultimately the students were \nable to prove he was actually innocent.\n  The Chicago Tribune, a newspaper in Illinois, was responsible for \nsome of the other proof of innocent individuals on death row, some 13 \nin Illinois. It was college students. It was the press. They were \nparties outside the criminal justice system who had to point out the \ndefects in the system.\n  Now the same thing is happening in Texas tonight. The discussion \nshould not end with media attention to this case. In fact, I was \nappalled this morning. I watch the Today Show every morning as I am \ngetting up and reading the Washington Post. I felt I was watching the \ntrial of a human being, a person who was about to be put to death, on a \nnational television show in a brief segment between advertisements. \nThis cannot be the way we administer justice in this country. In fact, \nI am very concerned about the way in which this is becoming almost a \nsideshow, somehow connected with the Presidential election.\n\n  In fairness to the Governor of Texas and in fairness to Vice \nPresident Al Gore, this should not be on their head as the Presidential \nelection goes forward. They should not be put in the position of having \nto make these decisions as this country comes to the conclusion as to \nwho will be the next President. It is a very unseemly environment in \nwhich to decide whether people should live or die. We have a special \nproblem, and it happens that the State with the most executions \noccurring, the State with many of the\n\n[[Page S5657]]\n\nexecutions coming up, happens to be the State of the presumptive \nRepublican nominee for President.\n  It is a very uncomfortable situation when at the same time all of \nthese questions about the death penalty are being raised. No one can \nsay that this was somehow a partisan attempt to raise the issue because \nthe person who really got this issue going, who really raised the \nquestion, is the Governor of Illinois, the chairman of Governor George \nBush's campaign in Illinois.\n  I plead that we get this issue away from the Presidential election. \nThe only way we can do that is to have a credible and honest review of \nthe fairness and justice in the system by which our Nation imposes the \nsentence of death. We should do exactly what Governor Ryan did in \nIllinois throughout this country: have a moratorium, a pause, during \nwhich a blue ribbon panel of pro and anti-death penalty people and \nother experts examine the issue.\n  We need a temporary halt to executions throughout America. Support \nfor this is growing. California, more than any other State, including \nTexas, has the most inmates sitting on death row awaiting execution. In \na poll of California residents released just today, almost two-thirds \nof Californians continue to support the use of capital punishment. But \nby a margin of nearly 4-1, the poll found that Californians favor a \nhalt to executions while the death penalty is studied. I think that is \nvery interesting. The vast majority still support the death penalty, \nbut they do know that something is wrong and we need a pause.\n  I urge my colleagues to lead the American people and join me as \ncosponsors of legislation that would put a temporary halt to executions \nand establish the National Commission on the Death Penalty, the \nNational Death Penalty Moratorium Act.\n  This rush to judgment concerning Gary Graham is not in keeping with \nAmerican traditions and values of fairness and justice. I ask my \ncolleagues to join in urging a pause before an innocent person is \nexecuted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my \ncolleague from Wisconsin. I agree, innocent lives should not be killed. \nWe should be looking at every possible degree of evidence we possibly \ncan.\n  I wonder if we could also consider all the young, innocent lives that \nare killed at the same time, and somehow put together a blue ribbon \ncommission to determine when life begins, and say we are not going to \nallow that to take place anymore, either.\n  I was just calculating. Across the country, we have every year about \n1.2 million abortions that take place. So today there have been over \n3,000 abortions. I agree that innocent life should not be killed and we \nshould do everything we possibly can to review that evidence, look at \nDNA evidence, anything we can. We should remove any sort of barriers to \ntime limits on tests for DNA evidence. That is an important and good \nthing we should do.\n  But can't we also consider at the same time, when does that innocent \nlife begin? I think those are valid points that we should both pause \nand consider at this time.\n\n\n                        NCAA GAMBLING AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the reason for me to speak this evening \nis to comment about an amendment that Senator McCain and myself, along \nwith two other Members have as well, that is pending on the DOD \nauthorization bill. I am not raising the amendment tonight, but I want \nto talk about it because it has been one of some controversy. I want to \nput forward the issues of why I am so concerned about this issue. It is \nan amendment that Senator McCain, myself, and two other Members \nsponsored, Senator Edwards and Senator Voinovich. It is about college \ngambling--specifically, legalized gambling in America on college \nathletics, college sports.\n  We have currently in the country, banned everywhere in America \nbetting on college sports, except one State--in Nevada it is allowed.\n  There is legalized betting on college sports. If someone wants to bet \non a University of Missouri football game, if they want to bet on a \nUniversity of Kansas basketball game, there is a legal scoreboard, \nthere is a game spread on it, and there is money laid on the table. It \nis all legal.\n  The handle is about $1 billion in Nevada each year betting on schools \nsuch as the University of Kansas, Kansas State University football, the \nFinal Four. It takes place every year. That has been growing \nsubstantially at the level of the handle, and it is going to keep on \ngrowing.\n  The problem is it is tarnishing our amateur athletics. It is giving a \nblack eye to college sports. We are getting more and more young people \nhooked into gambling because one of the key gateways to starting \ngambling is sports betting. A high number of young people start betting \non college sports. Our athletes are being sucked into it, and we have \nseen more cases of point shaving in the decade of the nineties by \ncollege athletes than the entire record of the NCAA before that.\n  The famous case about Northwestern University that broke during the \nFinal Four 2 years ago was a point shaving case. We had at a press \nconference Kevin Pendergast, a former Notre Dame placekicker, the \nmastermind who orchestrated the shaving case. He stated he would never \nhave been able to pull off this scheme without the ability to legally \nlay a large amount of money on the Las Vegas sports books.\n  He said: If I do not have that, I have to pull off two shams. I have \nto get the athletes to shave the case, and I have to sham some bookie \nas well. This way, if I can get the athletes to line up and not lose \nthe game--the point is not to lose the game, just do not make the \nspread. If it is a 10-point spread, just do not make it. It is easy to \ndo. A player does not have to miss a shot. Unfortunately, we have been \nlearning a lot about it. Where they usually do it is on defense. Let \nyour man beat you: He got by me, coach; I didn't mean to.\n  You do not stand at the foul line and look at the shot and say: I am \nthrowing a brick up there, when you do not normally. This is getting \npretty sophisticated now. The player lets his opponent slip by, he \njukes you one way, off you go: He scored on me, coach; I didn't mean \nfor it to happen.\n  The points were not made, the money is shaved, and away we go.\n  Not only is it our athletes, but it is also our referees. This really \nshould upset some people. Listen to this. I watch games and a lot of \ntimes I do not think the refs get it right. I would not want to have \ntheir job, but I get pretty irritated, particularly when it is my team \nand the call goes against it.\n  A study conducted by the University of Michigan found that 84 percent \nof college referees said they had participated in some form of gambling \nsince beginning their careers as referees. Nearly 40 percent also \nadmitted placing bets on sporting events and 20 percent said they \ngambled on the NCAA basketball tournament.\n  It gets worse. Two referees said they were aware of the spread on a \ngame, and it affected the way they officiated the contest. Some were \nasked to fix games they were officiating, and others were aware of \nreferees who ``did not call the game fairly because of gambling \nreasons.''\n  Several weeks ago, newspaper articles from Las Vegas and Chicago \ndetailed how illegal and legal gambling are sometimes connected. Even \nour referees are being pulled into this gambling situation.\n\n  This legislation by the four sponsors was a recommendation of the \nNational Gambling Impact Study Commission that met for 2 years on the \nimpact of gambling. They said this seedy influence should not be \nallowed to persist in college sports and on our athletes.\n  The Commerce Committee held hearings on this. I said at least provide \na State opt-out; allow a way for the University of Kansas, Kansas State \nUniversity, Wichita State University to get off the board so they can \npetition you so you do not bet on them.\n  Currently, no one can bet on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. It \nis illegal in Nevada to bet on a Nevada college team. They said it \nmight be unseemly or it might appear to be too much influence, to which \nI thought: All right. That sounds like a legitimate reason to me. Allow \nme to get the University of Kansas and Kansas State University off.\n  They said: No, we are not going to do that. We will not allow your \nlegislatures to petition; we will not allow your Governors to petition \nor your\n\n[[Page S5658]]\n\npresidents to petition; we are going to leave them on the book because \nif you want out, there will probably be others who will want out as \nwell. We do not want to let you out of this. This is a $1 billion \nhandle for us, and we get a lot of business.\n  The problem is, it has given a black eye to college sports. Listen to \nwhat some of the coaches are saying about this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter Senator McCain and I received \nand a list of organizations supporting this legislation be printed in \nthe Record. They include, among others, the National Collegiate \nAthletic Association and the National Council on Education.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 24, 2000.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Hon. Sam Brownback,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators McCain and Brownback: The undersigned wish to \n     express their full endorsement for the legislation you have \n     introduced to eliminate all exceptions for legalized betting \n     on high-school, college and Olympic sports.

We believe this \n     legislation will send a clear, no-nonsense message that it is \n     wrong to gamble on college students.\n       The proposed legislation is especially important to our \n     community because it will:\n       Eliminate the use of Nevada sports books for gain in point \n     shaving scandals.\n       Eliminate the legitimacy of publishing point spreads and \n     advertising for sports tout services.\n       Re-sensitize young people and the general public to the \n     illegal nature of gambling on collegiate sports.\n       Reduce the numbers of people who are introduced to sports \n     gambling.\n       Eliminate conflicting messages as we combat illegal sports \n     wagering that say it is okay to wager on college some places \n     but not in others.\n       You have permission to use our association's name publicly \n     in support of S. 2340.

Mr. President, one of the key coaches was Coach \nCalhoun from the University of Connecticut, U. Conn. He stated, while \nthis legislation does not solve the problem, ``it is a good starting \npoint.'' That is exactly what the legislation is, a beginning that will \nsend a clear message to our communities and, more importantly, to our \nkids that gambling on student athletics is wrong and threatens the \nintegrity of college sports.\n  We are asking for a simple amendment on this authorization bill. We \nwould agree to an hour of debate equally divided between both sides. I \nam willing to start tonight. I am willing to go through the night. I am \nwilling to go tomorrow, Saturday to bring this issue before this body. \nIt is an important matter, and it needs to come before this body. We \nseek an up-or-down vote on it.\n  Some people have raised questions about it. This is the time and \nplace to do it. We are ready. It is time to do it. It was voted through \nthe Commerce Committee with only two dissenting votes. Let's bring it \nup. That is why Senator McCain and I are pressing so aggressively to \nget this amendment considered on the DOD authorization. We will do it \nin a limited amount of time, whenever, an up-or-down vote. Let's just \npress this issue through and see what the will of the body is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5658-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                IN HONOR OF THE HONORABLE NEIL L. LYNCH\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am honored to rise today and pay \ntribute to a public servant who has selflessly contributed his legal \nknowledge and experience to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its \nresidents for almost 50 years. Today, the Honorable Neil L. Lynch, \nAssociate Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, gathers \nwith this friends and family to celebrate a career marked by military \nservice, a devotion to family, and a true love of the law.\n  Beginning in 1952 with his service as a First Lieutenant Adjutant in \nthe 42nd Air Rescue Squadron of the United States Air Force, Justice \nLynch set a standard of achievement and professionalism that would \ncarry him to the pinnacle of the legal profession. After working at \nHale, Sanderson, Byrne & Morton, he began teaching at the new England \nSchool of Law. He served as Chief Legal Counsel and Secretary-Treasurer \nat the Massachusetts Port Authority, worked again in the private sector \nwith Herlihy & O'Brian, then return to New England School of law as a \nProfessor of Law.\n  Judge Lynch's skills and understanding of the law were well known in \nMassachusetts by the 1970's, and few were surprised when Governor Ed \nKing appointed him to be his Chief Legal Counsel from 1979 to 1981. \nThis ascension was completed by the Governor's nomination of Justice \nLynch for a seat on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, a \nposition he has held with unquestioned professionalism and integrity \nsince 1981.\n  While a member of the Court, Justice Lynch has reached out to all \nlevels of law enforcement in an effort to pool and maximize the \nconsiderable knowledge and resources amongst his peers. As Dean and \nPresident of the Flaschner Judicial Institute, Justice Lynch oversaw a \nprofessional enhancement program that shares information on new \ninitiatives and changes in the field with his colleagues, he returned \nto academia to teach at the Massachusetts School of Law, and issued the \nlandmark study, ``Commission to Study Racial and Ethnic Bias in the \nCourts,'' in 1994.\n  Now, instead of navigating through complex legal issues, Justice \nLynch will be navigating his beloved ``Sui Generis'' through the \nwaterways of the East Coast. He leaves the court to spend more time \nwith Kathleen and his family and their growing number of grandchildren. \nMr. President, I join all of justice Lynch's colleagues, past and \npresent, and all of the people he has touched in the course of his \nprofessional life, in thanking him for his dedication to justice and \nequality under the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5658-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5658-S5659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO JIM COLLINS--50 YEARS IN JOURNALISM\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMr. Jim Collins, editor of the Willoughby, Ohio, News-Herald newspaper \non the occasion of his 50 years in journalism.\n  From an early age, Jim had newspaper ink flowing through his veins. \nBy the time he was 12, he was working as a paper boy for the News-\nHerald, delivering the twice-weekly paper to homes all over town. It's \nhard to imagine today, but subscribers paid just six cents a week for \nthe News-Herald back in 1941.\n  After graduating from Kent State University in 1950, Jim was hired as \na full-time reporter for the News-Herald. He served in this capacity \nuntil 1952, when Jim answered the call of his government and served a \ntwo-year tour of duty in the Army.\n\n[[Page S5659]]\n\n  When Jim returned to Willoughby, he resumed his duty as a reporter \nfor the News-Herald until 1959. That year, the News-Herald's owners \nasked Jim to manage two other papers that they owned, the Parma News \nand the Brooklyn News. Jim became the one-person operation for both \npapers for 15 months whereupon he returned to the News-Herald.\n  By 1967, Jim had worked his way up to become editor of the newspaper. \nIn fact, throughout his tenure with the News-Herald, Jim has held a \nvariety of editorial positions including assistant editor, city editor, \nmanaging editor and executive editor.\n  All throughout his career, Jim has accumulated a number of well-\ndeserved awards, including the Associated Press of Ohio's first place \naward for commentary in 1982, the first place award for column writing \nin 1991, and the first place award for editorial commentary just two \nyears ago. Jim has also been named the 1987 Willoughby Chamber of \nCommerce's Distinguished Citizen of the Year and received the Lake \nParks Foundation award in 1994.\n  I have always said that the measure of a person can be determined by \nthe work he or she does individually, or through the organizations to \nwhich he or she belongs, that benefit others. Jim has given of himself \nto numerous organizations having served as the chairman of the West \nEnd-YMCA board of managers and president of the Lake County YMCA. He is \nalso a member of the Willoughby Rotary Club, Willoughby School of Fine \nArts, the Lake County Blue Coats, the Willoughby Jaycees and several \narea chambers of commerce. Jim is also the first person to become an \nhonorary lifetime member of the Lake County Police Chiefs Association \nand is a member of the Cleveland Foundation Lake-Geauga Fund Committee.\n  Jim is a true man of integrity, and it is his integrity that has \nearned him the respect of journalists and politicians across the state. \nHe can be brutally honest, but he is always fair and he is never afraid \nto tell the truth. It is his character that has allowed him to remain \nin journalism for five decades.\n  Throughout his years with the News-Herald, he has worked to put \ntogether one of the most competitive papers in northeastern Ohio. Jim \nprovides his readers a broader level of reporting than most regional \npapers, paying attention not only to local news, but to state and \nnational news as well. Because of his leadership, circulation has \ngrown. In addition, Jim's initiative has allowed for the creation of a \nforum for candidates--in conjunction with Lakeland Community College--\nthat makes available to the public where candidates stand on particular \nissues.\n  While some may think that 50 years in the newspaper business is \nenough for any person, Jim is not slowing down and is by no means even \nclose to retiring. That's good news, because I would have a very hard \ntime imagining the News-Herald without Jim. I have enjoyed working with \nJim and I look forward to working with him for many more years to come.\n  Mr. President, Jim Collins has been a real friend to me in all the \nyears that I have known him. He has been an inspiration to me and so \nmany others throughout his life and his career. I congratulate him for \nhis dedication to the citizens of Ohio and for his 50 years of \naccomplishments in journalism. He has much to be proud of, and I \nconsider myself very lucky to know him. I wish him many more years of \nsuccess.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5659-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ROBERT J. LURTSEMA\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to a lover of music and an institution on \nBoston radio who recently passed away at age 68. In his long and \nbrilliant career, Robert J. Lurtsema touched vast numbers of people in \nthe Boston area with his ``deep organ voice'' and his love of classical \nmusic. For twenty-nine years, he was host and producer of ``Morning Pro \nMusica'' for radio station WGBH in our city, and he was widely loved \nand admired.\n  A native of Cambridge, Massachusetts, Robert J., as he was known to \nmany, graduated from Boston University School of Journalism. He joined \nWGBH in 1971 as a weekend host, and after four months became the host \nand producer of ``Morning Pro Musica.''

Mr. President, on June 25, 1950, Communist North \nKorea invaded South Korea with approximately 135,000 troops, and in \ndoing so initiated the Korean War. On June 25, 2000, the citizens of \nTraverse City, Michigan, will commemorate the 50th Anniversary of this \nunfortunate event, and will recognize the efforts of the many men and \nwomen who served the United States Armed Forces during the Korean War, \nwith the dedication of a Korean War Memorial.\n  The Korean War is often referred to as our ``forgotten war.'' Fought \nbetween World War II and the Vietnam War, I believe it safely can be \nsaid that it never found its proper place among our Nation's history \ntextbooks. This weekend, the 50th Anniversary of the North Korean \ninvasion, provides all of us with an opportunity to take a moment to \nrecognize the men and women who served in the Korean War--nearly six \nmillion individuals. Their sacrifices and contributions for the sake of \nour Nation must never be overlooked or forgotten.\n  Earlier this year, I was very pleased to co-sponsor Senate Joint \nResolution 39, a bicameral resolution that recognizes the 50th \nAnniversary of the Korean War, and the service by the members of our \nArmed Forces during that conflict. Today, I am pleased to do my part to \nensure that the Korean War ceases to be thought of as our ``forgotten \nwar.'' There is no doubt in my mind--and there should be no doubt in \nanyone else's--that the men and women who served in Korea, and \nparticularly the 54,260 soldiers who gave their lives in Korea, deserve \nmuch better than that.\n  Local communities can do much to remedy the situation as well. I \ncommend Traverse City, Michigan, for constructing this Korean War \nmemorial, and for taking the opportunity on Sunday, June 25, 2000, to \npay tribute to the men and women who served during the Korean War. We \nmust show these men and women that we appreciate their efforts and \nsacrifices on behalf on our great Nation, and that we thank them for \ntheir extraordinary efforts. In doing this, we will illustrate to them \nthat they have not been forgotten; rather, the case is far from this.\n  Mr. President, the men and women who served our Nation in Korea did \nso at a time when its very foundation--democracy--was being threatened \nby the terrible force of communism. On behalf of the entire United \nStates Senate, I congratulate the citizens of Traverse City, Michigan, \nfor recognizing and honoring this service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5659-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5659-4", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5659-S5660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE 1979 IRANIAN \n   EMERGENCY AND ASSETS BLOCKING--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 116\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport;\n\n[[Page S5660]]\n\nwhich was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act \n(IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I transmit herewith a 6-month periodic \nreport on the national emergency with respect to Iran that was declared \nin Executive Order 12170 of November 14, 1979.\n                                                  William J.

The United States and the Russian \nFederation have entered into a series of agreements that provide for \nthe conversion of highly enriched uranium (HEU) extracted from Russian \nnuclear weapons into low enriched uranium (LEU) for use in commercial \nnuclear reactors. The Russian Federation recently suspended its \nperformance under these agreements because of concerns that payments \ndue to it under these agreements may be subject to attachment, \ngarnishment, or other judicial process, in the United States. \nAccordingly, I have issued an Executive Order to address the unusual \nand extraordinary risk of nuclear proliferation created by this \nsituation.\n  A major national security goal of the United States is to ensure that \nfissile material removed from Russian nuclear weapons pursuant to \nvarious arms control and disarmament agreements is dedicated to \npeaceful uses, subject to transparency measures, and protected from \ndiversion to activities of proliferation concern. The United States and \nthe Russian Federation entered into an international agreement in \nFebruary 1993 to deal with these issues as they relate to the \ndisposition of HEU extracted from Russian nuclear weapons (the ``HEU \nAgreement''). Under the HEU Agreement, 500 metric tons of HEU will be \nconverted to LEU over a 20-year period. This is the equivalent of \n20,000 nuclear warheads.\n  Additional agreements were put in place to effectuate the HEU \nAgreement, including agreements and contracts on transparency, on the \nappointment of executive agents to assist in implementing the \nagreements, and on the disposition of LEU delivered to the United \nStates (collectively, the ``HEU Agreements''). Under the HEU \nAgreements, the Russian Federation extracts HEU metal from nuclear \nweapons. That HEU is oxidized and blended down to LEU in the Russian \nFederation. The resulting LEU is shipped to the United States for \nfabrication into fuel for commercial reactors. The United States \nmonitors this conversion process through the Department of Energy's \nWarhead and Fissile Material Transparency Program.\n  The HEU Agreements provide for the Russian Federation to receive \nmoney and uranium hexafluoride in payment for each shipment of LEU \nconverted from the Russian nuclear weapons. The money and uranium \nhexafluoride are transferred to the Russian Federation executive agent \nin the United States.\n  The Russian Federation recently suspended its performance under the \nHEU Agreements because of concerns over possible attachment, \ngarnishment, or other judicial process with respect to the payments due \nto it as a result of litigation currently pending against the Russian \nFederation. In response to this concern, the Minister of Atomic Energy \nof the Russian Federation, Minister Adamov, notified Secretary \nRichardson on May 5, 2000, of the decision of the Russian Federation to \nhalt shipment of LEU pending resolution of this problem. This \nsuspension presents an unusual and extraordinary threat to U.S. \nnational security goals due to the risk of nuclear proliferation caused \nby the accumulation of weapons-usable fissile material in the Russian \nFederation.\n  The executive branch and the Congress have previously recognized and \ncontinue to recognize the threat posed to the United States national \nsecurity from the risk of nuclear proliferation created by the \naccumulation of weapons-usable fissile material in the Russian \nFederation. This threat is the basis for significant programs aimed at \nCooperative Threat Reduction and at controlling excess fissile \nmaterial. The HEU Agreements are essential tools to accomplish these \noverall national security goals. Congress demonstrated support for \nthese agreements when it authorized the purchase of Russian uranium in \n1998, Public Law 105-277, and also enacted legislation to enable \nRussian uranium to be sold in this country pursuant to the USEC \nPrivatization Act, 42 U.S.C. 2297h-10.\n\n  Payments made to the Russian Federation pursuant to the HEU \nAgreements are integral to the operation of this key national security \nprogram. Uncertainty surrounding litigation involving these payments \ncould lead to a long-term suspension of the HEU Agreements, which \ncreates the risk of nuclear proliferation. This is an unacceptable \nthreat to the national security and foreign policy of the United \nStates.\n  Accordingly, I have concluded that all property and interests in \nproperty of the government of the Russian Federation directly related \nto the implementation of the HEU Agreements should be protected from \nthe threat of attachment, garnishment, or other judicial process. I \nhave, therefore, exercised my authority and issued an Executive Order \nthat provides:\n  --except to the extent provided in regulations, orders, directives, \n    or licenses that may be issued pursuant to the order, all property \n    and interests in property of the Government of the Russian \n    Federation directly related to the implementation of the HEU \n    Agreements that are in the United States, that hereafter come \n    within the United States, or hereafter come within the possession \n    or control of United States persons, including their overseas \n    branches, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, \n    withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in;\n  --unless licensed or authorized pursuant to the order, any \n    attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or \n    other judicial process is null and void with respect to any \n    property or interest in property blocked pursuant to the order; and\n  --that all heads of departments and agencies of the United States \n    Government shall continue to take all appropriate measures within \n    their authority to further the full implementation of the HEU \n    Agreements.\n  The effect of this Executive Order is limited to property that is \ndirectly related to the implementation of the HEU Agreements. Such \nproperty will be clearly defined by the regulations, orders, \ndirectives, or licenses that will be issued pursuant to this Executive \nOrder.\n  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued. The order \nis effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 22, 2000.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act with \nrespect to payments made under the prospective payment system for home \nhealth services furnished under the Medicare program; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n            THE EQUAL ACCESS TO HOME HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Collins in introducing the Equal Access to Medicare Home Health \nCare Act. This legislation will protect patient access to home health \ncare under Medicare, and ensure that providers are able to continue \nserving seniors who reside in medically underserved areas.\n  Medicare was enacted in 1965, under the leadership of President \nLyndon Johnson, as a promise to the American people that, in exchange \nfor their years of hard work and service to our country, their health \ncare would be protected in their golden years. Today, over 30 million \nseniors rely on the Medicare home health benefit to receive the care \nthey need to maintain their independence and remain in their own homes, \nand to avoid the need for more costly hospital or nursing home care.\n  Home health care is critical. It is a benefit to which all eligible \nMedicare beneficiaries, regardless of where they live, should be \nentitled. But, this benefit is being seriously undermined. Since \nenactment of the Balanced Budget Act, BBA, of 1997, federal funding for \nhome health care has plummeted. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, CBO, Medicare spending on home health care dropped 45 percent \nin the last two fiscal years--from $17.5 billion in 1998 to $9.7 \nbillion in 1999--far beyond the original amount of savings sought by \nthe BBA. Across the country, these cuts have forced over 2,500 home \nhealth agencies to close and over 500,000 patients to lose their \nservices.\n  In my own State of Massachusetts--a state that, because of economic \nefficiency, sustained a disproportionate share of the BBA cuts in \nMedicare home health funding--28 home health agencies have closed, 6 \nmore have turned in their Medicare provider numbers and chosen to opt \nout of the Medicare program, and 12 more have been forced to merge in \norder to consolidate their limited resources. The home health agencies \nthat have continued to serve patients despite the deep cuts in Medicare \nfunding reported net operating losses of $164 million in 1998. The loss \nof home health care providers in Massachusetts has cost 10,000 patients \naccess to home health services. Consequently, many of the most \nvulnerable residents in my state are being forced to enter hospitals \nand nursing homes, or going without any help at all.\n  To compound the problem, without Congressional action, Medicare \npayments for home health care will be automatically cut by an \nadditional 15 percent next year. It is critical that we defend \nAmerica's seniors against future cuts in home health services, and this \nbill will eliminate the additional 15 percent cut in Medicare home \nhealth payments mandated by the BBA. However, we must do more than \nattempt to stop future cuts. Indeed, it is equally as important that we \nbegin to provide relief to home health providers who are already \nstruggling to care for patients.\n  During the first year of implementation of the Interim Payment \nSystem, IPS, thousands of home health care agencies incurred \noverpayments because they were not notified of their per beneficiary \nlimits until long after the limits were imposed. The provisions of this \nbill would extend the repayment period for IPS overpayments without \ninterest for three years, and thereafter at an interest rate lower than \ncurrently mandated.\n  Under IPS, even agencies which did not incur overpayments were placed \non precarious financial footing because of insufficient payments, \nparticularly for high-cost and long-term patients. Accordingly, it is \ncritical that we bolster the efforts of all home health care providers \nto transcend their current operating deficits, especially as they \ntransition from the Interim Payment System to the Prospective Payment \nSystem, PPS.\n  The BBA specified that, in aggregate, PPS payments to home health \nproviders must equal IPS payments. This adjustment--the budget \nneutrality factor--is expected to reduce PPS payments for home health \nservices by 22 percent below the average Medicare costs prior to \nenactment of the BBA. In order to provide relief to home health \nproviders in this budget neutral context, the Equal Access to Medicare \nHome Health Care Act would establish a 10 percent add-on to the \nepisodic base payment for patients in rural areas, to reflect the \nincreasing costs of travel, and a ``reasonable cost'' add-on for \nsecurity services utilized by providers in our urban areas. These add-\nons ensure that patients in our medically underserved communities \ncontinue to receive the home care they need and deserve.\n  Finally, this legislation would encourage the incorporation of \ntelehealth technology in home care plans by allowing cost reporting of \nthe telemedicine services utilized by agencies. Telemedicine has \ndemonstrated tremendous potential in bringing modern health care \nservices to patients who reside in areas where providers and technology \nare scarce. Cost reporting will provide the data necessary to develop a \nfair and reasonable Medicare reimbursement policy for telehomecare and\n\n[[Page S5664]]\n\nbring the benefits of modern science and technology to our nation's \nunderserved.\n  Unless we increase the federal commitment to the Medicare home health \ncare benefit, we can only expect to continue to imperil the health of \nan entire generation. We must act to deliver on that promise that \nPresident Johnson made 25 years ago--our nation's seniors deserve no \nless.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Abraham):\n  S. 2767. A bill to authorize the enforcement by State and local \ngovernments of certain Federal Communications Commission regulations \nregarding use of citizens band radio equipment; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                   cb radio interference legislation\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to once again \nintroduce a bill to deal with the all too common problem of \ninterference with residential home electronic equipment caused by \nunlawful use of citizens band, or CB, radios. This is the third \nCongress in which I have offered this legislation. In 1998, it was \nnearly enacted as part of an anti-slamming bill. I hope that this year, \nwe can finally put this common sense bill into law.\n  The problem of CB radio interference can be extremely distressing for \nresidents who cannot have a telephone conversation, watch television, \nor listen to the radio without being interrupted by a neighbor's \nillegal use of a CB radio. Unfortunately, under the current law, those \nresidents have little recourse. The bill I am introducing today will \nprovide those residents with a practical solution to this problem.\n  Until recently, the FCC enforced its rules outlining what equipment \nmay or may not be used for CB radio transmissions, how long \ntransmissions may be broadcast, what channels may be used, as well as \nmany other technical requirements. The FCC also used to investigate \nneighbor's complaints that a CB radio enthusiast's transmissions \ninterfered with their use of home electronic and telephone equipment. \nThe FCC receives thousands of such complaints annually.\n  For the past five years, I have worked on behalf of constituents \nbothered by persistent interference of nearby CB radio transmissions, \nin some cases caused by unlawful use of radio equipment. In each case, \nthe constituents have sought my help in securing an FCC investigation \nof the complaint. And in each case, the FCC indicated that due to a \nlack of resources, they no longer investigate radio frequency \ninterference complaints. Instead of investigation and enforcement, the \nFCC only provides self-help information which the consumer may use to \nlimit the interference on their own.\n  This situation is understandable given the rising number of \ncomplaints for things like slamming. The resources of the FCC are \nlimited, and there is only so much they can do to address complaints of \nradio interference.\n  Nonetheless, this problem is extremely annoying and frustrating to \nthose who experience radio interference. Many residents implement the \nself-help measures recommended by FCC such as installing filtering \ndevices to prevent the unwanted interference, working with their \ntelephone company, or attempting to work with the neighbor they believe \nis causing the interference. In many cases these self-help measures are \neffective.\n  However, in some cases filters and other technical solutions fail to \nsolve the problem because the interference is caused by the unlawful \nuse of CB radio equipment such as unauthorized linear amplifiers.\n  Municipal residents, after being denied an investigation or \nenforcement from the FCC, frequently contact their city or town \ngovernment and ask them to police the interference. However, the \nCommunications Act of 1934 provides exclusive authority to the Federal \nGovernment for the regulation of radio. This preempts municipal \nordinances or State laws that regulate radio frequency interference \ncaused by unlawful use of CB radio equipment. This situation creates an \ninteresting dilemma for municipal governments. They can neither pass \ntheir own ordinances to control CB radio interference, nor can they \nrely on the agency with exclusive jurisdiction over interference to \nenforce the very Federal law which preempts them.\n  Let me give an example of the kind of frustrations people have \nexperienced in attempting to deal with these problems. Shannon Ladwig, \na resident of Beloit, WI is fighting to end CB interference with her \nhome electronic equipment that has plagued her family for many years. \nShannon worked within the existing system by asking for an FCC \ninvestigation, installing filtering equipment on her telephone, \nattempting to work with the neighbor causing the interference, and so \non. Nothing has been effective.\n  Here are some of the annoyances Shannon has experienced. Her \nanswering machine picks up calls for which there is no audible ring, \nand at times records ghost messages. Often, she cannot get a dial tone \nwhen she or her family members wish to place an outgoing call. During \ntelephone conversations, the content of the nearby CB transmission can \nfrequently be heard and on occasion, her phone conversations are \ninexplicably cut off. Ms. Ladwig's TV transmits audio from the CB \ntransmission rather than the television program her family is watching. \nShannon never knows if the TV program she taped with her VCR will \nactually record the intended program or whether it will contain \nprofanity from nearby CB radio conversation.\n  Shannon did everything she could to solve the problem and years later \nshe still feels like a prisoner in her home, unable to escape the \nbroadcasting whims of a CB operator using illegal equipment with \nimpunity. Shannon even went to her city council to demand action. The \nBeloit City Council responded by passing an ordinance allowing local \nlaw enforcement to enforce FCC regulations--an ordinance the council \nknows is preempted by Federal law. The bill I am introducing today \nwould allow Beloit's ordinance to stand.\n\n  The problems experienced by Beloit residents are by no means isolated \nincidents. I have received very similar complaints from at least 10 \nother Wisconsin communities in the last several years in which whole \nneighborhoods are experiencing persistent radio frequency interference. \nSince I have begun working on this issue, my staff has also been \ncontacted by a number of other congressional offices who are also \nlooking for a solution to the problem of radio frequency interference \nin their States or districts caused by unlawful CB use. The city of \nGrand Rapids, Michigan, in particular, has contacted me about this \nlegislation because they face a persistent interference problem very \nsimilar to that in Beloit. I am pleased that Senators Levin and Abraham \njoin me today in cosponsoring this legislation.\n  In all, the FCC receives more than 30,000 radio frequency \ninterference complaints annually--most of which are caused by CB \nradios. Unfortunately, the FCC no longer has the staff, resources, or \nthe field capability to investigate these complaints and localities are \nblocked from exercising any jurisdiction to provide relief to their \nresidents.\n  My bill resolves this Catch-22, by allowing states and localities to \nenforce statutes or ordinances prohibiting selected violations of the \nFCC regulations. This gives local law enforcement the ability to \nenforce existing FCC regulations regarding unauthorized CB equipment \nand frequencies while maintaining exclusive Federal jurisdiction over \nthe regulation of radio services. It is a commonsense solution to a \nvery frustrating and real problem which cannot be addressed under \nexisting law. Residents should not be held hostage to a Federal law \nwhich purports to protect them but cannot be enforced.\n  Now this amendment is by no means a panacea for the problem of radio \nfrequency interference. It is intended only to help localities solve \nthe most egregious and persistent problems of interference--those \ncaused by unauthorized use of CB radio equipment and frequencies. In \ncases where interference is caused by the legal and licensed operation \nof any radio service, residents will need to resolve the interference \nusing the FCC self-help measures that I mentioned earlier.\n  In many cases, interference can result from inadequate home \nelectronic equipment immunity from radio frequency interference. Those \nproblems can only be resolved by installing filtering equipment and by \nimproving the\n\n[[Page S5665]]\n\nmanufacturing standards of home telecommunications equipment.\n  The electronic equipment manufacturing industry, represented by the \nTelecommunications Industry Association and the Electronics Industry \nAssociation, working with the Federal Communications Commission, has \nadopted voluntary standards to improve the immunity of telephones from \ninterference. Those standards were adopted by the American National \nStandards Institute last year. Manufacturers of electronic equipment \nshould be encouraged to adopt these new ANSI standards. Consumers have \na right to expect that the telephones they purchase will operate as \nexpected without excessive levels of interference from legal radio \ntransmissions. Of course, Mr. President, these standards assume legal \noperation of radio equipment and cannot protect residents from \ninterference from illegal operation of CB equipment.\n  This bill also does not address interference caused by other radio \nservices, such as commercial stations or amateur stations. I have \nworked with the American Radio Relay League (ARRL), an organization \nrepresenting amateur radio operators, frequently referred to as ``ham'' \noperators, to address a number of concerns that they raised about the \noriginal versions of my bill. ARRL was concerned that while the bill \nwas intended to cover only illegal use of CB equipment, FCC-licensed \namateur radio operators might inadvertently be targeted and prosecuted \nby local government and law enforcement. ARRL also expressed concern \nthat local law enforcement might not have the technical abilities to \ndistinguish between ham stations and CB stations and might not be able \nto determine what CB equipment was FCC-authorized and what equipment is \nillegal.\n  I have worked with the ARRL and amateur operators from Wisconsin to \naddress these concerns. As a result of those discussions, this \namendment incorporates a number of provisions suggested by the league. \nFirst, the amendment makes clear that the limited authority provided to \nlocalities in no way diminishes or affects the FCC's exclusive \njurisdiction over the regulation of radio.\n  Second, the amendment clarifies that possession of a FCC license to \noperate a radio service for the operation at issue, such as an amateur \nstation, is a complete protection against any local government action \nauthorized by this amendment. Unlike CB operators, amateur radio \nenthusiasts are not only individually licensed by the FCC but they also \nself-regulate. The ARRL is very involved in resolving interference \nconcerns both among their own members and between ham operators and \nresidents experiencing problems.\n  Third, the bill also provides for a FCC appeal process by any radio \noperator who is adversely affected by a local government action under \nthis amendment. The FCC will make determinations as to whether the \nlocality acted properly within the limited jursidiction this \nlegislation provides and the FCC will have the power to reverse the \naction if they acted improperly. And fourth, my legislation requires \nthe FCC to provide States and localities with technical guidance on how \nto determine whether a CB operator is acting within the law.\n  In addition, the bill has been modified to address concerns raised by \ntruckers, who feared that local law enforcement would use reports of CB \ninterference to indiscriminately stop and search trucks in the area. \nThe bill now provides specifically that local governments may not seek \nto enforce the FCC regulations with respect to a CB radio on board a \ncommercial motor vehicle unless there is probable cause to believe that \nsomeone in the vehicle is operating a CB radio in violation of the \nregulations. This provision should ensure that this new authority is \nnot used as a pretext to harass truckers.\n  Again, Mr. President, my bill is narrowly targeted to resolve \npersistent interference with home electronic equipment caused by \nillegal CB operation. Under my bill, localities cannot establish their \nown regulations on CB use outside of the already existing FCC \nregulations. This bill will not resolve all interference problems and \nit is not intended to do so. Some interference problems require \ncontinued attentions from the FCC, the telecommunications manufacturing \nindustry, and radio service operators. This bill merely provides \nlocalities with the tools they need to protect their residents while \npreserving the FCC's exclusive regulatory jurisdiction over the \nregulation of radio services.\n  I ask that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2767\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor \nlegislation being introduced today by my friend from Wisconsin to \naddress a problem that is unique to certain areas of Wisconsin and \nMichigan.\n  In the Cities of Grand Rapids and Battle Creek, Michigan and in \nseveral Wisconsin communities, certain individual Citizens Band (CB) \nradio operators are using illegal equipment of a capacity which \ninterferes with the home electronic equipment and telephone service of \ntheir neighbors.\n  As a result, these neighbors are forced to buy filters in order to \nscreen out the interference, and in some cases the interference is so \nextreme that the filters don't even work. There have also been \ncomplaints that some of these ``illegal'' CB broadcasters are using \nprofanity which is disturbing to the neighbors and interfering with \nlegitimate use of CB radios by truckers and others.\n  The problem is exacerbated by a lack of Federal resources to stop the \nproblem. In recent years, due to budget and staffing cuts, the FCC has \ndecreased its enforcement efforts. The legislation being introduced \ntoday would authorize local jurisdictions to enforce the\n\n[[Page S5666]]\n\nFCC regulations regarding use of citizens band radio equipment, while \nmaintaining the FCC jurisdiction over the regulation of radio services.\n  The bill provides for an FCC appeal process available to any person \nwho believes they are adversely affected by local enforcement action. \nFCC does not object to this approach or to this legislation.\n  Mr. President, this legislation offers a simple solution to the \ninability of the FCC, due to insufficient resources, to put a stop to \nillegal CB equipment use in parts of Michigan and Wisconsin. The \nlegislation would allow local officials, who are more familiar with the \nspecific problems and complaints in their areas of jurisdiction, to be \nauthorized to enforce FCC regulations regarding the use of CB radio \nequipment. The legislation has the strong support of local government \nofficials in the Michigan communities where CB interference occurs.\n  An identical bill has been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives. I hope this legislation will be enacted in an \nexpedited manner so that local officials will have the ability to stop \nthe use of illegal CB equipment that is interfering with legitimate CB \nuse and disturbing citizens of the impacted communities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 2768. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the Medicare-dependent, small rural hospital program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n              small rural hospital program improvement act\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Rural \nHospital Program Improvement Act, which is intended to make critically \nimportant changes to Medicare payment policies for rural hospitals.\n  Mr. President, most hospitals in rural America serve a large number \nof Medicare patients. Medicare payments to these hospitals, however, \nare not always adequate to cover the cost of the services they provide. \nThe legislation I am introducing today will increase Medicare payments \nto small, rural hospitals in Maine and elsewhere by enabling more of \nthem to qualify for enhanced reimbursements under the Medicare \nDependent, Small Rural Hospital Program.\n  Rural hospitals are the anchors of small towns and communities across \nAmerica. Not only are they the mainstay of the local health care \ndelivery system, but they are also often the major employers in their \ncommunities. Rural communities have unique characteristics and special \nneeds, and their hospitals face tremendous challenges every day as they \nwork to provide the highest quality health care to their patients in \nthe face of sometimes discouraging odds.\n  Rural communities tend to have higher concentrations of elderly \npersons and higher levels of poverty. Rural residents also tend to have \nhigher rates of certain health problems than people living in urban \nareas. For example, deaths and disabilities resulting from injury are \nmore common, and rural residents also tend to experience higher rates \nof chronic disease and disability. Rural providers also face unique \nchallenges in the delivery of health care services, given the great \ndistances and extreme weather conditions that often prevail, \nparticularly in states like Maine. Shortages of physicians, nurses and \nother health professionals make it difficult to ensure that rural \nresidents have access to all of the care that they need. And finally, \nMedicare reimbursement policies tend to favor urban areas and fail to \ntake the special needs of rural providers into account.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 has posed additional challenges for \nrural areas. Deep Medicare payment reductions and mounting regulatory \nrequirements have damaged our fragile rural health care delivery \nsystem, and, in particular, our rural hospitals and home health \nagencies. While the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 did provide \nsome much-needed relief, we should take further steps to ensure that \nthese rural providers receive more equitable Medicare payments.\n  One relatively simple, but nevertheless important step we can take is \nto update the antiquated and arbitrary classification requirements that \nprevent otherwise-qualified hospitals from receiving assistance under \nthe Medicare Dependent, Small Rural Hospital program. Under this \nprogram, small rural hospitals that treat relatively high proportions \nof Medicare patients qualify for enhanced Medicare reimbursements. To \nqualify as a Medicare Dependent Hospital, a hospital must be located in \na rural area, not be a sole community hospital, have 100 or fewer beds, \nand have been dependent on Medicare for at least 60 percent of its \ninpatient days or discharges in 1987.\n  The requirement that the hospital must have had at least 60 percent \nof its hospital discharges or patient days attributable to Medicare \nbeneficiaries in 1987 is what creates the problem. Using 1987 as a base \nyear erects an arbitrary barrier that prevents many small rural \nhospitals that otherwise meet the criteria from participating in this \nprogram. As an example, despite the fact that most of the small rural \nhospitals in Maine treat a disproportionate share of Medicare \nbeneficiaries, none of them currently qualifies for this program. Not a \nsingle one.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today modifies and updates the 60 \npercent requirement and bases eligibility for the Medicare Dependent, \nSmall Rural Hospital program on Medicare discharges or patient days \nduring any of the three most recently audited cost report periods \nrather than fiscal year 1987. In addition, the bill would make the \nprogram, which currently is only authorized through FY 2006, permanent. \nAccording to the Maine Hospital Association, if updated in this way, \nnine Maine hospitals will be eligible for the program, which would make \nthem eligible for over $9 million additional Medicare dollars.\n  Increasing Medicare payment rates is critically important to the \nhospitals in Maine. For the past several years, Maine has ranked 49th \nor 50th in the nation in terms of Medicare reimbursement-to-cost \nratios. For example, while hospitals in some states received more from \nMedicare in 1996 than it cost them to provide care to older and \ndisabled Medicare patients, Maine's hospitals were only reimbursed 80 \ncents for every $1.00 they actually spent caring for Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  As a consequence, Maine's hospitals have experienced a serious \nMedicare shortfall in recent years. The Maine Hospital Association \nanticipates a $174 million Medicare shortfall in 2002, which will force \nMaine's hospitals to shift costs on to other payers in the form of \nhigher hospital charges. This Medicare shortfall is one of the reasons \nthat Maine has among the highest insurance premiums in the nation.\n  Maine's poor Medicare margin is not due to high hospital costs. In \nfact, the current system tends to penalize Maine hospitals for their \nefficiency. For example, at $5,232, Maine's cost per discharge is \nslightly under the national average of $5,241, and is well below the \nNortheast average of $5,517.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will not solve Maine's \nMedicare shortfall problem, but it will help to close the gap. It will \nalso enable many more small rural hospitals across the country to \nbenefit from this program, which will help to ensure continued access \nto high quality hospital care for all rural Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Robb, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kohl, \n        Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Cleland):\n  S. 2769. A bill to authorize funding for National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System improvement; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                          nics partnership act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the legislation \nto improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, NICS. \nThe NICS Partnership Act authorizes the Department of Justice to \nreimburse states for serving as points of contact under the NICS. Our \nlegislation also requires the Attorney General to issue a report to \nCongress on the appropriate formula to reimburse states for their \nreasonable costs to serve as points of contact for access to the NICS. \nI am pleased that Senators Hatch, Robb, Durbin, Kohl, Schumer, and \nCleland are original cosponsors of this bipartisan bill.\n  The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1994 established the \nNICS and required federal firearm licensees to conduct a background \ncheck on the\n\n[[Page S5667]]\n\npurchaser of any firearm sale after November 30, 1998. In its first 18 \nmonths of operation, the NICS has been a highly effective system for \nkeeping guns out of the hands of criminals and children. Having \nprocessed 10 million inquires during this time, the NICS has ensured \nthe timely transfer of firearms to law-abiding citizens, while denying \ntransfers to more than 179,000 felons, fugitives and other prohibited \npersons. That is a remarkable record in preventing crime and protecting \npublic safety.\n  This success, however, has come at an unfair cost to many states. The \nNICS is mandated by Federal law, the Brady Act, but many states are \npicking up the tab for conducting effective Brady background checks. \nCongress should remedy this inequity. Effective Brady background checks \nare the responsibility of the Federal government under Federal law. As \na result, it is only fair for Congress to reimburse states for their \nreasonable costs needed to conduct effective Brady background checks.\n  Because more comprehensive criminal history records are currently \navailable at the state and local level in many states, instead of the \nFederal level, these states have elected to serve as points of contact \n(POCs) to access the NICS. A state POC is a state agency that agrees to \nconduct Brady background checks, including NICS checks, on prospective \ngun buyers. In states that have agreed to serve as POCs, federal \nfirearm licensees contact the state POC for a Brady background check \nrather than contacting the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). These \nPOC background checks review more records of people in prohibited \ncategories, such as people who have been involuntarily committed to a \nmental institution or are under a domestic violence restraining order.\n  Indeed, in my home state of Vermont, for example, which serves as a \nPOC, approximately 28 percent of all denials of prohibited persons \nseeking firearm purchases are based on state charges which would not \nhave been available for review at the FBI's criminal record repository. \nThese purchasers were denied because a relief from abuse order had been \nissued against them, they had been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of \nfamily violence, they were wanted in the State of Vermont, or they had \nbeen convicted of a felony in Vermont and not fingerprinted. These \nresults demonstrate the value of having the states act as POCs for \nNICS.\n  Currently, the following 15 states serve as a full POC for NICS: \nArizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, \nIllinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont \nand Virginia. Another 11 states serve as partial POCs for NICS by \nperforming checks for handgun purchases while the FBI processes checks \nfor long gun purchases: Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, New York, North \nCarolina, Indiana, Maryland, New Hampshire, Oregon, Washington, and \nWisconsin. Thus, more than half the states serve as full or partial \nPOCs under the NICS.\n  In fact, of the 8,621,000 background checks conducted last year, \n4,538,000 were handled by the FBI and 4,083,000--almost half--were \nhandled by state POCs. So while some states relied on the FBI to \nconduct Brady background checks and paid nothing, the states that \nelected to conduct more effective background checks paid the full cost \nof them. That is unfair to states that are doing the right thing.\n  The State of Vermont, for instance, pays about $110,000 a year for \nits POC system to run effective Brady background checks on all firearms \npurchased through federal firearms licensees. In other POC states, the \nburden is higher on state legislatures to come up with funding sources \nto pay for effective Brady background checks.\n  Indeed, the Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, wrote to me last year in \nstrong support of Federal funding to pay for the costs of Brady \nbackground checks performed by POC states. Governor Bush empathized \nthat Florida's POC background checks were more efficient and effective \nthan background checks performed at the Federal level. Governor Bush \nconcluded in his letter that: ``Without this funding, it is unlikely \nthat state legislatures will continue the state programs--the \ninequities of charging for the service in some states but getting free \nservice in others are too obvious.'' I agree. I ask unanimous consent \nthat Governor Bush's letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof my remarks.\n  The FBI, in its first operations report on the NICS, recommend that \nstates should be compensated for their costs necessary to serve as \nPOCs. Specifically, the FBI's report found: ``Based on its first year \nof operation, it is clear that the ability of the NICS to stop \nprohibited persons from acquiring firearms would be improved by . . . a \nmeans to help states with the cost of performing as a POC state. . . \n.''\n  A recent General Accounting Office report on the implementation of \nthe NICS also praised the POC state background check system. The GAO \nreport found: ``According to the FBI, the functioning of the NICS would \nbe more effective and efficient if more states were full participants. \nFor instance, FBI officials noted that state law enforcement agencies \nhave access to more current criminal history records and more data \nsources, particularly regarding noncriminal disqualifiers, such as \nmental hospital commitments, from their own states than does the FBI, \nand have a better understanding of their own state laws and \ndisqualifying factors.''\n  Similar legislation to reimburse POC states under the NICS was part \nof the Senate-passed Juvenile Justice bill, which has been languishing \nin conference for many months. I prefer that we address this issue as \npart of the juvenile justice legislation by convening the juvenile \njustice conference and finishing the work we started last May when the \nSenate passed the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill by a strong \nbipartisan vote. But since the congressional leadership appears \nunlikely to reconvene the juvenile justice conference, then we should \nconsider these improvements to the NICS now to protect public safety.\n  Indeed, the Department of Justice, in comments on the Senate-passed \njuvenile justice bill, stated: ``Reimbursing the point-of-contact \nstates for doing NICS checks could be critical to retaining their \nparticipation, because they have a strong disincentive to preform \nchecks that the FBI is providing to gun dealers and buyers free of \ncharge. We believe it is very important to retain point-of-contact \nstates and increase their number, because states have access to state \nrecords that are not available to the FBI and states have the expertise \nto interpret their own records and local laws.''\n  Mr. President, states are doing the right thing by serving as points \nof contact under the NICS for more effective background checks, which \nare mandated by Federal law. These background checks prevent crime and \npromote the public safety. Congress should do the right thing by \nreimbursing these states for their reasonable costs for conducting \nthese point of conduct background checks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2769\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for Federal recognition of the Lower \nMuscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n    the lower muscogee-creek indian tribe of georgia recognition act\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr President, today I am introducing legislation \nwhich will provide for the Federal recognition of the Lower Muskogee-\nCreek Indian Tribe of Georgia.\n  I realize that Congress has traditionally deferred to the Secretary \nof the Interior on matters relating to tribal recognition. Further, \nwhile it is within our jurisdiction, I understand that there is a \nreluctance in Congress to federally recognize Indian tribes through \nlegislation. I would certainly prefer to settle this particular \nrecognition issue in accordance with the practices and procedures \nestablished by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. However, I am compelled to \nintroduce this legislation because I believe there has been a \nfundamental flaw which, in this case, has prevented the Lower Muskogee \ntribe from obtaining a fair and equitable review of its recognition \nrequest. Mr. President, please allow me to elaborate on this statement.\n  It is my understanding that once a petition has been denied, the \nrules prohibit a tribe from petitioning the Secretary of the Interior a \nsecond time. While the intent of the rule may be to eliminate redundant \nand frivolous petitions, I believe there are times when we must make an \nexception. Further, Mr. President, I would contend that this rule is \nespecially unfair to those tribes who petitioned the Agency prior to \nthe finalization of the rules in 1978. This is the case with respect to \nthe Lower Muskogee tribe in my home State of Georgia.\n  The Lower Muskogee tribe has tried for over two decades to obtain a \nfavorable review of their status as a tribe. In 1977, members of the \ntribe petitioned the Secretary of the Interior for recognition. Without \nthe assistance of legal counsel or technical support, the tribe \nsubmitted their petition. While the petition was pending, the \nDepartment of Interior (DOI) proposed and finalized rules relating to \nthe procedures by which tribes may petition for federal recognition. In \nDecember 1981, the tribe's petition was denied due to technical \nomissions.\n  I understand that there are serious concerns associated with the \nfederal recognition of tribes by an Act of Congress--the most obvious \nbeing the perception that establishment of a gaming facility may soon \nfollow. However, members of the Lower Muskogee tribe are not seeking to \nopen casinos in Georgia. In fact, at the request of the tribe's \nPrincipal Chief, I have included language in the bill to prohibit such \naction. Under my bill, federal recognition of the Lower Muskogee tribe \nwill not permit casinos or any other games of chance. It will simply \nrecognize these well-deserving people as an Indian tribe, and allow \ntheir participation in programs which should be available to them as \nlegitimate Native Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record, and urge my colleagues to join me in enacting \nthis legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2771\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian \n     Tribe of Georgia Recognition Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress declares and finds the following:\n       (1) The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia are \n     descendants of and political successors to those Indians \n     known as the original Creek Indian Nation at the time of \n     initial European contact with America.\n       (2) The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia are \n     descendants and political successors to the signatories of \n     the 1832 Treaty of Washington which was a treaty made while \n     the Creeks were one nation, before removal. The Treaty \n     involved all Creeks, including the Upper, Middle, and Lower \n     Creeks, when the Creek Nation was whole and intact.\n       (3) The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia \n     consists of over 2,500 eligible members, most of whom \n     continue to reside close to their ancestral homeland within \n     the State of Georgia. Pursuant to Article XII of the 1832 \n     Treaty of Washington, the Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe \n     of Georgia declined to be removed and continued to operate as \n     a sovereign Indian tribe comprising those Lower Creeks \n     declining removal under the Treaty of 1832.\n       (4) The Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia \n     continues its political and social existence with a viable \n     tribal government carrying out many of its governmental \n     functions through its traditional form of collective \n     decisionmaking and social interaction.\n       (5) In 1972, when the Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of \n     Georgia (also known as the Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe East \n     of the Mississippi River) petitioned the Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs for Federal recognition, the tribal leaders were not \n     well educated and the Tribe could not afford competent \n     counsel adequately versed in Federal Indian law. The Tribe \n     was unable to obtain technical assistance in its petition \n     which consequently lacked critical and pertinent historical \n     information necessary for recognition. Thus, due to technical \n     omissions, the petition was denied on December 21, 1981.\n       (6) Despite the denial of the petition, the United States \n     Government, the government of the State of Georgia, and local \n     governments, have recognized the political leaders of the \n     Lower Muscogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia as leaders of a \n     distinct political governmental entity.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Member.--The term ``member'' means an enrolled member \n     of the Tribe, as of the date of enactment of this Act, or an \n     individual who has been placed on the membership rolls of the \n     Tribe in accordance with this Act.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (3) Tribe.--The term ``Tribe'' means the Lower Muscogee-\n     Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia.\n\n     SEC. 4.

RESERVATION.\n\n       (a) Lands Taken Into Trust.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, if, not later than 2 years after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Tribe transfers interest in \n     land within the boundaries of Grady County, Carroll County, \n     and such other counties in the State of Georgia to the \n     Secretary, the Secretary shall take such interests in land \n     into trust for the benefit of the Tribe.\n       (b) Reservation Established.--Land taken into trust \n     pursuant to subsection (a) shall be the initial reservation \n     land of the Tribe.\n       (c) Limitation on Gaming.--Gaming as defined and regulated \n     by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) \n     is prohibited on the land taken into trust under subsection \n     (a).\n\n     SEC. 6. BASE MEMBERSHIP ROLL.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Tribe shall submit to the \n     Secretary a membership roll consisting of all individuals who \n     are members of the Tribe. The qualifications for inclusion in \n     the membership roll of the Tribe shall be developed and based \n     upon the membership provisions as contained in the Tribe's \n     Constitution and Bill of Rights. Upon completion of the \n     membership roll, the Secretary shall publish notice of such \n     in the Federal Register. The Tribe shall ensure that such \n     roll is maintained and kept current.\n       (b) Future Membership.--The Tribe shall have the right to \n     determine future membership in the Tribe, however, in no \n     event may an individual be enrolled as a member of the Tribe \n     unless the individual is a lineal descendant of a person on \n     the base membership roll, and has continued to maintain \n     political relations with the Tribe.\n\n     SEC. 7. JURISDICTION.\n\n       The reservation established pursuant to this Act shall be \n     Indian country under Federal and tribal jurisdiction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Grassley, \n        Mr. Thompson, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 2774. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for individual savings accounts funded by employee and employer \nSocial Security payroll deductions, to extend the solvency of the old-\nage, survivors, and disability insurance program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           the bipartisan social security reform act of 2000\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation \nto make\n\n[[Page S5669]]\n\ntechnical corrections to the Bipartisan Social Security Reform bill my \ncolleagues and I introduced last summer. The purpose of this \nlegislation is simple: to conform our previous legislative language to \nchanges that have been made in the Social Security program--such as \neliminating the earnings limit--since last July; to correct some \ninadvertent errors we discovered; and to update our assumptions to \nreflect the new reality of the Trust Funds as reported in the 2000 \nSocial Security and Medicare Trustees Report which came out earlier \nthis year.\n  Since July 16, 1999 when Senators Gregg, Kerrey, Breaux, Thompson, \nThomas, and Robb and I introduced our legislation to save Social \nSecurity, the issue has taken on new life, due to Governor Bush's \nwillingness to make Social Security reform a primary issue in his \npresidential campaign. He should be commended for his leadership and \nfor grabbing the third rail of American politics fearlessly in order to \ncreate a truly secure Social Security system so that future generations \nwill be able to rely on Social Security like their parents and \ngrandparents.\n  I want to urge my colleagues to take a serious look at our proposal \nto save Social Security. It was designed in a bipartisan, bicameral \nmanner: four Republicans and three Democrats cosponsored the Bipartisan \nSocial Security Reform Bill, and Congressmen Kolbe and Stenholm \nsponsored similar legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  The bipartisan plan would maintain a basic floor of protection \nthrough a traditional Social Security benefit, but two percentage \npoints of the 12.4 percent payroll tax would be redirected to \nindividual accounts. Individuals could invest their personal accounts \nin any combination of the funds offered through the Social Security \nsystem. An individual who invested his or her personal account in a \nbond fund would receive a guaranteed interest rate. However, \nindividuals who wish to pursue a higher rate of return through \ninvestment in a fund including equities could do so.\n  Our proposal would eliminate the need for future payroll tax \nincreases by advance funding a portion of future benefits through \npersonal accounts. With individual accounts, we provide Americans with \nthe tools necessary to build financial independence in retirement--\nespecially to those who previously had limited opportunities to create \nwealth. The legislation provides incentives for low and middle income \nworking Americans to save additional funds for retirement by matching \ntheir voluntary contributions to their individual accounts. Under our \nplan, they will be able to save for retirement and benefit from \neconomic growth.\n  As all the cosponsors have said a hundred times, our proposal offers \nno ``free lunch''. In order to save Social Security for future \ngenerations it must be modernized. We have crafted a responsible plan \nto save Social Security for generations to come. By making incremental, \nsteady changes to the Social Security system, we will be able to ensure \nthe long-term solvency of the program.\n  With this technical corrections bill we have improved upon our \noriginal legislation and I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan \nproposal to save Social Security.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2774\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

To foster innovation and technological advancement in the \ndevelopment of the Internet and electronic commerce, and to assist the \nStates in simplifying their sales and use taxes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                 Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Internet and E-commerce are \nto continue to grow and flourish then Congress must address the \ndifficult tax issues that these have posed. To that end, Senator \nVoinovich and I, along with Senators Graham, Enzi, Breaux and six of \nour distinguished colleagues are introducing the Internet Tax \nMoratorium and Equity Act.\n  First and foremost, this legislation extends for four additional \nyears the existing moratorium on punitive and discriminatory Internet \ntaxes, and on access taxes. Internet technology is becoming a real \ngrowth engine for our economy. Governments should not be allowed to \nimpose new taxes on access, or to enact discriminatory tax plans that \nwould apply to the Internet and E-commerce but not to other kinds of \ntransactions. I believe that such policies could foolishly hurt the \nfuture growth of the Internet industry, and this legislation prevents \nthat from happening anytime soon.\n  At the same time, however, this legislation moves toward a solution \nto the growing web of tax compliance problems that faces virtually \neveryone who would do business across state lines --sellers and \ncustomers alike. Our approach also would help to create a climate in \nwhich Web-based firms and Main Street businesses can co-exist and \ncompete on fair and even terms.\n  Any new form of commerce presents a challenge to the rules and \nstructures that have grown up around the old. The Internet is no \nexception. The Internet has raised vexing questions regarding both \nprivacy and the protection of property rights in writing and music. It \nhas raised similar questions regarding the revenue systems of the \nstates and localities of this nation. Not surprisingly, the Internet \nsimply does not fit neatly into these systems as they have evolved over \nthe last two hundred years.\n  This disconnect has created tensions on all sides. On one side are \nthe vital new businesses--Internet service providers, Web-based \nbusinesses and the rest--worried that they will be singled out as cash \ncows and subjected to new and unfair taxes. On the other side are state \nand local governments worried about the erosion of their tax bases and \ntheir ability to pay for the schools, police, garbage collection and \nmore that their taxpayers need and expect. In between are Main Street \nmerchants who collect sales taxes from their customers and worry about \nunfair competition from Web-based business that avoid collecting these \ntaxes. Let us not forget the citizens and taxpayers, who appreciate the \nconvenience and opportunities of the Web but who also care about their \nMain Street merchants, and about their schools and other local \nservices.\n  All of these concerns are valid. There are no bad guys in the drama. \nRather, it is the kind of conflict that a new technology inevitably \nposes. The automobile required the reform of traffic-control rules \ndesigned for the horse-and-buggy era. So today the rise of E-commerce \nrequires an update of tax compliance rules designed primarily for local \ncommerce. Our job in Congress is not to point fingers but rather to try \nto address the problem in a fair and constructive way.\n  The solution must begin by putting the worries of Web-based \nentrepreneurs to rest. They should not be concerned about new and \ndiscriminatory tax burdens, and they should not be singled out as cash \ncows. Congress should make this clear. We have enacted a moratorium to \nprohibit state and local governments from enacting tax plans that \ndiscriminate against the E-commerce or impose a levy on Internet \naccess. This existing moratorium is set to expire next year. We should \nextend that moratorium to December 2005. That will help clear the air \nand also make possible the development of a real solution for the sales \nand use tax compliance problems now facing many businesses and and \ntheir customers.\n  The solution begins with a recognition of the problem. Collecting a \nsales tax in a face-to-face transaction on Main Street or at the mall \nis a relatively simple process. The seller collects the tax and remits \nit to the state or local government. But with remote sales--such as \ncatalog and Internet sales--it's more difficult. States can not require \na seller to collect a sales tax unless the business has an actual \nlocation or sales people in the state. So most states, and many \nlocalities, have laws that require the local buyer to send an \nequivalent ``use tax'' to the state or local government when he or she \ndid not pay taxes at the time of purchase.\n  The reality, of course, is that customers almost never do that. It \nwould be a major inconvenience, and people are not accustomed to paying \nsales taxes in that way. So, despite the requirement in the law, most \nsimply don't do it. This tax, which is already owed, is not paid. For \nyears, state and local governments could accept this loss because \ncatalog sales were a relatively minor portion of overall commerce. The \nInternet, however, will change that.\n  Internet and catalog sellers argue that collecting sales taxes would \nbe a significant burden for them. They contend that they would have to \ncomply with tax laws from thousands of different jurisdictions--46 \nstates and thousands of local governments have sales taxes. They would \nhave to deal with many different tax rates and all of the \nidiosyncracies regarding what is taxable and what is non-taxable. They \nhave a point.\n  However, there are some remote sellers who know they enjoy an \nadvantage over Main Street businesses and simply do not want to lose \nit. They can sell a product without collecting the tax, whereas Main \nStreet businesses must collect the local sales tax. Main Street \nbusinesses claim that is unfair, and they have a point, too.\n  As I said, all sides in this debate have valid points, and that is \nthe premise of the bill we introduce today. There are three basic \nprinciples underlying the Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act. \nFirst, we believe that this new Internet technology is becoming a real \ngrowth engine for our economy. Governments should not impose access or \ndiscriminatory taxes that might jeopardize its growth. That's why the \nlegislation we are introducing extends the current moratorium on \nInternet access and multiple and discriminatory taxes on electronic \ncommerce for over four additional years.\n\n[[Page S5677]]\n\n  Second, state and local governments should be encouraged to simplify \ntheir sales tax systems as they apply to remote sellers. And third, \nonce States have done this, then it is only fair that remote sellers do \ntheir part and collect any use tax that is owed, just as local \nmerchants collect sales taxes. This simple step would free the consumer \nfrom the burden of having to report such taxes individually. It would \nlevel the playing field for local retailers and others that already \ncollect and remit such taxes, and it would protect the ability of state \nand local governments to provide necessary services for their residents \nin the future.\n  Specifically, the Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act would do the \nfollowing:\n  Extend the existing moratorium on Internet access, multiple and \ndiscriminatory taxes through December 31, 2005.\n  Put Congress on record as urging States and localities to develop a \nstreamlined sales and use tax system with the advice of the National \nConference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. Among other things, \nsuch a system would include a single, blended tax rate with which all \nremote sellers could comply. It should also include within each state a \nuniform tax base on which remote sellers apply the tax, as well as a \nuniform list of exempt items.\n  Authorize States to enter into an Interstate Sales and Use Tax \nCompact through which member States would adopt the streamlined sales \nand use tax system. Congressional authority and consent to enter into \nsuch a Compact would expire if it has not occurred by January 1, 2006.\n  Authorize adopting States to require remote sellers with more than $5 \nmillion in annual gross sales to collect and remit sales and use taxes \non remote sales, once twenty States have adopted such Compact, unless \nCongress has acted to disapprove the Compact by law within a period of \n120 days after the Congress receives it.\n  Prohibit states that have not adopted the simplified sales and use \ntax system from gaining benefit from the authority extended in the bill \nto require sellers to collect and remit sales and use taxes on remote \nsales.\n  In my view, it would be a mistake for Congress to adopt a lengthy \nextension of the current Internet tax moratorium without addressing the \nunderlying problem. If we don't, then the growth of the Internet, which \nshould be a benefit to Americans, will instead mean a major erosion of \nfunds available to build and maintain schools and roads, finance police \ndepartments and garbage collection, and all the other services that \ncitizens in this country want and need. One study suggests that states \nand local governments soon could be losing more than $20 billion \nannually if the Internet industry continues its rapid growth, and if \nsales and use tax collection rules are left unchanged.\n  The competitive crisis facing local retailers is also growing more \nurgent. Testimony at a recent congressional hearing makes that clear: A \nrepresentative of Wal-Mart testified recently that that company is \nincorporating a separate business to put Wal-Mart on the Internet. It \nwill do so in a manner that will enable them to avoid sales and use \ntaxes. The reason? Even though Wal-Mart has locations in every state \nand therefore would be required to collect such taxes on Internet \nsales, it recognizes that other large competitors will be making those \nsales tax-free. The company regards such avoidance as a matter of \nnecessity to remain competitive.\n  This scenario will play out over and over again. The large retailers \nlike Wal-Mart will survive; the small Main Street businesses will \nstruggle. And, there will be a massive loss of revenues to fund schools \nand other basic services.\n  Mr. President, this is an important issue that Congress must address \nnow. We believe that this legislation strikes a balance between the \ninterests of the Internet industry, state and local governments, local \nretailers and remote sellers. It is workable and fair.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this much-needed bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Internet Tax \nMoratorium and Equity Act of 2000 introduced today by Senator Dorgan. I \nam an original cosponsor and I encourage each of my colleagues to join \nme as a cosponsor of this bill. We had to take a look at the Internet \nsales tax issue for people who might be using legislative vehicles to \ndevelop huge loopholes in our current system. We are federally \nmandating states into a sales tax exemption. We need to preserve the \nsystem for those cities, towns, counties, and states that rely on the \nability to collect the sales tax they are currently getting.\n  There are some critical issues here that have to be solved to keep \nthe stability of state and local government--just the stability of it--\nnot to increase sales tax, just protect what is there right now. I \nbelieve the Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act of 2000 is a \nmonumental step forward in protecting, yet enhancing, the current \nsystem.\n  Certainly, no Senator wants to take steps that will unreasonably \nburden the development and growth of the Internet. At the same time, we \nmust also be sensitive to issues of basic competitive fairness and the \nnegative effect our action or inaction can have on brick-and-mortar \nretailers, a critical economic sector and employment force in all \nAmerican society, especially in rural states like Wyoming. In addition, \nwe must consider the legitimate need of state and local governments to \nhave the flexibility they need to generate resources to adequately fund \ntheir programs and operations.\n  If the loophole exists, I can share a method for local retailers to \navoid sales tax collection too--but creating this loophole will lead to \nothers--pay attention here. Sales tax collection and federal and state \nincome tax could be in the same boat, if sole tax collection is no \nlonger necessary on Internet sales purely by virtue of the sale over \nthe Internet. Why shouldn't an employee whose check is written on the \nInternet and transmitted directly to his bank account not owe any \nincome tax? Both would be Internet tax loopholes--tax collection \nexemptions forced by an all-knowing Federal Government.\n  As the only accountant in the Senate, I have a unique perspective on \nthe dozens of tax proposals that are introduced in Congress each year. \nIn addition, my service on the State and local level and my experiences \nas a small business owner enable me to consider these bills from more \nthan one viewpoint.\n  I understand the importance of protecting and promoting the growth of \nInternet commerce because of its potential economic benefits. It is a \nvaluable resource because it provides access on demand. In addition, it \nis estimated that the growth of online businesses will create millions \nof new jobs nationwide in the coming years. Therefore, I do not support \na tax on the use of Internet itself.\n  I do, however, have concerns about using the Internet as a sales tax \nloophole. Sales taxes go directly to state and local governments and I \nam very leery of any federal legislation that bypasses their \ntraditional ability to raise revenue to perform needed services such as \nschool funding, road repair and law enforcement. I will not force \nstates into a huge new exemption. While those who advocate a permanent \nloophole on the collection of a sales tax over the Internet claim to \nrepresent the principles of tax reduction, they are actually advocating \na tax increase. Simply put, if Congress continues to allow sales over \nthe Internet to go untaxed and electronic commerce continues to grow as \npredicted, revenues to state and local governments will fall and \nproperty taxes will have to be increased to offset lost revenue or \nStates who do not have or believe in State income taxes will be forced \nto start one.\n\n  After months of hard work, negotiations, and compromise, the Internet \nTax Moratorium and Equity Act of 2000 has been introduced. I would like \nto commend Senator Dorgan on his commitment to finding a solution and \nworking all parties to find that solution. The bill extends the \nexisting moratorium on Internet access, multiple, and discriminatory \ntaxes for an additional four years through December 31, 2005.\n  Throughout the past several years, we have heard that catalog and \nInternet companies say they are willing to allow and collect sales tax \non interstate sales (regardless of traditional or Internet sales) if \nStates will simplify\n\n[[Page S5678]]\n\ncollections to one rate per State sent to one location in that State. I \nthink that is a reasonable request. I have heard the argument that \ncomputers make it possible to handle several thousand tax entities, but \nfrom an auditing standpoint as well as simplicity for small business, I \nsupport one rate per State. I think the States should have some \nresponsibility for redistribution not a business forced to do work for \ngovernment. Therefore, the bill would put Congress on record as urging \nStates and localities to develop a streamlined sales and use tax \nsystem, which would include a single, blended tax rate with which all \nremote sellers can comply. You need to be aware that States are \nprohibited from gaining benefit from the authority extended in the bill \nto require sellers to collect and remit sales and use taxes on remote \nsales if the States have not adopted the simplified sales and use tax \nsystem.\n  Further, the bill would authorize States to enter into an Interstate \nSales and Use Tax Compact through which members would adopt the \nstreamlined sales and use tax system. Congressional authority and \nconsent to enter into such a compact would expire if it has not \noccurred by January 1, 2006. The bill also authorizes States to require \nall other sellers to collect and remit sales and use taxes on remote \nsales unless Congress has acted to disapprove the compact by law within \na period of 120 days after the Congress receives it.\n  We introduce this bill because we do not think there is adequate \nprotection now. It is very important we do not build electronic \nloopholes on the Internet, an ever-changing Internet, one that is \ngrowing by leaps and bounds, one that is finding new technology \nvirtually every day. What we know as the Internet today is not what we \nwill be using by the time the moratorium is finalized. More and more \npeople are using the Internet everyday.\n  Mr. President, I recognize this body has a constitutional \nresponsibility to regulate interstate commerce. Furthermore, I \nunderstand the desire of several Senators to protect and promote the \ngrowth of Internet commerce. Internet commerce is an exciting field. It \nhas a lot of growth potential. The new business will continue to create \nmillions of new jobs in the coming years.\n  The exciting thing about that for Wyomingites is that our merchants \ndo not have to go where the people are. For people in my State, that \nmeans their products are no longer confined to a local market. They do \nnot have to rely on expensive catalogs to sell merchandise to the big \ncity folks. They do not have to travel all the way to Asia to display \ntheir goods. The customer can come to us on the Internet. It is a \nremarkable development, and it will push more growth for small \nmanufacturers in rural America, especially in my State. We have seen \nsome of the economic potential in the Internet and will continue this \nprogress. It is a valuable resource because it provides access on \ndemand. It brings information to your fingertips when you want it and \nhow you want it.\n  I was the mayor of a small town, Gillette, WY, for 8 years. I later \nserved in the State house for 5 years and the State senate for 5 years. \nThroughout my public life I have always worked to reduce taxes, to \nreturn more of people's hard-earned wages to them.\n  I am not here to argue in favor of taxes. There were times in \nGillette when we had to make tough decisions. I was mayor during the \nboom time when the size of our town doubled in just a few years. We had \nto be very creative to be sure that our revenue sources would cover the \nnecessary public services--important services like sewer, water, curb \nand gutter, filling in potholes, shoveling snow, collecting garbage, \nand mostly water. It is a tough job because the impact of your decision \nis felt by all of your neighbors. Hardly any of these problems is \nsolved without money. When you are the mayor of a small town, you are \non call 24 hours a day. You are in the phone book. People can call you \nat night and tell you that the city sewer is backing up into their \nhouse. I was fascinated how they were always sure that it was the \ncity's sewer that was doing it. Therefore, it is important that we do \nnot cut towns out of a historic source of revenue. They provides \nservices you really depend on. Remember you cannot flush your toilet \nover the Internet.\n  The point is that the government that is closest to the people is \nalso on the shortest time line to get results. I think it is the \nhardest work. I am very concerned with any piece of legislation that \nmandates or restricts local government's ability to meet the needs of \nits citizens. This has the potential to provide electronic loopholes \nthat will take away all of their revenue. The Internet Tax Moratorium \nand Equity Act of 2000 would designate a level playing field for all \ninvolved--business, government, and the consumer.\n  If the loophole exists, I can share a method for local retailers to \navoid sales tax collection too--but creating this loophole will lead to \nothers--pay attention here. Sales tax collection and federal and state \nincome tax could be in the same boat, if sole tax collection is no \nlonger necessary on Internet sales purely by virtue of the sale over \nthe Internet. Why shouldn't an employee whose check is written on the \nInternet and transmitted directly to his bank account not owe any \nincome tax? Both would be Internet tax loopholes--tax collection \nexemptions forced by an all-knowingly federal government.\n  I do strongly support this bill. The current system of collecting \nrevenues for those towns and states should be preserved--preserved on a \nlevel playing field for all involved. I do not think we have all the \nanswers, or we would not be asking for this bill. So whatever we do, we \nhave to have a bill that will preserve the way that small business and \nsmall towns function at the present at the present time. Our bill is \ncritical for towns, small businesses, and you and me. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, earlier this year, the Senate began \nconsideration of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nreauthorization. As its name suggests, that legislation governs how \nFederal dollars that go to the States for education will be spent. It \nis a very important bill, and I regret that the Senate was unable to \ncomplete consideration of it.\n  As important as the ESEA reauthorization bill is, however, it is not \nthe most significant education bill that Congress will deal with in the \nnext two years. In fact, the most important education bill Congress \nwill consider won't mention schools or students. It won't reference \nclassroom size or teacher salaries.\n  In 1998, Congress passed the Internet Tax Freedom Act. That bill \nimposed a three year moratorium on specific state taxes applicable to \nthe Internet. The legislation didn't affect the states' ability to \nimpose sales tax on Internet purchases, nor did it fix the unfair \nadvantage ``e-tailers'' currently have over their main street \ncompetitors with respect to their responsibility to collect sales and \nuse taxes.\n  As a result of two Supreme Court rulings, a state is prohibited from \nrequiring out-of-state retailers from collecting sales tax on purchases \nmade by its residents if the business has no presence in the state. The \nsales tax still applies, it just has to be collected directly from the \npurchaser. For a variety of reasons, very little of this tax is ever \ncollected.\n  The Internet Tax Freedom Act created the Advisory Commission on \nElectronic Commerce which was supposed to come up with a solution to \nthis problem. Instead the Commission was hijacked by a small group who \nopted to demagogue this issue to further their ``anti-tax'' agenda. The \nresult was a year-long study of an issue with little in the form of \nuseful recommendations.\n  The House has passed a five year extension of the moratorium put in \nplace by the Internet Tax Freedom Act. The Senate also may soon \nconsider a proposal to extend the temporary ban imposed in 1998. The \ngame plan of the forces supporting this extended moratorium is clear: \ndelay, delay, delay. Keep extending the moratorium until there is a \nsufficiently large political constituency to permanently block the \ncollection of sales taxes on purchases made over the Internet.\n  This is not a hidden agenda. Governor Gilmore, Chairman of the \nAdvisory Commission on Electronic Commerce stated it clearly when he \nsaid that ``I believe America should ban sales and use taxes on the \nInternet permanently, for all time. If we secure tax freedom on the \nInternet through 2006, tax freedom on the Internet will become an \nentitlement for the American\n\n[[Page S5679]]\n\npeople and a political inevitability. No tax collector will be welcome \non the Internet after 2006.''\n\n  Let me be clear: this is not about whether purchases made over the \nInternet are subject to sales tax. They already are. The question is \nwhether Internet sellers should have the same responsibility to collect \nthe sales tax as their Main Street competitors.\n  If we answer this question with a ``no,'' funding for education will \nsuffer. Why? Because states have the fundamental responsibility for \nfinancing public education in our country For most states, sales tax \nrevenue is the primary means by which states fulfill this \nresponsibility. Because many states rely on sales taxes for their \ngeneral revenue, the equation is simple--no collection of sales tax on \nthe Internet means less money for new schools, teacher salaries, or \ntextbooks. Six states--Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas \nand Washington rely on sales taxes for more than half of their total \ntax revenue.\n  Over the next four years, Internet sales are expected to grow by \nnearly $500 billion. If state and local governments are prohibited from \ncollecting sales taxes on those new sales, they stand to lose close to \n$17.5 billion in revenue. Florida's share of that lost revenue could be \n$1 billion. When asked why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton replied, \n``that's where the money is.'' Today, the money is increasingly on the \nInternet.\n  There is another reason to fix this issue: fairness. No one would \nseriously consider a proposal that barred state and local governments \nfrom collecting sales and use taxes from retailers who operate from \ngreen buildings. That would be unfair to those businesses that aren't \nlocated in green buildings. Proposals to arbitrarily benefit the \nInternet, however, somehow receive a great deal of attention and \nsupport.\n  Our position should be clear: no more delays. No more moratoriums \nuntil Congress agrees to a process whereby states can simplify their \nsales tax systems and receive the authority they need to require remote \nsellers to collect their sales taxes.\n  The legislation we are introducing today takes the first positive \nstep in this direction. The bill extends the current moratorium on \nInternet access taxes and multiple or discriminatory taxes on the \nInternet, a prohibition that virtually all agree should be imposed.\n  More importantly, however, it establishes a process whereby states \ncan cooperatively create a model sales and use tax system. Sales tax \nlaws must be made significantly more uniform across the states, and the \nadministration of the tax must be substantially overhauled and \nsimplified. The goal of this legislation is to develop a simple, \nuniform, and fair system of sales tax collection. It will reduce the \nburden on remote sellers and protect state and local sovereignty.\n  Once states have adopted this simplified system, they would then have \nthe authority to require remote sellers to collect and remit sales and \nuse taxes to the state.\n  Previous attempts to require remote sellers to collect sales and use \ntaxes have been criticized on the grounds that it was unreasonable to \nrequire businesses to keep track of the nearly 7,500 state and local \ngovernments levying sales and use taxes. That is a suspect criticism, \nparticularly for those. Nevertheless, this bill dramatically simplifies \nthe system for businesses by establishing uniform definitions and fewer \nrates.\n  The streamlined sales and use tax system envisioned by this \nlegislation follows the guidance offered by the Advisory Commission on \nElectronic Commerce. The attributes of this streamlined system include:\n  A centralized, one-stop, multi-state registration system for sellers;\n  Uniform definitions for goods or services that would be included in \nthe tax base;\n  Uniform and simple rules for attributing transactions to particular \ntaxing jurisdictions;\n  Uniform rules for the designation and identification of purchasers \nexempt from tax;\n  Uniform certification procedures for software that sellers may rely \non to determine state and local taxes;\n  Uniform bad debt rules;\n  Uniform returns and remittance forms;\n  Consistent electronic filing and remittance methods;\n  State administration of State and local sales taxes;\n  Uniform audit procedures;\n  Reasonable compensation for tax collection by remote sellers;\n  Exemption for remote sellers with less than $5 million in annual \nsales for the previous year;\n  Appropriate protections for consumer privacy; and\n  Such other features that member states deem warranted to promote \nsimplicity.\n  Critics of this legislation will argue that it is anti-technology, \nand that the Internet must be protected from this threat. That is not \ntrue. The sponsors of this bill yield to no one in their support and \nenthusiasm for a vibrant information technology era. But that support \ndoes not necessitate special breaks for companies doing business over \nthe Internet.\n  A more appropriate characterization for this legislation is that it \nwill both assure fairness to all sellers and protect states' abilities \nto collect the resources necessary to make the education investments \nthat will pave the way for the next technological breakthrough--the \nnext Internet. I hope my colleagues will join us and support this \napproach.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL (for himself and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 2776. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage charitable contributions to public charities for the use in \nmedical research; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the medical research investment act of 2000\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation, the Medical Research Investment Act, or MRI Act, and \nprivileged to be joined today by Senator Torricelli. The American \npeople are unique in the world in their spirit of volunterism and \ncharitable efforts. Unfortunately, the Federal Tax Code quite often \ngets in the way.\n  Congress has made impressive strides to increase resources for \nmedical research. Last year we passed and enacted an increase of $2.7 \nbillion in funding for the National Institutes of Health. This fourteen \npercent increase means this Congress is well on its way to doubling the \nFederal support for medical research, as we promised. At the same time, \nhowever, we should not diminish the critical role of private donations. \nThis is why the MRI Act is so necessary.\n  While researchers have indeed made impressive breakthroughs in \nfinding cures. The fight is far from over. For instance, 16 million \nAmericans live with diabetes mellitus. In fact, I met today a \ncourageous child, Caity Rigg, who suffers from Juvenile diabetes and \nrequires four shots of insulin a day just to survive. Diabetes is the \nleading cause of kidney failure, blindness, and amputations, and is a \nmajor factor for heart disease, stroke, and birth defects. It shortens \naverage life expectancy by 15 years and costs the nation in excess of \n$100 billion annually.\n  Cardiovascular diseases, heart attacks and strokes, claimed nearly 1 \nmillion lives in the United States in 1997. A third of these deaths \nwere premature. In 1996, a third of all hospitalization expenditures \nwere made to Medicare beneficiaries for hospital expenses due to \ncardiovascular problems.\n  This year approximately half a million Americans will die of cancer--\nmore than 1,500 people per day. It is the second leading cause of death \nin the United States, and since 1990, approximately 13 million new \ncases have been diagnosed. In 2000, over 1 million new patients will be \nstricken.\n  The MRI Act makes very simple, but very significant changes. First, \nit encourages charitable gifts of cash or property for medical research \nby increasing the limitations on deductibility from the current 50 \npercent cap to 80 percent of adjusted gross income. Individuals could \ngive 30 percent for medical research and 50 percent of income for other \npurposes. Or they could give as much as 80 percent of income for \nmedical research alone. Not only would this benefit medical research, \nbut it presents the opportunity for other charities to similarly \nreceive greater support. Further, those who can give more than 80 \npercent in a year\n\n[[Page S5680]]\n\nmay extent the carry-forward for excess charitable gifts for medical \nresearch from five years to ten years.\n  Second, the MRI Act allows medical research to benefit from incentive \nstock option, or ISO's, giving by ending disincentives for taxpayers \nwho contribute stock from ISO's to medical research. Current law taxes \nsuch transactions at a rate of almost forty percent if stocks are not \nheld for more than a year. Because of the tax on their gifts, many \ntaxpayers find they must sell $140 in stock for every $100 they wish to \ndonate because of the taxes on their gifts. In addition to this change, \nno ordinary income, capital gains or alternative minimum tax would be \nimposed on medical research gifts.\n  Accordingly to an estimate by Price Waterhouse Coopers, the MRI Act \nwould release more than 1 billion in new donations to medical research \nover the next 5 years. For many research efforts, it could mean the \ndifference between finding cures or not. Our proposal enjoys broad \nsupport from the medical research community.\n  Alliance for Aging Research, American Association for Cancer \nResearch, ALS Association (Lou Gehrigs's Disease), American Society of \nCell Biologists, Cancer Treatment Research Foundation, Coalition of \nNational Cancer Cooperative Groups, Cure for Lymphoma, Friends of \nCancer Research, International Foundation for Anticancer Drug \nDiscovery, Juvenile Diabetes Foundation for Parkinson's Research, \nOncology Nursing Society, Prevent Blindness America, Research to \nPrevent Blindness, and Society for Women's Health Research.\n  In closing, I encourage my colleagues to join us in supporting the \nMRI Act and look forward to its consideration.

A bill to amend the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration Authorization Act of 1992 to revise and enhance \nauthorities, and to authorize appropriations, for the Chesapeake Bay \nOffice, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n\n\n       THE NOOA CHESAPEAKE BAY OFFICE REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \ntogether with my colleagues, Senators Warner, Robb and Mikulski, to \nreauthorize and enhance the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Program office. This \noffice, which was first established in 1992 pursuant to Public Law 102-\n567, serves as the focal point for all of NOAA's activities within the \nChesapeake Bay watershed and is a vital part of the effort to achieve \nthe long-term goal of the Bay Program--restoring the Bay's living \nresources to healthy and balanced levels.\n  As the lead Federal agency responsible for marine science, NOAA has \nplayed a critical role in the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay and its \nliving marine resources. Since 1984, when the Agency first signed a \nMemorandum of Understanding with EPA to participate in the Chesapeake \nBay Program as a full Federal partner, NOAA has supported scientific \ninvestigations and conducted other important activities ranging from \nfisheries stock assessments to monitoring of algal blooms and tracking \nchanges in tidal wetlands. This research has been essential to \nimproving our understanding of the impacts of climate, harvest and \npollution on the decline of anadromous fish, oysters and other marines \nspecies in the Bay and helping to develop management strategies for \nrestoring living resources.\n  In order to better integrate NOAA's diverse efforts in the Bay region \nand provide a clear focal point within NOAA for Chesapeake Bay \ninitiatives, in 1991 I introduced legislation to create a NOAA \nChesapeake Bay Office or NCBO. The legislation authorized $2.5 million \na year for the program and prescribed the office's principal functions \nas coordination, strategy development, technical and financial \nassistance and research dissemination. That legislation was \nincorporated in an overall\n\n[[Page S5681]]\n\nNOAA authorization bill and became Public Law 102-567. To implement the \ninitiative, NOAA established an office in Annapolis under the \nadministration of the National Marine Fisheries Service and has been \nfunding peer-reviewed research directed at the Bay's living resource \nproblems, providing scientific expertise and technical assistance to \nBay Program partners, working to involve other relevant NOAA elements \nin the Bay restoration and participating in a wide variety of Bay \nProgram projects and activities. During the past eight years, the NCBO \nhas made great strides in realizing the objectives of the NOAA \nAuthorization Act of 1992 and the overall Bay Program living resource \ngoals. Working with other Bay Program Partners, important progress has \nbeen made in surveying and assessing fishery resources in the Bay, \ndeveloping fishery management plans for selected species, undertaking \nhabitat restoration projects, removing barriers to fish passage, and \nundertaking important remote sensing and data analysis activities.\n  NOAA's responsibilities to the Bay restoration effort are far from \ncomplete, however. Some populations of major species of fish and \nshellfish in Chesapeake Bay such as shad and oysters, remain severely \ndepressed, while others, such as blue crab are at risk. Bay-wide, some \n16 of 25 ecologically important species are in decline or severe \ndecline, due to disease, habitat loss, over-fishing and other factors. \nThe underwater grasses that once sustained these fisheries are only at \na fraction of their historic levels. Research and monitoring must be \ncontinued and enhanced to track living resource trends, evaluate the \nresponses of the estuary's biota to changes in their environment and \nestablish clear management goals and progress indicators for restoring \nthe productivity, diversity and abundance of these species. Chesapeake \n2000, the soon-to-be-signed new Bay Agreement, has identified several \nliving resource goals which will require strong NOAA involvement to \nachieve.\n\n  The legislation which I am introducing would provide NOAA with \nadditional resources and authority necessary to ensure its continued \nfull participation in the Bay's restoration and in meeting with goals \nand objectives of Chesapeake 2000. First, this measure would move \nadministration and oversight of the NOAA Bay Office from the National \nMarine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to the Office of the Undersecretary to \nhelp facilitate the pooling of all of NOAA's talents and take better \nadvantage of NOAA's multiple capabilities. In addition to NMFS there \nare four other line offices within NOAA with programs and \nresponsibilities critical to the Bay restoration effort--the Office of \nOceanic and Atmospheric Research, National Ocean Service, National \nWeather Service, and National Environmental Satellite, Data and \nInformation Service. Getting these different line offices to pool their \nresources and coordinate their activities is a serious challenge when \nthey do not have a direct stake or clear line of responsibility to the \nChesapeake Bay Program. Placing the NOAA Bay office within the Under \nSecretary's Office will help assure the coordination of activities \nacross all line organizations of NOAA.\n  Second, the legislation authorizes and directs NOAA to undertake a \nspecial five-year study, in cooperation with the scientific community \nof the Chesapeake Bay and appropriate other federal agencies, to \ndevelop the knowledge base required for understanding multi-species \ninteractions and developing multi-species management plans. To date, \nfisheries management in Chesapeake Bay and other waters, has been \nlargely based upon single-species plans that often ignore the critical \nrelationships between water and habitat quality, ecosystem health and \nthe food webs that support the Bay's living resources. There is a \ngrowing consensus between scientific leaders and managers alike that we \nmust move beyond the one-species-at-a-time approach toward a wider, \nmulti-species and ecosystem perspective. Chesapeake 2000 calls for \ndeveloping multi-species management plans for targeted species by the \nyear 2005 and implementing the plans by 2007. In order to achieve these \ngoals, NOAA must take a leadership role and support a sustained \nresearch and monitoring program.\n  Third, the legislation authorizes NOAA to carry out a small-scale \nfishery and habitat restoration grant and technical assistance program \nto help citizens organizations and local governments in the Chesapeake \nBay watershed undertake habitat, fish and shellfish restoration \nprojects. Experience has shown that, with the proper tools and \ntraining, citizens' groups and local communities can play a tremendous \nrole in fisheries and habitat protection and restoration efforts. The \nChesapeake Bay Foundation's oyster gardening program, for example, has \nproven to be highly successful in training citizens to grow oysters at \ntheir docks to help restore oysters' populations in the Bay. The new \nBay Agreement has identified a critical need to not only to expand and \npromote community-based programs but to restore historic levels of \noyster production, restore living resource habitat and submerged \naquatic vegetation. The NOAA small-grants program, which this bill \nwould authorize, would complement EPA's Chesapeake Bay small watershed \nprogram, and make ``seed'' grants available on a competitive, cost-\nsharing basis to local governments and nonprofit organizations to \nimplement hands-on projects such as improvement of fish passageways, \ncreating artificial or natural reefs, restoring wetlands and sea-grass \nbeds, and producing oysters for restoration projects.\n  Fourth, the legislation would establish an internet-based Coastal \nPredictions Center for the Chesapeake Bay. Resource managers and \nscientists alike agree that we must make better use of the various \nmodeling and monitoring systems and new technologies to improve \nprediction capabilities and response to physical and chemical events \nwithin the Bay and tributary rivers. There are substantial amounts of \ndata collected and compiled by Federal, state and local government \nagencies and academic institutions including information on weather, \ntides, currents, circulation, climate, land use, coastal environmental \nquality, aquatic living resources and habitat conditions. \nUnfortunately, little of this data is coordinated and organized in a \nmanner that is useful to the wide range of potential users. The Coastal \nPredictions Center would serve as a knowledge bank for assembling \nmonitoring and modeling data from relevant government agencies and \nacademic institutions, interpreting that data, and organizing it into \nproducts that are useful to resource managers, scientists and the \npublic.\n  Finally, the legislation would increase the authorization for the \nNOAA Bay Program from the current level of $2.5 million to $6 million \nper year to enhance current activities and to carry out these new \ninitiatives. For more than a decade, funding for NOAA's Bay Program has \nremained static at an annual average of $1.9 million. If we are to \nachieve the ultimate, long-term goal of the Bay Program--protecting, \nrestoring and maintaining the health of the living resources of the \nBay--additional financial resources must be provided.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will provide an important boost to \nour efforts to restore the Bay's living resources. It is strongly \nsupported by the Chesapeake Bay Commission, the Chesapeake Bay \nFoundation and members of the scientific community. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text of the measure and supporting letters be \nprinted in the Record immediately following my statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2777\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: We understand that you will soon be \n     introducing legislation to reauthorize NOAA's Chesapeake Bay \n     Program. This broadened, $6 million reauthorization would \n     allow NOAA to better address multi-species management issues, \n     to establish a complementary grants program in support of \n     local community projects throughtout the Bay, and to make \n     additional contributions that enhance the restoration of \n     oysters in the estuary.\n\n[[Page S5683]]\n\n       This legislation provides another enhanced mechanism for \n     meeting the ambitious restoration and protection goals \n     contained in the Chesapeake 2000 agreement that we and our \n     Bay partners are signing on June 28. The members of the \n     Chesapeake Bay Commission look forward to the enactment on \n     this NOAA reauthorization and offer our full support and \n     assistance as it moves through the Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Bolling,\n       Chairman.\n     Brian E. Frosh,\n       Vice-Chairman.\n     Arthur D.

Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The Chesapeake Bay Foundation fully \n     supports your new bill that would reauthorize and enhance the \n     NOAA Chesapeake Bay Program. We greatly appreciate your \n     leadership on this legislation and your persistent pursuit of \n     a restored Bay.\n       The NOAA Bay Program originally was authorized in 1992 and \n     has been a major contributor in protecting and restoring the \n     Bay. The NOAA Bay office has provided a clear focal point \n     within NOAA for Chesapeake Bay initiatives, involving all \n     relevant NOAA entities in Bay restoration efforts, managing \n     peer-reviewed research, and strengthening NOAA's interactions \n     with Chesapeake Bay partners.\n       One of the NOAA Bay Program's yearly achievements is its \n     fishery stock assessment. This work is crucial to gauging and \n     managing the health of the Bay's fisheries. In addition, the \n     NOAA Bay Program contributes to ecosystem management, \n     community-based restoration activities, data analysis, and \n     information management. NOAA Bay Program employees \n     participate on Chesapeake Bay Program committees and they \n     chair the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Effects Committee and \n     the Chesapeake Bay Stock Assessment Committee.\n       Recently, the NOAA Bay Program made a major commitment to \n     restoring the Bay's oyster population, which provides vital \n     filtering of polluted water and unique habitat for marine \n     life. CBF views restoring the oyster population as one of the \n     most important steps we can take to restore the health of the \n     Bay.\n       This new bill would consolidate authority for the Program's \n     base funding with other line item programs, such as oyster \n     recovery and multi-species initiatives. Moreover, the bill \n     requires the NOAA Bay Program to help the Bay states meet the \n     goals of the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement. The small watershed \n     grants section, which is a new initiative, would be used for \n     projects like Susquehanna River fish passages, oyster reef \n     reconstruction, and other citizen-led, hands-on projects.\n       Lastly, the bill increases authorization to $6 million each \n     year to carry out these activities. The Chesapeake Bay is the \n     most productive estuary in the world and its vast fisheries \n     and marine resources deserve that level of commitment from \n     the federal government.\n       This bill represents a tremendous boost for CBF's and \n     NOAA's efforts to Save the Bay. We look forward to working \n     with you to secure passage of this exciting new legislation.\n           Very Truly Yours,\n                                      Michael F. Hirshfield, PhD.,\n                              Vice-President, Resource Protection.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Specter, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Grassley, and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 2778. A bill to amend the Sherman Act to make oil-producing and \nexporting cartels illegal; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     the no oil producing and exporting cartels (nopec) act of 2000\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, we have all watched in the last few weeks as \ngas prices have skyrocketed across the country, reaching an average \nprice for regular gas of $ 1.68 per gallon. The situation is even worse \nin Wisconsin and other Midwestern states. The Milwaukee Journal \nSentinel reported on June 21 that the average price in Milwaukee for \nregular gas has reached $2.05 per gallon, and reports of consumers \npaying as much as $2.30 or more are not uncommon. We need to take \naction, and take action now, to combat this unjustified rise in gas \nprices that takes hard-earned dollars away from average citizens every \ntime they visit the gas pump. It is for this reason that I rise today, \nwith my colleagues Senators DeWine, Specter, Leahy, and Grassley, to \nintroduce the ``No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act of 2000'', \n``NOPEC''.\n  We have all heard many explanations offered for this rise in gas \nprices. Some say that the oil companies are gouging consumers. Some \nblame disruptions in supply. Others point to the EPA requirement \nmandating use of a new and more expensive type of ``reformulated'' gas \nin the Midwest. Some even claim that refiners and distributors are \nillegally fixing prices, and I am glad to see that the Federal Trade \nCommission, at the request of the Wisconsin delegation and Senator \nDeWine, has now launched an investigation to figure out if these \nallegations are true. And these are just a few of the reasons that have \nbeen offered.\n  But one cause of these escalating prices is indisputable. This is the \nprice fixing conspiracy of the OPEC nations, a conspiracy that for \nyears has unfairly driven up the cost of imported crude oil to satisfy \nthe greed of the oil exporters. We have long decried OPEC but, sadly, \nuntil now no one has tried to take any action to put it out of \nbusiness. NOPEC will, for the first time, establish, clearly and \nplainly, that when a group of competing oil producers like OPEC agrees \nto act together to restrict supply or set prices they are violating \nU.S. law, and it will authorize the Attorney General or FTC to file \nsuit under the antitrust laws for redress. Our bill will also make \nplain that the nations of OPEC cannot hide behind the doctrines of \n``Sovereign Immunity'' or ``Act of State'' to escape the reach of \nAmerican justice.\n  Even under current law, there is no doubt that the actions of the \ninternational oil cartel would be in gross violation of our most basic \nprinciples of antitrust law as nothing more than an illegal price \nfixing scheme if this cartel was a group of international private \ncompanies rather than foreign governments. But OPEC members have used \nthe shield of ``sovereign immunity'' to escape accountability for their \nprice-fixing. The Federal Sovereign Immunities Act, though, already \nrecognizes that the ``commercial'' activity of nations is not protected \nby sovereign immunity. And it is hard to imagine an activity that is \nmore obviously commercial than selling oil for profit, as the OPEC \nnations do. Our legislation will correct one erroneous twenty-year-old \nlower federal court holding and establish that sovereign immunity \ndoctrine will not divest a U.S. court from jurisdiction to hear a \nlawsuit alleging that members of the oil cartel are violating antitrust \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, in recent years a consensus has developed in \ninternational law that certain basic standards are universal, and that \nthe international community can, and should, take action when a nation \nviolates these fundamental standards. The response of the international \ncommunity to ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia and action by \nthe courts of Britain to recognize that Mr. Pinochet could be held \naccountable in Britain for allegations of human rights abuses and \ntorture that occurred when he was President of Chile are two prominent \nexamples. The rogue actions of the international oil cartel should be \ntreated no differently. The most fundamental principle of a free market \nis that competitors cannot be permitted to conspire to limit supply or \nfix price. This principle is the foundation upon which the entire body \nof competition law rests. In this era of increasing globalization, when \nwe truly need to open international markets to ensure the prosperity of \nall, we should not permit any nation to flout this fundamental \nprinciple.\n  Our NOPEC legislation will, for the first time, enable our \nauthorities to take legal action to combat the illegitimate price-\nfixing conspiracy of the oil cartel and will, at a minimum, have a real \ndeterrent effect on nations that seek to join forces to fix oil prices \nto the detriment of consumers. For these reasons, I urge that my \ncolleagues support this bill so that our nation will finally have an \neffective means to combat this selfish conspiracy of oil-rich nations.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today Senators Kohl, Specter, Leahy, \nGrassley, Feingold, and I have introduced the ``No Oil Producing and \nExporting Cartels Act of 2000'', NOPEC. We do so to address the long-\nstanding problem of foreign governments acting in the commercial arena \nto fix, allocate, and establish production and price levels of \npetroleum products.\n  More than two months ago, Senators Specter, Kohl, Thurmond, Schumer, \nBiden, and I sent a letter to the President asking him to seriously \nconsider legal action to put an end to the cartel behavior of OPEC \nnations. The White House has failed to take any action,\n\n[[Page S5684]]\n\nand it appears that there are some within the Administration who \nbelieve there may be legal stumbling blocks to such a lawsuit. During \nthe time in which the Administration has failed to take action, we have \nwitnessed gas prices begin to rise again. Most notable are the \nunexplainable, sharp price increases in several Midwestern states. \nThese price increases have harmed many in Ohio and across the Midwest. \nThere is no relief in sight. Many are speculating about the cause of \nthe price-spikes. One cause is indisputable--the unacceptably high \nprice of imported crude oil set by the OPEC cartel.\n  Nation after nation has adopted antitrust enforcement principles that \nrecognize the illegality of price fixing and other restraints of trade. \nYet OPEC is undeterred, and continues to flout broadly accepted legal \nprinciples and artificially restrains the production of oil. It is time \nfor internationally recognized principles of competition to operate in \nthe oil and petroleum industry--just as they do in other markets.\n  The purpose of NOPEC is simple and straightforward. It makes clear \nthat the U.S. enforcement agencies may bring antitrust enforcement \nactions against foreign states which violate antitrust laws in the \nproduction and sale of oil and other petroleum products, and it \nestablishes that the district courts have jurisdiction and authority to \nconsider such cases.\n  NOPEC does this by amending the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act, ``FSIA''. Under FSIA, the governmental \nactivities of foreign governments are immune from the jurisdiction of \nthe federal courts. A lower federal court has ruled--we believe \nerroneously--that the conduct of OPEC nations in relation to oil \nproduction and exportation are governmental, not commercial activities, \nand thus immune. NOPEC corrects this ruling, and clarifies the law, \nspecifically removing immunity from foreign governments when they are \nengaged in the limitation of the production or distribution of oil and \nother petroleum products. NOPEC also makes clear that the federal \ncourts should not decline to make a determination on the merits of an \naction brought under NOPEC based on the ``act of state'' doctrine.\n  This legislation will send a strong signal to OPEC nations that their \nagreements restrain trade and harm American consumers. This will no \nlonger be accepted. Our legislation will allow the U.S. enforcement \nagencies to do their jobs and enforce the antitrust laws.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Kohl, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Torricelli, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 2779. A bill to provide for the designation of renewal communities \nand to provide tax incentives relating to such communities, to provide \na tax credit to taxpayers investing in entities seeking to provide \ncapital to create new markets in low-income communities, and to provide \nfor the establishment of Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n     the american community renewal and new markets empowerment act\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am joining colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to introduce the American Community Renewal and New \nMarkets Empowerment Act. Demonstrating that Congress can constructively \nwork together and find common ground, we--Senators Lieberman, \nTorricelli, Kohl, Santorum, Abraham, and Hutchinson--unveiled a plan \nthat creates economic incentives to help close America's wealth gap. \nAmong many important initiatives, our plan includes my new markets \nlegislation that I introduced last September, S. 1594, the Community \nDevelopment and Venture Capital Act, and full funding for Round II of \nEmpowerment Zones.\n  This plan builds on the President's and Speaker's agreement by \nsecuring full, mandatory funding for Massachusett's Empowerment Zone. \nSo far, the money has dribbled in--only $6.6 million of the $100 \nmillion authorized over ten years--and made it impossible for the city \nto implement a plan for economic self-sufficiency. Some 80 public and \nprivate entities, from universities to technology companies to banks to \nlocal government, showed incredible community spirit and committed to \nmatching the EZ money, eight to one. Let me say it another way--these \ngroups agreed to match the $100 million in Federal Empowerment Zone \nmoney with $800 million. Yet, regrettably, in spite of this incredible \nalliance, the city of Boston has not been able to tap into that \nleveraged money and implement the strategic plan because Congress \nhasn't held its part of the bargain. I am extremely pleased that we \nwere able to work together and find a way to provide full, steady \nfunding to these zones. That money means education, daycare, \ntransportation and basic health care in areas--in Massachusetts that \nincludes 57,000 residents who live in Roxbury, Dorchester and \nMattipan--where almost 50 percent of the children are living in poverty \nand nearly half the residents over 25 don't even have a high school \ndiploma.\n  Mr. President, this bill also includes an initiative that I \nintroduced last year called the Community Development and Venture \nCapital Act. Its purpose is to stimulate economic development through \npublic-private partnerships that invest venture capital in smaller \nbusinesses that are located in impoverished rural and urban areas, \nknown as new markets, or that employ low-income people. We call these \nareas new markets because of the overlooked business opportunities. \nAccording to Michael Porter, a respected professor at Harvard and \nbusiness analyst who has written extensively on competitiveness, ``. . \n. inner cities are the largest underserved market in America, with many \ntens of billions of dollars of unmet consumer and business demand.''\n  Both innovative and fiscally sound, my new markets initiative is \nfinancially structured similar to Small Business Administration \n(SBA's), successful Small Business Investment Company (SBIC), program, \nand incorporates a technical assistance component similar to that \nsuccessfully used in SBA's microloan program. However, unlike the SBIC \nprogram which focuses solely on small businesses with high-growth \npotential and claims successes such as Staples and Calaway Golf, the \nNew Markets Venture Capital program will focus on smaller businesses \nthat show promise of financial and social returns, such as jobs--what \nwe call a ``double bottomline.''\n  To get at the complex and deep-rooted economic problems in new market \nareas, my initiative has three parts: a venture capital program to \nfunnel investment money into our poorest communities, a program to \nexpand the number of venture capital firms that are devoted to \ninvesting in such communities, and a mentoring program to link \nestablished, successful businesses with businesses and entrepreneurs in \nstagnant or deteriorating communities in order to facilitate the \nlearning curve.\n  What I'm trying to do as Ranking Member of the Small Business \nCommittee, and have been working with the SBA to achieve, is expand \ninvestment in our neediest communities by building on the economic \nactivity created by loans. I think one of the most effective ways to do \nthat is to spur venture capital investment in our neediest communities.\n  But, Mr. President, this bill even goes further than funding \nempowerment zones and establishing incentives to attract venture \ncapital into distressed communities. It enhances education \nopportunities, creates individual development accounts to help low-\nincome families save and invest in their future, increases affordable \nhousing, improves access to technology in our classrooms and creates \nincentives to help communities remediate brownfields.\n  Before closing, I want to thank my colleauges for working so hard on \nthis compromise and for their admirable willingness to put aside our \ndifferences for a larger purpose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/22/senate-section/article/S5684-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5684-S5686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 345\n\n  At the request of Mr. Allard, the name of the Senator from Georgia \n(Mr. Cleland) was added as a cosponsor of S. 345, a bill to amend the \nAnimal Welfare Act to remove the limitation that permits interstate \nmovement of live birds, for the purpose of fighting, to States in which \nanimal fighting is lawful.\n\n[[Page S5685]]\n\n                                 S. 577\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Arkansas \n(Mrs. Lincoln) was added as a cosponsor of S. 577, a bill to provide \nfor injunctive relief in Federal district court to enforce State laws \nrelating to the interstate transportation of intoxicating liquor.\n\n\n                                 S. 656\n\n  At the request of Mr. Reed, the name of the Senator from Nebraska \n(Mr. Hagel) was added as a cosponsor of S. 656, a bill to provide for \nthe adjustment of status of certain nationals of Liberia to that of \nlawful permanent residence.\n\n\n                                 S. 662\n\n  At the request of Mr. L.

Res. 327\n\n       Whereas thousands of women around the world are killed and \n     maimed each year in the name of family ``honor'';\n       Whereas the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, 56th \n     Session, January 2000, working with the Special Rapporteurs \n     on violence against women and extrajudicial,\n\n[[Page S5687]]\n\n     summary or arbitrary executions, received reports of so-\n     called ``honor killings'' from numerous countries, including \n     Bangladesh, Jordan, India, Pakistan, Ecuador, Uganda, and \n     Morocco, and noted that such killings take many forms, such \n     as flogging, forced suicide, stoning, beheading, acid-\n     throwing, and burning;\n       Whereas, according to the 1999 report of the Department of \n     State on human rights, so-called ``crimes of honor'' in \n     Bangladesh include acid-throwing and whipping of women \n     accused of moral indiscretion;\n       Whereas authorities in Bangladesh expect as many as 200 \n     honor killings in that country in 2000;\n       Whereas thousands of Pakistani women, including young \n     girls, are stabbed, burned, or maimed every year by husbands, \n     fathers, and brothers who accuse them of dishonoring their \n     family by being unfaithful, seeking a divorce, or refusing an \n     arranged marriage;\n       Whereas Jordan, which had 20 reported honor killings in \n     1998, still has laws reducing the penalty for or exempting \n     perpetrators of honor crimes, and the Jordanian parliament \n     has twice failed to repeal those laws;\n       Whereas the King of Jordan has taken the commendable action \n     of establishing Jordan's Royal Commission on Human Rights, \n     chaired by the Queen of Jordan, primarily to address \n     obstacles, including the persistence of honor crimes, that \n     prevent women and children from exercising their basic human \n     rights;\n       Whereas more than 5,000 dowry deaths occur every year in \n     India, according to the United Nations Children's Fund \n     (UNICEF), which reported in 1997 that a dozen women die each \n     day in kitchen fires, disguised as accidents, because their \n     husbands' families are dissatisfied over the size of the \n     women's dowries;\n       Whereas women accused of adultery in Afghanistan, the \n     United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, and a host of other countries \n     are subject to a maximum penalty of death by stoning;\n       Whereas, even though honor killings may be outlawed, law \n     enforcement and judicial systems often fail properly to \n     investigate, arrest, and prosecute offenders, and laws \n     frequently permit such reductions in sentences or exemptions \n     from prosecution to those who kill in the name of honor that \n     the results are typically token punishments, impunity, and \n     continued violence against women; and\n       Whereas the right to life is the most fundamental of all \n     rights and must be guaranteed to every individual without \n     discrimination, and the perpetuation of honor killings and \n     dowry deaths is a deliberate violation of women's human \n     rights that should be universally condemned: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President, through the United States Agency for \n     International Development, should work with law enforcement \n     and judicial agencies of foreign governments to encourage the \n     adoption of legal system reforms that provide for the \n     effective investigation and prosecution of crimes known as \n     ``honor crimes'';\n       (2) the President, through the United States Agency for \n     International Development, should make available to local \n     organizations in foreign countries sufficient resources to \n     provide refuge and rehabilitation for women who are victims \n     of honor crimes and to sustain their children;\n       (3) the Secretary of State, when preparing annual country \n     reports on human rights practices, should include information \n     relating to the incidence of honor violence in foreign \n     countries, the steps taken by foreign governments to address \n     the problem of honor violence, and all relevant actions taken \n     by the United States, whether through diplomacy or foreign \n     assistance programs, to reduce the incidence of honor \n     violence and increase investigations and prosecutions of such \n     crimes;\n       (4) the President should--\n       (A) communicate to the United Nations the concern over the \n     high rate of honor-related violence toward women in foreign \n     countries worldwide;
