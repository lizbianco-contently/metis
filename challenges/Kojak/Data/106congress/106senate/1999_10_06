On behalf of the leader, I have been asked to announce \nthat the Senate will resume consideration of the pending Nickles \namendment on the Labor-HHS bill regarding the Social Security trust \nfund. It is hoped that Senators who have filed amendments will work \nwith the bill managers. What we propose to do is continue to alternate, \nand we are going to seek time agreements of 30 minutes equally divided \nso that we can move ahead and complete the bill. We have contentious \namendments which are pending on both sides. We are working on the \nRepublican side to try to have these amendments considered with very \nshort time agreements, or reasonably short time agreements so that we \ncan proceed.\n  We have the obligation to finish this bill, or at least the \nexpectation of finishing this bill by the close of business tomorrow. \nThere are dinners both Wednesday evening, this evening, and tomorrow \nevening which will keep our sessions not too long unless we establish a \nwindow, which we will have to do. And if a window is established, that \nmeans very late night sessions if we are to recess from 6:30, 7 \no'clock, 8:30 or 9 o'clock. That is something to be avoided. We have \nculled down the amendments, and we think we are in a position to move \nahead very promptly.\n  The leader has asked me also to announce that the Senate may consider \nconference reports to accompany the Agriculture appropriations bill and \nany other conference reports available during this week's session of \nthe Senate.\n  Until one or two other Senators arrive, I would like to take a moment \nor two to comment about another matter of business, a very important \nmatter, and that is the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/06/senate-section/article/S12051-7", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12051-S12052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the President invited a number of \nSenators, both Democrats and Republicans, to the White House last night \nfor dinner, including the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, who is \nnow presiding. I had expressed a view publicly before the dinner began \nthat I thought the vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty should be \ndeferred; it should not be held on Tuesday. I have stated that position \nbecause it is plain that there are not enough votes in the Senate to \npass the treaty. I favor the treaty. I said so publicly some time ago. \nI think it is also not timely to take up the treaty on the existing \nschedule because of the complexity of the issue.\n  Yesterday, the Armed Services Committee held 5 hours of hearings. I \nattended part of them. The subject matter is very complicated. It is my \njudgment that Senators are not really prepared to vote on the matter \nand that the vote may take on partisan overtones, political overtones, \nparty partisan overtones, which I think would be very undesirable.\n  It has been reported publicly that all 45 Democrats are in favor of \nthe treaty; that there are only a very few Republicans who are in favor \nof the treaty, and that many Senators on both sides have really not had \nan opportunity to study the treaty in depth to have positions which \nmight lead some to disagree with the party position.\n\n[[Page S12052]]\n\n  It is my thinking that it would be calamitous--a very strong word, \nbut I think that is the right word--if the Senate were to reject the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. At the present time around the world, \nmany eyebrows are raised because the Senate has not ratified the \ntreaty. But if the Senate were to reject the treaty, then it would be \nhighly publicized worldwide. It would be an open excuse for countries \nsuch as India and Pakistan to continue nuclear testing, which I think \nis very undesirable, destabilizing that area of the world, and give an \nexcuse for rogue nations such as Iran, Iraq, Libya, and other rogue \nnations to test, and it would be very undesirable.\n  It is a complicated issue because our distinguished majority leader \nhas scheduled the vote under a unanimous consent agreement with the \nminority leader after very substantial pressures have been building up \nwith many floor statements demanding a vote.\n  The majority leader gave them what they asked for, and it was agreed \nto. It is not an easy matter to have that unanimous consent agreement \nvitiated. Any Senator can object to the vote. We will go ahead and \nschedule it. The administration has expressed the view it does not want \nto make a commitment to have no vote during the year 2000. The leader \nhas propounded a substitute unanimous consent agreement, as I \nunderstand it--I wasn't on the floor at the time--which would vitiate \nthe unanimous consent agreement on the condition that no vote be held \nin the year 2000.\n  The administration takes the position if they were to agree to that, \nor go along with it, that it would look as if they were backing off the \ntreaty and it would be complicated for other world leaders as to how \nthe administration would explain that kind of a position when we were \npressing other nations to stop nuclear testing and to end \nproliferation.\n  It may be the matter is really for the Senate without the \nadministration. We set our own schedule. Perhaps a group of Senators \nrepresenting both Democrats and Republicans could take the \nresponsibility to oppose a vote during the year 2000.\n  Another idea which occurred to me this morning was to have a vote in \nthe year 2000 but have it after the election so the treaty does not \nbecome embroiled in Presidential politics. One of the key Democrats \nexpressed the view that he would oppose considering the treaty in the \nyear 2000 because it would become embroiled in Presidential politics \nand surely lose.\n  If a debate were to be scheduled by mid-November and then a vote held \nin November that could accommodate the interests of not having it \ninvolved in a Presidential campaign and still give President Clinton an \nopportunity to have the treaty decided upon during his tenure as \nPresident with him being in the position to advocate.\n  I make these comments because I think with the schedule for debate on \nFriday and then again on Tuesday and a scheduled vote on Tuesday that \ntime is of the essence--in this case very much the essence, not unlike \nthat expression which has arisen in real estate transactions--that \nthere are very serious international implications.\n  I know many Senators will be following up on the dinner meeting of \nlast night by communicating with our distinguished majority leader and \nby communicating with people on both sides to see if we can accommodate \nall of the competing interests.\n  We are facing one of the most important votes of our era. It will set \nback arms control and nonproliferation very substantially if this \ntreaty goes down. If after study and deliberation and an adequate time \nfor debate the treaty is rejected, so be it. That is constitutional \nprocess. But to have it go down with the kinds of pressures to schedule \nit, and a schedule which has been entered into knowingly with leaders \non both sides having unanimous consent agreements all the time, and any \nsuggestion that there is any inappropriate conduct on anybody's part is \ntotally unfounded. That is the way we operate. But, as I view it, it is \nan unwise course for the reasons I have stated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/06/senate-section/article/S12052-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12052-S12062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have some housekeeping.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I still have the floor.\n  I ask my distinguished colleague, the assistant majority leader, if \nwe could propound a unanimous consent request to consider the pending \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the manager of the bill, \nwe are going to have to do that now. It would be appropriate if the \ndebate started. We are in the process of checking to see who wants to \nspeak against the pending amendment.\n  I say in response to my friend's statement earlier that we want to \nmove this along. The staff has worked very well the last several days \nsince we had our break. We are down now to about 16 amendments, give or \ntake a few, both Democratic and Republican amendments. We have on our \nside agreed. We have time agreements on most of ours--not all of them \nbut most of them. I think we can move forward on that basis.\n  I also say to my friend that I saw the Senator from Pennsylvania \ncoming into the White House as I was leaving last night. I was invited \ndown for a meeting. I should say to my friend that I had orange juice \nand some nuts. I see that he was served dinner. That is something I \nhave to check into.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator and I had been there at the same time, we \ncould have solved this problem.\n  Mr. REID. Over dinner.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The fact that I was arriving as the Senator from Nevada \nwas departing led to the inability to solve it. If we had been there \ntogether, we would have had a very abbreviated meeting. We could have \nconcentrated on dinner instead of debate.\n  Mr. REID. I think maybe the Senator's great skills in debates may \nhave had something to do with the Senator being served dinner and me \ngetting by with just orange juice and a bowl of nuts.\n  Anyway, I think we should proceed on this pending amendment and move \nforward with it. If the Senator from Pennsylvania has someone speaking \non it, we will try to get people lined up to speak against it and try \nto move along as quickly as possible.\n  We called some of our people to come over and offer amendments. We \ncould set that aside and move on to some of these amendments on which \nwe have time limits.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would be agreeable to setting the \namendment aside. I have secured the agreement of the proponent of the \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution, Senator Nickles, to 30 minutes equally \ndivided. It is a sense of the Senate. It does not have the import of \nsome of the other amendments which involve real money and not \nconfederate money. The next amendment would come from the other side of \nthe aisle. If somebody is ready to offer an amendment, I would be \nagreeable to setting this amendment aside until we can reach a time \nagreement.\n  Let me yield now to my colleague from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that several \nfrom our side of the aisle are coming to speak on this, and Senator \nNickles will return at 10.\n  While they are assembling their amendments, we might talk on this for \nthe next few minutes and then get a time agreement with Senator Nickles \nand I for 30 minutes equally divided. He has indicated he will do that. \nWe have a few minutes before they are ready to present their amendment. \nWe might continue to discuss this amendment.\n\n[[Page S12053]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I think that would be appropriate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, may I inquire of my distinguished \ncolleague from Nevada whether an amendment is ready now or when an \namendment will be ready to be offered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have two Senators who are on their way. \nIn Senate language, ``on their way'' doesn't mean they are walking into \nthe building. They have indicated to us they are on their way. As soon \nas they are through the door, I will let the Senate know and we can get \na time agreement on the amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I might say, for the information of \nall Senators who may be watching on television, we are very anxious to \nsort of queue up so we can move along with dispatch.\n  If there are Senators on our side of the aisle who wish to speak on \nthis sense of the Senate, it would be my request that they come over \npromptly so they can speak--the same thing about Members on Senator \nReid's side of the aisle. If somebody has an amendment to offer, we can \nmove this bill along and stack those votes and not have to have a late \nnight session. The leader did talk about a window. We haven't had a \nwindow for a while. Windows which bring us back here late in the \nevening hours are not very much appreciated.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I also say, if my friend will yield, to \nelaborate on his statement, Friday is fast approaching and people have \nthings they want to do on Friday. Friday is scheduled now, and it may \nbe vitiated based on the statement the Senator from Pennsylvania has \nmade. The way the unanimous consent order is now in place, we are going \nto start debate on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on Friday. There \nare a lot of people who have planned their schedules around that. If \nthat is taken off for some reason, I am sure the majority leader will \nask us to complete this bill, if it is not completed before Thursday.\n  I say to my friend that we need to move forward on this bill, if \nanybody has any anticipation of going back to their States on Friday.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that was well said.\n  Mr. President, may I yield to my colleague from Georgia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am going to speak for a moment or two \nabout the pending business, which is the Nickles amendment numbered \n1851. It is a sense of the Senate and is quite short and very clear.\n  It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should ensure that fiscal \nyear 2000 appropriations measures do not result in an on-budget \ndeficit, excluding surpluses generated by the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  Basically, what he is saying is that if for any reason in our \nbudgetary exercise we find ourselves having dipped into the Social \nSecurity receipts, go beyond non-Social Security receipts, there would \nbe a sequester for across-the-board cuts to replenish it. The response \nfrom the other side is interesting because, of course, the President \nand the other side have said they don't want to use Social Security \nreceipts and then they say current budgetary activities, depending on \nwhose numbers you read, may have already done so.\n\n  I point out, it is not over until it is over. There has been no \nconcluding action on our budget decisions. What this sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment states is ``if,'' depending on how much, it would \nrequire across-the-board cuts to protect Social Security--pretty clean \nand very simple. That is the sense-of-the-Senate resolution from \nSenator Nickles of Oklahoma, amendment No. 1851. It is simple. It says \nwhen we finish all of our budget activities, finish all the \nconferences, and have everything concluded, if we have gone beyond \nother surpluses and dipped into Social Security, they will be \nreplenished by an across-the-board cut.\n  The other side last week was imploring it is already maybe at $19 \nbillion. It depends on whose numbers you look at. That is a 5-percent \nacross-the-board cut. We are not there, is the point. If the budgeteers \nand appropriators are neglectful and we get into Social Security at \nthat level, it will be appropriate there be a 5-percent across-the-\nboard cut. Everybody has agreed--the President, the leadership on the \nother side and on our side--we should not use Social Security receipts \nto deal with this year's budget.\n  I think Senator Nickles from Oklahoma offers a rational concept for \nassuring the American people--assuring those individuals who are \nconcerned about Social Security, whether they are using Social Security \nor about to use Social Security--that this Congress is not going to use \nthose to deal with the current expenditures.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May I interrupt my distinguished colleague to propound a \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent, and it has been cleared with \nSenator Reid, that the pending amendment be subject to 1 hour of debate \nwith time equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield time to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, Senator Nickles should be here shortly \nto speak on his own behalf. Basically, he outlined a very simple \npremise and a very important principle, that we are not going to use \nSocial Security for new spending; we are going to protect Social \nSecurity receipts.\n  He has offered a concept by which that would be done. Its impact \nwould depend on the amount to which appropriators and the Congress, \nthrough their budgetary practices, had used those receipts. They have \ntwo options: They can go back to the conference committee reports and \nmake sure the spending does not get into Social Security, in which case \nthis has no import. But if they do, if it is $5 billion, that will be a \n1-percent across-the-board cut; if it is $20 billion, it will be about \n5.\n  It is up to the conscience, work, and dedication of our appropriators \nto resolve.\n  He outlines early in the process a premise which I think is sound: if \nwe get into Social Security, we will recover.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time does my distinguished colleague from New \nHampshire desire?\n  Mr. GREGG. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 10 minutes to Senator Gregg.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Nickles amendment \nof which I am a cosponsor along with a number of other Members of the \nSenate.\n  This proposal addresses one of the underlying political debates we \nare confronting today in trying to reach conclusion on our entire \nbudget, which is the manner in which we should handle Social Security \nsurplus. It is a key element of how we can resolve this matter and \nresolve it in a way that fulfills at least the stated goals of the \nvarious parties.\n  We have heard the President say on a number of occasions he wants to \nprotect the Social Security surplus and preserve it for Social \nSecurity. It has been our position, as the Republican membership of \nthis Senate, that we should do exactly that. In fact, we have offered \ntime and again something called a lockbox which would essentially \nguarantee all Social Security surplus be held independent of any other \nspending and would not be available for any other activities of the \nGovernment but, rather, be reserved for the purposes of paying down the \ndebt and being retained in the Social Security trust fund as debt \ninstruments.\n  Unfortunately, as we have moved down the road to address the \noperating budget of the Federal Government, it has been clear the \nadministration wants to have it both ways: They want to say, on one \nside, protect the Social Security trust fund, and specifically the \nsurplus which is now being generated by the Social Security accounts; \nbut, on the other side, they want to propose a large amount of new \nspending which would inevitably lead to using up some portion of the \nsurplus of the Social Security trust fund.\n  Senator Nickles, other Members of this Senate, and I have come \nforward with this proposal which is a sense of the Senate and therefore \nisn't binding. Hopefully at some point it will be put into binding \nlanguage. It says under no circumstances will Social Security\n\n[[Page S12054]]\n\ntrust fund dollars or the surplus now being generated by the Social \nSecurity taxes being paid be used to operate the general functions of \nthe Federal Government, and that we should have a mechanism to \nguarantee what is known as a sequester which is a system of saying, if \never we should spend a dollar or it is looking as if we are about to \nspend a dollar of Social Security surplus funds, there will be a \nsequester in spending of the general fund, the general operating \naccounts of the Federal Government, the discretionary accounts of the \nFederal Government, the ``sequester'' meaning those accounts would be \nreduced to the extent necessary in order to be sure no Social Security \nsurplus funds would be used.\n\n  This, of course, is the proper way to proceed because it sets in \nplace a mechanism which makes it clear, and which makes it absolutely a \nsure thing, that there will be not an invasion of Social Security \nsurplus funds.\n  To step back a second, let's understand what the Social Security \nsurplus funds are. We all pay Social Security taxes on our earnings. \nThey are called FICA taxes. Those taxes go into what is known as the \nSocial Security trust fund. That trust fund is used to pay for the \noperation of the Social Security system.\n  The Social Security system for many years ran a deficit where the \ntaxes being raised were not enough to support the money being paid to \nsupport the benefits, or it was about to run a deficit. Therefore, we \nchanged the tax law and we changed the structure of the benefits back \nin 1983 so the system was put into a solvent situation.\n  As the baby boom generation grew in its earning capacity and the \nolder generations preceding, the World War II generations, retired, we \nfound the earning capacity of the baby boom generation was so great it \nwas generating a huge surplus. In other words, there was more money \ngoing into the Social Security trust fund than was needed to support \nthe people on Social Security.\n  For a number of years, because the operating accounts of the Federal \nGovernment, the day-to-day operation accounts independent of Social \nSecurity, were running a deficit, the Social Security trust fund was \nborrowed from to mask the deficit of the operating accounts of the \nFederal Government. We ended up with the Federal Government day-to-day \noperations, whether defense, education, or social services, being \nsupported by the Social Security taxes which were being paid into the \nSocial Security trust fund.\n  With the occurrence of the good economy and a strict fiscal \ndiscipline put in place by this Republican Congress, we now are in a \nposition where we are running what is known as a real surplus. In other \nwords, the amount of money we are taking in in order to operate the \nFederal Government in its day-to-day activities is about the same, and \nit is starting to grow to the point where it is actually exceeding the \namount of money necessary to operate the Federal Government. So things \nsuch as education, defense, and general social services can be paid for \nby the general revenues of the Federal Government. It is no longer \nnecessary for us to invade the Social Security trust fund in any way to \noperate the Federal Government.\n  Yet there is still some pressure, because there is this surplus \nrunning up in the Social Security trust fund, to say we can spend a \nlittle more on the operations side of the Federal Government--a little \nmore for defense, a little more for education. All we have to do is \ntake it out of the Social Security trust fund to pay for it.\n  That is what this debate is about; there are many of us who believe \nthat is not the proper way to do it. The money that goes into the \nSocial Security trust fund should be reserved for the purposes of \npreserving and protecting Social Security. Some of us have even gone so \nfar as to put forward major pieces of legislation, bipartisan in \nnature, which would structure a program to make the Social Security \nsystem solvent not only for today but for the next hundred years.\n  In fact, there is a bill that would do exactly that which I cosponsor \nwith Senator Breaux, Senator Grassley, and a number of other Members, \nSenator Kerrey, Bob Kerrey from Nebraska. It would make the Social \nSecurity system solvent for years. It would use this surplus in the \nSocial Security trust fund to accomplish that solvency.\n  That is really another story. But it points out it is important the \nSocial Security surplus is preserved for Social Security, the \npreservation of Social Security, and it is not used to operate the \ngeneral government.\n  In order to keep Social Security solvent, in order to keep the \nsurplus from the day-to-day operation of the Federal Government, we \nhave put forward this sense of the Senate. As I mentioned, what the \nsense of the Senate essentially says is, if it occurs that the day-to-\nday operation of the Federal Government--for national defense, for \neducation, for general social activities--should exceed the operating \nincome of the general government--income taxes, business taxes, various \nexcise taxes we receive--if it should exceed those incomes, then rather \nthan go into the Social Security trust fund to pay for that deficit, we \nwill reduce the spending of the Federal Government to the point where \nthe incomes of the Federal Government meet the expenses of the Federal \nGovernment on the operating side of the ledger and the Social Security \nsurplus will, therefore, be kept protected and preserved for the \npurpose, I hope, of putting in place a large, comprehensive plan I just \ndescribed to you, that Senators Breaux, Kerrey, and Grassley, and I \nhave introduced.\n  This proposal is a sense of the Senate. It is not even actually a \nlegislative event. I hope someday it will be. But this legislation \nsimply states that the Senate is not going to tolerate the invasion of \nthe Social Security trust fund for purposes of operating the day-to-day \nfunctioning of the Government of the United States; that we are going \nto expect the Government of the United States to meet its day-to-day \noperating expenses from the traditional resources that are available to \nit for operations and not from the income that comes from those people \nwho are paying Social Security taxes.\n\n  Rather than just making that as a statement, we are also taking it a \nstep further, saying we shall create a sequester mechanism whereby \nthere will be an actual reduction in spending on the day-to-day \noperations side of the account should there ever occur a situation \nwhere the Social Security trust fund was going to be used in order to \npay for day-to-day operations. Thus, we create this clear, enforceable \nprotection for Social Security and for our Social Security trust fund.\n  It is a very simple idea. It is a very appropriate idea. Most \nimportant, it is an idea that is absolutely consistent with everything \nwe have heard from the White House and from the other side of the aisle \nas it has put forward its concepts of how we should protect and \npreserve the Social Security trust fund. Essentially, Senator Nickles, \nI, and the other Senators who support this legislation, most of whom I \nguess are Republican, are really doing the work of the administration.\n  We know, for that reason, we are going to be supported both by the \nadministration and Democratic Members of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 6 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have here an interesting saga. It started \nwhen the House decided to add another month to the fiscal year. That \ncaused a little bit of controversy, to say the least. Then last week \nthey came up with a new proposal, and that is the earned-income tax \ncredit, which Ronald Reagan said was the best antiwelfare program he \nhad ever known. The Republicans in the House decided what they were \ngoing to do was slow down the payments of this, the best antiwelfare \nprogram ever.\n  This ran into a little bit of trouble, including the frontrunner for \nthe Republican nomination for President, George W. Bush, who said he \nthought it was wrong to try to balance the budget on the backs of the \npoor.\n  Just a short time ago, they came up with a new proposal. That is what \nwe are here to talk about today, an across-the-board cut. Of course, an \nacross-the-board cut would be devastating. In fact, it was attacked \nimmediately by the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations \nCommittee as a political blunder. He said: ``It's a mistake.\n\n[[Page S12055]]\n\n It sets a bad precedent. We have never done anything like that.'' This \nis the chairman, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations \nCommittee. So I think we should just step back and become more \nrealistic and look at some reasonable offsets to fund Government the \nway it should be funded.\n  In this morning's Washington Post, in something called ``In The \nLoop'' by Al Kamen, he gave us the results of a little contest he held. \nHe wanted to find out what people thought the new month should be \nnamed. Remember, the majority wants to extend the calendar year 1 \nmonth. Here are some of the names they have come up with. He said:\n\n       We weeded out some suggestions that came as many as 10 \n     times, such as Porkuary or Porkcember, Debtuary or Debtember, \n     Budgetary. . . .\n\n  But some of those he thinks were winners were: ``Abracadember'' which \nis, magic, It is like ``abracadabra.'' And then ``Payupuary'' was also \ndeclared a winner. This is clearly voodoo economics; one of the names \nthat won was ``Voodoober.''\n  We have another one that sounds pretty good--I certainly agree it \nshould be declared a winner--``Gridlocked-ober,'' based upon the \ngridlock that occurred just a few years ago because of the Republicans \nshutting down the Government. Another one is ``Busta-cap-uary.'' This \nwas submitted by a Member of the House of Representatives.\n  Another one that was not submitted by a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, but probably should have been--is called \n``DeLaypril,'' named after the House whip.\n  I think it is good to add a little bit of levity to what is going on. \nBut the levity should end and we should get serious about getting rid \nof the appropriations bills. When I say get rid of them, I mean just \nthat. We should get them so they can pass muster here and be signed by \nthe President. The way things are going now, I think the President is \ngoing to veto almost every appropriations bill that is going to be sent \nto him. It is apparent to me the appropriations bills have too much \nmagic in them and really are pieces of legislation that deserve these \nderogatory names. We must get serious and pass a budget the American \npeople will accept.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time to the Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, might I inquire of my colleague from New \nJersey how long would he wish to speak.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We have, by unanimous consent, established a half \nhour on each side. If the Senator from Nevada has used 6 minutes, then \nwe have roughly 24 left.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada, now the Senator from \nNew Jersey, has 25 minutes 30 seconds. The Senator from Pennsylvania \nhas 18 minutes 19 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may yield to \nthe Senator from Oklahoma for 5 minutes without losing any time on our \nside. That comes off their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for \nhis cooperation. Of course, this will be charged to our time.\n  I appreciate the comments by Senator Coverdell and Senator Gregg. I \nknow Senator Grams from Minnesota will be speaking shortly on this \namendment. I will make some quick comments, and maybe I will not take 5 \nminutes.\n  I hope we do not have to have across-the-board cuts to meet our \nobjectives, but our objective is to make absolutely certain that we do \nnot dip in, as some people say, or spend some of the Social Security \nsurplus money.\n  Right now there are surplus taxes coming from Social Security. There \nare more taxes going in than going out. We want 100 percent of that to \nbe used to pay down the national debt. We do not want to spend it. We \ndo not want to spend it for anything other than paying down the \nnational debt. Period. We are drawing the line.\n  I heard my colleagues from the Appropriations Committee--and I have \ngreat respect for the members on that committee; I served on it at one \ntime--say: We do not want to; we do not have to. I agree with that. We \neven put in the resolution we would have across-the-board cuts only if \nnecessary. I hope it will not be necessary. I do not think it will be \nnecessary.\n  Right now, in totaling up the bills, from the Budget Committee and \nthe Congressional Budget Office, basically if we have discretionary \nspending above $592 billion or $593 billion, then we will start dipping \ninto the Social Security money. Current projections are if we continue \nspending, as outlined in all the appropriations bills, we will be above \nthat figure by about $4 billion or $5 billion. We have not concluded \nmajor appropriations bills. We have not concluded the Ag bill, but we \nare very close. We have not concluded the Department of Defense bill, \nand we have not concluded the Labor-HHS bill which is the biggest bill. \nAmong those three bills, we can find $5 billion, and there would be no \nreason whatsoever to have to make this cut.\n  In the event we do not, for whatever reason, then let's have some \nadjustments. If it turns out we are $5 billion over--and those are the \nfigures given by the Budget Committee and Appropriations Committee--we \nwill have across-the-board reduction cuts of about 1 percent. It will \napply to Defense, Labor-HHS, and VA-HUD. It will apply to all agencies. \nThat is minuscule, that is affordable, and that is doable. It will keep \nus from dipping into Social Security trust funds as we have done year \nafter year.\n  A lot of us have been pretty resolute in saying we ought to have a \nline. We are breaching the line on the caps because we are exceeding \nthe caps by using emergency designations. We are now saying the \nabsolute line is let's not grab Social Security money. That money comes \nfrom payroll taxes. It is supposed to be set aside for retirement. It \nis not to be spent on a variety of programs, whether that is a $2 \nbillion increase in NIH or a $2.3 billion increase in education, or a \nbig increase in defense, or an $8.7 billion emergency Agricultural \nbill. It should not be spent for those things. If necessary, and \nhopefully it will not be necessary, we will implement across-the-board \nreductions to make absolutely certain that we do not dip into the \nSocial Security trust funds.\n  I thank Senator Gregg, Senator Coverdell, Senator Grams from \nMinnesota, Senator Gramm from Texas, and others in supporting this \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment, and hopefully it will not be necessary; \nCongress will pass its bills and show at least enough discipline to not \ndip into the Social Security trust fund.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for his accommodation so \nI can attend another meeting. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I offer to let our friends on the \nother side who want to speak in opposition go ahead now if they want. I \nwill pick up my time when that is done, if that is all right, if \nanybody has any interest.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for another half second?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHagel be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to make sure we mean it when we \nsay we are going to protect Social Security. Right now I ought to say \nwelcome to the magic show because what we are hearing is rather \nhypothetical: If we want to protect Social Security by adopting across-\nthe-board reductions in all discretionary appropriations, it should be \nsufficient to eliminate such deficit if necessary.\n  I believe it is more important to say how we are going to do that \nwithout at the same time dipping into Social Security. It is not \nrealistic. This is pie in the sky, and the American public ought to \nknow about what we are talking.\n\n[[Page S12056]]\n\n  I do not support deep, indiscriminate cuts in education, defense, or \nlaw enforcement. Tell the veterans you want to cut further. I want to \nhear anybody stand on this floor and say to the veterans who served our \ncountry when we needed them and we made promises: Sorry, we are going \nto cut your benefits. I want them to talk about that. I want to hear \nthem talk about how we are going to provide the kind of law enforcement \nwe want when we will be getting rid of FBI agents and Border Patrol \npeople. Cuts to the Immigration and Naturalization Service could result \nin a reduction of approximately 2,000 Border Patrol agents, when \neverybody is screaming about the number of illegal immigrants pouring \nacross our borders. I want to hear them talk about programs such as \nHead Start that give children a chance to learn if they have not had \nthe benefit of a home life that encourages learning. Mr. President, \n43,000 children will be cut from the program.\n  I hope the American public listens. I know they get tired of our \ndroning, but this is the kind of thing they ought to view with \ninterest. I hope we are going to defeat this amendment.\n  Everyone knows it is now October 6. The fiscal year is almost a week \nold. But obviously, the Republican majority still does not know how \nthey are going to put together their budget. They have declared they do \nnot want to use Social Security surpluses. No, but the declarations \nring hollow. In fact, they have been moving legislation that would raid \nthose surpluses of billions of dollars, and they do not want to admit \nit.\n  The Republican tax bill, for instance, would use Social Security \nsurpluses in the years 2005 through 2008. That is not very far away \nfrom our initial attempt to increase the longevity of Social Security.\n  In fiscal year 2008, that raid on Social Security would reach almost \n$50 billion. Public, listen to this: Now they are pushing bills that \nwill use roughly $20 billion in Social Security funds this very year, \nthe year which started October 1. That is not just my opinion, it is \nthe opinion of the Congressional Budget Office, which is directed by a \nRepublican appointee.\n  The majority has that right. Over the past few weeks, the majority \nhas twisted itself into knots to evade the discretionary spending caps. \nThey have used gimmick after gimmick, to the point where, frankly, the \nintegrity of the whole budget process has been compromised.\n  I hope my colleagues can see this chart.\n  This is what a prominent paper, the Wall Street Journal, had in its \nissue of July 27: GOP using ``two sets of books.''\n\n       Lying about the numbers.\n\n  That is a budget expert, a fellow by the named of Stan Collender on \nthe GOP. ``Directed Scorekeeping''--we will talk about that in a \nminute.\n\n       Republicans are double-counting a big part of next year's \n     surplus, papering over the fact that their proposed tax cuts \n     and spending bills already have exhausted available funds.\n\n  In the House, the Republicans have declared the census that we are \nrequired to take, mandated by the Constitution; it comes around every \n10 years--they want to declare that an emergency so it gets out of the \nspending loop. It is hardly an unexpected crisis. Calling it an \nemergency gets around the discretionary spending caps. For House \nRepublicans, apparently, that is more important than direct, honest \nbudgeting.\n  The Republicans are also using two sets of books, as we see described \nhere, to get around the discretionary spending caps. When it suits \ntheir purposes, the majority uses CBO scoring; when it does not, they \nuse OMB scoring. This is mumbo jumbo. For those who are not familiar \nwith what goes on here--using this set of books on the one hand and \nthat set of books on the other hand.\n  If someone was the chief executive of a major corporation--I had the \nhonor of serving in that capacity before I came here--and did that, \nthey could wind up in jail--using books here to describe what is going \non on one side, and using books over here to describe a different \npicture to the public. That is unacceptable behavior but certainly not \nin this institution. That way, they can pretend they are spending less \nthan they technically are.\n  Today, I am releasing a report that explains this so-called \n``Directed Scorekeeping.'' As the report explains, the majority is \nforcing CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, to fudge the numbers in \nan unprecedented way. The report is available from my office. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of that report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   How the GOP Is Using ``Two Sets of Books'' To Hide Use of Social \n                            Security Surplus\n\n            [From the Office of Senator Frank R. Lautenberg]\n\n\n                 The Abuse of ``Directed Scorekeeping''\n\n       Congress generally relies on the Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO) to evaluate the budgetary effects of \n     legislation. This year, however, the Republican majority has \n     repeatedly directed CBO to modify its scoring of \n     appropriations bills, in order to make the bills appear less \n     costly. Although such ``directed scorekeeping'' has occurred \n     occasionally in the past, the extent of the practice this \n     year is unprecedented.\n       According to a recent CBO analysis, congressional \n     Republicans have directed CBO to make more than $18 billion \n     in scorekeeping adjustments in the FY 2000 appropriation \n     bill.\\1\\ CBO generally includes these modifications in its \n     reports on legislation by creating a special account called \n     ``Budget Committee discretionary adjustment.'' This year, the \n     adjustments in the Senate range from $5 million for the \n     District of Columbia to $13 billion for the Department of \n     Defense.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       By forcing CBO to modify its scoring of legislation, the \n     GOP has sought to hide more than $18 billion in new spending. \n     This total exceeds the entire non-Social Security surplus, \n     which CBO estimates at $14 billion.\n       Of course, changing the scoring of legislation does not \n     alter the actual budget impact of that legislation. If CBO's \n     actual estimates are used based on their own assumptions, it \n     becomes clear that congress is on its way to spending at \n     least $18 billion of Social Security surpluses in fiscal year \n     2000, and perhaps considerably more.\\2\\\n       Some Republicans defend ``directed scorekeeping'' as \n     necessary to reconcile differences between OMB and CBO \n     spending assumptions. But if accuracy is the goal, we should \n     stick with CBO. A review of outlay estimates for \n     appropriations enacted between 1993 and 1997 found that CBO's \n     estimates were almost identical to the actual amounts spent \n     in each year.\\3\\ A more recent comparison of CBO and OMB \n     estimates of defense outlays found that CBO's estimates were \n     consistently higher than OMB's between 1997-1999, but that \n     both CBO and OMB came in below actual defense outlays.\\4\\\n       The Republicans are also ``mixing and matching'' \n     estimates--combining OMB's lower spending estimates with \n     CBO's higher surplus projections. Choosing the best \n     assumptions from each agency increases the potential for \n     estimating error beyond what would occur under one set of \n     assumptions. This practice is in clear violation of Section \n     301(g) of the Congressional Budget Act which states that the \n     budget resolution and determinations made for Budget Act \n     points of order ``shall be based upon common economic and \n     technical assumptions''. Unfortunately, there is no practical \n     remedy for violations of this section of the Budget Act since \n     the chair in the Senate relies exclusively on the Budget \n     Committee for all budget rulings.\n       Scorekeeping directives have been used in previous years, \n     but not on this large a scale. Between 1991 and 1999, CBO was \n     asked to change its estimates of appropriations bills four \n     times by amounts ranging from $1.9 billion in 1993 to $5.5 \n     billion in 1992. The adjustment this year, $18.7 billion, is \n     $5.7 billion higher than the previous nine years combined.\n       Section 312(a) of the Congressional Budget Act gives the \n     Budget Committees the prerogative to use their own estimates \n     in the budget process. When this discretion is abused, there \n     is no penalty, other than higher deficits. Ironically, \n     American companies don't get off the hook so easily. In \n     recent months, the SEC has cracked down on businesses that \n     use accounting gimmicks to exaggerate profits. Several \n     companies have been charged and some have paid fines. \n     Unfortunately, only the American taxpayer picks up the tab \n     when the Congress cooks the books.\n       The following table shows CBO estimates of scoring \n     adjustments for the ten year period, fiscal years 1991-2000.\n\n                     DIRECTED SCORING, FY 1991-2000\n                    [Outlays; in billions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Fiscal year                Defense    Nondefense     Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2000 est.\\1\\.......................     -13,073       -5,596     -18,669\n1999 \\1\\...........................      -2,383         -235      -2,618\n1993...............................      -1,291         -565      -1,856\n1992...............................      -2,937       -2,532      -5,469\n1991...............................      -2,929  ...........      -2,929\n1991-99............................      -9,540       -3,332     -12,872\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Estimates based on House adjustments.\n \nSource: CBO.\n\n                    [Memorandum of October 4, 1999]\n\n     To: Sue Nelson.\n     From: Janet Airis.\n     Subject: Across-the-Board Cut to Discretionary \n         Appropriations.\n\n       This is in response to your request of an across-the-board \n     cut to FY 2000 discretionary\n\n[[Page S12057]]\n\n     appropriations.

Beyond using the emergency designation and using two \nsets of books, the majority has resorted to the gimmick of artificially \nshifting huge amounts of spending into the next fiscal year.\n  The Washington Post described this as adding a 13th month to the \nfiscal year, kind of changing the calendar. It is a gimmick, and the \npublic, again, ought to take notice. It is like getting out of debt by \nputting existing debts on a second credit card. It may make you feel \nbetter today, but it is sure going to make things tougher tomorrow.\n  These are a few of the gimmicks that are being proposed in this \nlegislation. But no matter how many are used, there is no getting \naround the fact that the majority has busted the spending caps, and \nthey are spending Social Security surpluses. Let's make sure that is \nclearly understood. They are using the budget surpluses created in the \nSocial Security account to fund Government. They want to take even \nlarger cuts out of programs.\n  There is a better alternative. Instead of using scorekeeping \ngimmicks, we can use real offsets; that is, take it from another place. \nFor example, we can close special interest tax loopholes. The \nRepublicans even included some of those loophole closers in their tax \nbill, so this should not be at all that hard.\n  Another option that I personally favor is to simply go to the source \nthat cost this country of ours lots and lots of money, the tobacco \nindustry. Let them fully compensate taxpayers for the costs of tobacco-\nrelated diseases that they create. Why should they be protected? I do \nnot understand it. Why cannot we get our friends across the aisle to \njoin us in saying to the tobacco industry: Pay the $20 billion that you \ncost us with the diseases that you have helped render on our society?\n  It is an outrage. We are going to let them get away with what they do \nwhile we say to our citizens: OK, we are going to cut veterans \nbenefits; we are going to cut police efforts; we are going to cut \neducation. Come on. That by itself could virtually eliminate the raid \non Social Security--$20 billion by the bills already approved by the \nSenate.\n  To its credit, the Justice Department is trying to recoup these costs \nthrough civil litigation against the tobacco companies. But as we all \nknow, that could take years. Meanwhile, Congress can act now to make \nthe taxpayers whole. We ought to do it.\n  The Nickles amendment, however, proposes another approach. It says: \nRather than closing tax loopholes or asking the tobacco industry to pay \nits fair share, let's cut education, let's cut defense, let's cut the \nFBI, let's cut the Border Patrol, let's cut environmental protection, \nand let's cut veterans health care.\n  We heard it said that these across-the-board cuts might be a 2- or 3-\npercent difference. But those figures are not based on CBO's own \nestimates; they are based on the so-called ``Directed Scorekeeping.'' \nThat is a direction from the Budget Committee or the leadership to say: \nHey, you say it's going to cost $10 billion. I tell you what, let's say \nsomething else. Let's say it's only going to cost $9 billion. OK, $9 \nbillion. There is no basis in fact, but let's say it.\n  It is based on politically driven assumptions about how much bills \nwill cost, not the objective analysis of CBO estimators.\n  The truth is that if we are serious about protecting Social Security \nsurpluses, the across-the-board cuts would have to be much greater. And \nif we look at the bills the Senate has already approved, we would need \na 5.5-percent cut. And that is not my figure; that comes from the \nCongressional Budget Office--5.5 percent. The Transportation bill that \nwe just processed through here--and I shared the Democratic leadership \nin getting that bill to the floor--would take a cut of over $2.5 \nbillion.\n  But even that is unrealistically low. First, many Senate bills still \nneed to be reconciled with the House, which has adopted a variety of \nemergency provisions--gimmickry--to allow for increased spending. In \naddition, Congress almost inevitably will increase spending for other \nitems in the near future: Funding for hurricane victims--that ought to \nbe fresh in our minds--for health care providers that are suffering \nfrom excessive cuts, preventing the expected closings of long-term care \nfacilities in major quantities, for operations such as Kosovo; and then \nit is also a good bet that at some point this year there will be other \nemergencies: earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes--who knows what--that \nwill also require more funding. If we do not offset that spending, it \nwill come straight out of the Social Security surplus--cut the Social \nSecurity surplus.\n  When you account for these additional costs, you would have to cut \ndiscretionary spending roughly 10 percent under this amendment--10 \npercent. Do my colleagues want to go on record in supporting cutting \neducation by at least 5 percent, more likely 10 percent? Do they want \nto call for cuts in defense, veterans programs, crime initiatives, and \nhealth research? I am sure the American public does not want that to \nhappen, and none of us elected to represent them ought to support this \nwild scheme.\n  Senator Nickles has offered his amendment as a second degree to his \nown underlying amendment. But at an appropriate point, once his second-\ndegree amendment is disposed of, I plan to offer an alternative \namendment. My amendment will call for rejecting scorekeeping gimmicks \nand indiscriminate across-the-board cuts. Instead, it will urge that we \nprotect Social Security surpluses by closing special interest tax \nloopholes and using other appropriate offsets.\n  My alternative amendment does not limit the types of offsets that \ncould be used, nor does it single anything out. But it would put us \nclearly on record in opposition to the broad-based cuts proposed by the \namendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, and in strong \nopposition to the continued use of budget gimmickry to avoid tough \ndecisions.\n  For now, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Nickles amendment. I ask \nthe public who may learn of this amendment to let their Representatives \nknow they do not like it, that they want to protect Social Security \nsurpluses. Let's not make the deep cuts that are arbitrary in \neducation, defense, crime, veterans, and other programs. Instead, let \nus close special interest tax loopholes, find other appropriate offsets \nthat will allow us to save Social Security, as all of us agree should \nbe done, in a direct and honest way.\n\n[[Page S12058]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 14 minutes \n18 seconds, and the Senator from New Jersey has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise strongly to support Senator Nickles' \npending amendment on the Labor-HHS bill, and I commend his leadership \nand vitality on this very important issue.\n  This amendment reassures the American people that Congress is not \ngoing to spend one penny of Social Security money, and it will put the \nSenate on record that we will honor that commitment.\n  We hear our colleagues from the other side of the aisle say \nRepublicans are already dipping into Social Security. They want to \nspend more money.\n  That is not true. What we are trying to do is say we are going to go \nup to the edge but not go over; that is, not spend one dime of Social \nSecurity money. By being able to do that, we don't want to dip into the \nSocial Security trust fund. We think everybody, across the board, on \ndiscretionary spending should make sure that doesn't happen.\n  That means we have an across-the-board cut. In other words, reduce \nall spending, in order to protect Social Security. That, I think, would \nbe a fair and even way to do it.\n  Our colleagues on the other side don't want to cut spending. They are \nnot talking about cutting spending at all in any programs. What they \nare saying--and the gimmicks they would use or the magic they would put \ninto this budget--is simple tax increases. Let's penalize big tobacco, \nthey say. But they don't tell us there are dozens of other tax \nincreases buried in their proposal that would also affect every other \naverage working American in this country. In other words, to support \ntheir higher spending level, they want to go out and attack the \ntaxpayer. ``Let's raise taxes,'' ``close loopholes,'' are some of the \nwords they use. The magic they put in it is tax increases.\n  That means every American out there can face higher Federal taxes in \norder to support larger spending. We are saying, let's do it the other \nway around. Let us be fiscally responsible. Let us not ask more of the \ntaxpayer. Let us reduce spending across the board and do it in a very \nfair and equitable way.\n  I believe this is a crucial step to truly protect the Social Security \nsurplus and save it exclusively for Americans' retirement, not for tax \nrelief, not for government spending. This is a line we absolutely have \nto draw in the sand.\n  In fact, over the past few days I have been working on legislation \nwhich is related to Senator Nickles' amendment. I will introduce the \nbill today.\n  This legislation will be complimentary to the Nickles amendment. His \nis a sense-of-the-Senate--my bill would create a mechanism to enforce \nour commitment. It would prevent anyone, whether it be the Congress or \nthe administration, from raiding the Social Security surplus. This \nenforcement mechanism is simple and straightforward. Because we won't \nknow whether we are spending the Social Security surplus until we get \nthe CBO revised numbers in January, this bill will trigger an automatic \nacross-the-board cut in discretionary spending to make up any \ndifferences if the January reestimate shows we are spending any Social \nSecurity surplus. It would work similarly to the sequester of Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings, but applies to Social Security surplus spending.\n  Let me address why it is so important to pass both the Nickles sense-\nof-the-Senate and my legislation. Economic forecasting is more of an \nart that a science. Many uncertainties, risks, and factors are \ninvolved. We have a budget of $1.8 trillion based on a variety of \nassumptions, estimates, forecasts and projections, with people using \nboth CBO numbers and OMB numbers. It is highly likely that there are \nerrors in this budget. While we should learn from our past mistakes and \ntake a very prudent and conservative approach in our economic outlook \nand our spending, a $10 billion error in forecasting of $1.8 trillion \nis not uncommon.\n  However, some of our colleagues are out there accusing us of spending \nthe Social Security surplus. the truth is, we don't want to, but \nhonestly we don't know for certain at this point. Neither does the \nPresident nor our Democratic colleagues. That is, whey we need my bill \nas our insurance that we will live up to our commitment.\n  Some wave the CBO August letter to prove they are right. But Mr. \nPresident, as one economist observed, ``If you torture numbers long \nenough, they will confess to anything.'' This is true with the CBO \nestimates. As you know, the CBO is a scorekeeping office and it scores \nbased on whatever assumptions Congress requires it to use. We could \ncontinue to argue indefinitely over the right assumptions. That does \nnot solve the problem.\n  Since both Congress and President Clinton have agreed that saving \nSocial Security should be our top priority and have committed to not \nspending the Social Security surplus for government programs, we must \nfind a better way to keep our promise to the American people.\n  Republicans have made a number of attempts to create a lockbox to \nlock in every penny of the Social Security surplus, not for government \nspending, not for tax relief, but exclusively for Americans' \nretirement. Unfortunately, opposition by the Democrats has blocked the \nestablishment of this safe lockbox.\n  In the absence of the Social Security safety lockbox, I hope that all \nof our colleagues and the President agree with us that we must draw a \nline in the sand. And live up to our pledge that not a penny of the \nSocial Security surplus will be spent to fund this year's \nappropriations. Personally, I will vote against any spending bills that \nour right plans to spend Social Security money. If our spending plans \ndo pass and we would, unintentionally wind up spending Social Security, \nmy bill allows us to keep our commitment to the American people, by \nscaling back other spending to save Social Security.\n  Again, since we must use economic assumptions, the difficulty we are \nfacing is because the numbers are so close we won't know if this year's \nappropriations have spent the Social Security surplus--or which \nspecific spending bill or bills have spent the money--until next year \nwhen we receive the CBO re-estimate. Therefore we need an effective \nenforcement mechanism to ensure that Congress and the President do not \ntouch the Social Security money.\n  The best mechanism is that proposed by Senator Nickles' sense-of-the-\nSenate and my legislation. If this year's appropriations end up \nspending the Social Security surplus as a result of estimate errors, we \nwill automatically rescind that amount by reducing government spending \nacross-the-board and return it to the Social Security trust fund. This \nwill affect discretionary spending only--not entitlement programs for \nseniors or the needy.\n  My biggest fear, is that without this mechanism Congress and the \nPresident may spend some of the Social Security surplus by using \nerroneous estimates. We would be forced to legislate after the fact if \nthere is a re-estimate that shows spending of the Social Security \nsurplus. The atmosphere of panic could cloud the type and speed of the \nremedy. The remedy should be my bill, and it should be passed before we \nface a problem, so we cannot play the blame game once we have a re-\nestimate.\n  The President's revised budget plan would have dipped into the Social \nSecurity surplus by $24 billion. Counting his $12 billion emergency \nspending request, the President would spend $36 billion of the Social \nSecurity surplus for fiscal year 2000. Compared with his original \nbudget, which would have taken $150 billion from the trust funds, this \nrevised plan is a great improvement.\n  However, the President still wants to spend money he pledged to save. \nThat's not acceptable. We must say no to anyone who wants to spend even \na penny of the Social Security surplus because we promised the American \npeople we would save it. There is no excuse in an era of budget surplus \nto continue raiding the Social Security trust funds. Washington has \ndone enough damage to America's retirement system.\n\n[[Page S12059]]\n\n  In 1998, American workers paid $489 billion into the Social Security \nsystem, but most of the money, $382 billion, was immediately paid out \nto 44 million beneficiaries the same year. That left a $106 billion \nsurplus. The total accumulated surplus in the trust fund is $763 \nbillion.\n  Unfortunately, this surplus exists only on paper. The Government has \nconsumed all the $763 billion for non-Social Security related programs. \nAll it has are the Treasury IOUs.\n  Despite Washington's rhetoric of using every penny of Social Security \nsurplus to save Social Security, last year's omnibus appropriations \nbill alone spent over $22 billion of the Social Security surplus. \nWithout the enforceable mechanism provided by the Nickles amendment and \nmy legislation, the Social Security surplus is likely to be spent to \nfund other government programs in fiscal year 2000 and the outyears.\n  Enough is enough. We must stop this outrageous practice. The time is \nnow to show our resolve in protecting every penny of the Social \nSecurity surplus to ensure it will be available for Americans' \nretirement income security.\n  Do not mistakenly think that our colleagues across the aisle have \nchanged their big spending ways by their rhetoric opposing spending the \nSocial Security surplus. Do not believe for a second that they want to \nmaintain fiscal discipline. They still want to spend more by taxing \nmore.\n  Instead of controlling spending, the President and the Democrats have \nincreased government spending and created even more government \nprograms. They believe they know best how to spend taxpayers' money and \nthat they can do more by spending more.\n  This solution to continue to grow funding for government programs at \nunprecedented high levels is to raise taxes. In the President's budget, \nhe has not just proposed to penalize American tobacco companies, but to \nraise taxes on also small businesses, homeowners as well as millions of \nother Americans who are already overtaxed.\n  Again, the President's solution to avoiding spending the Social \nSecurity surplus will be to increase taxes. He will penalize American \nsmall businesses by changing their tax rules; he penalizes millions of \nAmerican seniors who rely on life insurance products for their \nretirement; he penalizes non-profit trade organizations, which serve \nthe disadvantaged in their communities so well, by taking away their \ntax exempt status; he penalizes other American companies by imposing \nenvironmental surtaxes and excise taxes. The President also penalizes \nmillions of American homeowners by increasing their mortgage \ntransaction fees; he penalizes millions of American travelers by \nraising taxes on their domestic air passenger tickets.\n  Is there anyone left who hasn't been penalized by the President and \nhis colleagues in the Congress?\n  A tax increase is not the solution to this year's serious spending \nproblem. Exercising fiscal discipline is our best solution. Although we \ndon't know if we already have spent the Social Security surplus for \nfiscal year 2000 due to uncertain and incomplete estimates, we should \ntake a very prudent approach on spending. On principle, we must do \neverything we can to ensure Washington will not have a chance to touch \nany Social Security money.\n  I am disappointed that instead of solving the problem, Washington is \ntrying again to hide behind creative financing, forward funding, \nemergency spending and so-called technical adjustments to give the \nappearance we are not breaking the spending caps or eating into the \nSocial Security surplus. I am also disappointed that Congress spends \nevery penny of the $14 billion on-budget surplus for increased \nspending. Remember, this $14 billion is the tax overpayment which we \npromised to return to working Americans in the form of tax relief. I \nproposed this in the budget resolution and Congress included this in \nour budget resolution early this year.\n  I have warned repeatedly that if we don't return tax overcharges to \nthe taxpayers or reduce the debt, Washington will spend it all, leaving \nnothing for tax relief or the vitally important task of preserving \nSocial Security. This year's appropriations bills have proven my fear \nto be well founded. The last thing we want to do is to spend these tax \noverpayments to enlarge the government. Since President Clinton's veto \nprevents major tax relief this year, we at least should dedicate this \non-budget surplus to reduce the national debt. But we are spending \nevery penny of it, in violation of our commitment in the budget \nresolution.\n  Twenty-five years ago, the Congress passed the Congressional Budget \nAct, which created an annual budgeting process in the hope of \ncontrolling spiraling government spending. Twenty five years later we \nhave made progress but are still unable to tame this beast.\n  Today, spending is at an all-time high, and so are taxes. The \ngovernment is getting bigger, not smaller. Government spending is \ngrowing twice as fast as personal income. Discretionary spending has \nincreased by over 20 percent since 1993.\n  The budget process has become so complicated that most lawmakers have \na hard time understanding it. Of course, that hasn't stopped the \nproliferation of budget gimmicks to circumvent the intent of the \nCongress. The flawed budget process allows Members to vote to control \nspending in the budget and then turn right around and vote for \nincreased appropriations.\n  Spending caps are the best example of the phrase ``fiscal \ndiscipline'' means nothing in Washington. Spending caps were supposedly \na good tool to control spending--if the President and lawmakers could \nstick to them. But since the establishment of statutory spending \nlimits, Washington has repeatedly broken them because of a lack of \nfiscal discipline. In fact, the first budget criteria in the past has \nbeen to first break the caps so spending could be accommodated.\n  Washington set new spending caps in 1990 after it failed to meet its \ndeficit reduction targets. In 1993, President Clinton broke the \nspending caps for his new spending increases and created new caps. But \nin 1997, the President could not live within his own spending caps, and \nhe broke them again. New spending caps were again re-negotiated and \nestablished in BBA.\n  By 1998, one year later Congress and President Clinton could not live \nwithin their new limits and proposed over $22 billion of so-called \n``emergency spending'' and other unauthorized spending in the omnibus \nspending legislation to get around the caps. The use of ``emergency'' \nspending is far too broad, and has become a common budget gimmick.\n  This year Washington may spend $37 billion or more above the spending \ncaps and use more creative bookkeeping to give the impression we are \nmaintaining the caps. It demands more spending to fully fund government \nprograms, but delays payment of the bills until the next fiscal year, \nplacing more and more pressure on future caps and spending commitments.\n  Again and again, Washington lowers the fiscal bar and them jumps over \nit, or finds ways around it, at the expense of the American taxpayers. \nThis is wrong. If we commit to living within the statutory spending \ncaps, we must stick to them. We must use every tool available to \nenforce these spending limits. If we were still facing a budget deficit \nwe would not be spending this much money. But because there is a \nsurplus, the feeding frenzy continues. Again, a lack of fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  I understand the upward spending pressure the Congress is facing this \nyear and in the outyears. But I believe we should, and can, meet this \nchallenge by prioritizing and streamlining government programs while \nmaintaining fiscal discipline. We can reduce wasteful, unnecessary, \nduplicate, low-priority government programs to fund the necessary and \nresponsible functions of government. We could if we tried, but it seems \nit's easier just to throw more money at the budget. Many believe we can \nhelp more if we spend more, but the spending comes at the expense of \nsomebody--and that somebody is usually the average, middle-class \ntaxpayer.\n  It's true that our short-term fiscal situation has improved greatly \ndue to the continued growth of our economy. However, our long-term \nfinancial imbalance still poses a major threat to the health of our \nfuture economic security. The President said tax relief was \nirresponsible. Wrong. It's spending appetite that is irresponsible.\n  Breaking the caps through more and more spending will only worsen our\n\n[[Page S12060]]\n\nshort-term fiscal outlook and affect our ability to deal with long-term \nbudget pressures.\n  We can run but we cannot hide from our budget problems. We must make \nhard choices and be honest about it. While ``advance appropriations,'' \n``advance funding'' and ``forward funding'' are not uncommon practices \nhere, it does not mean they are the right thing to do, particularly \nwhen these budget techniques are used to dodge much-needed fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  In the past 5 years, ``advance appropriations'' have increased \ndramatically, jumping from $1.9 billion in fiscal year 1996 to $11.6 \nbillion in fiscal year 2000, an increase of $9.7 billlion over 5 years. \nThis year, President Clinton proposed advancing nearly $19 billion into \nfiscal year 2001. Advance appropriations create even worse problems for \nus in the outyears. We must end this irresponsible practice.\n  I realize how extremely difficult it is for appropriators to get \ntheir job done this year. I appreciate the fact that tremendous efforts \nare being made to keep our promise not to spend any of Social Security \nsurplus. My point is, in an era of budget surplus, extra prudence and \neffort is needed to keep ourselves from spending more than we can \nafford. If we can maintain fiscal discipline, we will be able to honor \nour commitment to the American people not to take any money from Social \nSecurity.\n  Protecting the Social Security surplus from funding government \noperations is the last defense of fiscal discipline. I cannot emphasize \nhow vitally important this line of defense is for both the Republican \nParty as well as the Democratic Party. If we lose this defense, our \ncredibility and accountability with the Americn people will be gone.\n  Mr. President, the best protection is the Nickles sense-of-the-Senate \namendment coupled with my legislation. If more accurate or actual \nnumbers show Congress and the President have spent the Social Security \nsurplus for fiscal year 2000 and beyond, an effective mechanism will \nensure the money is returned. It is plain and simple. I hope my \ncolleagues from both sides will support the Nickles amendment and my \nlegislation.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMS. I will yield.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that the cut would probably have to be \naround a 9 percent across-the-board cut?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Why would it be 9 percent? Some of the latest numbers I \nhave seen are anywhere from $3.8 to $5.6 billion, and all of the \nappropriation bills are not yet completed. They have not been submitted \nor voted on, so we are still estimating. If the Senator is talking \nabout $30 billion or $40 billion, we are not in that range right now. \nThose accusations have been made, but according to the numbers I have \nseen, we are not in that range.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the Office of Management and Budget, in \na meeting last night, indicated at least 9 percent. The House has a \nnumber of things in bills they have passed; they have declared those as \nemergencies. There are other matters that are double funded. For \nexample, in order to pass this bill, there has been money taken from \nthe Defense appropriations bill. There comes a time when we have to \nfund everything in realistic terms. As I have indicated, the Office of \nManagement and Budget believes across-the-board cuts now would have to \nbe about 9 percent.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Without agreeing to the Senator's numbers, let me say that \nif that were the case, wouldn't it show that we are spending more than \nwe should and that that kind of a cut would be something that we should \ndo? If we are going to go back and say to the taxpayer: We can't manage \nthe books and somehow we have spent 9 or 10 percent more in \ndiscretionary spending than we have, and the only way we can make it up \nis to go out and penalize, as my colleagues have said, big tobacco, but \nalso penalize in dozens of other ways with other tax increases--in \nother words, if we can't do our job responsibly--then we should go to \nthe taxpayer and say, let's just have a little more revenue to make up \nthose differences. I don't think it is going to be in the range of 9 or \n10 percent. If that would be true, I think that would be a glaring \nargument we are overspending by 10 percent in discretionary spending \nand we should make every effort to trim that spending.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question? If the Senator \nwill yield for a question.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I will yield just for one.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have a letter from CBO that says dividing the \nprojected deficit by the available outlays results in an across-the-\nboard cut of 5.5 percent. That is from the CBO. I ask the Senator, if \nhe hasn't, if he would take a look at that. I think he will see that is \nsome pretty deep cuts he is talking about, 5.5 percent.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I think we are overspending by that much, too. I will say \nthis once again, as I mentioned earlier in my statement. We are using a \nlot of different numbers. We are using a lot of assessments, \nprojections. We are taking a lot of risks in a $1.8 trillion budget. If \nsome of these numbers are wrong, then I think we need to go back and \nadjust them. The question, I guess, comes down to how do we adjust \nthem. My colleagues on the other side would adjust them by raising \ntaxes so they could keep spending more. What we are advocating is we \nwould adjust our spending habits and spend less across the board. I \nthink we need to do that because taxpayers today are paying taxes at an \nall-time record high. Forty-two percent, on average, of everything \npeople in my State of Minnesota earn goes to pay taxes. I think that we \ncan't continue to ask them to pay even more because we can't hold down \ntheir spending.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 25 seconds. The Democratic side \nhas 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. The CBO has \nprojected that we are heading toward using at least $19 billion of the \nSocial Security surplus next year. Again, I agree with Senator Nickles \nthat we should not be dipping into Social Security to pay for this \nyear's appropriations bills. But, quite frankly, I believe the other \nside already has dipped into Social Security by the fact of what they \nhave been doing with their spending bills.\n  While I do agree with Senator Nickles on not dipping into Social \nSecurity, I don't agree with his solution. Again, he calls for an \nacross-the-board cut against all discretionary programs, even those \nthat we have already passed. They were passed by both sides, went to \nconference, came back, and they have been signed into law by the \nPresident. Now they want to take that back.\n  OMB has estimated a 9-percent across-the-board cut. We have a letter \nfrom CBO which shows that this across-the-board cut that Senator \nNickles is proposing would be about 5.5 percent. Well, let's take a \nlook. The Senator from Minnesota said we are spending too much money. I \nam going to get into that in a second. Take a look at what we would \nhave to cut with a 5.5-percent cut across the board. Our COPS program, \nour community policing program that puts cops on the streets, would \nhave to be cut by $26 million; Head Start, $290 million cut; meals for \nseniors, $29 million cut; NIH, $967 million cut. That is almost a $1 \nbillion cut in NIH. While Senator Specter and I and others, in a \nbipartisan manner, have worked to get the $2 billion increase for NIH \nand get it on the track to double in 5 years, this would whack about a \nbillion dollars out of NIH.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Iowa, who has spent so much time on \nHead Start, explain why it would hurt American children to cut almost \n$300 million from Head Start?\n  Mr. HARKIN. First of all, we all agree this has been a bipartisan \napproach to put more money into Head Start to cover all 4-year-olds in \nthe Head Start Program. We know an ounce of prevention is worth a pound \nof cure. Every study done, all the educators, everybody says if we can \nput the money into Head Start, we are\n\n[[Page S12061]]\n\ngoing to save a lot of money downstream.\n  Mr. REID. It is true, is it not, that it has been proven and apparent \nthat we save money in welfare costs and costs to our criminal justice \nsystem by helping these kids?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true.\n  Mr. REID. Isn't it also true that, even funded at current levels, \nmost kids who need help don't get it?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. I think right now on Head Start, we are a little \nover 50 percent. About 50 percent of the eligible kids are served by \nHead Start. We are trying to get it up to 80 percent.\n  Mr. REID. If we cut almost $300 million, we are going to drop down to \n30 or 35 percent.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is correct--probably less than 40 percent. Four out \nof 10 kids who qualify, who need the Head Start Program, will be cut \nout of the program because of this cut.\n  Mr. REID. You heard the Senator from Minnesota say we have to start \ncutting, that we are spending too much money. Does the Senator from \nIowa think we are spending too much money for the Head Start Program?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator has put his finger on it. We are spending too \nlittle on that program. We need to fund it so every eligible child can \nget into that program.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Minnesota said what Democrats want to do \nis raise taxes. Hasn't the Senator from Iowa been trying for more than \n3 years--would the Senator tell this Senator, because I want some \nunderstanding, as to what you are talking about for tobacco, for \nexample, to cover some of these things?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am going to get to where we can get the money so we can \nhave the offsets, so we don't have--\n  Mr. REID. It is not out of taxes, is it?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Not one penny in taxes. I want to say to my friend from \nNevada that the Senator from Minnesota said we are spending too much \nmoney. I am thinking that I might offer an amendment to cut NIH by $1 \nbillion. Let's see how many votes we get on the other side. What if I \noffered an amendment to cut Head Start by $290 million? Do you think \nthe Republicans would all vote to cut that? How about title I, \neducation grants, $380 million in cuts to title I for our schools? How \nabout veterans' health care, cut by $1.1 billion? Does anybody believe \nthat if we offered amendments to cut those, we would get the votes to \ndo that? Maybe the Senator from Minnesota would be the sole person who \nwould vote to cut NIH by a billion dollars; I don't know. Perhaps we \nought to have an amendment to see if that is what they want to do.\n  Mr. REID. Isn't it true that if we had amendments to increase \nspending for veterans' benefits by a billion dollars, they would pass \noverwhelmingly?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is probably true. The Senator is absolutely right. \nWhen the Senator says we are spending too much and we have to cut \nspending, why doesn't he offer some amendments to cut NIH, title I, \nmeals for seniors, and Head Start? No, they are going to try to hide \nbehind this sort of across-the-board cut. An across-the-board cut means \ndeep cuts in these programs.\n\n  The Senator from Nevada said we have a proposal where we can pay for \nthese programs and it would not require any tax at all. This is what we \ncould do. I have a proposal that has been scored by CBO. If we just \npenalize the tobacco companies that fail to reduce teen smoking--they \nset the targets to reduce teen smoking, but they are not meeting them. \nWe are saying that they pay a penalty for not reducing that and it \nraises $6 billion. CBO has given us the score on that. We could fund \nthe Department of Defense at the requested level. What DOD said is, \nfund them at that level. That saves us $4 billion. We could enact the \nadministration's proposal for student loan guarantee agencies. That is \n$1.5 billion in savings.\n  I might add that the House, last week, went the opposite direction. \nThey raised the student loan origination fees. I could not believe they \ndid that. Talk about raising taxes; last week, the House raised the \ntaxes on college students by making them pay more for their loans. They \nincreased it by 25 percent. It affects about one-third of students. \nMore than half of the students in my State of Iowa are affected by \nthat. So they got a 25-percent increase in their origination fees.\n  Well, that is the opposite way to go. If we enacted the \nadministration's proposal, we would save $1.5 billion. Reduce Medicare \nwaste, fraud, and abuse by $13 billion. Well, again, the House bill--\nthe counterpart to this--actually cuts funding for Medicare waste, \nfraud, and abuse. It retreats at a time when we have $13 billion \nestimated annually that we lose to Medicare for waste, fraud, and \nabuse.\n  What the House GOP did is to cut $70 million from the audits and \nother checks that save us $17 for every dollar spent. We know from the \naudit agencies and others that for every dollar we have spent on \naudits, every dollar we have spent on the checks, we got $17 returned \nfrom waste, fraud, and abuse. Yet the House bill cut money from \nfighting waste, fraud, and abuse. That is inexcusable. If we want to go \nafter it, we could save $13 billion.\n  The last is reducing corporate welfare. We have a series of things--\n$2 billion tax deductibility of tobacco advertising; underpayments by \noil and gas industry royalties for use of Federal lands; billions lost \nbecause of tax loopholes and gimmicks that allow foreign companies and \nmultinationals to avoid paying their fair share by bookkeeping methods \nthat shift funds to foreign tax havens. By doing that, we can save \nabout $4 billion. So our total offsets are about $28.5 billion, and we \nhaven't raised taxes on any American. Nobody would have to pay more \ntaxes.\n  Yet this is the choice: Either have these kinds of offsets that will \nhelp pay for increased funding at NIH, veterans' health care, Head \nStart programs, meals for seniors; or what the Senator from Oklahoma \nwants to do, and that is to have a huge cut in all of these programs. \nThat is really where we are.\n  As I said, I agree with the Senator from Oklahoma; we shouldn't be \ndipping into Social Security. But we shouldn't be cutting Head Start \nprograms. We shouldn't be cutting Meals on Wheels, meals to seniors. We \nshouldn't be cutting NIH and biomedical research. We should focus on \nthe waste, fraud, and abuse, focus on the tax loopholes, focus on the \nDOD funding at their requested level, and that will more than pay for \nthe programs we have come up with on a bipartisan basis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 4 minutes 25 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the consensus has been clear cut that \nSocial Security trust funds ought not to be invaded. The pending \nNickles amendment recites that the Congress and the President should \nbalance the budget excluding the surplus generated by the Social \nSecurity trust funds. That is really agreed upon, I think on all sides.\n  The second finding is that Social Security surpluses should be used \nonly for Social Security reform, or to reduce the debt held by the \npublic, and should not be spent on other programs. That is generally \nagreed upon.\n  Then the sense-of-the-Senate clause: It is the sense of the Senate \nthat Congress should ensure that the fiscal year 2000 appropriations \nmeasures do not result in an onbudget deficit, excluding the surpluses \ngenerated by the Social Security trust funds, by adopting an across-\nthe-board reduction in all discretionary appropriations sufficient to \neliminate such deficit, if necessary.\n  The sense of the Senate is not binding, as we all know; it is what we \nthink ought to be done.\n  I do not like the idea of reducing the discretionary spending, \nalthough I think the figures cited by the Senator from Iowa are \nextreme. I don't think we are looking at a 5-percent across-the-board \ncut, which would have a deep impact on Head Start, which we ought not \nto do, or a deep impact on NIH, which we ought not to do.\n  In proposing this amendment, Senator Nickles seeks to put the Senate \non notice--and appropriately so--that we had better come within the \nconfines, and not exceed the caps, and not go into Social Security. I \nthink that is an appropriate objective.\n  When the Senator from Iowa articulates proposals for savings in quite \na number of other directions, I don't think they are realistic. I don't \nthink the Congress is going to cut defense by $4 billion. When he \narticulates the view about penalizing tobacco companies that fail to \nreduce teen smoking by $6 billion, that is a laudable objective, if we \ncan find more tobacco money. It is\n\n[[Page S12062]]\n\ntoo bad we don't have some of the money which was worked out on the \n$203 billion settlement for the Federal Government. But I don't think \nthat is likely either. Reducing waste, fraud, and abuse is the most \nlofty objective the Congress can articulate. But finding the money to \nachieve that is so hard.\n  While I have worked very closely with my distinguished colleague from \nIowa, I don't really think those figures are realistic. I don't think \nwe are going to reduce Head Start. I don't think we are going to reduce \nNIH. But there is a stick. It is a stick to stay within the budget \nlimitations.\n  Among a great many alternatives which are undesirable, I believe the \npending sense-of-the-Senate resolution is the least undesirable. So I \nam going to support it.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-five seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Would Senator Nickles like the last word?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I apologize to my colleagues for going to \nthe Finance Committee. I have just a couple of comments.\n  I have heard some of the discussion which said if we enact this \namendment, we will have a 5-percent reduction. That is not the case. I \nhave heard my colleagues say the Congressional Budget Office says it. \nWell, frankly, you get into descriptions of who is doing the scoring. \nIf you use the administration scoring, it is not 5 percent; it is 1 \npercent. We use some administration scoring, OMB scoring. When we had \nthe Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, we used OMB scoring. They were the ones \nwho implemented it. We use OMB scoring in a lot of the bills we have \nbefore us. If that is the case, we are $5 billion off. I don't think we \nhave to be $5 billion off. I think we can, within the last few bills, \nnarrow it down. We can eliminate $5 billion of growth in spending. \nAcross the board won't be necessary, it shouldn't be necessary, if we \nshow just a little discipline.\n  I know others on the other side said we can raise taxes. That may be \ntheir proposal. But it is not going to pass.\n  Yet I know there is lots of demand for increases in spending. We are \ntrying to say we should have some restraint. The restraint is that we \nshouldn't be dipping into the Social Security surpluses. If we are \ngoing to spend Social Security surpluses, let's have an across-the-\nboard reduction--if necessary. I hope it is not necessary. Let's do \nthat if necessary to restrain the growth of spending, so we can ensure \nthat 100 percent of the Social Security funds are used for debt \nreduction or for Social Security and not used for more Government \nspending in a variety of areas, whether it is defense, Labor-HHS, or \nyou name it.\n  I thank my colleagues for their cooperation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute \nso I may respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma stresses the \ndifference between OMB and the Congressional Budget Office. It is the \ntypical preference to use the Congressional Budget Office.\n  I point out a letter dated October 4 sent to a senior member of our \nstaff. It says:\n\n       Dividing the projected deficit by the available outlays \n     results in an across-the-board cut of 5.5 percent.\n\n  This is from the Congressional Budget Office. They are the gospel, I \nthink, when it comes to making decisions in the Budget Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record, and \nI yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [Memorandum of October 4, 1999]\n\n     To: Sue Nelson, [Democrat Staff--Budget Committee].\n     From: Janet Airis [CBO Staff].\n     Subject: Across-the-Board Cut to Discretionary \n         Appropriations.\n\n       This is in response to your request of an across-the-board \n     cut to FY 2000 discretionary appropriations. You asked us to \n     calculate an across-the-board cut that would result in an \n     estimated on-budget deficit for FY 2000 of zero, assuming \n     that the current status CBO estimate (excluding ``directed \n     scoring''), as of October 4, is enacted into law. Given your \n     assumption, our estimate of the projected on-budget deficit \n     is $19.2 billion. Our estimate of the outlays available to be \n     cut is $351.7 billion. Dividing the projected deficit by the \n     available outlays results in an across-the-board cut of 5.5%.\n       This calculation is preliminary and done without benefit of \n     language. If you have any questions, please contact me at \n     226-2850.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada who has \nbeen a strong champion of the rights of seniors. He and I serve on the \nCommittee on Aging.\n  I take this opportunity this morning to talk about an extraordinarily \nimportant issue for the older people of this country, and that is the \nneed to make sure senior citizens can get prescription drug coverage as \npart of the Medicare program.\n  I am especially proud that Senator Olympia Snowe and I have \nintroduced what is now the only bipartisan prescription drug bill \nbefore the Senate, and I am hopeful in the days ahead we can get this \nlegislation before the Senate and ensure that the millions of \nvulnerable older people in this country get decent prescription drug \ncoverage under Medicare.\n  I believe it is time to get this issue out of the beltway, get it out \nof Washington, DC, and get it to the grassroots of America. That is why \nSenator Snowe and I have initiated a grassroots campaign to get \nprescription drug coverage under Medicare.\n  As folks can see in the example next to me, we are hoping in the next \nfew weeks that senior citizens and their families from across the \ncountry will send in copies of their prescription drug bills to their \nSenators. We think our proposal, the Senior Prescription Insurance \nCoverage Equity Act, known as SPICE, is the way to proceed because it \nis bipartisan, it is market oriented, it gives senior citizens choice \nin the marketplace, and uses marketplace forces to hold down costs for \nprescription medicine.\n  We use as a model the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, \nwhich is what Members of Congress and their families have as the \ndelivery system for health care. If it is good enough for Members of \nthe Senate, Senator Snowe and I believe it is good enough for the older \npeople of our country.\n  We are hoping that instead of this just being a discussion within the \nbeltway, with the various interest groups on one side or the other \nlining up, we hope in the days ahead, as a result of senior citizens \nsending in copies of their prescription drug bills and their families \nweighing in with their legislators, we can get our bipartisan bill \nmoving.\n  More than 50 Members of the Senate have already voted for the funding \nproposal Senator Snowe and I advocate. We propose there ought to be a \ntobacco tax to fund this program. We believe that is only right, \nbecause in this country, more than $12 billion goes out of the Medicare \nprogram each year to handle tobacco-related illnesses. We believe there \nis a direct connection between the funding proposal we establish and \nmaking sure older people get this benefit. With more than 50 Members of \nthe Senate on record for the budget vote that Senator Snowe and I \noffered earlier this year, we ought to be able to build on that vote \nand actually get this program added to Medicare.\n  I am especially pleased the approach Senator Snowe and I have taken \nis one that can help lower the cost of prescription drug coverage for \nolder people. A key part of this debate is coverage, but equally as \nimportant is the need to hold down the costs of these prescriptions. We \nare seeing around this country that the big buyers of prescription \ndrugs--the health maintenance organizations and the large purchasers--\nget a discount and senior citizens are hit with a double whammy. Not \nonly does Medicare not cover their prescriptions, but when a senior \ncitizen walks into a pharmacy and picks up their prescription, say, in \nArkansas or Oregon or Maine, they, in effect, are subsidizing the \ndiscounts the big buyers are getting as a result of their marketplace \npower.\n  Some have proposed a system of price controls, putting Medicare in \nthe position of buying up all the medicine and using that as their idea \nof holding down costs. Senator Snowe and I think that will end up \ngenerating a lot of cost shifting on to the part of other people who \nare having difficulty covering their prescription drug bills.\n  We favor a market-oriented approach along the lines of the Federal \nemployee health plan. We are not talking about a price control regime \nor a run-from-the-beltway approach to this issue. We are talking about \nusing marketplace forces to hold down the costs of prescription drugs \nfor our older people.\n  It is especially urgent now. More than 20 percent of the Nation's \nsenior citizens are spending more than $1,000 a year out of pocket for \ntheir prescription medicine. We have older people with incomes of \n$15,000, $16,000 a year spending $1,000 or $1,500 each year on their \nprescription drugs. Very often those seniors are not able to pick up a \nprescription their doctor phoned in to their neighborhood pharmacy \nbecause the senior citizen cannot afford it, and the prescription \nlanguishes for weeks at the pharmacy because they cannot pick it up.\n  That is what I have heard from seniors in my State of Oregon. We have \nheard from other seniors whose physicians tell them they should be \ntaking three pills a day and they cannot afford that, and they start by \ntaking two, and then they take one. Eventually they get sicker and they \nneed much more expensive care.\n  In fact, the pharmaceuticals now and the medicines of the future are \ngoing to be preventive drugs. They are going to be drugs that help \nlower blood pressure and help us deal with cholesterol problems. As a \nresult, in the long term, we are going to save significant dollars by \npreventing expensive institutionalizations and hospital services as a \nresult of adding immediate prescription drug coverage to the Medicare \nprogram. Clearly, this benefit needs to be paid for.\n  The proposal Senator Snowe and I have offered will generate more than \n$70 billion in the next few years to add this benefit to the program. I \nam very hopeful the Senate will move on a bipartisan basis to tackle \nthis issue.\n\n[[Page S12064]]\n\n  There are many, certainly, in Washington, DC, who think the \nprescription drug issue is too complicated and too political to deal \nwith now, that we should wait until after the election. Senator Snowe \nand I reject that approach. It is more than a year until the next \nelection. We are hoping senior citizens, just as this poster next to me \nsays, will send in copies of their prescription drug bills to their \nSenators. Tell the Members of the Senate exactly why this issue is \nimportant to them, why the lack of prescription drug coverage is \ncausing them a hardship, and help Senator Snowe and I ignite a \ngrassroots movement to ensure that prescription drug coverage does \nbecome part of the Medicare program.\n  In effect, it is time for a wake-up call to the Congress. Some of the \nnaysayers and those who say we ought to put this issue off I think are \nmissing the real needs of the Nation's older people. If you have an \nincome of $15,000 or $16,000 and you are spending $1,500 a year for \nprescription drugs, if you are giving up other essentials, such as \nelectricity, to pay for your prescription drugs, you cannot afford to \nwait until after the next election.\n  It may be a luxury for people here in the beltway to wait until after \nthe next election to talk about the need to come up with a practical \nsolution to covering older people with their prescriptions. Senator \nSnowe and I think waiting is not a luxury that the millions of \nvulnerable, older people in this country have. They cannot afford to \nwait.\n  We are hoping, as a result of this campaign we have launched in the \nlast week to have folks send in a copy of their prescription drug \nbills, that this can serve as a wakeup call to this Senate and this \nCongress that the time to act is now.\n  We hope the Senate will choose the proposal we have developed. \nUndoubtedly, there are other very good ideas. I am sure we will hear \nfrom seniors, when they send in copies of their bills, about the best \nway to address this issue legislatively. Ours is a marketplace-oriented \napproach. It is based on the kind of program that Members of the Senate \nhave.\n  We hope, in the days ahead, seniors from across the country will send \nus copies of their prescription drug bills. We want to see this \ncoverage added now. We want to see the Senate address this in a \nbipartisan way.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent the time be evenly charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, to my amazement, we received a letter \nindicating the President might want to veto the foreign operations \nappropriations bill, a stunning development, it seems to me, almost \ninexplicable.\n  This bill, while not as much as the President requested, is as large \nas he signed last year and includes a number of items important not \nonly to many of us but to him as well.\n  For example, if this bill were to ultimately be vetoed, the President \nwould be vetoing--would be stopping--aid to the Newly Independent \nStates of the former Soviet Union of $735 million; developmental \nassistance, which was $83 million over his request in this bill that he \nis threatening to veto; narcotics assistance at $285 million, which is \n$24 million above last year, the bill that he signed; for AIDS, $180 \nmillion to fight AIDS, which is $55 million above the bill that he \nsigned last year; for UNICEF, an important program of the United \nNations, there is $110 million in this bill for UNICEF, which is $5 \nmillion more than in the bill last year that he signed.\n  Obviously, we continue the Middle East earmarks to Israel and Egypt. \nVetoing this bill would deny $3 billion to Israel. I think it is \nimportant to note that The American Israel Public Affairs Committee \nsupports this bill. AIPAC supports this bill. I ask unanimous consent \nthat letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                        AIPAC,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 1999.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington,DC.\n       Dear Chairman McConnell: We are writing to express our \n     support for the Conference Report on HR 2606, the FY 2000 \n     Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, which contains \n     funding for Israel's regular aid package, including \n     provisions for early disbursal, offshore procurement and \n     refugee resettlement. The Middle East peace process is moving \n     forward with both Israel and the Palestinians committed to \n     resolving issues between them within a year. It is important \n     that Congress support Israel as this process moves ahead, and \n     we therefore also hope and urge that Congress find a way to \n     fund assistance to the Wye River signatories before the end \n     of this year.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lionel Kaplan,\n       President.\n     Howard Kohr,\n       Executive Director.\n     Brad Gordon,\n       Legislative Director.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, other items in this bill of interest: \nChild health, immunization, and education initiatives. For Kosovo--we \nfought a war there a few months ago--there is $535 million for Kosovo \nand for some of the countries surrounding Kosovo that were impacted by \nthe war that was fought there. That is $142 million more than the \nPresident requested.\n  In addition, there is money in this bill for the environment, for \nbiodiversity, for tropical rain forests, unique ecosystems initiatives. \nAll of that will be denied if the President vetoes this bill.\n  For Lebanon and Cyprus, to help in the reconciliation process there, \nthere is $15 million for Lebanon and $15 million for Cyprus.\n  Infectious diseases, especially polio and TB campaigns, which have \nbeen priorities of Senator Leahy, all of that would be vetoed by this \nbill.\n  Funds for Georgia, for Ukraine, for Armenia, for Poland--all of which \nis supported vigorously by Americans of Georgian, Ukrainian, Armenian, \nand Polish descent--all of that would not go forward if this bill were \nvetoed. The vote on this bill, when it went through the Senate--and it \nis not all that different now from the way it was when it cleared the \nSenate--was 97-2. This is virtually the same bill, at $12.6 billion, \nwhich protects virtually all of the Senate priorities passed here at \n97-2. On the threat reduction initiative, we have spent $5.9 billion in \nRussia over the years. There are no restrictions on the $735 million we \nprovide for that area of the world preventing funding of this new $250 \nmillion initiative to control the nuclear problem there.\n\n  On development assistance, the President claims it is dramatically \nunderfunded. In fact, we not only exceeded last year's level--that is \nthe bill President Clinton signed--we exceeded last year's level of \nspending and we have exceeded his request for this year. The President \nrequested $83 million less than the conference has provided.\n  The veto threat to the Senator from Kentucky is inexplicable. It \ndoesn't make any sense, unless this important bill for the assistance \nof Israel and Egypt and Armenia and Georgia and Ukraine and a number of \nother worthwhile causes that are supported around the world is somehow \nbeing made part of a larger strategy by the administration to veto all \nof these bills.\n  This bill enjoys strong support from AIPAC, from Armenian Americans, \nfrom Georgian Americans, Polish Americans, Latvian, Lithuanian, \nEstonian, and Ukranian Americans. They are but a few of the Americans \nwho appreciate this bill.\n  As I indicated, all of these items are threatened by the President's \ninexplicable decision to threaten to veto this bill.\n  Finally, let me say, before turning to my friend and colleague from \nVermont, Senator Leahy, I don't know where the President wants to get \nmore money for this bill. Are we going to take it out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund to spend on foreign aid? Is that what the President \nis suggesting we do? Does President Clinton want us to take money\n\n[[Page S12065]]\n\nout of the Social Security trust fund and spend it on foreign aid? I \ndon't think that is something we ought to be doing. I don't think the \nAmerican people would like that.\n  I repeat, this is a bill that was supported overwhelmingly on a \nbipartisan basis when it cleared the Senate the first time. It is about \nthe same size as the bill the President signed last year.\n  I don't think there is any rational basis for the vetoing of this \nbill. I encourage the Senate to speak once again on a broad bipartisan \nbasis with a large vote to support this important bill which means so \nmuch to peace and stability around the world.\n  With that, Mr. President, I understand we are planning on voting \naround noon. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is available to this side of \nthe aisle?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 14 minutes 50 \nseconds remaining, and the Senator from Kentucky has 17 minutes 24 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator from \nOregon, Mr. Wyden, had spoken earlier as in morning business; is that \ncorrect, and that was taken from my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The UC took the time from this bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the time taken by Mr. Wyden \nbe restored to my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. We may well not use it. I am trying to \nprotect time for some who may want to come and speak.\n  It has been a week since the conference committee on foreign \noperations completed its work. The House tried, during that week, to \nmuscle the votes to pass it, and yesterday they did, by a three-vote \nmargin.\n  As stated by some of the leadership in the House, the bill is part of \na grand Republican strategy to force the President to either except a \nlarge cut in funding for foreign policy or veto the bill and then be \nblamed for cutting Social Security to pay for foreign policy, even \nthough everybody knows that is not going to happen. I think the \nAmerican people are more savvy than that. They know that foreign policy \nis the key responsibility of the Federal Government. It has been ever \nsince the days of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin.\n  Today the world is far more complex, more dangerous, more independent \nthan anybody could have assumed. They also know the President is not \ngoing to do anything to harm Social Security.\n  The House finally passed the conference report by three votes. The \nbill will pass here, with a third of the Senate voting against it. Then \nthe President vetoes it. It is unfortunate we are here.\n  In that regard, let me say something about the distinguished senior \nSenator from Kentucky. I should warn him and alert him that I am going \nto praise him. That may bring about the Republican State committee \ninitiating in Kentucky a recall petition, but that is the price of fame \nand glory.\n  The fact is, the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky took an \nallocation, as chairman of this subcommittee, which by anybody's \nstandards--his, mine or anybody else's--was too small. With that, he \ntried to fashion a bill that reflects the best interests of our country \nand the needs of our country and the great humanitarian nature of \nAmericans.\n  He has done it extraordinarily well. He has bent over backward--I say \nthis to all Democratic Members of the Senate as well as Republican \nMembers--to accommodate the needs of Senators on both sides of the \naisle. His chief of foreign policy, Robin Cleveland, and others have \nworked very closely with Senators on both sides of the aisle to try to \naccommodate all they could. Are there things not in here? Of course. \nYou only have so much money.\n  There are things the Senator from Kentucky would like to increase in \nhere, substantially. Without embarrassing him, I won't go down the \nlist, but he could think of a number of areas. Are there things the \nSenator from Vermont would want to see increased? Of course, there are, \nsubstantial areas.\n\n  We have seen, for example, the situation we now have in New York City \nwhere, after an outbreak of encephalitis, there is now a feeling that \nthis disease came over transported by a bird. It is now infecting birds \nand humans in New York. As birds migrate south, it will affect others. \nWhere did the disease come from? A different continent. It demonstrates \nthat every disease is only an airplane trip away.\n  We have money in here to approach that problem, working with a number \nof people, Dr. Nils Daulaire and others, to try to help countries \nidentify diseases when they occur in their country, help them eradicate \nthem there, help them contain them--both for the humanitarian effort of \nhelping this country get rid of the disease, but also one that protects \nall the rest of the world so the disease doesn't spread. Could we use a \nlot more money? Yes, we could. Ironically, we will end up spending \nhundreds of times more in this country, if we don't do this, just to \nhelp protect our own people within our own borders, than the fraction \nof that amount we would spend to stop the disease from occurring in the \nfirst place. That is one example. AIDS, the greatest calamity to hit \nthe world since World War II, does not have ample funds.\n  It has extra money in here. I complimented him and the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky for helping get that money in. Both of us believe \nand both of us have said repeatedly that the money in here falls short \nof what is needed to protect our interests around the world.\n  For years, we urged the administration to fight harder for the \nforeign operations budget. Let me say this as a criticism of the \nadministration of my own party: Too often, the administration has done \ntoo little, too late to build the support in Congress.\n  At the same time, the Congress has failed to allocate to our \nsubcommittee the funds we need. This bill is $800 million below the \n1999 level and $1.9 billion below the President's request, which, \nfrankly, was not an unreasonable request. It is substantially less than \nthis Congress was willing to give President Ronald Reagan for foreign \naid. At a time when President Reagan was expressing concerns about \nforeign aid, he was still spending far more than we have in here, in a \nworld much smaller than it is today.\n  It may surprise Senators to know that the President's fiscal year \n2000 budget request for foreign operations, which he didn't get, is \nabout the same as the amount we appropriated a decade ago. It is far \nless if you count inflation and far, far less if you count the amount \nwe actually came up with.\n  We have a lot of interests around the globe. The United States, a \nnation of a quarter of a billion people, has the preeminent economy and \nmilitary might in the world. But our economy and military might, by \nitself, does not protect our interests totally and does not enable us \nto continue our interests into the next century.\n  It is absurd that at the threshold of the 21st century, we continue \nto nickel and dime our foreign policy spending. We spend less than 1 \npercent of the Federal budget on foreign policy. Yet we are a worldwide \npower. Companies in my little State of Vermont are involved in \ninternational trade. We are, on a per capita basis, about third or \nfourth in the country in exporting outside our borders. With the \nInternet, any company in Vermont, or Kentucky, or Arkansas, or \nIllinois, or anywhere else, which does business on the Internet, if \nthey are selling something, they are going to get inquiries from Sri \nLanka, from Japan, from Germany, from the Middle East. We are a \nworldwide, interconnected economy.\n  We are also a nation that is called upon almost as a 911 source to \nhelp put out regional battles, fights, and so on, where democracy has \nnot taken hold, and we will spend tens of billions, even hundreds of \nbillions, of dollars to do that. But we won't spend a tiny fraction of \nthat amount of money in our foreign policy budget to try to help \ndemocracy take place in the first place, so we don't have to call out \nthe marines.\n  Unfortunately, the majority in Congress refuses to face up to that. \nWe continue to underfund these programs\n\n[[Page S12066]]\n\nand to underfund our diplomacy in the Commerce-Justice-State \nappropriations bill.\n  It is an isolationist, shortsighted approach that weakens our \nsecurity, puts undue burdens on our Armed Forces, and does damage to \nfuture generations of Americans. We still have Members of Congress who \ncall this foreign aid, and they even brag about cutting foreign aid. \nThese are the same Members of Congress who say, ``I will never leave \nthe shores of this Nation while I serve in Congress,'' as though this \nNation exists just within its shores--a nation where every one our \nFortune 500 companies do business around the world, every one of our \nStates' economies is greatly affected by what kind of business we do \naround the world. Our students travel abroad; our citizens travel \nabroad. I don't know how many times we have people going to other \ncountries saying, ``I am an American, I must have some rights.'' What \ndo we do to help support those rights?\n  To say we don't need to be involved in foreign aid, especially when \nthe United States spends far less of its budget than most other \nnations--actually less in dollars than some-- is simplistic, self-\nserving, and mostly inaccurate. These programs benefit all Americans.\n  We have a number of programs that are underfunded in this budget that \ncreate jobs in the United States. We create the greatest number of jobs \nin our economy in those jobs that affect our exports. To the extent \nthat our foreign aid and foreign policy programs improve the economies \nof other countries, they improve our markets. But unlike the request \nthe President has made for funding to support America's export \ncommunity, the bill cuts those funds.\n  The President has requested funding to support national security \nprograms, including to safeguard nuclear material in the former Soviet \nUnion. If you want something to make you wake up at 3 o'clock in the \nmorning, think of the inadequate controls over the nuclear material \nthat is now stored in the former Soviet Union. Ask any American, \n``Would you support something that would help us secure those nuclear \nmaterials?'' and they will say yes. This bill cuts those funds.\n  The President has asked for funds to build free markets, to \nstrengthen democratic governments that support our policies, to protect \nthe global environment. I don't think anybody opposes these programs, \nbut we are just not going to pay for them. Rather than funding them at \na level commensurate with the requirements and needs of a superpower \nwith the world's largest economy, some want to make political points. I \ndisagree with that. I think that is dangerous.\n\n  I voted to report the bill from the committee. I did that mostly out \nof respect for the efforts of the chairman of the subcommittee. I voted \nfor it on the floor, as most Senators did, to send it to conference. \nBut I said at that time my vote was contingent upon additional funding \nbeing added in conference. It did not happen.\n  I don't support everything the President has asked for at all. I want \nto make that clear. Some things I would vote against. But there is much \nin this conference report I do support. I don't support a cut in \nfunding. I think the long-term security costs to our economy and our \nsecurity will be far greater. It is simply irresponsible.\n  Year after year, I have voted for foreign operations bills I thought \nwere too low. I thought last year's bill was too low, and I said so at \nthe time. I voted for it because I thought it was the best we could do \nand it would not do irreparable harm to our national security. But this \nbill is $800 million less than last year's.\n  We have written a balanced bill. I have talked about the provisions I \nsupport, such as funding to combat HIV/AIDS in Africa and other \ndevelopment assistance programs. It also includes some provisions I \ndon't support, but we had a fair debate and vote on them. That is fine \nwith me.\n  Funding for IDA, which makes low-cost loans to the poorest countries, \nwas cut by $175 million. Funding for the U.N. agencies was cut. Funding \nfor the Korea Energy program cut by $20 million. Funding for \npeacekeeping was cut. Funding for nonproliferation, antiterrorism, and \nother security programs was cut. The Peace Corps was cut.\n  The world's population is going to pass 6 billion people next week, \nyet this conference report provides $50 million less for international \nfamily planning than the amount passed by the Senate in July and $100 \nmillion less than we spent 10 years ago, when the population was much \nsmaller.\n  It cuts funding for the Global Environment Facility by $157 million \nbelow last year's level and $108 million below the President's request.\n  I want to see a bill the President can sign. I say this to the \nadministration and the leadership of the House and Senate: You have \nmany Members on both sides of the aisle who want a good bill. But all \nof you are going to have to help us get the money so we can have a \nbetter bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I will be voting against the fiscal year \n2000 Foreign Operations appropriations bill conference report. Although \nI supported this bill when it came through the Senate, I was hopeful \nthat during the conference we would find the resources to address the \nserious deficiencies in this bill. Unfortunately, that was not the case \nand we have before us a bill that dramatically cuts the \nAdministration's request for foreign operations by 14 percent.\n  At a time of great uncertainty around the world, when we are being \ncalled on to foster new democracies, support peacekeeping operations, \nprevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and provide critical support for \nthe ongoing Middle East peace process, we have before us a bill which \nthreatens to undermine many of these vital foreign policy interests. If \nwe nickel and dime our foreign policy priorities now, we will pay a \nhigher price down the road when we respond to the ensuing international \ncrises.\n  I have generally supported our foreign aid budget. It is a less than \none percent of our annual budget, a small amount to protect our \nnational interests and provide tremendous benefit to those in need. In \nthe past, however, when our spending contributed to burgeoning \ndeficits, I opposed foreign aid or for that matter any spending bill \nthat surpassed the spending levels of the previous year. However, in \nthis era of budget surpluses the debate has shifted to a question of \npriorities. And, it is in this context that I must oppose this bill. We \ncannot afford to give short shrift to basic priorities traditionally \nfunded in this bill. It is my hope that after the President vetoes this \nbill, we produce a bipartisan foreign operations budget that can be \nsupported by all.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Foreign \nOperations Conference Report and to express my disappointment that in \npassing this report the Committee has not provided funding for the U.S. \ncommitment to the Wye River agreement.\n  This conference agreement, which provides $12.6 billion in funding, \nis nearly $2 billion below the President's request and $1 billion less \nthan last year's bill. This low level of funding makes it all but \nimpossible for the U.S. to maintain its leadership role in the \ninternational community. Indeed, nearly every major account in the \nconference report is underfunded, including funding for voluntary \ninternational peacekeeping, the Peace Corps, Multilateral Development \nBanks, the Enhanced Threat Reduction Initiative, African development \nloan initiatives, the Global Environment Facility, and debt relief for \nthe world's poorest countries.\n  Most troubling, one specific initiative, the Wye assistance for the \nMiddle East peace process, is nonexistent.\n  As Israel and the Palestinian Authority move ahead with \nimplementation of the Wye agreement and final status negotiations, it \nis vital that the United States also do its part in meeting its \ncommitments and obligations.\n  On Monday I, and twenty-one of my colleagues, sent letters to the \nPresident and to the Majority and Minority leaders about the critical \nimportance of meeting our Wye commitments. Let me tell you why I \nconsider this to be such an important issue.\n  On September 4, 1999 Prime Minister Barak and Palestinian Authority \nPresident Arafat signed the Sharm el-Shiekh Memorandum, expediting the \nfulfillment of Israeli and Palestinian obligations under prior \ntreaties, particularly the Wye agreement, and establishing a time line \nfor the completion of final status negotiations by\n\n[[Page S12067]]\n\nSeptember 13, 2000. Under this agreement: Israel has now relinquished \nan additional 7 percent of the West Bank, with 5 percent more slated \nfor turnover to the Palestinian Authority later this year; Israel has \nreleased 199 Palestinian prisoners with another 150 scheduled for \nrelease later this year; Israel has started to open the Shuhada Road in \nHebron; the Palestinian Authority has submitted its list of police; \nand, Israel and the Palestinian Authority have formally initiated final \nstatus negotiations.\n  Israel and the Palestinian Authority are meeting their obligations, \nand as Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority continue to make \nprogress in these negotiations, it is all the more critical for the \nUnited States to provide the financial assistance and support that has \nbeen promised.\n  Whereas the first land transfer from Israel to the Palestinian \nAuthority did not involve the movement of Israeli troops or bases, the \nnext two planned transfers will involve the redeployment of troops, \nbases, and other infrastructure at considerable cost to Israel. In \nfact, there is some concern in Israel that if the U.S. is unable or \nunwilling to meet its commitments under Wye, the budget of the \ngovernment of Israel will be thrown into chaos.\n  The United States has pledged to provide $1.2 billion to Israel, $400 \nmillion to the Palestinians, and $300 million to Jordan to assist them \nin meeting their obligations under the Wye accord, as well as for \neconomic assistance for Jordan and areas under the Palestinian \nAuthority.\n  The United States has a deep commitment to Israel and its Arab \npartners in the peace process to help advance negotiations and to help \nmeet the financial burden placed on the parties in the peace process in \nmeeting their obligations. We have undertaken this commitment both \nbecause it is the right thing to do and because it serves well vital \nU.S. national security interests.\n  The Wye agreement represents an important step on the road to peace \nin the Middle East. We must meet our obligations under Wye, and I do \nnot believe that Congress should pass a Foreign Operations \nAppropriations bill that does not include such funding.\n  I do not believe that the United States can adequately pursue our \nnational interests and foreign affairs priorities with this Conference \nReport. It will not allow the U.S. to continue to operate important \ninternational programs at current levels, will undoubtedly detract from \nthe stature of the U.S. in the international community, and lets down \nour partners in the Middle East peace process. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in opposition to this conference report.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as a member of the Foreign Operations \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have always supported the subcommittee's \nbill here on the Senate floor. We always have difficult and \ncontroversial choices before our subcommittee. Under the leadership of \nSenators McConnell and Leahy, we have been able to do a reasonable job \ncrafting a bill with bipartisan support.\n  Unfortunately, that is not the case this year. I will be voting \nagainst the foreign operations appropriations measure. I take this \naction for a number of reasons.\n  Most importantly, this bill is woefully underfunded. The bill is $2 \nbillion less than President Clinton's request and some $800 million \nbelow last year's congressionally approved funding level. This account \nhas already been cut significantly in recent years. The most recent \ncuts, in my estimation, will cripple our already meager foreign aid \nefforts. We spend a great deal of time here in the Congress talking \nabout the U.S. role as the world's lone superpower. The foreign \noperations bill is a test of our sincerity in providing global \nleadership beyond the realm of U.S. military might.\n  This bill does so many things that project an America to the world \nthat we can and should all be proud of. We educate young girls, we \nprovide microcredit loans to small family enterprises, we export \ndemocracy throughout the world, we cooperate with human rights \nactivists and monitors, and we create opportunities for American \ncitizens and business interests abroad. Unfortunately, the bill on the \nfloor today cripples our efforts to work internationally, vital work \nthat is in the national interest of the United States.\n  The foreign operations bill fails to provide any funding to the \nimportant Middle East peace process. The President had requested $500 \nmillion in assistance to aid the implementation of the Wye River \nAccords. This small investment in peace and security is even more \nimportant given the recent agreement between Israel's new government \nand the Palestinian Authority. Now is the time to reassert U.S. support \nfor the peace process that, at this moment, shows so much hope and \npromise.\n  I also am disappointed that this bill underfunds our export promotion \nprograms. For example, the Export-Import Bank, which protects and \ncreates American jobs, is funded below the 1999 level and far below the \nAdministration's 2000 request. U.S. workers compete in the global \neconomy. That's a fact. It is equally true that other governments in \nAsia and Europe do far more to help their exporters succeed. Our \nability to compete and win abroad for American workers is impacted by \nthe foreign operations bill. And this bill could do far more for \nAmerican workers.\n  Finally, I continue to have reservations regarding the funding levels \nand the restrictive language placed on our international family \nplanning assistance programs. The restrictive language is particularly \nharmful as it cripples the provision of valuable family planning \nprograms which aid population control, economic development, \nenvironmental protection and some many other areas. Our false family \nplanning debates driven by domestic politics here in the United States \nonly harm thousands of women and families in the developing world.\n  Mr. President, this bill will not become law. President Clinton has \npromised a veto for numerous, very legitimate reasons. I encourage the \nPresident to follow through with a veto if this bill makes it to his \ndesk. And I am anxious to work with my Senate colleagues on a new \nversion of this bill. This is an important bill. Given the resources, I \nam confident that Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy can deliver a \nbill the Senate will again endorse with wide bipartisan margins.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have to say that I am disappointed in the \nforeign operations appropriations conference report. In my estimation \nthen, and in my estimation now, this bill has two huge flaws: First of \nall, the bill as a whole is under funded. It simply does not dedicate \nthe necessary monies for our nation's foreign operations.\n  The Administration has indicated that the President will veto this \nbill, and I approve that decision. The amount in this bill is nearly $2 \nbillion less than the administration's request. That is unacceptable.\n  The second major problem is that, not only is overall funding \ninadequate, two essential programs have either faced draconian cuts, or \nhave not been funded at all. It is on those programs that I wish to \nspeak.\n  Perhaps the biggest failure of this bill is that it does not provide \nthe amount that the President requested to support the Middle East Wye \nRiver Agreement.\n  I find it irresponsible that the conference report does not include a \nsingle penny to fulfill our commitment to support the agreement. Early \nin September, Israel and the Palestinian Authority signed an agreement \nto carry out Wye and to move to final status negotiations.\n  Just as the peace process is getting back on track, this conference \nreport sends a signal of American retreat from our historic moral and \nstrategic commitments in the Middle East.\n  The $800 billion in aid missing from the conference report for fiscal \nyears 1999, and the $500 missing form this year's appropriation were \nrequested to support Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority in \ncritical areas.\n  In Israel, funds were requested to assist Israel in carrying out its \nmilitary re-deployments and to acquire anti-terrorism equipment. In the \nPalestinian Authority, support was requested for education, health \ncare, and basic infrastructure in order to reduce the influence of \nradical groups that thrive off of economic misery.\n  In Jordan, support is needed to bolster the new King as he takes bold \nand risky moves to support peace and aggressively fight terror.\n\n[[Page S12068]]\n\n  The parties in the region will need to know that we are a reliable \npartner as they move to the most contentious issues in the peace \nprocess. This conference report calls into question our ability to \ncarry out our commitments.\n  The second failure of this year's conference report is that it does \nnot fund the Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative, an essential part of \nU.S. efforts to reduce the chances for the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction from the former Soviet Union.\n  Almost every one of the Department of State budget increases proposed \nin the Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative has been zeroed out in the \nconference report. This occurred despite the inclusion in the Senate \nbill of two floor amendments calling for the conferees to achieve full \nfunding of these program requests. I regret that this message was \nignored by the conferees, and Frankly I fear that their action could \nendanger our national security.\n  Some of the programs that are unfunded in this bill were to help \nRussia's biological weapons experts find new fields of work. If we fail \nto do that, these very same experts could later threaten our crops, our \nlivestock, and our very lives.\n  Assistance for the Newly Independent States was decreased by 445 \nmillion from a Senate passed level that was already $250 million below \nthe Administration's request. While it is unclear where the additional \ncut would be made, it could reduce existing non-proliferation \nassistance programs such as the International Science and Technology \nCenters in Russia and Ukraine. Through these centers over 24,000 former \nweapons scientists have found jobs in places other than nuclear and \nbiological weapons labs in Iraq and Iran.\n  The same could be said for the Civilian Research and Development \nFund. This foundation provides training for Russians who are former \nweapons scientist so that they can embark in nonmilitary careers. Not \nonly the United States, but the entire world has benefited from this.\n  I accept the fact that Congress has to make some tough choices in all \nof our appropriations. There are literally a dozen more programs in \nthis bill that I would like to see increased funding for. We cannot \ndesignate as much money as we would like in all the areas we would \nlike. However, I believe that the programs I have outlined above are \ncrucial to the effective execution of United States foreign policy.\n  By ignoring them, we are creating serious problems which may very \nwell be costly to correct. Diplomacy and assistance are cheap compared \nto the price we pay when they fail. When the Senate passed its \nappropriation bill in June, I hoped that these flaws I have just \ndiscussed would be corrected. They were not. As it stands, I cannot \nsupport the conference report.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the foreign operations \nconference report includes a major concession to the Clinton \nadministration--it strikes language which attempted to stop U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars from being used to promote abortion abroad, imposing \nan imperialistic, left-wing, pro-death agenda on the nearly 100 \ncountries who have, for deeply-held religious reasons, upheld the \nsanctity of human life and who believe that life, including lives of \nthe innocent and unborn, are sacred in God's eyes.\n  Regrettably, the House-passed language, the Smith-Barcia Foreign \nFamilies Protection amendment, while not cutting funding for the \ninternational population assistance, would have at least restored the \nprohibition on using these funds to support foreign organizations that \nlobby to repeal or undermine the laws of foreign governments against \nabortion. Since the Senate refused to negotiate with the House on a \nproposed compromise on the issue, as a result, the conference report on \nforeign operations has no pro-life safeguards. The Senate conferees did \nnot accept the House's proposal to reinstate last year's ban on funding \nfor the U.N. Population Fund in exchange for dropping the Foreign \nFamilies Protection Act Amendment.\n  The UNFPA has cooperated with the Peoples Republic of China in \nimplementing coercive population control including forced abortion and \nsterilization. There are examples of poor people around the world being \ncoerced into sterilization and fertility experimentation, sometimes, as \nwas reported in Peru, by the threat of withholding food aid.\n  More recently, in Kosovo, Concerned Women for America reported that \nwhile refugees sought water, clothing and other basic necessities, the \nUNFPA and Planned Parenthood delivered what they considered ``life-\nsaving supplies''--working with the UNHCR, whey dispatched ``emergency \nreproductive health kits'' for about 350,000 people for a period of 3 \nto 6 months.\n  These kits included oral and indictable contraception kits, sexually \ntransmitted disease kits, intrauterine device (IUDs) kits, \ncomplications of abortion kits, vacuum extraction equipment and, \ncondoms (UNFPA press release, 4/8/99).\n  The U.S. State Department estimates that of the 350,000 refugees, 10 \npercent are either pregnant, breastfeeding or caring for very young \ninfants. Also, Kosovo has one of the two highest total fertility rates \nin Europe, making it a prime target for population controllers like \nUNFPA (Planned Parenthood press release, 4/13/99).\n  UNFPA and Planned Paenthood are putting these women at risk. CWA \nfound a doctor with 10 years experience with the UNHCR, as well as \nnumerous non-governmental organizations (NGOs), who was willing to \ntestify without attribution about the danger of providing birth control \npills and emergency ``contraception'' to refugee women. This doctor \nworked extensively within the U.N. and externally to prevent \ndistribution of emergency ``contraception'' which causes chemical \nabortion in the early stages of pregnancy and manual vacuum aspirators \nused to perform abortions.\n  The doctor confirmed the fact that refugee women who use birth \ncontrol pills are vulnerable in two specific ways. First, they do not \nreceive information to make an informed decision, nor are they \nguaranteed a doctor's continuing care.\n  Vacuum aspirators included in the UNFPA kit are particularly \ndangerous. These manual devices cannot be sterilized, risking fatal \ninfections, and can puncture the uterus. Rather than life-saving, these \ndevices can be life-threatening.\n  The UNFPA and PPFA are exploiting these desperate, vulnerable refugee \nwomen. They are attempting to indoctrinate them with the U.N.'s radical \nnotions about sexuality and abortion. Abortions may only intensify \ntheir physical and emotional distress. Post-abortion syndrome (PAS) is \na type of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, once believed only to affect \nwar veterans.\n  This year, unsuccessfully, an effort was made in the House to \ntransfer funds from ``international family planning'' programs to child \nsurvival programs--this is based on the pleas of many respected people \nin the children's health field, including health ministers in Africa, \nwho have begged the West for basic medicines like penicillin and \nrehydration salts. They have said their shelves are overflowing with \ncondoms, while they watch their infants and young children die from \nbasic maladies that would never go untreated in the industrialized \nworld. Their calls have gone unheeded. The Clinton Administration's \nforeign policy priority is to ensure that women can abort their babies, \nnot to ensure that mothers who give birth can properly care for their \nchildren.\n  The fight is not over--the issue of protecting women and their unborn \nchildren and of respecting the pro-life, pro-family laws of foreign \nnations will resurface this year.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President: I rise in opposition to the adoption of H.R. \n2606--the fiscal year 2000 foreign operations conference report.\n  Let me say at the outset that it is very unusual for me to oppose an \nappropriations bill of this kind, but I do so today because I believe \nthat if it becomes law it will jeopardize United States interests \nglobally. Why are our interests threatened? They are threatened because \nthis bill does not provide the wherewithal to the Clinton \nadministration so that it can effectively carry out United States \nforeign policies and programs. Many programs being funded by this bill \nare at drastically reduced levels. The total dollar value of the \nappropriations contained in this conference report are approximately $2 \nbillion below levels requested by the President.\n\n[[Page S12069]]\n\n  The conferees apparently did not think that the Middle Peace Process \nis of critical interest to the United States because nowhere can a find \nfunding in support of the implementation of the Wye Agreement--clearly \na critical component in ensuring that the peace process more forward. I \nbelieve that this omission is extremely unwise and is reason enough \nalone for Members of this body to oppose it.\n  But that is not the only problem with this bill. Let me discuss some \nof the other deficiencies as well.\n  First, Mr. President, we all know how much bipartisan support the \nPeace Corps engenders in both Houses of Congress. Peace Corps \nvolunteers are our ``citizen diplomats'' abroad. The lasting good will \nand friendship that results from American men and women serving as \nvolunteers for two years in countries that need and want their presence \nis immeasurable. No one that I know of has any complaints about the \norganization. Yet, this bill would short change its fiscal year 2000 \nbudget by $35 million, making it nearly impossible for the Peace Corps \nto meet its congressionally mandated goal of placing 10,000 volunteers \nin the field early in the next decade.\n  Nor does this conference report contain a penny for use by the \nClinton administration as its initial responses to the tragic natural \ndisasters that have just occurred in Turkey and Taiwan. Surely we could \nhave provided some start up monies to assist our friends in their hour \nof need. Similarly, money was not included in this bill to assist the \npeople of Kosovo begin the painful process of rebuilding after the \ndevastation wrought by Serbian forces earlier this year.\n  The phrase ``penny wise and pound foolish'' comes readily to mind as \none reviews the provisions of this bill. Let me highlight some of the \nmost important deficiencies as I see them: $175 million reduction in \nloan programs designed to help the poorest nations address their \ncritical needs; $157 million reduction in global environmental \nprotection programs; $26 million below the Senate passed appropriated \namounts for the U.S. Export Import Bank and additional unnecessary \nCongressional notification requirements that could delay approval of \nexport credit applications; $85 million reduction in debt relief for \nthe poorest countries; $200 million reduction in regional democracy \nbuilding and economic development programs for Africa, Latin America \nand Asia; $297 million reduction in democracy and civil society \nprograms in the independent states of the former Soviet Union; and $20 \nmillion reduction in funds to support the Korean Peninsula Development \nOrganization and seriously restrictive legislative conditions which \njeopardize important ongoing U.S. diplomatic efforts to contain the \nNorth Korean nuclear threat to the Korean Peninsula.\n  This is certainly not an exhaustive listing of all the problems I \nhave with this bill, but merely the highlights, or low lights as the \ncase may be, of the serious inadequacies with the foreign operations \nconference report. Having said that I believe that the issues I have \ncited are more than enough reason for members to vote against this \nlegislation and I urge them to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am sorry my friend and colleague, the \nSenator from Vermont, is not going to be able to support the bill. But \nI do want to commend him for his ongoing effort with regard to \ndemining. The Leahy War Victims Fund has had a dramatic impact not only \non rehabilitation but also on safety; in addition, Senator Leahy's \ninterest in and devotion to the subject of infectious diseases. He has \nsingle-handedly driven the funding levels up. The surveillance, \ncontrol, and treatment have improved throughout the world because of \nhis commitment.\n  I commend him for that.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that both sides are interested \nin having this vote at noon. I am prepared to yield back my time, if \nSenator Leahy is, and we will proceed with the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my understanding is that no one else on \nthis side wishes to speak.\n  In that case, I yield our time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n  The yeas and nays have not be ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, as the Senate proceeds toward its still-\nscheduled debate on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, I am confident \nthat the record will show most former senior U.S. government officials \nremain strongly opposed to Senate ratification of the CTBT.\n  The Senate--and the American people--will hear from many \ndistinguished officials in the coming days, as they speak out against \nthe CTBT. Of course, the Clinton Administration will try to counter \nthat other well-known people support the CTBT, but those who support \nratification of this proposed total nuclear test ban are a distinct \nminority.\n  In looking over the record, however, I found that many of the very \npeople the Clinton Administration claims now support such a permanent \nand total nuclear test ban treaty in fact explicitly rejected it when \nthey served in the U.S. Senate and in uniform.\n  They argued at that time (a) that such a test ban was unverifiable, \nand (b) that the U.S. needs to preserve the ability to conduct nuclear \ntests if the American people are to be assured of the safety and \nreliability of our nuclear weapons.\n  Make no mistake: These are all great Americans, whom I admire and \nrespect, who served their country with distinction. In calling \nattention to their statements of the past for the record today, I \ncertainly imply no disrespect.\n  To the contrary, I hope the record will reflect their judgements at \nthat time because I believe that those judgements on a zero-yield test \nban were right back then--and those judgements are still right today.\n  For example, as a U.S. Senator, our distinguished former colleague, \nBill Cohen of Maine, was a leading light on defense issues in the U.S. \nSenate. Indeed, he vigorously objected to the termination of nuclear \ntesting when he served here as a U.S. Senator. He objected, he said, \nbecause the termination of nuclear testing would undermine efforts to \nmake U.S. weapons safer.\n  Throughout the months of August and September 1992, Senator Cohen \nvigorously fought efforts by Senators Mitchell, Exon, and Hatfield to \nkill the United States nuclear test program.\n  Here is a sample of Senator Cohen's 1992 views as expressed on the \nSenate floor on September 18 of that year seven years ago:\n\n       We have made, in fact, remarkable progress in negotiating \n     substantial reductions in nuclear arsenals. While we have \n     made substantial reductions, we are not yet on the verge of \n     eliminating nuclear weapons from our inventories. We are \n     going to have to live with nuclear weapons for some time to \n     come, so we have to ask ourselves the question: Exactly what \n     kinds of nuclear weapons do we want to have during that time?\n\n  Senator Bill Cohen declared further seven years ago:\n\n       . . . [W]hat remains relevant is the fact that many of \n     these nuclear weapons which we intend to keep in our \n     stockpile for the indefinite future are dangerously unsafe. \n     Equally relevant is the fact that we can make these weapons \n     much safer if limited testing is allowed to be conducted. So, \n     when crafting our policy regarding nuclear testing, this \n     should be our principal objective: To make the weapons we \n     retain safe.\n       . . . The amendment that was adopted last week . . . does \n     not meet this test . . . [because] it would not permit the \n     Department of Energy to conduct the necessary testing to make \n     our weapons safe.\n\n  Similarly, Vice President Al Gore likewise adamantly opposed a \n``zero-yield'' test ban--i.e., one that would ban all nuclear tests--as \na United States Senator, on the grounds that such a ban was \nunverifiable.\n  Indeed, on May 12, 1988, Senator Gore objected to an amendment \n(offered to the 1989 defense bill) because it called for a test ban \ntreaty and restricted all nuclear tests above 1 kiloton.\n  A 1 kiloton limit ban, Senator Gore said at that time, was \nunverifiable. At Senator Gore's insistence, the proposed amendment was \nmodified to raise the limit for nuclear testing from a 1 kiloton limit \nto a 5 kiloton limit.\n  For the Record, here's what Senator Gore's position as taken on the \nSenate floor in 1988:\n\n       Mr. President, I want to express a lingering concern about \n     the threshold contained in the amendment.\n       Without regard to the military usefulness of lack of \n     usefulness of a 1 kiloton versus the 5 kiloton test, purely \n     with regard to verification, I am concerned that a 1 kiloton \n     test really pushes verification to the limit, even with \n     extensive cooperative measures. . . . I express the desire \n     that this threshold be changed from 1 to 5.\n\n  If Senator Gore argued on the Senate floor that a 1 kiloton test ban \nwas unverifiable, surely the zero-yield--ban--i.e. a ban on all nuclear \ntests would be equally unverifiable.\n  President Clinton has argued that several former Chairmen of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff strongly back his call for a Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty banning any and all nuclear tests.\n  It's interesting that their statements, when they were still in \nuniform, however, raise doubts about Administration's claims that they \nvigorously support the CTBT. Consider, for example, what General Colin \nPowell, then the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said on December 1, \n1992:\n\n       With respect to a comprehensive test ban, that has always \n     been a fundamental policy goal of ours, but as long as we \n     have nuclear weapons, we have a responsibility for making \n     sure that our stockpile remains safe. And to keep that \n     stockpile safe, we have to conduct a limited number of \n     nuclear tests to make sure that we know what a nuclear weapon \n     will actually do and how it is aging and to find out a lot of \n     other physical characteristics with respect to nuclear \n     phenomenon. . . . As long as we have nuclear weapons, I think \n     as good stewards of them, we have to conduct testing.\n\n  General Powell previously had made much the same declaration during a \nSenate hearing on September 20, 1991:\n\n       We need nuclear testing to ensure the safety, surety of our \n     nuclear stockpile. As long as one has nuclear weapons, you \n     have to know what it is they will do, and so I would \n     recommend nuclear testing.\n\n  What General Powell said was as true back then as it is today.\n  Similarly, Admiral William Crowe also opposed the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty while he was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In \ntestimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on May 5, 1986, \nhe stated:\n\n       [A comprehensive test ban] would introduce elements of \n     uncertainty that would be dangerous for all concerned.\n\n  He further declared:\n\n       I frankly do not understand why Congress would want to \n     suspend testing on one of the most critical and sophisticated \n     elements of our nuclear deterrent--namely the warhead.\n\n  General David Jones likewise stated, during his confirmation hearing \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee:\n\n\n[[Page S12071]]\n\n\n       I would have difficulty recommending a zero test ban for an \n     extended period.\n\n  Among the General's reasons for opposition were, according to a May \n29, 1978 press account, that the CTBT\n\n       is not verifiable, and that U.S. stockpile reliability \n     could not be assured.\n\n  Numerous press accounts from 1994 and 1995 indicated that General \nJohn Shalikashvili maintained strong reservations regarding a zero \nyield test ban, and made clear that he favored maintenance of the \nability to conduct low-yield testing under any negotiated treaty.\n  Indeed, these comments by these former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs--\nwhile in uniform--strongly echo the current views of other former \nChairmen of the Joint Chiefs, such as Admiral Tom Moorer and General \nJohn Vessey, Jr., both of whom today strongly oppose the CTBT.\n  Again, I must emphasize that all of these men are distinguished \nAmericans whom I greatly respect and admire.\n  Indeed, my point today is simply to show that the arguments of \nSenators Cohen and Gore, and Chairmen Powell, Crowe, Jones and \nShalikashvili were right then--and they are still right today:\n  Nuclear testing is vital to maintaining the safety of our nuclear \nweapons and the reliability of our nuclear deterrent.\n  A ``zero-yield''--i.e., a total and complete--nuclear test ban is \nunverifiable.\n  A Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that bars any and all nuclear testing \nis dangerous for the American people, and I am confident that the \nUnited States Senate will not ratify such a dangerous treaty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/06/senate-section/article/S12071-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12071-S12090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n          RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2267 To Amendment No. 1851\n\n (Purpose: To reject indiscriminate across-the-board cuts and protect \nSocial Security surpluses by closing special interest tax loopholes and \n                    using other appropriate offsets)\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2267 to amendment No. 1851.\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. PROTECTING SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Congressional Budget Office has projected that \n     Congress is headed toward using at least $19,000,000,000 of \n     the social security surplus in fiscal year 2000.\n       (2) Amendment number 1851 calls for across-the-board cuts, \n     which could result in a broad-based reduction of 10 percent, \n     taking into consideration approved appropriations bills and \n     other costs likely to be incurred in the future, such as \n     relief for hurricane victims, Kosovo, and health care \n     providers.\n       (3) These across-the-board cuts would sharply reduce \n     military readiness and long-term defense modernization \n     programs, cut emergency aid to farmers and hurricane victims, \n     reduce the number of children served by Head Start, cut back \n     aid to schools to help reduce the class size, severely limit \n     the number of veterans served in VA hospitals, reduce the \n     number of FBI and Border Patrol agents, restrict funding for \n     important transportation investments, and limit funding for \n     environmental cleanup sites.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that instead of raiding social security surpluses or \n     indiscriminately cutting defense, emergency relief, \n     education, veterans' health care, law enforcement, \n     transportation, environmental cleanup, and other \n     discretionary appropriations across the board, Congress \n     should fund fiscal year 2000 appropriations, without using \n     budget scorekeeping gimmicks, by closing special-interest tax \n     loopholes and using other appropriate offsets.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, obviously, I went in a slightly \ndifferent direction as we introduced our second-degree amendment \nbecause I wanted the clerk to particularly read some of the \nimplications of what it is we are facing if we adopt the Nickles \namendment.\n  My amendment is a substitute for the Nickles amendment. It is very \nsimple. It expresses the sense of the Senate that the Congress must not \npermit raiding Social Security surpluses nor indiscriminately cut \ndefense, emergency relief, education, veterans' health care, law \nenforcement, transportation, environmental cleanup, and other \ndiscretionary appropriations across the board. Instead, we should fund \nfiscal year 2000 appropriations--I point out that the year began \nOctober 1--without using budgetary gimmicks by closing special interest \ntax loopholes and using other appropriate offsets.\n  In my view, this is a much more rational and appropriate way to \napproach the budget. Deep across-the-board cuts are a bad way to do \nbusiness. They will prove extremely unpopular. Americans didn't send us \nto Washington to simply use a meat ax approach to governing. They want \nus to do it thoughtfully. They want us to go after waste and \ninefficiencies, to use our judgment and support essential programs such \nas education. The Nickles amendment, by contrast, puts the budget \nprocess on automatic pilot. It would cut indiscriminately.\n  I read from the text of the Nickles amendment where they say in the \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment that ``Congress should ensure that the \nfiscal year 2000 appropriations measures do not result in an on-budget \ndeficit''--that on-budget is excluding Social Security trust funds. \nThey put parentheses around it--``by adopting''--this is the solution \nthey offer--``an across-the-board reduction in all discretionary \nappropriations sufficient to eliminate such deficit if necessary.''\n  The language is quite clear. But to further clarify, it says cut \nthese programs--the ones I talked about--cut veterans' health benefits, \ncut educational benefits, cut law enforcement, cut FBI, cut border \nguards even though our border is saturated by illegal immigration. And \nwe ought to make an orderly process about that.\n  The Nickles amendment makes no distinction between critical \npriorities such as education, defense, and lower priorities such as \ncorporate subsidies or pork barrel spending.\n  There is no need for a meat ax approach. The Republicans' own tax \nbill proposed to close various tax loopholes. Now that the bill has \nbeen vetoed, why not use some of the same loopholes to help protect \nSocial Security, to prevent potentially painful cuts in education and \nother priorities?\n  Why not search for waste from other Government programs? How many of \nus have talked about that waste as we campaigned for office? Shouldn't \nwe go after that before we take money away from our schools or our \nArmed Forces?\n  My amendment does not specify the offsets we should adopt, and it in \nno way endorses raising income taxes on ordinary families, but it does \nsay we have to treat the budget candidly.\n  One of the things we should all be alerted to--the public in \nparticular, but certainly we who are going to vote on this--it says: \n``GOP Using Two Sets of Books,'' in a commentary by the Wall Street \nJournal of July 27:\n\n       Republicans are double-counting a big part of next year's \n     surplus, papering over the fact that their proposed tax cuts \n     and spending bills already have exhausted available funds.\n\n  If it were up to me, as I said earlier, I would ask the tobacco \nindustry to compensate the taxpayers for the damage they have caused \nand help pay for the tobacco-related diseases that cost us some $20 \nbillion a year. If we could get that $20 billion a year, we wouldn't \nhave to be faced with the prospect of cutting Social Security surpluses \nby some $19 billion.\n\n  Once again, my amendment doesn't endorse that particular approach, or \nany specific provision. It just says: Let's be honest with the American \npeople, and let's find real offsets.\n  I will tell you what I learned from the Congressional Budget Office \nin a letter to one of my staff people:\n\n       Our estimates of the outlays available to be cut is $351.7 \n     billion. Dividing the projected deficit by the available \n     outlays results in an across-the-board cut of 5.5 percent.\n\n  Across-the-board cuts--that is all of those programs that we have \ndiscussed several times.\n  We shouldn't use gimmicks. We shouldn't use that kind of treatment, \nand not indiscriminate, across-the-board cuts which drastically slash \nfunding for teachers, military personnel, veterans, and other \npriorities. In fact, we have an endorsement of\n\n[[Page S12072]]\n\nthat view, I think it is fair to say, when Appropriations Committee \nchairman Bill Young of Florida says to cut 2.7 percent of all \ndiscretionary spending would result in cuts of about $7 billion from \ndefense which would wipe out the pay increase that lawmakers recently \nprovided for the military.\n  We all know the military is having a problem recruiting new members \nand getting new recruits to join the various branches. Would we want to \ndiscourage that effort even though we are having a problem filling \nthose important positions that we must have to protect ourselves? I \nthink not.\n  Mr. President, pretty simply, I hope my colleagues will support the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, several comments: First, I commend the \nSenator from New Jersey for at least a more, in my judgment, candid \ndiscussion of this debate than we heard last week because the \nresolution that he offers says the Congressional Budget Office has \nprojected that Congress is headed toward--headed toward doesn't mean \nthey are there--whereas last week in the debate you would have thought \nit was a fait accompli.\n  The point is, we don't know if any funds or spending levels would \nhave been at such a level that they would have affected Social \nSecurity. No one knows that now. Everybody is trying to avert that. \nHere comes Senator Nickles' amendment which says if we don't avert \nthat, it would relate to across-the-board cuts. I think all of us \nunderstand that the number, if any of it applies to Social Security, \nwould never be of the magnitude discussed in the amendment by the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  The point I wish to make is that it is a nebulous amendment because \nit says it is headed for--in other words, we don't know. But then they \ndraw the conclusion that it might result in reductions of 10 percent \nacross the board. We heard 1 percent. If it were around $5 billion, it \nwould be 1 percent. If it were $19 billion, it would be probably around \n5 percent. To get to 10 percent, we would probably have to be at about \n$40 billion.\n  The point is, this is a very imprecise amendment about something. It \nis like an attempt to be a crystal ball. What are the appropriators, \nwhat is the Senate, and what is the Congress going to ultimately do \nwith the pressure?\n  The amendment also has a technical flaw because it suggests in the \nlanguage that it would cut emergency aid to farmers and hurricane \nvictims when across-the-board cuts do not apply to emergency funding--\nsomething the authors may want to review.\n  Senator Nickles said if spending is such that it utilizes some Social \nSecurity receipts, they will require an across-the-board cut. I think \nthe American people can understand that.\n  This resolution says we could cut spending, which of course is what \nSenator Nickles suggests ought to happen as well; but if that doesn't \nwork, we will just raise taxes. The Senator from New Jersey points out \nthese are taxes that would not affect ordinary families. All taxes \naffect ordinary families. There is no such thing as a corporate tax. It \nreally doesn't exist. Corporate taxes are expenses to the corporation. \nThe ladder consumers buy, the loaf of bread consumers buy, the gasoline \nconsumers buy, on anything consumers buy, consumers pay all corporate \ntaxes.\n  He talks about the possibility of taxing tobacco companies yet again \nafter the settlement. Who pays any charge to the cost of the tobacco? \nThe people who buy it, the ordinary people who use the product.\n  The major distinction has at least been reduced between the two \nbills. They both say ``if,'' ``could,'' ``maybe,'' but the principal \ndistinction is that the Senator from Oklahoma says if any of those \nfunds come from Social Security receipts, they have to be replaced by \nan across-the-board reduction, which is an incentive to reduce spending \nso that doesn't happen; and the Senator from New Jersey says there is a \nmajor incentive to reduce expenditures to keep it from happening, but \nif it does, we will raise taxes; we will take more out of everybody's \npocket. That is the principal distinction.\n  I am pleased the debate has eliminated both suggestions that anyone \nreally understands what that amount, if any, might be. I am pleased the \namendment of the Senator from New Jersey acknowledges that.\n  It boils down to two different approaches about what to do if it were \nto happen. The Senator from Oklahoma says we would have across-the-\nboard spending reduction; the Senator from New Jersey says we would \nraise taxes. He does admonish it would not be a tax that would affect \nan ordinary person. I point out that all corporate taxes are paid for \nby all consumers.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to continue to use some of the \ntime we have reserved. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 21 and a half minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I listened to our colleague from \nGeorgia with interest. He said we were not too specific about things. \nBut we are specific about one thing, and that is we do not want to \ntouch Social Security.\n  A long time ago, someone said: Touch not a hair on that old gray \nhead. I have the color hair that evokes thoughts of Social Security, \nand I am eligible to be a recipient. I know how important it is, as \ndoes everybody here. I do not want to diminish everybody else's view. \nThey all know how important it is.\n  Let's start with what is in the Nickles amendment. It says that \nCongress should eliminate any on-budget deficit by adopting an across-\nthe-board reduction in all discretionary appropriations, if necessary. \nAll discretionary appropriations --that could mean anything: Farmers' \naid, Veterans Administration, FBI, drug enforcement, Coast Guard, you \nname it. All these programs would have to suffer deep cuts under this \namendment because, according to CBO, the Senate has already approved \nlegislation that would use $19 billion of Social Security funds. And \nwe're likely to use even more Social Security funds when we conference \nwith the House, which is proposing higher spending levels, and when we \nprovide relief to hurricane victims and others suffering from genuine \nemergencies. Mr. President, before I go further, I see my colleague \nfrom Illinois on the floor. I yield 5 minutes to him, and then we will \nbe able to come back to our point.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, those who are trying to follow what is \nhappening on Capitol Hill at this moment in time should be aware of \nsome of the basics. Our calendar year for budget purposes ended on \nOctober 1. We started a new year. So, ``happy new year'' to all who are \nfollowing this debate. Unfortunately, we do not have our spending bills \npassed.\n  In fairness, neither Democrats nor Republicans have a very good \nrecord of passing these bills on time. But I think most people would \nconcede, we are at a moment in time in the history of this institution \nwhere we have never faced such chaos as we do today. There does not \nseem to be any exit strategy. People are getting too comfortable here. \nInstead of thinking about ending this session in a responsible way and \ngoing home, we are still jousting back and forth politically, and that \nis sad.\n  What is even sadder is the situation in which we find ourselves \ntoday. After all the time we spent on the budget and after all the \nsuggestions about how to resolve it, we do not have anything near a \ndialog between the President and the leaders on Capitol Hill. Some say \nthey do not want the President to come up to Capitol Hill because that \nmay not be a good environment for the debate. Some say the Republican \nleaders are afraid to go to the White House because they have had their \npockets picked there in the past. I suggested we set up folding chairs \non The Mall and let them meet there, let the whole world watch, and \nlet's see if we can bring it to a conclusion.\n  I think the American people ought to pay attention to this debate \nbecause now what we hear from the Republican\n\n[[Page S12073]]\n\nside of the aisle is that in order to exit this place, they want to \nhave an across-the-board cut in all the appropriations bills. That may \nsound eminently fair: Everybody suffers. But keep in mind, some suffer \nmore than others. When you start cutting back in programs such as Head \nStart and you have the kinds of cuts we need to balance the budget, \n43,000 children are taken out of this program where we try to get them \nready for school. How many people do you want the cut at the Federal \nBureau of Investigation? How many people do you want to cut from the \nborder guards to stop drugs from coming into the United States?\n  These are legitimate questions, and spending committees make these \ndecisions as they build their budget bills. Now, in a effort to get out \nof town, we hear from the Republican side of the aisle, ``Let's just \nhave an across-the-board cut,'' and I think that is sad. We have had \nentirely too much gimmickry in this budget debate already. At one point \nin time, one of the Republican Senators suggested we should amend, not \na bill but the calendar, not the legislative calendar but the real \ncalendar; let's create a 13th month in a year. We were going to have a \ncontest to see if we could come up with a name for it in an effort to \nat least have some bipartisan agreement. But after it did not pass the \nlaugh test, it was dropped as an idea.\n  Then last week, the Republican leaders in the House said: We'll take \nthe millions of Americans, working Americans, who get some tax relief \ncalled the earned-income tax credit, and let's just delay paying those \npeople. That was a suggestion from the House Republican leaders. That \ndid not even pass the George W. Bush compassionate conservative test. \nHe announced to his party and America: Don't do that. You have to find \na way out of this short of hurting people who are working for a living \nand struggling to get by.\n  It seems as if every week there is a new notion, the latest one being \nthis across-the-board cut. Let's try to get to the bottom line here. \nYou will hear us toss out CBO, OMB, on and on. We love to do that in \nWashington. The Congressional Budget Office comes up with some \nestimates on spending and the economy. The Office of Management and \nBudgeting does the same. Sometimes they agree; sometimes they don't. It \nis a calculated guess. But they both seem to agree at this point in \ntime that we will be borrowing money from the Social Security trust \nfund in order to bring this to a conclusion. I don't want to see that \nhappen. But it has happened for years and years and years, and this \nyear we would borrow less than we usually do. I hope we do not have to \nborrow any, when it is all said and done.\n  President Clinton came to us and said: Here are some offsets. Here \nare some things you can do that will, in fact, provide the revenue we \nneed for us to leave on time.\n  I think some of them were reasonable. Let me give you an idea. One of \nthem suggested a 50-cents-a-pack tobacco tax. I know from serving in \nthis body, my colleagues are not going to warm up to that idea. I \nsupport it. Yes, it is true, the Senator from Illinois just said he \nsupports a tax increase on tobacco products, because when the price \ngoes up, the kids stop buying them. When kids stop buying them, they \nstart weaning themselves from an addiction that can ultimately lead to \ndeath and disease--50 cents a pack, $6 to $8 billion a year, money that \ncan be spent for education, for health care, for priorities in this \ncountry. I think the President is on the right track.\n  So I sincerely hope, before we resort to cutting such things as \neducation and FBI, border guards, military personnel--personnel \nstaffing reductions--we ought to step back for a minute and see if \nthere is not some common ground left here.\n  The most amazing thing about this across-the-board cut debate is that \nthe ink is hardly dry on the Republican proposal that was offered, and \nthen thrown off the table, to give America a $792 billion tax cut. You \nmay remember it. It has only been a few weeks ago. We had so much \nmoney, we were awash in money, we were going to start giving it back in \nhuge sums. Thank goodness the American people and many leaders in \nWashington said wait a minute, take another look at it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the time to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So when the proposal was made by the Republican side for \nthe $792 billion tax cut, many people said: Wasn't it 24 months ago \nthat this Senate floor was consumed in a debate about amending the \nConstitution of the United States to pass a balanced budget amendment \nto stop the deficits once and for all, to bring discipline by the \nFederal court system imposing limitations on spending?\n\n  Yes, it was a little over 2 years ago. That is what we were talking \nabout.\n  Then the proposal came from the Republican side: We have so much \nmoney now that we can give away a massive tax cut, primarily to the \nwealthiest people in this country.\n  The idea was rejected by Alan Greenspan who has no political ax to \ngrind and wants to see the economy move forward. The idea was rejected \nby economists, as well as leaders from the President on down, and most \nimportant, it was rejected by the American people.\n  A few weeks later, the same Republican Party that had this massive \ntax cut tells us we are in desperate straits as to this year's budget, \nand we have to do across-the-board cuts in law enforcement, education, \nand health care. That tells us, frankly, the captain on the ship does \nnot know where he is headed. The captains, in these cases, are the \nleaders in the House and the Senate on the Republican side.\n  I will tell you where I think they should be heading, and I think the \nAmerican people expect this to happen. We have to end this in a \nsensible fashion. We have to make certain when it is done we meet our \nbasic obligations--obligations to kids and school, obligations to those \nwho depend on us for the very basics, obligations to Social Security to \nmake sure it is strong beyond the year 2032, and as for Medicare, \nbeyond the year 2015. These should be viable systems. That is our first \nobligation.\n  It is our obligation, as well, to provide for the basics of this \ncountry--the national defense, to make sure the men and women in \nuniform are treated humanely and they have not only good assignments \nbut are adequately compensated for the service they give to our \ncountry.\n  The list is pretty obvious and most American families would agree \nwith them, but we have not gotten the dialog underway between Democrats \nand Republicans on Capitol Hill. I sincerely hope this idea of an \nacross-the-board cut is rejected. I believe the Appropriations \nCommittee has to make priority judgments on spending. The President's \noffset package will save us some money.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I hope this happens soon. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Nebraska--\nhow much time does the Senator need, 5 minutes?\n  Mr. KERREY. Five or 6 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Five or 10. I prefer he not take the ``or''; take the \n5 or 6 minutes, please. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia and the Senator from New Jersey if I can split my time because \nthough I do support the amendment of the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey, I have an unusual argument. It may sound as if I am both for it \nand against it. I appreciate him yielding time to me.\n  It is terribly important we do save Social Security, but my \nfrustration in the entire Social Security debate is to date, what has \nhappened is the Social Security issue has prevented us from increasing \ndiscretionary spending and getting a budget that meets the needs of the \nAmerican people. It has prevented us from doing a tax cut of any kind, \nwhether it is $300 billion or $500 billion or $700 billion. It has \nprevented us from doing Medicare reform. It locked us up in a box.\n  We cannot seem to get anything done because we are not willing to fix \nSocial\n\n[[Page S12074]]\n\nSecurity. We want to have the issue, but when we get down to the \ndetails of the problem, it is not an easy problem to solve because we \nbasically--not basically--we have a liability on the table that is \nabout 33 percent larger than what current taxes will fund. That is the \nproblem.\n  For 150 million Americans under the age of 45, that means they are \ngoing to face a benefit cut of between 25 and 33 percent. Thus, the \nannouncements recently sent out by Mr. Apfel, the head of the Social \nSecurity Administration, are not accurate. He is telling people how \nmuch money they are going to get if Congress raises taxes. The last \ntime I checked, there is not a single vote in this body to raise \npayroll taxes. If that is the case, it is likely to be every \nbeneficiary under the age of 45 is going to be looking at a pretty \nsubstantial benefit cut. That is the problem we have to address.\n  There are a number of legislative proposals that have been \nintroduced, but, again, relevant to this debate, you would think \neverybody is about to fix Social Security. The lockbox does not fix \nSocial Security. All it does is use the payroll tax to pay down the \ndebt. After having used the payroll tax to keep the deficit low for 16 \nyears, we are now saying to Americans who get paid by the hour: You get \nthe pleasure of reducing all the debt.\n  For the median family of $37,000 a year, they will pay about $5,500 \nin payroll taxes versus $1,300 or $1,400 in income taxes. It is not, in \nmy view, a very fair transaction.\n  If we enact Social Security legislation, it could be a very good \ntransaction because we could do tax reduction for those families. We \ncould help them on the discretionary side helping their children go to \ncollege by doing some things as well to make certain their kids get a \ngood education in our K-12 system. There are a lot of good things that \ncould occur if we fix Social Security.\n  There are only 29 Members of Congress who have signed on to any \nspecific legislation at all. I call that to the attention of those who \nare watching this debate because, again, one would think, given all the \ninterest in Social Security, they were about to pass Social Security \nreform legislation.\n  Earlier today, the chairman of the Finance Committee had a meeting in \nwhich he was discussing the need to extend some tax provisions, the R \ntax credit most specifically, but also making some changes in the \nindividual alternative minimum tax, a very unfair and pretty heavy tax \non working families that have multiple deductions.\n  We were talking about that, and I suggested to the chairman that the \nFinance Committee take up Social Security reform; let's mark up the \nbill. There is a majority on the committee who would vote for a \nspecific piece of legislation. It is not likely we are going to.\n\n  As I see it, the Republicans are a little bit distrustful of what the \nPresident might do. The President has a proposal on the table that \ntakes $25 trillion of income taxes to extend Social Security solvency \nfor 20 years. Republicans, I believe, have correctly identified that as \na mistaken way to sort of fix Social Security.\n  I am willing to join with Republicans in that regard and hope, as we \ndebate these various proposals, that enthusiasm will grow as a \nconsequence of looking at what is happening to 150 million \nbeneficiaries who will not be eligible for another 20, 30, or 40 years. \nWhat happens to them if we do not take action? They are the ones who \nare going to pay a price. The terrible paradox about that is not only \nare they going to pay a price with delay, but the lockbox basically \nsays to them: You are going to shoulder the burden for debt reduction \nuntil we finally come to grips with this particular problem.\n  Time is not on our side. The problem does not get easier. If you \nfavor tax increases, the tax increases will be larger the longer you \nwait. If you favor cutting benefits, the benefit cuts get bigger the \nlonger you wait. If you favor, as I do and a number of us in the \nSenate, making some modest reduction in benefits but coupling that with \nincreased payments for lower-wage individuals and the establishment of \nsavings accounts that would enable individuals, in combination with a \ndefined benefit program, to actually get more than what is currently \npromised--with either one of those three proposals, the longer you \nwait, the more the beneficiaries and taxpayers are going to suffer. It \ndoes not get easier for them. It gets harder for them. It may be easier \nfor us as we head to elections, but it is not easier for the American \npeople to watch this debate get locked up over this lockbox issue, \nseeing who favors saving Social Security the most. It does not benefit \nthe American people for us not to enact legislation that will fix \nSocial Security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 17 minutes; \nthe Senator from New Jersey has 5.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from Oklahoma how much \ntime he wishes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator can give me 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, shortly, within the next 10 or 15 \nminutes, we will be voting on the Lautenberg second-degree amendment. I \nurge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment. I looked through the \namendment. Although it is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, it should be \nfactual. This is not factual. Amendment No. 1851 calls for across-the-\nboard cuts which could result in a broad-based reduction of 10 percent. \nThat is not true. There is no way in the world it can be 10 percent \nunless Congress goes on a drunken spending spree. Maybe some people \nwant to do that. We are not going to do that.\n  You can get into all kinds of discussions using CBO or using OMB.\n  Further, the amendment says we should do it without using budget \nscorekeeping gimmicks.\n  The gimmick is, we are using the administration's scorekeeping. That \nis a gimmick. Maybe it is wrong, but I have heard many people on the \nother side say OMB is more accurate than CBO. If you used all CBO \nnumbers, it would be, at most, a 5 percent reduction. So 10 percent \ndoes not even belong in this debate. Using OMB scorekeeping, you are \ntalking about 1 percent. I actually believe we will not have to.\n  I have talked to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and he \nsays we can make it. We are talking about spending $500 billion. We are \nonly $5 billion off. That is about 1 percent. We ought to be able to do \nthat.\n  The Labor-HHS bill we are debating right now has some big increases \nin some programs. Maybe we could scale back those increases just a \nlittle. NIH grows from $15 billion to $17 billion, but the President \nonly requested an increase of $300 million. Does it have to grow by $2 \nbillion?\n  Education. I have heard some of my colleagues say, oh, those \nRepublicans are cutting education. The bill has a $2.3 billion increase \nover last year and $500 million more than the President requested. \nThere is a $500 million increase in the bill that is before us dealing \nwith labor.\n  So my point is, I think we can tighten up a little bit and not have \nacross-the-board cuts. I just mentioned Labor-HHS. Maybe we could also \ndo it in defense; maybe we could do it in a couple of other areas.\n  But the way I read the Lautenberg amendment, getting around the false \nstatements that it could cut up to 10 percent, it says: ``closing \nspecial-interest tax loopholes''--that is another way of saying let's \nraise taxes--``and using other appropriate offsets.''\n  If the Senator has the votes to raise taxes, let him try to raise \ntaxes. This Congress passed a tax cut, not a tax increase. The Senator \nhad a chance to offer tax increases. They did not pass. I am just \nsaying maybe he still wants to raise taxes, but that did not happen. \nThe tax cuts were not signed into law. The President vetoed that. So we \nare not going to get tax cuts.\n  So I am saying, whatever happens, let's make sure we do not dip into \nthis money of the Social Security surplus. We are saying 100 percent of \nthat should be used to pay down the national debt--100 percent of it. \nWe should not be raiding that money to spend on all these other \nappropriations bills. That is what I am saying.\n\n[[Page S12075]]\n\n  I look at the substitute offered by my friend and colleague from New \nJersey that says: Hey, let's raise taxes; let's use other appropriate \noffsets. I do not know what they are. If he has ``other appropriate \noffsets,'' offer them.\n  I want to help work with my colleagues to make sure we don't take \nmoney out of the Social Security fund. I am willing to do it. We have \nbills on the floor now where we can do it.\n  Maybe we should have other offsets for the Labor-HHS bill. Maybe we \nshould have other offsets for other appropriations bills. But if we try \nto put them all together, let's make sure we do not dip into Social \nSecurity money. Let's not do that. We should not do it.\n  I think this amendment by my colleague from New Jersey says: Well, \ninstead of any cuts in spending, let's raise taxes. I think that would \nbe a mistake. I do not think the votes are there to do it. I do not \nthink it will happen in this Congress.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Lautenberg amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want to make some brief observations in \nreference to the debate on the Lautenberg amendment to the Labor/Health \nand Human Services/Education Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000. \nThe Senator from New Jersey suggests that there is an aversion to \nidentifying and addressing tax loopholes. I would point out that in the \nFinance Committee we have worked in a bipartisan manner to identify and \naddress areas of our tax code which are viewed as candidates for \nchange. These measures have raised tens of billions in revenue over the \nlast few years. Some examples in this area include action the committee \ntook to effect the tax treatment of corporate owned life insurance \n(COLI), liquidating REITs and tax shelter registration requirements.\n  Indeed, we are required to consistently look for avenues where we can \nadjust our tax code to enact change going forward. We are faced with \njust such a situation right now in crafting our so called extender \nbill. The items we are seeking to go forward with include permanently \nshielding individuals from the alternative minimum tax--an important \nitem to ensure that our families are able to take advantage of measures \ndesigned to advance their education and child care needs. We are \nlooking to create job opportunities with the extension of the work \nopportunity tax credit, the R tax credit and the welfare to work tax \ncredit and to enable working men and women to continue their education \nboth at the undergraduate and graduate level through the employer \nprovided education assistance program. In the environmental area we are \nlooking to continue provisions which enable communities and businesses \nto address brownfields. I would point out that millions of people \nbenefit from these provisions.\n  I believe it is possible to craft legislation which will provide for \nprograms which have been identified as priorities--health care for our \nveterans, education, aid for our farmers, environmental programs and \nhealth research. We have worked in the Finance Committee to advance \nthese priorities as well and will continue to do so going forward in a \nbipartisan manner.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask if the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania wants to use any of the time available on that side \nat this time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I intend to make comments for a few \nminutes, and then I will be prepared to yield back the remainder of our \ntime so we can proceed to a vote, if the Senator from New Jersey is \nprepared to do the same.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will use just a couple minutes to \nrespond, and then we will have finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I listened very carefully. One of the things that \nsometimes the public does not understand is, we can disagree on things \nbecause it is an honest view of what is taking place. Perhaps our \nfriends on the Republican side would see things one way and we on this \nside see them another way. But when we talk about OMB and CBO, these \nare rather arcane acronyms for the public at large. We work with them \nall the time. They are arcane for us.\n  But OMB is something that usually is thought to represent the White \nHouse view, the administration view, on calculating where we are, our \nbudget--how much we are spending and how much we are taking in. So I \nguess it is easy to say that those of us who are on the same party side \nas the White House want to pay attention to what OMB says and those who \nrepresent the majority in the legislature--the House and the Senate--\nwant to rely exclusively on CBO--except when it is convenient. This \ndifference is what we are seeing now in talking about whether or not we \nuse OMB scoring.\n  Our distinguished colleague from Oklahoma said: Well, we want to use \nsome of the scoring the President uses, from OMB. But, Mr. President, \nthey only want to use OMB scoring selectively--only when OMB's numbers \nmake it appear that they are using less of the Social Security surplus.\n  In court, you are not allowed to do that. I am not a lawyer, but I \nknow lawyers can't pick and choose from the laws of various states when \nthey present their cases, and use only those laws most favorable to \ntheir clients. They have to live under the rules of their jurisdiction.\n  But here in the Congress, the Republican majority wants to use CBO \nscoring when it suits their purposes, and OMB scoring when it doesn't.\n  For example, the majority is using CBO's estimate of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus. That's because CBO is projecting a $14 billion non-\nSocial Security surplus, whereas OMB's estimate is much lower--$6 \nbillion.\n  But then when it comes to scoring the defense appropriations bill, \nall of a sudden the majority wants to use OMB numbers.\n  In other words, they are using two sets of books.\n  Mr. President, there may be rare occasions when the majority will \ntruly believe that CBO has erred in their scoring. But that is not what \nis going on here. This ``directed scoring'' is not based on the merits. \nThe Republicans are simply trying to make it appear that they are \nspending less than they really are. And that they are using less Social \nSecurity surpluses than they actually are.\n  I also would point out that when the Senator from Oklahoma says, \nwell, they want to raise taxes, let me remind the Senator that when the \ntax bill was sent to the President, it had $5.5 billion over 10 years \nof tax increases. So the Republicans themselves have admitted that \nthere are legitimate savings to be had from closing loopholes. But \napparently now their position is that there is not a single loophole to \nbe closed in the tax code. Or at least that we should not close any \nloopholes before we cut education and defense first.\n  I say, let's take a look at the tobacco industry. Let's try to \nrecover some of the expenses they force us to incur. Let's see if we \ncan't get back the $20 billion a year it costs taxpayers to treat \ntobacco-related diseases. That by itself would essentially solve our \nbudget problem and allow us to avoid dipping into the Social Security \ntrust fund.\n\n  Mr. President, if there is any time left, I yield it back and hope \nour colleagues will support this sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from New Jersey would yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are only 8 seconds remaining of the time \nof the Senator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the 8 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am interested in the comment by the \nSenator from New Jersey about ``he is not a lawyer, but'' with respect \nto what has been offered on the floor of the Senate. I would suggest \nthat if the Presiding Officer were a judge and was looking for \ncompetent evidence, evidence that had a factual basis, the speeches \nwould be much shorter in this Chamber.\n  One of the things I have been impressed with over the years is the \ndifference in the kinds of assertions--on both sides of the aisle. I am \nnot referring to anything the distinguished Senator from New Jersey has \nsaid. But when he talks about the authenticity of representations of \nfact, this body takes extraordinary liberty in what is represented as \nfact. When it comes to the numbers, my preference would be--and I know \nthe Senator from New Jersey did not use the expression ``lying\n\n[[Page S12076]]\n\nabout the numbers,'' it is some budget expert--but I do not think a \ncomment about lying, suggesting untruthfulness, is very helpful.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a comment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. In my opening comments, I said that we viewed things \ndifferently. There was no suggestion of lying or dishonesty. I \ndisplayed this because that is what was said by a bunch of experts. I \nwas careful not to accuse any of my colleagues of acting unethically.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from New Jersey for that. I walked \nin a little late and hadn't heard him say that. Maybe he repeated it. I \nrespect the comment that there are different views. But to have a chart \nabout lying, when the matters are subject to widespread disagreements \nas to how you calculate numbers, I would be very critical of budget \nexpert Stan Collender--not critical of Senator Lautenberg--for using \nthe expression ``lying.'' I don't think that advances the ball very \nmuch.\n  I agree with a great deal of what is in the Lautenberg amendment. I \nagree we ought not cut Head Start, education, VA hospitals, border \npatrols, transportation, environmental funding, defense funding. I \nthink that is exactly right. But when the Senator from New Jersey comes \ndown to the sense of the Senate and says we should avoid using budget \nscorekeeping gimmicks, close special interest tax loopholes, and use \nother appropriate methods, starting with the budget loopholes--the \nPresident's budget had more than $20 billion of advance funding. \nAdvance funding, regrettably, has become a commonplace practice that \nhas been engaged in on all sides. I think the precedent and the custom \nare used generally and not subject to criticism from someone who uses \nthem.\n  When the President submits a budget with a tax increase of 55 cents a \npack on cigarettes resulting in revenues of $6.5 billion, I might \nsupport that kind of a tax increase, but it is not money in the bank. \nIt is pie in the sky. It is not even Confederate money. It doesn't \nexist anywhere. So when the President includes that in his budget, that \nis hardly a subject to criticize Republicans on grounds of gimmickry.\n  When the advance funding is accepted that the President uses, and the \nRepublicans have used it, too, but you can't have a tax increase to pay \nfor discretionary programs under the Balanced Budget Act. I don't know \nif that is a very good provision, but I do know it is the law. I do \nknow it is a law the President signed. So when the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution calls for eliminating gimmicks and you have that approach--I \nwon't call it gimmickry; why disparage the administration; just call it \n``that approach''--it hardly is valid.\n  Then the final line on the amendment by the Senator from New Jersey \nis ``and by using other appropriate offsets.'' I am all for appropriate \noffsets, but what are they? Where are they?\n  I think what we have to do--and we are still struggling on this--is \nto bring our appropriations bills within the caps, not to cut Social \nSecurity. I agree totally with the Senator from New Jersey on not \ntouching Social Security. I think that is an accepted conclusion on all \nsides.\n  We are struggling with this bill, and we have a lot of amendments yet \nto be offered. This is a very massive bill, $91.7 billion. This bill \nwas crafted in the subcommittee, the full committee, to take the \nmaximum load that could be borne on this side of the aisle. I may be \nwrong about that. My distinguished colleague from Oklahoma raises some \nsignificant questions with me about the propriety of that amount of \nmoney.\n  Well, we have to really, my metaphor is, run between the raindrops in \na hurricane to find a bill which shall be passed by this body and go to \nconference with the House and can be signed by the President. I had \noccasion to have a word or two with the President about this bill last \nnight, when we were talking about the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. \nThe President doesn't like the bill because it takes out a lot of his \nprograms.\n\n  The Constitution gives some authority to the Congress on \nappropriations--a little more expressed, explicit authority to the \nCongress than to the President, although the President has to sign the \nbills, but we do have some standing. So when we disagree with some of \nthe priorities and have added $2.3 billion to education and are $500 \nmillion more than the President, we are trying to fit this bill within \nthe budget constraints and within the caps which we have.\n  While we have dueling sense-of-the-Senate resolutions, I intend to \nvote against the resolution offered by the Senator from New Jersey. I \nvoted for the resolution offered by the Senator from Oklahoma. I think, \nin all candor, that neither of these resolutions advances this bill a \nwhole lot. What we have to deal with on this bill are the hard dollars \nand the specific programs. In the interest of moving the bill ahead, I \nwill inquire how much time I have remaining in anticipation of yielding \nit back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 43 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time. I know if we \nare not out of time, we are just about out of time. I will take a few \nminutes of my leader time to talk about this amendment.\n  I rise in strong support of the amendment. I do so in large measure \nbecause I believe it reflects the approach that represents the only way \nwe are ever going to bring about a consensus on spending and the budget \nbefore the end of this year.\n  I don't have it at this moment--I have asked my staff to bring it--\nbut the chairman of the appropriations committees in both the House and \nthe Senate have expressed themselves publicly about the impropriety of \nacross-the-board cuts. They have said it is the easy way; it is not the \nmost appropriate way.\n  Indiscriminate cuts have never been the right way to approach deficit \nreduction, but these indiscriminate cuts are not the only way our \nRepublican colleagues have suggested we go about meeting our budget \nobjectives in the past. They have used a number of devices. Some of \nthem have been the subject of a good deal of discussion in recent days.\n  George W. Bush has noted how inappropriate it is to use the EITC, and \nthey appear to have backed away from using the tax credit available to \nworking families. They have suggested accelerating the timing of the \nspectrum auction by $2.6 billion. They have suggested using two sets of \nbooks, one by and for congressional Republicans and one by the CBO. \nThey have suggested declaring LIHEAP an emergency, the Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program. They have suggested declaring the year 2000 \ncensus as an emergency. They have suggested that we raid the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill. None of these have worked. Now we find our \nRepublican colleagues suggesting maybe just an across-the-board, \nindiscriminate cut.\n  We made some very difficult decisions with regard to defense earlier \nthis year. We made the decision to provide them a pay raise for the \nfirst time in some time. Yet it appears our Republican colleagues are \nnow prepared to go back and cut that pay raise and cut the other \nportions of the defense budget as well. We estimate that if you are \ngoing to pay for everything Republicans suggest with across-the-board \ncuts, a 3 percent cut won't do; the cut required is closer to 10 \npercent. That is what the Office of Management and Budget says.\n  So if we cut defense by 10 percent, if we cut all the programs \nassociated with disaster and agriculture by 10 percent, if we cut \neducation by 10 percent, I wonder whether our colleagues want to do \nthat. Yet that seems to be where they have relegated themselves, given \nthe fact that none of their other budget gimmicks have worked. You \ncan't accelerate spending. You can't turn the EITC program into an ATM \nmachine.\n  You can't use many of the approaches that have been previously \nproposed by our Republican colleagues. They now know that. However, as \nI said, congressional Republicans didn't figure this out until after we \nwitnessed the unusual occurrence where they were criticized by one of \ntheir Presidential candidates. They will soon find out that across-the-\nboard spending cuts will not work either.\n\n[[Page S12077]]\n\n  What works is what the senior Senator from New Jersey is now \nsuggesting. What works is that we demonstrate some real leadership and \nfind the offsets necessary to pay for these programs, or find the cuts \nthat may be required to pay for these spending bills--not \nindiscriminately, but by making some tough choices. That is what we are \nsuggesting. We are going to have to make tough choices in cuts or in \noffsets, but we have to make the tough choices together--Republicans \nand Democrats negotiating how to resolve this. We resolved it last \nyear. That is how we should do it this year. In many cases, we have \nbeen locked out of the deliberations. Up until now, we haven't been \ninvolved in some of the conference committee deliberations.\n  So I hope everybody realizes that in the end, if we are going to \nsolve this problem, we have to do it in the way the senior Senator from \nNew Jersey is suggesting. Let's solve it by showing some leadership, \nlet's solve it by working together, let's solve it in the age-old \ntraditional way of sitting down and finding the cuts and the offsets \nrequired to pay for the commitments we are making in the budget this \nyear.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from North Dakota for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if a lot of this debate isn't \nabout some here running for cover on the Social Security issue.\n  Isn't it the case that several years ago, we had a very substantial \ndebate about amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget? \nIsn't it true the author of the previous amendment and others were \ndemanding on the floor of the Senate that we write into the \nConstitution the proposition that Social Security revenues ought to be \nable to be used to pay for other programs in order to claim a balanced \nbudget? Isn't that the case?\n  If that is the case, how do they come to us now and say we don't want \nto use Social Security moneys for the operating budget when, in fact, \nthey wanted to put it in the Constitution 3 years ago?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from North Dakota makes a very interesting \npoint. We had that debate and we had some votes back then. I think the \nSenator from North Dakota and the Senator from Nevada were the prime \nsponsors of the amendment that said you cannot use Social Security \ntrust funds for the purposes of general revenues in calculating a \nbalanced budget. I think we lost that amendment fight on a party-line \nvote. And now, in the last couple weeks, the CBO has already said: \nLook, Republicans are now acting in a manner consistent with their \nvotes on this constitutional amendment. We now know that, according to \nCBO, they have already used $18 billion. Those aren't our numbers, \nthose are CBO numbers. They have already done that. But that is the way \nthey voted 3 or 4 years ago when we had that constitutional amendment \ndebate--to use Social Security trust funds for the purposes of general \nrevenues, for the purposes of meeting whatever obligations there may \nbe. So they are consistent.\n  But I don't think anybody ought to be misled. Now there is some talk \nabout, well, we ought to use across-the-board cuts. They know across-\nthe-board cuts involve deep cuts in defense, in education, in \ncommitments to the environment, and in disaster and emergency \nassistance. They know that isn't going to happen. The only way it is \ngoing to happen is to do what is now on the table. This ought to be a \n100-0 vote. Every Republican and Democrat ought to be supporting this \namendment because it is the only way we are going to resolve this \nimpasse. The sooner we recognize that, the better.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts for a question \nbefore I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In listening to the Senator's explanation of his \nunderstanding of what the underlying issue was, and also the Lautenberg \nproposal, did the 1 percent underlying proposal consider tax \nexpenditures? We have about $4 trillion in tax expenditures. The 1 \npercent, as I understand it, doesn't take into consideration a review \nof tax expenditures, where we might be able to find places where we \ncould tighten the belt on some of these tax expenditures, and we would \nnot need these kinds of offsets in the areas of education or health. I \nwonder whether the Senator's understanding of the 1-percent cut would \ninclude a review of tax expenditures.\n  We have seen some important cutbacks in terms of freezes in various \nexpenditure programs, and we have seen some cutbacks in various \nprograms in the period of the last few years in some important areas of \neducation and health, but we haven't had a real review of these tax \nexpenditures. I wonder whether the Senator--as we come down to this \nperiod of time--thinks that issue might be at least something we ought \nto consider or debate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts makes a very important \npoint. Not $1 of tax expenditures are on the table in their proposal. \nWhat they are suggesting is that we cut education first, that we cut \ndisaster assistance first, that we cut LIHEAP first, that we cut \ndefense first; and only after we have done all of that, I suppose they \nwould assume we might look at tax expenditures. But there is not a word \nabout looking at the $4 trillion of possibilities in the tax \nexpenditure category before we look at cutting education for children, \nbefore we look at cutting Head Start, before we look at cutting \nafterschool programs, before we look at cutting title I and funding for \ndisadvantaged children. All of those cuts are on the table but not $1 \nin tax expenditures. So the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely \ncorrect.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, does the Senator not agree with me that we have \nseen a comprehensive review of these various programs, as we should, to \nfind out how effective the programs are? These programs that we \nauthorize and appropriate money for have been watched carefully in the \npast several years. But I don't know of a single hearing that has been \nheld in the Senate of the United States to have a similar kind of \nreview of tax expenditures, to find out whether there are \ninefficiencies and waste, or whether they are accomplishing what the \npublic purpose and goal was when they were devised. There very well may \nbe an opportunity to squeeze some resources out of tax expenditures so \nwe don't have to cut education and health and home heating oil. Does \nthe Senator think that ought to be part of this debate and discussion \nas we talk about the questions of funding these critical programs?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I may respond, the irony is that the only tax matter \nthat has been on the table for our Republican colleagues has been the \nearned-income tax credit, the tax credit affecting working families who \nare trying to get off welfare, who are trying to ensure that they pay \ntheir bills on time, who appreciate the importance of having that \nlittle help in April of every year. In fact, our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, and on the other side of the Capitol, made the \npoint last week that these families need some help in managing.\n  Well, I have heard, ``I am from the Government and I am here to help \nyou'' in a lot of different ways, but this is a new chapter. There is \nno way we are going to help working families manage their money better \nby taking away the one financial tool they have in the Tax Code. That \ndoesn't help them. It is a charade that even George W. Bush fully \nunderstood and appreciated and spoke out on.\n  I think the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. That \nought to be a consideration as well. We ought to be looking at $4 \ntrillion in possibilities there, at least prior to the time we commit \nto cut the first dollar of education, the first dollar of health care \nfor children, or the first dollar of Armed Forces personnel stationed \nabroad. That, it seems to me, would be the prudent approach.\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from South \nDakota talked about tax expenditures. Is that the same thing some of us \nrefer to as ``corporate loopholes,'' ``corporate welfare,'' and ``tax \nloopholes\"?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is what I am talking about. Obviously, when we talk \nabout tax expenditures, people sometimes wonder what reference that is. \nIn many cases, we are talking about loopholes. In fact, it is \ninteresting that our Republican colleagues, in order to pay for the \nhuge tax cut they had proposed\n\n[[Page S12078]]\n\nearlier this year--which ended up going nowhere--used corporate \nloophole closures as a way to pay for part of it. So even they have \nacknowledged on occasion that these corporate loophole closures are \nsomething we should be looking at; not in this case, however. In this \ncase, they are proposing that we cut education first, that we cut \nhealth care first, and then we look at other things, perhaps--although \nit isn't addressed in this proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an \nadditional amount of time be granted to this side equal to the time \nused in excess of the leader's allotted time. I first make an inquiry \nas to how much in excess of the leader's allotted time was just used.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry. Reserving the right to object, how \nmuch time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A total of 20 minutes was used.\n  Mr. REID. Is there a request pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a request pending.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Parliamentary question: Is there not time usually \nreserved as leader time and as time allocated outside of debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is time reserved for the two leaders.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had inquired of the Parliamentarian how \nmuch time was being used when it was up to 17 minutes. I was informed \nthat the Parliamentarian never interrupts the leader when the time is \nin excess. I didn't want to break with that custom. But it seemed to \nme, as a matter of comity and fairness, that if excess time was being \nused, there ought to be that much additional time on this side. But I \nunderstand the rules. If there is objection to that, so be it.\n  How much more time is left on this side of the aisle?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the arguments \nby the Senator from South Dakota. When he talks about Democrats being \nlocked out, certainly he isn't talking about this bill. The ranking \nmember and I worked on this bill in a collaborative partnership. I \ndon't know if he is referring to other bills or just this bill, but \nthere was no lock out here. When the Senator from South Dakota objects \nto across-the-board cuts and says--may we have order, Mr. President--\nthat we ought to take a look at matters one by one and make the tough \nchoices, we ought to have the offsets, I would certainly be in favor of \nthat.\n  If the Senator from New Jersey had made specific requests on offsets, \nI would have been glad to vote on them one by one instead of saying \n``other appropriate offsets.'' If he had identified special interest \ntax loopholes, I would have been prepared to vote on those one by one \ninstead of the generalization. But I think it is worth noting that on \nthis bill nobody on that side of the aisle has made any suggestion for \nany offset--not at all.\n  We added to block grants $900 million by an amendment from the \nSenator from Florida. We had $900 million offered from day care and \nadded to the bill by the Senator from Connecticut. We had $200 million \noffered but rejected by the Senator from California for afterschool; \n$200 million offered but rejected on class size by the Senator from \nWashington. We have amendments pending now by the Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Wellstone, $3 billion for disadvantaged education; $3 \nbillion for Head Start. Other amendments, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, $200 million on one; the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nBingaman, $200 million on another.\n  I think those are all very worthwhile programs. But it hardly lies in \nthe mouth of those on the other side of the aisle to talk about hard \ndecisions of offsets when they don't talk about any offsets and they \ndon't talk about any hard decisions. They don't talk about specifics.\n  I don't like across-the-board cuts, either. I have said so. I don't \nthink we are going to have across-the-board cuts. I think that is the \nsword of Damocles which is hanging over this appropriations process to \nkeep us within the caps. But we have hardly heard of any offsets or any \ntough decisions on the other side of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will make a couple of comments, and \nthen we will vote.\n  For the information of all of our colleagues, we will have a vote \nmomentarily on the Lautenberg amendment, or at least in relationship to \nthe Lautenberg amendment.\n  I have heard: Well, if you follow the amendment that has already \npassed, we will have to have a 10-percent reduction.\n  I want to say categorically that is false, and people shouldn't try \nto mislead people. What we are saying is we should not be taking money \nout of Social Security trust funds to spend it on a bunch of other \nprograms. We should show some discipline. I absolutely don't want \nacross-the-board cuts. I want to make those cuts. I want us to live \nwithin the numbers necessary so we don't touch Social Security. That is \n$14 billion more than the caps. All right. We will go up to that \namount, but not more than that amount. We need some limit.\n  This bill has been growing like crazy. The Labor-HHS bill, as Senator \nSpecter mentioned, the bill that he reported out of committee, had \nsignificant growth; it had more money than the President requested for \neducation. Somebody said: Well, if we adopt the last amendment, which \nis already adopted, and we followed that, we would have cuts in \neducation.\n  We would have maybe 1 percent. But guess what. The education bill \nwent up by $2.3 billion. You could have a 1-percent reduction in that \nand still spend more than the President requested.\n  The Labor-HHS bill over the year has been growing like crazy. In \n1996, it was $63.4 billion; in 1997, it was $71 billion; in 1998, it \nwas $80.7 billion. The bill we have before us is $84.4 billion. As \nSenator Specter mentioned, we already have amendments adding a couple \nof billion dollars on top of that. We defeated amendments to try to add \na couple billion dollars more.\n  There is a whole slew of amendments to spend billions more as if \nthere is no budget, as if there is no restraint whatsoever. And \nSenators are saying, wait a minute, you really are spending Social \nSecurity surpluses, and we shouldn't be doing that. We said we are not \ngoing to do it. We passed a resolution that says if it is necessary, we \nwill have across-the-board cuts. We don't want to touch Social \nSecurity. Yet we have amendment after amendment saying let's spend \nmore. Many of us reject that.\n  I yield the remainder of our time.\n  I move to table the Lautenberg amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 2267. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 54, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 314 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n\n[[Page S12079]]\n\n\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \nunderlying amendment No. 1851.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the motion of the \nSenator from Oklahoma?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. On our sequencing, we are now ready for an amendment \nfrom the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy. He and I have had an \ninformal discussion on a unanimous consent request to not have any \nsecond-degree amendments, to vote on or in relation to the Kennedy \namendment after 30 minutes equally divided. And I supplement that with \nno second-degree amendments prior to the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I do not object to doing \nhalf an hour. I am instructed by the leadership on our side that they \nnot start a vote until 4:15. But I can wind up if you want to start on \na second.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is my intention to stack the votes, to take them up \nlater today, so there will be no vote before 4:15.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, was the request for a \ntime agreement on the Kennedy amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania still has the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I renew my unanimous consent request to have 30 minutes \nequally divided, no vote before 4:15, no second-degree amendments, and \na tabling motion on or in relation to the Kennedy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2268\n\n                    (Purpose: To protect education)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I \nunderstand, therefore, that not withstanding other previous agreements \nin regard to first-degree amendments, this would qualify as a first-\ndegree amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2268.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       In order to improve the quality of education funds \n     available for education, including funds for Title 1, the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Pell Grants \n     shall be excluded from any across-the-board reduction.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. Simply stated, this \namendment says:\n\n       In order to improve the quality of education, funds \n     available for education * * *\n\n  And then it says, such as:\n\n       Title I, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     [IDEA] and Pell Grants shall be excluded from any across-the-\n     board reduction.\n\n  Just a few minutes ago, we were having a debate on the floor of the \nSenate on the questions about overall general reductions in the budget \nwhich would have affected these education programs. We had a brief \ndebate on alternative ways in order to try to deal with some of the \nbudgetary considerations and constraints.\n  During that discussion and debate, I asked whether we had actually \neven given consideration to trying to find additional kinds of funding \nby closing some of the tax expenditures which are generally understood \nas tax loopholes. We did not receive any assurances on that. Really, as \na result of that debate, as we are moving on through this whole \nappropriation bill, and in anticipation there may be another \nopportunity or another occasion where Senators will come forward and \nask for a reduction in the funding levels across the board, this \namendment just excludes the education programs.\n  We can ask why we ought to exclude education programs. Why not other \nprograms? We could have some debate and discussion on that issue. But \nthe principal reason for excluding these programs is because over the \nperiod of recent years, we have seen a series of reductions in \neducation programs as a result of House and Senate Appropriations \nCommittee action.\n  Going back to 1995, we had a House bill--this is just after the \nRepublicans had gained control of the House and Senate--that actually \nrequested rescission of $1.7 billion. Then the House bill in 1996 was \n$3.9 billion below 1995; in 1997, $3.1 billion below the President's \nrequest; in 1998, $200 million below the President's request; in 1999, \n$2 billion below the President's request.\n  We know this appropriation bill that has been reported out by the \nAppropriations Committee is in excess in total numbers of what the \nPresident requested. We also know it is on its way to the House of \nRepresentatives for negotiation.\n  The purpose of this amendment is, no matter what we are going to do \nin terms of other kinds of activities to reduce funding of various \nprovisions of the legislation, we are not going to reduce funding in \nthe area of education. That is basically the reason for this amendment. \nWe know that the title I program works; the Pell program works; IDEA \nworks; the other education programs work. We have had good debates on \nthose measures over the past months. It is very important that we \nunderstand that.\n  We are now experiencing a significant increase in the total number of \nstudents who are going to be involved in K through 12 education. We \nwill see 500,000 students this coming year attending our schools, an \nall-time high. We know we will need 2.2 million teachers over the next \n10 years, and we are getting further behind, hiring only about 100,000 \nteachers a year. Even with the current efforts we have made in \nrecruitment we are still falling further and further behind.\n  We are also finding that more young families and needy families are \nable to get their children through college. One of the most interesting \ndevelopments that has taken place in this last year is, we have the \nbest repayment of student loans in over 10 years. This means that young \npeople who are going to post-secondary education are taking advantage \nof the federal loan programs, and are repaying those loans. This is a \nvery important and significant indication that there is a great need \nfor these federal loans, and that young people across this country are \ndemonstrating a responsible attitude by repaying those loans on time.\n  I had raised the question earlier of whether we should not fully fund \nthese important education programs, and other health care measures, \nchild care measures and the community service block grant--I yield \nmyself 3 more minutes. I have asked if we couldn't find some reductions \nin terms of tax expenditures to find that funding.\n  Only a few months ago, under the Republican tax bill, they \neffectively found $5.5 billion over 10 years in their legislation. All \nwe are saying is, if you can find $5.5 billion over 10 years, you can \ncertainly find enough now to protect the programs dealing with \neducation, dealing with health care, dealing with the LIHEAP program \nand some of these other nutrition programs. These are programs which \nare a\n\n[[Page S12080]]\n\nlifeline to the neediest people in our society. That is what we are \nresisting. We are resisting this wholesale way of trying to diminish \nthe continued commitment and responsibility we have to the neediest \nchildren and to the neediest workers and the neediest parents in our \nsociety. That is what brings us to the floor of the Senate today.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Iowa. How much time do I have, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Eight minutes 41 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes 30 seconds to the Senator from Iowa \nand the other 4 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding me this time. I \ncompliment him on this amendment.\n  There is all this talk going around about across-the-board cuts. We \njust had the amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma which he \nwithdrew. As you can see, there is some sentiment on the other side of \nthe aisle to have some across-the-board cuts. Again, we have tried to \nresist those because, as the Senator from Massachusetts said so \neloquently, there are a lot of people out there who could be \ndrastically hurt--low-income people, needy people, seniors, veterans, \nand others.\n  What this amendment addresses is the education end of it. Both sides \nof the aisle have said time and time again that education is our No. 1 \npriority. The leader said that earlier this year. Both sides have been \nsaying education is our No. 1 priority. What this amendment basically \nsays is, as I understand it, if there is going to be any across-the-\nboard cut--and there shouldn't be because we have plenty of offsets; we \ndon't need an across-the-board cut--if there is an across-the-board \ncut, we will exempt education, only education, including IDEA, the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, title I, and Pell grants.\n  What the Nickles amendment would have done--again, it is sort of \nrolling around out there about an across-the-board cut--CBO said the \nNickles amendment would translate into a 5. 5-percent cut. For title I, \nthat would be a $380 million cut. OMB said it would be as much as a 10-\npercent cut. That would be $800 million. So somewhere between a $380 \nand a $800 million cut in title I. Afterschool programs would be cut \n$20 to $40 million; ed technology, $35 to $70 million; and special \neducation would be cut from $300 to $600 million, if, in fact we had an \nacross-the-board cut.\n  Again, I urge Senators to vote for this amendment because it will \nsend a signal, loudly and clearly, that if there are any across-the-\nboard cuts, we are not going to take it out of education. We understand \nthat education is our No. 1 priority. We understand we have to invest \nin education. The last thing we want to be included in any kind of \nacross-the-board cut would be any cuts in education.\n  I compliment the Senator from Massachusetts. This is a great \namendment. This ought to receive a 100-0 vote to protect education from \nany across-the-board cuts.\n  I yield back whatever time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois had been yielded 4 \nminutes. Does the Senator from Oklahoma wish to speak at this time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, two or three comments are in order.\n  Some people are still debating the amendment to which we have already \nagreed. I withdrew it. It was a sense of the Senate, a sense of the \nSenate which said we shouldn't be raiding Social Security funds. I \ndon't think we should be raiding Social Security funds for education or \nfor defense or for other issues. We have a lot of money. Defense is \ngoing up by $17 billion. Education alone is going up by $2.3 billion, \neven more than the President requested. As I stated before, if you do \nhave an across-the-board cut, it is only 1 percent. And if you cut 1 \npercent off that 37.3, you are talking about $370 million off an \nincrease that is $2.3 billion. So you still have an increase of $2 \nbillion in education alone.\n  People are entitled to their own interpretation. They are not \nentitled to their own facts. Education has grown dramatically. The \nentire Labor-HHS bill, on which I have already quoted the figures, has \ngrown from--I don't have it right in front of me--about $50 billion a \nfew years ago to about $90 billion today.\n  So when I see charts: ``Republicans slashing education,'' it is just \nabsolutely false. We have more money in this bill than the President \nrequested. And even if you have a 1-percent reduction--and I hope we \ndon't; I have said this time and time again; I hope we don't have an \nacross-the-board reduction--I hope the appropriators will work with \neverybody to stay within the limit to which we agreed, which actually, \nso everybody will know, is $592 billion, and if we do that, we won't be \ntouching Social Security. That is what we ought to do.\n  You can fund an increase in education, an increase in NIH, an \nincrease in defense, an increase in HUD, an increase in veterans, and \nstill not raid Social Security. That is what we are trying to do.\n  Just for the information of my colleagues, I withdrew the amendment. \nI don't believe the Senator's amendment is in order. I don't know how \nyou amend something that is not underlying. I make that point and yield \nthe floor at this time.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, if he wishes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator may go first.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nraising this issue. In reply to my colleague, the Senator from \nOklahoma, I believe the Senator from Massachusetts is making it clear, \nnow that we know that lurking at least in the backs of the minds of \nmany of the Republican leaders is the idea of an across-the-board cut, \nto somehow develop an exit strategy, the Senator from Massachusetts \nreminds us that across-the-board cuts means a cut in education.\n  Let me give you some specifics, if I might. When I look at the \ncommittee report from this education funding bill, I see that if the \n5.5-percent cut that is envisioned by some of the Republican leaders is \nput into place, we will reduce the amount of money for title I, the \nmajor Federal educational program for disadvantaged children, to below \nlast year's level of funding. So those who say this is a harmless cut \nthat will never be noticed are not portraying this accurately, I'm \nafraid.\n  I am prepared to discuss the facts with the Senator from Oklahoma, \nand the facts, unfortunately, lead to the conclusion that if we take \nhis across-the-board cut strategy, we are going to cut educational \nfunding below last year's level of spending. In so doing, whom do we \njeopardize? Title I, of course, sounds pretty general and pretty \nbureaucratic, but this program is critically important for 11 million \nkids across America. Who are these kids? These are the kids most likely \nto drop out of school; these are the kids most likely to need special \nhelp to stay up with their classes and not fall behind; these are the \nkids who need that extra tutor for reading so they don't get behind the \nclass, get discouraged, and drop out of school or, frankly, become a \nproblem in the classroom. That is what title I is about. That is the \nprogram that would be cut by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  It is not the only program. The Congressional Budget Office says that \nthe 5.5-percent across-the-board cut that is envisioned by some \nRepublican leaders will cut many other programs as well: $26 million \nfrom the COPS Program, a program to put more police on the street and \nin communities, which is bringing down crime in America. Is there a \nhigher priority? I don't think there is in my State of Illinois. The \nHead Start Program, from which millions of kids from poor families get \na helping hand before they start kindergarten so they can succeed, we \nwould see $290 million cut from that program by this idea of an across-\nthe-board cut. National Institutes of Health: Of all of the progress we \nhave made in improving Federal funding for medical research, we would \ncut $967 million out of the progress and research into diseases and \nproblems facing American families. I think that is a serious mistake.\n\n[[Page S12081]]\n\n Title I education grants, a $380 million cut.\n  Let me tell you some of the other cuts in education effected by this \nRepublican strategy of across-the-board cuts. Afterschool programs: All \nof us stood on this floor in horror over what happened at Columbine \nHigh School in Littleton, CO. We knew something went wrong in a very \ngood school. Children lost their lives. We said: What is it that we \nneed to do to protect our kids in school and to make sure fewer kids \ngo astray? We were told by the experts time and time again that we need \ncounselors at the schools to seek out troubled kids, and we need \nprograms at the schools so kids can use their time effectively.\n\n  An across-the-board cut would reduce the amount of money available to \nAmerican schools for afterschool programs. By reducing that amount of \nmoney, it is just going to lessen our opportunity to reach out to kids \nwho need something constructive to do in a supervised environment after \nschool. So when my friends on the Republican side say that the easy way \nout, the painless way, is an across-the-board cut, they don't want to \nface reality. Those cuts will touch people who need a helping hand. \nThey are going to touch kids who might drop out of school. They are \ngoing to cut afterschool programs. They are going to cut the kind of \ntutoring we need to make sure that kids succeed.\n  In this day and time, at this time in our history, with the \nprosperity of the American economy, with the strength of this budget \nand of our budget process, have we reached a point where we have no \nrecourse but to cut the most basic program for America--education? I \nthink not. The President has come up with a list of offsets that will \npreserve the Social Security trust fund and still keep our budget in \nbalance. I urge this Senate to adopt the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the anticipation is that we are not going \nto have across-the-board cuts because the totality of the appropriated \nbills will come within the caps. Senator Stevens was on the floor and \nwe were discussing the last amendment. That continues to be the \nreassurance from the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I can \npersonally vouch for the fact that we are striving mightily on a \nconglomerate of 13 bills to come within the caps. I am personally \nopposed to the cuts across the board, as I have already said. When the \nLautenberg amendment was argued a few moments earlier this afternoon, I \nsaid if there were specific proposed cuts, we ought to take them up one \nat a time. I hope we don't get to that either. If we do get to cuts, I \nthink that education ought to be preserved.\n  This bill has an increase in education of $2.3 billion, some $500 \nmillion more than the President's budget. That reflects the concerns \nthat the distinguished ranking member, Senator Harkin, and I have had. \nIf there are to be cuts, I would want to exclude education.\n  It is true that it becomes difficult, once something is excluded, to \nnot want to exclude other items. I would not want to see a cut in NIH. \nIt hardly makes a lot of sense to add $2 billion to NIH if it is going \nto be cut almost $1 billion. Senator Harkin and I probably would have \nincreased it $3 billion in that case.\n  The Senator is laughing. It is good to have a laugh in the middle of \nthe afternoon.\n  But what we have to do is avoid across-the-board cuts. If it comes to \nthat, then we will start to make exclusions, and we are making choices \nto have other cuts instead of these cuts. Then when we start to exclude \nvirtually everything, we will ultimately have to come down to what cuts \nare necessary if these 13 appropriations bills do not come within \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, I see no other Senator on the floor seeking \nrecognition. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten-and-a-half minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We are looking for a Senator to offer the next \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If we can yield back time, then the vote on this would be \nheld at what time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. We are going to stack them later in the afternoon, but \nnot in advance of 4:15, which was the point raised by Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the chairman, are we then through with this \namendment and we are open for other amendments right now?\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct, as soon as I yield back the balance of \nthe time, which I intend to do.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for me to make a couple of \ncomments?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have a list of amendments. I urge Senators on our side \nto please come over and offer the amendments that we have listed. \nPeople are protected in their amendments, but we want to get the bill \ndone. Any Senators who may not be on the floor but who are available, \nplease come over and offer your amendments. We have time agreements, \nand we can get these out of the road this afternoon before we start \nvoting later on. It would be a shame not to use the time we have right \nnow available to us to offer amendments and get them debated.\n  Again, I urge Senators on the Democratic side to please come over.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is speaking on time \nyielded from the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wonder if we could have the attention \nof the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania controls the \nremaining time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was inquiring if the Senator would \nyield just for a question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I saw the Senator from Iowa indicating that we might \nhave a lull. I see the Senator from Texas on her feet. There was a \ndesire by the committee to move forward on this bill and I would be \nglad to move on to one of the other amendments with a short time \nagreement as well. I see the Senator from Texas. We will be glad to \ncooperate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond, I would be glad to entertain the next \namendment of the Senator from Massachusetts on a short time agreement. \nWe are sequencing. We would like to now yield to the Senator from Texas \nto make a statement, and then we will proceed with an amendment on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Maine and I have 10 minutes equally divided to speak on an \nissue pertaining to the bill but not actually offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If it is agreeable to go ahead, we will be set to go. I \nam willing to work out a time agreement. As far as I am concerned, the \nSenator from Texas may want to go right ahead. I can follow her right \naway.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have another amendment on this side. We are \nsequencing time. We will be yielding to Senator Hutchison now. We have \nanother amendment on which we hope to have a short time agreement. Then \nwe will return. Is the Senator from Massachusetts prepared to accept \nanother time agreement of 30 minutes equally divided?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think the Senator from Rhode Island wishes to speak, \nif we can make it 45 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. All right. Let's do this. I ask unanimous consent that \nin sequence after the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Maine are \nrecognized for 10 minutes equally divided, there then be an amendment \noffered on the Republican side. We would then go to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, for his amendment, a second-degree \namendment, with 45 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, does the Senator from \nPennsylvania know how long the second amendment will take? Ours will be \n45 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I haven't worked that time agreement out. I haven't \ntalked\n\n[[Page S12082]]\n\nto the proponent. But I expect it to be 30 minutes equally divided. I \nwould not want to make a commitment to that because I haven't cleared \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I would not object with \nan amendment with a short-time agreement. There was some talk that \nthere may be an offering of another type of amendment--one that might \nrequire a longer time agreement.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We don't anticipate offering the ergonomics amendment--\nif that is the Senator's question--at this particular time.\n  Mr. REID. Continuing to raise the objection, it is my understanding \nthat Senator Kennedy would be able to debate for 45 minutes equally \ndivided prior to there being a motion to table.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. And no amendment would be in order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Prior to the motion to table.\n  Mr. SPECTER. No second-degree amendment would be offered prior to the \nmotion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, the Senators from Texas \nand Maine are recognized for 10 minutes each.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask that after 5 minutes I be \nnotified so I can yield my colleague her 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am talking today about an amendment \nthat I would like to offer but am not able to because it would be \nsubject to a rule XVI point of order. It is an amendment that has been \noffered before and passed by the Senate. Yet we have not been able to \nprevail in conference. It is just an amendment that would clarify the \nlaw in a particular area, and one that I think would improve the \noptions that would be available in public schools.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Texas yield for a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We now have the intervening amendment to be offered by \nSenator Coverdell, after Senators Hutchison and Collins speak, and I \nask unanimous consent that on Senator Coverdell's amendment there be 30 \nminutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we need to see the \namendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will get a copy for the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Could we know the subject?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my time \nstart now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the amendment I hope to provide in the \nESEA authorization that is going to take place either later this year \nor next year would allow public schools the option of offering single-\nsex classes or single-sex schools in the public arena.\n  We all know that the hallmark of America is that we have a public \neducation system that would give every child an equal opportunity to \nfulfill his or her potential. Many of us acknowledge that the public \nschool systems throughout our country are failing the test today. What \nwe are trying to do is give more options to public schools to acquire \nthe necessary tools to provide each child the nurturing and the special \nattention they need to succeed.\n  My amendment would clarify existing Federal law by allowing Federal \neducation funds to be used for single-sex public schools and classrooms \nas long as comparable educational opportunities are made available for \nstudents of both sexes. Remember, there is an option. It could not even \ncome into being unless a school district and the school itself and the \nparents wanted this option.\n  Due largely to the fear that many schools throughout our country \nbelieve the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights will not \nallow single-sex education efforts, most schools and school districts \nare reluctant to use even their own money on same-gender education \nprograms, much less Federal funds. Ask almost any student or graduate \nof a same-gender school, most of whom are from private or parochial \nschools, and they will almost always tell you they have been enriched \nand strengthened by their experience.\n  Surveys and studies of students show that both boys and girls \nenrolled in same-gender programs tend to be more confident and more \nfocused on their studies and ultimately more successful in school as \nwell as later in their careers, particularly if they have something to \novercome in the way of either rowdiness, shyness, or something of that \nsort. Girls report being more willing to participate in class and to \ntake difficult math and science classes they otherwise would not have \nattempted. Boys report less fear of being put down by their classmates \nfor wanting to participate in class and excel in their studies. \nTeachers, too, report fewer control and discipline problems, something \nalmost any teacher will tell you can consume a good part of class time.\n  Study after study has demonstrated that girls and boys in same-gender \nschools, where they have chosen this route, are academically more \nsuccessful and ambitious than their coeducation counterparts.\n  Single-sex education has benefited students such as Cyndee Couch, an \neighth-grader at Young Women's Leadership School in East Harlem, NY. \nCyndee and the other students at their school, located in a low-income, \npredominantly African American and Hispanic section of New York City, \nhave an attendance rate of 91.8 percent, significantly above the city \naverage. They also score higher on math and science exams than the city \naverage. In fact, 90 percent of the school's students recently scored \nat or above grade level on the standardized public school math problem-\nsolving tests. The citywide average was 50 percent.\n  Last year, Cyndee bravely appeared on the television show ``60 \nMinutes'' to talk about why she likes this all-girls public school, one \nof the very few in the nation. She told host Morley Safer ``. . . as \nlong as I'm in this school and I'm learning, and no boys are allowed in \nthe school, I think everything's going to be OK.''\n  Unfortunately for Cyndee and for the other students in fledgling \nsame-gender public school programs across the country, everything is \nnot OK. Opponents of same-gender education have sued to shut down the \nYoung Women's Leadership School and other schools like it around the \ncountry. I cannot imagine why they would do this when the success has \nbeen proven. We want to give the options to public schools that private \nand parochial schools now have.\n\n  It is not a mandate. It is an option. We want to pursue this so \npublic schools will succeed in giving every child his or her full \neducational opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to begin my remarks by commending \nmy friend and colleague from Texas for her leadership on this issue and \nfor bringing it to the Senate's attention.\n  I wish to share with my colleagues a wonderful example of the \naccomplishments that can be realized by a same-gender class. A gifted \nmath teacher, Donna Lisnik, at Presque High School, pioneered an all-\ngirls math class some years ago. She believed it would result in \ngreater achievement by the young girls who were studying math at \nPresque High School. She began to offer the same-sex class in math and \nshe proved to be absolutely right. The class was offered for over 5 \nyears and the results were outstanding. Both the achievement of these \ngirls and the number of them participating in advanced math and science \nclasses increased.\n  I had the privilege of visiting Mrs. Lisnik's classroom. I cannot \noverstate the excitement of the girls in her class studying advanced \nmath. They were learning so much and they were so excited by this \nopportunity to learn together.\n  Incredibly, the Federal Department of Education concluded that this \nmath class violated title IX of the Education Act. Consequently, \nPresque High\n\n[[Page S12083]]\n\nSchool was required to open the class to both boys and girls. It is \ninteresting to note, however, that it is girls who continue to enroll \nin this class even though it is open to both boys and girls.\n  It is unfortunate that schools are prevented by the Federal \nregulations from developing single-gender classes in which both young \nwomen--and in other classes, young men--can flourish and reach their \nfull potential. Senator Hutchison's proposal assures that other schools \nwith innovative education programs designed to meet gender-specific \nneeds will not face such obstacles.\n\n  This proposal does not weaken or undercut in any way the protections \nfor women and girls in title IX. It does not allow a school to offer an \neducation benefit for only one sex, to the exclusion of the other. \nSchools must have comparable programs for both boys and girls. However, \nit does give schools the flexibility to design and offer single-gender \nclasses when the school determines that such classes will provide their \nstudents with a better opportunity to achieve high standards, the kind \nof high standards and achievement that I witnessed firsthand in Mrs. \nLisnik's exciting math class in northern Maine.\n  Although Senator Hutchison has decided to withdraw her amendment, I \nam going to work with her to ensure that it is incorporated in the \nrewrite of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act that will be \nundertaken by the health committee later this year. This is a proposal \nthat is designed to help young girls and young boys excel by using the \ndevice of single-sex classrooms. It deserves support.\n  I am very pleased to join with the Senator from Texas in supporting \nthis effort.\n  I yield back any remaining time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for \ncosponsoring this amendment with me and for being willing in the \ncommittee to work on getting it included in the reauthorization.\n  This is an option, not a mandate. Coed education is better for a \nnumber of students. However, when students have a problem with not \nbeing willing to speak up in class or have a particular problem in math \nand science where it is indicated that they would do better in a \nsingle-sex atmosphere, let's have this option open for public school \nstudents, students who may not be able to afford the option of private \nschool or parochial school, so that our public schools will be the very \nbest they can be, offering every option they can offer to the public \nschool students so every child in this country will have the same \nopportunity to excel.\n  I hope we can approve this amendment. The last time it was offered we \nadopted it in the Senate by a vote of 69-29. It was very bipartisan and \nvery strong. I know Members on both sides of the aisle who have \nattended single-sex schools and who believe this is an option that \nshould be allowed will fight for this amendment for every public school \nchild to have this option without the hassle and threat of being sued \nthat might deter the opportunity for them to have what would meet their \nneeds.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1837\n\n   (Purpose: To decrease certain education funding, and to increase \n                       certain education funding)\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask that Senate amendment 1837 be \ncalled up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1837.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 54, line 19, strike ``$1,151,550,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,126,550,000''.\n       On page 55, line 8, strike ``$65,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$90,000,000''.\n       At the end, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . FUNDING\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law--\n       (1) the total amount made available under this Act to carry \n     out part A of title X of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 shall be $39,500,000;\n       (2) the total amount made available under this Act to carry \n     out part C of title X of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 shall be $150,000,000; and\n       (3) the total amount made available under this Act to carry \n     out subpart 1 of part A of title IV of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 shall be $451,000,000, of \n     which $111,275,000 shall be available on July 1, 2000.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I offer a second-degree amendment to \nthe Coverdell amendment, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the precedent of the Senate, the second-\ndegree amendment would not be in order until the time for debate has \nbeen utilized or yielded back.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will reoffer at the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, amendment No. 1837 increases funding \nfor Reading Excellence by $25 million; it would increase charter school \nfunding by $50 million, and increase Safe and Drug Free Schools by $25 \nmillion. The amendment is paid for by an offset of $100 million from \nthe fund for the improvement of education which is currently funded at \n$139.5 million. I repeat, the amendment increases funding for Reading \nExcellence by $25 million, increases charter school funding by $50 \nmillion, and increases Safe and Drug Free Schools by $25 million.\n  Charter schools are offering some of the most promising educational \nreform today. Since 1991, 34 States and the District of Columbia have \nenacted charter school programs. This year, more than 1,700 charter \nschools will be serving 350,000 of our Nation's students. As most \nMembers know, charter schools are public schools which have been set \nfree from burdensome Federal, State, and local regulations. In place of \nthe intrusive regulations, charter schools are held accountable for \nacademic results by the consumers, parents, and students.\n  In the last 2 years, exciting studies have been released that provide \ndata on the success of charter schools around the country. In May of \n1997, the Department of Education released its first formal report on \nthe study of charter schools. The findings include the two most common \nreasons for starting public charter schools: flexibility from \nbureaucratic laws and regulations, and the chance to realize an \neducational vision.\n  About 60 percent of public charter schools are new startups rather \nthan public or private school conversions to charter status.\n  In most States, charter schools have a racial composition similar to \nstatewide averages, or have a higher proportion of minority students. \nCharter schools enroll roughly the same proportion of low-income \nstudents, on average, as other public schools.\n  The Hudson Institute also undertook a study of charter schools \nentitled ``Charter Schools in Action.'' Their research team traveled to \n14 States, visited 60 schools, and surveyed thousands of parents, \nteachers, and students.\n  Some of the study's key findings: Three-fifths of charter school \nstudents report that their charter school teachers are better than \ntheir previous school's teachers; over two-thirds of the parents say \ntheir charter schools are better than that child's previous school with \nrespect to class size, school size, and individual attention; 90 \npercent of the teachers are satisfied with their charter school \neducational philosophy, size, fellow teachers, and students.\n  Among students who said they were failing at their previous school, \nmore than half are now doing excellent or good work. These gains were \ndramatic for minority and low-income youngsters and were confirmed by \ntheir parents.\n  The Hudson Institute study found that charter schools are \nsuccessfully serving students, parents, and teachers. Currently, there \nare national and State studies that demonstrate a positive ripple \neffect. The study on the impact of Michigan charter schools found that \ncharter school competition has put pressure on traditional public \nschools to become more accountable. A similar study done on \nMassachusetts charter schools found that district schools have been \nadopting innovative practices that mirror charter school efforts. A \nstudy on Los Angeles charter schools shows that charter schools\n\n[[Page S12084]]\n\nhave influenced district reform by heightening awareness and initiating \ndialog.\n  The implication of the success of charter schools is that successful \npublic schools should be consumer oriented, diverse, results oriented, \nand professional places that also function as mediating institutions in \ntheir communities. Charter schools offer greater accountability, \nbroader flexibility for classroom innovation, and ultimately more \nchoice in public education.\n  Many in this Chamber are aware of my strong support of the \nopportunity for low-income parents to choose the best educational \nsetting for their child, whether public or private. I believe this \nability to choose the best educational environment for our children is \nsomething all parents should have, not just those parents who can \nafford the choice.\n  Another provision of this amendment deals with reading excellence. To \nget an idea of our children's future, one has only to look in the \nSunday paper at all the high-tech firms looking for applicants. There \nis no more clear indicator of where our economy is headed. Without \nbasic skills, many of our children will be shut out of the workforce--\nleft behind. We have a literacy crisis in the Nation. More than 40 \nmillion Americans cannot read. Those who cannot learn to read are not \nonly less likely to get a good job but they are also disproportionately \nrepresented in the ranks of the unemployed and homeless. Consider that \n75 percent of unemployed adults, 33 percent of mothers on welfare, 85 \npercent of juveniles appearing in court, and 60 percent of prison \ninmates are illiterate.\n  The Federal Government spends more than $8 billion on programs to \npromote literacy, with little result. More than 40 million Americans \ncannot read a phone book, a menu, or the directions on a medicine \nbottle, and only 4 out of 10 third graders can read at grade level or \nabove. That is why last fall we passed an important piece of \nlegislation to address the serious problem of illiteracy in our \ncountry. This legislation, the Reading Excellence Act, seeks to turn \naround our Nation's alarmingly high illiteracy rates by focusing on \ntraining teachers to teach reading, increasing parental involvement, \nand sending more dollars to the classroom.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes 3 seconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The legislation provide $210 million for research, \nteacher training, and individual grants for K-12 reading instruction \nand requires that funds for teacher training be spent on programs that \nare demonstrated by scientific research to be effective. It also \nauthorizes grants to parents for tutorial assistance for their \nchildren. Most important, Reading Excellence ensures that 95 percent of \nthe funds go to teaching children to read, not to administrative \noverhead. The Reading Excellence Act provides today's children with the \ntools they need to be successful in tomorrow's workforce. Helping to \nensure every child can read is one of the best bills Congress can pass.\n  We also deal in this amendment with safety in schools. In 1996, \nstudents ages 12 through 18 were victims of about 225,000 incidents of \nnonfatal, serious, violent crimes at school and 671,000 incidents away \nfrom school. These numbers indicate that when students were away from \nschool, they were more likely to be victims of nonfatal serious crimes \nincluding rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.\n  In 1996, 5 percent of all 12th graders reported they had been injured \nwith a weapon such as a knife, gun, or club during the past 12 months \nwhile they were at school; that is, inside or outside the school \nbuilding or on a school bus; and 12 percent reported they had been \ninjured on purpose without a weapon while at school.\n  So I come back to the basic tenet of this legislation; that is, we \nare reinforcing, through the amendment, in a significant way, Federal \nassistance to charter schools, the Reading Excellence Act, and Safe and \nDrug Free Schools--$50 million more to charter schools, $25 million \nmore to the Reading Excellence Act, and $25 million into Safe and Drug \nFree Schools.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. The minority yields back its time on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The majority yields back its time on this amendment. I \nbelieve we have an agreement to accept it. I suggest this be dealt with \nby voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1837) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1819\n\n(Purpose: To increase funding for title II of the Higher Education Act \n                                of 1965)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to have the \nattention of the Senate on a measure which I think has compelling \nsupport of families across this country. I know we have a 45-minute \ntime limitation. So we have 22\\1/2\\ minutes on our side.\n  I yield myself 5 minutes at the present time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator would need to call up his \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I call up amendment No. 1819.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself, \n     Mr. Reed, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Kerry, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1819.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 60, line 10, before the period, insert the \n     following ``: Provided further, That in addition to any other \n     amounts appropriated under this heading an additional \n     $223,000,000 is appropriated to carry out title II of the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965, and a total of $300,000,000 \n     shall be available to carry out such title, of which \n     $300,000,000 shall become available in October 1, 2000''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, if this amendment is accepted, it will provide some \n$300 million nationwide to improve the quality of teaching in the \npublic schools of America. If we have had some important testimony over \nthese past several years, it has been along these lines. Let's get \nalong with having smaller class sizes in the various early years. \nSenator Murray, from the State of Washington, has made that case very \nclear. And the STAR report, that has focused in on the work of \nTennessee, has also demonstrated that in a very compelling way.\n  The second area is afterschool programs. Our good friends, Senator \nBoxer from California, Senator Dodd, and others, have spoken about the \nimportance of afterschool programs for children in reducing violence \nand enhancing academic achievement and offering opportunities for \nbusiness communities to work with children in these afterschool \nprograms to offer career improvements.\n  There have been important needs which have been demonstrated for \nbuilding additional kinds of facilities and improving the facilities \nthat exist.\n\n[[Page S12085]]\n\n The General Accounting Office says that is in excess of over $100 \nbillion. That amendment will follow on tomorrow. It is very important \nto make sure when every child goes to class in a public school system \nthat the school is going to be in the kind of condition to which all of \nus want our children to go. If we do not do that, we send a very poor \nmessage to children. We say, effectively, it does not matter what that \nclassroom looks like or what that classroom is really all about. That \nsends a powerful message to a child that perhaps education is not so \nimportant.\n  But when you consider that, and consider also the steps that have \nbeen taken in terms of improving technology in the classroom, improving \nthe work that is being done in the areas of literacy, there is one \nimportant, outstanding additional issue which demands and cries out for \nattention in the Senate; and it is this: The American families want to \nhave a well-qualified teacher in every classroom in America, period.\n  I think if you ask parents all across this country, at the end of the \nafternoon, where the greatest priority is--if you said, look, if we \ncould have a well-qualified teacher in your child's classroom, I bet \nevery family in America would put that just about at the top of their \nvarious lists.\n  Over the last 3 years, our Committee on Education has had extensive \nhearings on this issue. We made some recommendations in the last \nCongress on this issue. It had very strong bipartisan support on the \nissue of quality teaching. The approach that was taken in that \nlegislation says: All right. We want to provide teacher enrichment for \nindividuals who are already teachers.\n  We had ideas about mentoring with older teachers and working with \nprofessional teachers, but what we have not addressed in an adequate \nway is how we are going to recruit the kinds of teachers who would be \nthe best teachers for our children and how we are going to train them \nin the most effective ways so they will be the very best.\n  This amendment, if it is accepted, amounts to $300 million. We have \nsome $77 million in there now. The President had asked for $115 million \nto do it. But certainly the applications for this kind of training has \nfar exceeded even the amounts we are talking about today.\n  This offers an opportunity to say to the young people of this \ncountry, and to those kinds of local partnerships--the effective State \nprograms, the universities across this country in the States--that we \nare going to help and assist you in, as a top priority, recruiting the \nbest teachers for the students in this country.\n  Finally, we have pointed out, in the education debate over the period \nof the past days, the need for new teachers. Some 2 million teachers \nover the next 10 years--200,000 a year--is what we need. We are only \ngetting 100,000 at the present time. The Senate has rejected the \nexcellent proposal of the Senator from Washington to increase the \nnumber of teachers in the early grades.\n\n  I yield myself 3 more minutes.\n  In fact, with the rejection of the Murray amendment, we are going to \nfind in excess of 30,000 well-qualified, well-trained teachers who are \nworking in grades K through 3 actually getting pink slips. It makes no \nsense at all. It makes no sense at all.\n  So it does seem to me that in an overall budget of $1.7 trillion--do \nwe understand? $1.7 trillion--we ought to be able to have $300 million \nin the tried and tested way of recruiting teachers, additional \nteachers, who we know we are in short supply of; well-trained teachers, \nwho we know we are in short supply of; and make them available to an \nexpanding, growing population in our K through 12th grade system. We \nare increasing the number of students by 477,000 this year. So we are \nfalling further and further behind.\n  This is a very simple, straightforward amendment. It is saying that \nof all of the priorities--and there are many--education is certainly \namong the very highest; and of all the priorities in the areas of \neducation, getting good teachers, recruiting young and old people alike \nwho will be good teachers, giving them the inspirational kind of \ntraining so they can go into the classroom, use the latest in \ntechnologies, adapt that to the kind of curricula to benefit the \nchildren of this country, should receive these additional funds.\n  Mr. President, I know there are others who want to speak on this \nissue. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. \nReed. I think all of us understand that he has made the issue of \nquality and highly trained teachers his issue in this body, as well his \ninterest in providing pediatric specialists for all children. These are \namong the many other areas of public policy in which he has been \nactively engaged both on the Education Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives and here in the Senate. I certainly think all of us on \nthe Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in the Senate are \nvery fortunate to have his insights about the importance of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank Senator Kennedy for those kind words, and also for \noffering this very important amendment. I am a very proud cosponsor of \nthis amendment with Senator Kennedy.\n  Last Congress, on an overwhelming bipartisan vote the Senate passed \nthe Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants program as part of the Higher \nEducation Act Amendments of 1998. This was the first time we looked \nseriously at reforming the way our teachers are trained by enhancing \nthe linkage between teacher colleges and elementary and secondary \nschools.\n  What we tried to emphasize is the connection between the teacher \ncolleges and the real-life experiences of teachers in the classroom. \nThe best way to enhance the quality of teaching in America is at the \nlevel of the entry teacher.\n  This is something the Kennedy-Reed amendment will provide more \nresources for. What we want to do is form a strong, vibrant, and vital \nlink between the teacher colleges and the elementary and secondary \nschools. We want to ensure that teachers who leave teacher colleges are \nnot just experts in theoretical and pedagogical subjects. We want them \nto be, first and foremost, experts on the subject matter that they \nteach, be it mathematics or science or any other subject. In addition, \nwe want to ensure that they have extensive clinical experience.\n  The model to follow is our medical education system. No one would \ndream of certifying and licensing a physician after simply going to \nschool and hearing lectures and then maybe having 2 or 3 weeks in a \nhospital. It is a long-term, extensive clinical education. That model \nis applicable also, I believe, to education.\n  In fact, what we have found from our hearings is a disconnect between \nwhat teaching students are learning in college and the reality of the \nteaching experience in the classroom. We want to eliminate that \ndisconnect.\n  The Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998 sought to do just that by \nauthorizing partnerships between teacher colleges and elementary and \nsecondary schools. There are examples of partnerships that already \nexisted and inspired us; examples such as Salve Regina University in my \nhome State of Rhode Island, which has a partnership with the Sullivan \nSchool in Newport. It is exciting and challenging, not only to the \nyoung students in that school, but also to the prospective teachers who \nlearn a great deal. In fact, at the heart of these partnerships is the \nattempt not only to change the culture of elementary and secondary \nschools but also to change the culture of teacher colleges.\n  Too often the teacher college in a great university is a poor cousin \nwithout a great endowment, neglected by other parts of the university. \nWhat we want to do is get the university involved in this great effort \nso that professors in the math, English, and history departments are \nalso part of this great reawakening of teacher preparation at the \nuniversity level. This cultural change at the college level, together \nwith extensive clinical involvement with local elementary and secondary \nschools, I believe, is a fundamental way to enhance the quality of \nteachers.\n  The Kennedy-Reed amendment will provide more resources to do this \nvery important and critical job that lies before us. We have gone \nthrough the first\n\n[[Page S12086]]\n\nround of grants with respect to the partnership grants. The Department \nof Education funded $33 million in the first round to 25 institutions \nof higher education and their elementary and secondary school partners. \nThis is a first and important step, but we need to do more. That is \nprecisely what this amendment proposes to do. It will appropriate \nadditional resources so we can broaden dramatically these partnerships, \nas well as increase our investment in the state and recruitment grants \nalso included in the Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. One additional minute.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator.\n  If we, in fact, pass this amendment, we will be able to fund up to \n100 additional partnership, state, and recruitment grant proposals, \nthereby enabling this important innovation in teacher preparation to be \naccessible throughout our nation.\n  I am strongly supportive of this amendment. I think it is something \nthat will allow us to make great progress. Once again, emphasizing a \npoint made so well by Senator Kennedy, if you look at public education, \nand if you search for the most powerful lever that we have to improve \nit, to reform it, and to continue it as an excellent system, teacher \ntraining is that lever.\n  This amendment will give us the power to move forward, dramatically \nand decisively to improve the quality of teaching in the United States. \nI strongly support it and commend the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis efforts.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine and a half minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair, and I particularly thank my senior \ncolleague for this amendment, as well as for his extraordinary \nleadership on the subject of education. I think everyone here will \nagree there simply is no stronger voice for the quality of our schools \nand the opportunities for our children than my senior colleague.\n  The great battle in the Senate over the past years has been to \nestablish standards by which we would raise the education level of our \nschools. The fact is, a few years ago we basically won that battle \nbecause now 49 States in the country have agreed to put standards in \nplace or have them in place. Those standards vary. In some States they \nare stronger than they are in other States, but the great challenge now \nis fourfold.\n  One is to stay the course in putting the standards in place and \nraising the standards. The second is to guarantee that teachers can \nteach to the standards. The third is to guarantee that students have \nthe opportunity to learn to the standards. That is not being dealt with \nspecifically, though partly, in this amendment. The final one is \naccountability. All of this has to be accountable. We have learned \nthat. You have to know that what you are trying to teach and what kids \nare learning are, in fact, being taught and learned.\n  What the Senator from Massachusetts, my senior colleague, and Senator \nReed and I and others are joining in is a recognition that we have an \nextraordinary challenge before us. I was going to use the word \n``crisis,'' but I don't want to use it because it is overused. We have \nall heard the quotes about the number of teachers we need to hire in \nthe next few years. We know maybe as many as 2 million teachers are \nneeded, perhaps half of them in the next 5 years. We also know we are \nlosing 30 to 40 percent of new teachers within the first 3 to 4 years. \nWe know there are ways to make a difference in teachers staying at what \nis increasingly becoming one of the toughest jobs in America.\n  It is interesting that a survey, released about 4 months ago, showed \nwhat teachers have been telling us for some time. Our own teachers in \nthis country acknowledge that they don't feel fully prepared for the \nmodern classroom. By modern classroom, we mean a lot of different \nthings. We mean the technology needed to teach. We mean some of the \nmodern teaching methodologies, pedagogies. We also mean the nature of \nthe student who comes to school today. That student comes burdened with \na whole set of problems, unlike the students of the past. We also know \nthat because of the multicultural, racial diversity of our Nation, we \nhave teachers coping with different cultures, with a diversity that is \nabsolutely extraordinary but also challenging.\n  The fact is that fully 80 percent of our teachers tell us they don't \nfeel equipped to be able to do the job. They are crying out for help. \nThat is what the Kennedy amendment delivers. It makes education \nprograms accountable for preparing high-quality teachers, for improving \nprospective teachers' knowledge of academic content, through increased \ncollaboration between the faculty and schools of education and the \ndepartments of arts and sciences, so we will ensure that teachers are \nwell prepared for the realities of the classroom by providing very \nstrong, hands-on classroom experience and by strengthening the links \nbetween the university and the K-through-12 school faculties.\n  We also need to prepare prospective teachers to use technology as a \ntool for teaching and learning. We need to prepare prospective teachers \nto work effectively with diverse students.\n  The truth is that we as Senators talk about the difficulties of \nteaching today in America. The fact is that it is one of the most \ndifficult jobs in our Nation. It is extraordinary to me that the \nSenate, at this time of urgent need in the country, might not be \nprepared to make the most important investment in the country. It is \nextraordinary to me that kids just 2 or 3 years out of college can earn \nin a Christmas bonus more than teachers will earn in an entire year. It \nis impossible to attract some of the best kids out of our best colleges \nand universities because we are not willing to provide the mentoring, \nthe ongoing education, the support systems, and the capacity to really \nfulfill the promise of teaching in the public school system.\n  So I hope our colleagues will support the notion that all we are \ntrying to do is raise to the original requested level the spending for \nthe teacher enhancement grants, with the knowledge that this is the \nmost important investment we can make in America. Teachers need and \ndeserve respect from the Senate and from those who create the structure \nwithin which they try to teach our kids so that they can, in fact, \nlearn and we can do better as a country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think I have 3 and a half minutes left. \nI yield myself 3 minutes.\n  On this chart behind me, we see that communities need more well-\nqualified teachers. Out of 366 total applications--and this is 1999--\nonly 77 applications were funded. With this particular amendment \naccepted, we would still be below half of what was actually in the \npipeline for this last year, let alone what would be in there for next \nyear. There is enormous need.\n  Finally, I will quote from the chairman of our Education Committee, \nSenator Jeffords, who, in his representation to the Senate on the \neducation bill, had this to say about this particular provision that is \nin the law--not about this amendment but about this provision:\n\n       At its foundation, Title II embraces the notion that \n     investing in the preparation of our Nation's teachers is a \n     good one. Well-prepared teachers play a key role in making it \n     possible for our students to achieve the standards required \n     to assure both their own well-being and the ability of our \n     country to compete internationally.\n       . . .Title II demands excellence from our teacher \n     preparation programs; encourages coordination; focuses on the \n     need for academic content, knowledge, and strong teaching \n     skills.\n       . . .These efforts recognize the fundamental connection \n     that exists among States, institutions of higher education, \n     and efforts to improve education for our Nation's elementary \n     and secondary school teachers.\n\n  This provision had the strongest bipartisan support in that education \nbill. We know what the need is. We know this is a very modest \namendment. We know what a difference it will make in terms of the high \nschool students of this country. I hope this amendment will be \naccepted.\n\n[[Page S12087]]\n\n  Mr. President, I understand I have a minute left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a minute and a half.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield that time to the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. \nReed, with whom I have enjoyed working, along with my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry.\n  Mr. REED. I thank Senator Kennedy.\n  Let me emphasize one additional point that bears repeating. The \nclassroom today is very different from those in the 1950s or 1960s--\ndifferent because of technology; different because families are in much \nmore distressed conditions in many parts of the country; different \nbecause of the various cultural factors that go into the makeup of many \nclasses, particularly in urban America. In fact, we are still teaching \nin too many colleges as if it were the class of 1950, as if it were the \ntime of ``My Three Sons'' and ``Leave It To Beaver.''\n  That is not what American education is today. What we have to do \ntoday--and this amendment will help immensely--is refocus our teacher \ntraining to confront the issues of today, such as multiculturalism, \nchildren with disabilities in the classroom, and technology. This is \nabsolutely critical. Unless we enhance our commitment to this type of \neducation--partnerships between schools of education and elementary and \nsecondary schools, drawing on the resources of the whole university, \nfocusing these resources on new technology and the challenges that are \nparticular to this time in our history--we are not going to succeed in \neducating all of our children to the world-class standards that we all \nknow have to be met.\n  I urge passage of this very important amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is no doubt about the importance of \nteacher quality enhancement. Teachers are the backbone of the \neducational system. There is no doubt about the importance of \neducation. It is a truism that education is a priority second to none. \nThe bill that has been presented on the floor by the distinguished \nranking member, Senator Harkin, and myself through subcommittee and \nfull committee has recognized the importance of education in that we \nhave increased education funding by $2.3 billion this year over last \nyear's appropriation. It is now in excess of $35 billion on the Federal \nallocation. Bear in mind that the Federal Government funds only about 7 \npercent of education nationwide.\n\n  When we talk about teacher quality enhancement, this is a program \nwhich is a very new program. It was not on the books in fiscal year \n1998. For the current year, fiscal year 1999, we have an appropriation \nin excess of $77 million. When we took a look at it this year, we \nprovided a $3 million increase. This is a matter of trying to recognize \nwhat the priorities are.\n  The President had asked for $115 million, and we thought that in \nallocating funds on a great many lines--title I, Head Start, and many \nother very important education programs--the proper allocation was $80 \nmillion. Now, when the Senator from Massachusetts comes in and asks for \nan increase of some $220 million, he is requesting $185 million more \nthan the President's request. It would be an ideal world if our funding \nwere unlimited. But what we are looking at here--and we have had very \nextensive debate today on whether the budget is going to invade the \nSocial Security trust fund. I think this Senator, like others, has \ndetermined that we do not invade the Social Security trust fund.\n  We had debated whether or not there ought to be a pro rata increase \nor a decrease, if we ran into the Social Security trust fund, to make \nsure we didn't use any of the Social Security moneys, or whether, as \nthe Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, offered in an amendment, \nto have other targeted cuts. My view is that we have to structure this \nbudget so we don't cut into the Social Security trust fund.\n  Senator Stevens was in the well of the Senate earlier today, and I \ndiscussed the matter with him. We are trying to structure these 13 \nappropriations bills so we don't move into the Social Security trust \nfund. But if we make extensive additions, as this amendment would do, \nadding $220 million, as I say, which is $185 million more than the \nPresident's request, it is not going to be possible to avoid going into \nthe Social Security trust fund.\n  We have already had very substantial increases in funding on this \nbill. We have a bill of $91.7 billion, which is as much as we thought \nthe traffic would bear on the Republican side of the aisle, realizing \nthat we have to go to conference with the House which has a lower \nfigure, and realizing beyond that, that we have to get the President's \nsignature. We have already had $1.3 billion added to the $91.7 billion \nfor block grants. We have had $900 million added for day care. Now, if \nwe look at another amendment for $220 million, it is going to \ninevitably at one point or another break the caps.\n  These are not straws that break the camel's back. These are heavy \nlogs which will break the back, and it is not even a camel.\n  Much as I dislike opposing the amendment by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, I am constrained to do so in my capacity as manager of \nthis bill.\n  In the course of the past week, I have voted against more amendments \non funding for programs that I think are very important than I have in \nthe preceding 19 years in the Senate. But that is the responsibility I \nhave when I manage the bill--to take a look at the priorities, get the \nallocation from the Budget Committee, have a total allocation budget of \n$91.7 billion, and simply have to stay within that budget.\n  Mr. President, I inquire as to how much time is remaining on the 45 \nminute time agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much does the Senator from Massachusetts have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. His time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, teacher quality is one of the most \ncritical factors influencing student achievement and success. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Kennedy amendment, which would increase \nTeacher Quality Enhancement grants from $80 million to the fully \nauthorized level of $300 million.\n  I am a cosponsor of this amendment, along with Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland and others, because I firmly believe that an investment in \nteacher quality is an investment in our children's future. We know all \nlearners have the capacity for high achievement. We must increase our \ninvestment in teacher quality enhancement so every child in America is \ntaught by the most qualified teacher available. We must invest in our \nteachers. We must help them reach the highest levels of competency, so \nthey in turn can help their students reach the highest summits of \nachievement. As we work to bolster teacher quality, we must also focus \nour attention on reducing class size. Smaller classes have led to \ndramatic gains in student achievement. We must continue to reduce class \nsize so highly qualified teachers can provide students more \nindividualized attention. Reducing class size and increasing investment \nin teacher quality enhancement are key to ensuring academic success for \nall students.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are prepared to move ahead with \nanother amendment. We are going to evaluate our schedule. I suggest, \njust a moment or two, the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, is prepared to offer an amendment, to \nspeak to it for 10 minutes, and then withdraw it.\n  Mr. REED. That is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot, is it appropriate to ask for the yeas and nays until the time has \nbeen yielded? I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment. I ask for \nthe yeas and nays on the previous amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  It is in order to ask for the yeas and nays. Is there a sufficient \nsecond?\n\n[[Page S12088]]\n\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object on the request \nfor the amendment, I would happy to do that. I say to my friend from \nPennsylvania that we want to use this fill time. Senator Bingaman will \ngo next, may I inquire, on the next amendment offered?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I believe the next amendment would be on this side of \nthe aisle.\n  Mr. REID. The next Democratic amendment would be Bingaman.\n  I thank the manager.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is satisfactory.\n  I yield the remainder of my time on the Kennedy amendment.\n  I now ask unanimous consent to proceed with Senator Reed under the \nstipulated terms of 10 minutes to offer an amendment and withdraw it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1866\n\n   (Purpose: To permit the expenditure of funds to complete certain \n    reports concerning accidents that result in the death of minor \n                employees engaged in farming operations)\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 1866 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1866.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In title I, under the heading ``Occupational Safety and \n     Health Administration--Salaries and Expenses'', insert before \n     the colon at the end of the second proviso the following: ``, \n     except that amounts appropriated to the Occupational Safety \n     and Health Administration for fiscal year 2000 may be \n     obligated or expended to conduct an investigation in response \n     to an accident causing the death of an employee (who is under \n     18 years of age and who is employed by a person engaged in a \n     farming operation that does not maintain a temporary labor \n     camp and that employs 10 or fewer employees) and to issue a \n     report concerning the causes of such an accident, so long as \n     the Occupational and Safety and Health Administration does \n     not impose a fine or take any other enforcement action as a \n     result of such investigation or report''.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment is a result of a tragic \naccident in my home State of Rhode Island where a young worker on a \nfarm was killed accidentally.\n  The police came immediately and determined that there was no foul \nplay and concluded their investigation. But the parents were deeply \nconcerned because no one could explain to them what happened.\n  As we looked into the matter for them, we discovered that for many \nyears, because of a rider on this appropriations bill, OSHA has been \nprohibited from investigating deaths on farms that employ 10 or fewer \nworkers.\n  If this terrible, tragic accident had taken place in a McDonald's, \nOSHA would be there. There would be an investigation. They would \ndiscover the cause. They would suggest remedies. They would do what \nmost Americans expect should be done when an accident takes place in \nthe workplace. But because of this small farm rider, OSHA is powerless \nto investigate.\n  I think it is wrong. I think it is wrong not only because these \nparents don't know what circumstances took the life of their child, but \nthey also regret that it might happen again because there might be some \ntype of systematic flaw or some type of problematic process on the farm \nthat could also claim the life of another youngster.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Rhode Island yield \nfor a moment on a managers' matter?\n  Mr. REED. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We are ready to proceed on the votes on the two \namendments pending by the Senator from Massachusetts when Senator Reed \nconcludes. I thought perhaps we should notify the Members that the \nfirst vote will start at approximately 4:55.\n  I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for yielding.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me continue.\n  My amendment would simply state that OSHA has the authority to \nconduct an inspection when a minor, someone under 18 years of age, is \nkilled on a farm regardless of the size of the farm, but they would \nalso be prevented from levying any type of fine or enforcement action. \nTheir role would be very simple and very direct: Find the cause of the \naction; then, not with respect to that particular farm, not with \nrespect to any particular sanction of penalty, generally, if they can \nlearn something that would help protect the lives of others, they would \nincorporate that, of course, in their overall directions and \nregulations for farming and other activities.\n  These goals are very simple and straightforward: Identify the cause \nof the accident so that the employer knows what steps are needed to \nprevent similar deaths, and make that information available so that \nother farmers can take steps to avert similar tragedies.\n  This is not an academic or arcane issue because there are numerous \nyoungsters working on farms. There are also in the United States about \n500 work-related deaths reported each year. Moreover, although only 8 \npercent of all workers under the age of 18 are employed in agriculture, \nmore than 40 percent of the work-related deaths among young people \noccur in the agricultural industry.\n  So this is an issue of importance.\n  Let me stress something else. This particular amendment would only \napply if the individual youngster was, in fact, an employee of the \nfarm. This would not affect a situation where a son or daughter are \ndoing chores around the farm. This is a situation when someone is hired \nto work on the farm, and that person is involved in a fatal accident. I \nthink it is only fair because I believe the parents in America, when \nthey send their children into the workplace--be it a supermarket or \nMcDonald's or a farm, large or small--expect their children will at \nleast have the coverage of many of the safety laws we have in place; \nbut failing that, at least we will have the power, the authority, the \nability to determine what happened in the case of a fatal accident.\n\n  This proposal is not unique to the situation I found in Rhode Island. \nThe National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of \nScience, issued a report entitled ``Protecting Youth at Work,'' and \namong the recommendations:\n\n       To ensure the equal protection of children and adolescents \n     from health and safety hazards in agriculture, Congress \n     should take an examination of the effects and feasibility of \n     extending all relevant Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration regulations to agricultural workers, including \n     subjecting small farms to the same level of OSHA enforcement \n     as that apply to other small businesses.\n\n  My proposal goes not to that great length, not to that extreme. It is \nmuch more constrained and limited. It simply says when there is a \nfatality involving an employee under 18 years of age on a farm--small \nor large--OSHA can conduct an inspection to determine the cause and \nperhaps propose remedial actions but cannot invoke any type of sanction \nor fine.\n  That is the height of reasonableness, given the experiences we have \nseen, given the report of the National Academy of Science, given all of \nthese factors.\n  I believe this should be done. In fact, it is long overdue. It is \nsimple justice, not only for the families of those youngsters who are \nfatally injured on these small farms, but also it will give us the \nimpetus to save lives in the future.\n  Some have criticized this amendment as potentially imposing an undue \nburden on small farms. This is erroneous criticism. There is no burden \nhere other than facing up to the facts and finding out what happened. \nIndeed, I believe knowledge is power; if we know what caused these \naccidents, we can prevent them and, even, I hope, make the operators of \nthese farms more conscious of what they are doing, particularly as they \nemploy youngsters.\n  This is an amendment I believe is important; it is critical. I \noffered a variation on this amendment in the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions when we were considering\n\n[[Page S12089]]\n\nthe SAFE Act. We had a vigorous debate but, I will admit, it met \nresistance.\n  I believe passionately we can do something and we must do something. \nI also recognize this process will not end today, that in the last few \nhours or moments of this debate it is unlikely this amendment will \npass. I will, as I indicated to the Senator from Pennsylvania, withdraw \nthe amendment. Such withdrawal does not signify retreat by me on this \nissue. I will continue to look for ways in which we can have \ninvestigations of fatalities on small farms, not because of any animus \ntoward large or small farms but because when someone loses a child, I \nbelieve they deserve an answer. What happened? How did it happen? How \ncan other children be spared from such a fatality?\n  In that spirit, I will continue to advance this issue and look for \nadditional ways we can get an investigation. Again, the emphasis is not \non being punitive; the emphasis is on being, first of all, fair to the \nfamily; and second, of being remedial so we can address problems that \nmay be systematic and prevalent not just on the site of the particular \nfatality but endemic and systematic throughout the farming community.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1866, Withdrawn\n\n  With that, I yield back my time, and I ask unanimous consent the \namendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would have voted against the Nickles \namendment because I could not endorse a plan to bust the budget caps, \nspend every dime of the non-Social Security surplus, and then use \nbudget gimmicks to keep ourselves from dipping into the Social Security \nsurplus.\n  The Congress has the power of the purse, and that power carries with \nit the obligation to spend the taxpayer dollars responsibly. Just \nbecause we have a surplus of tax dollars in the Treasury, that doesn't \nmean we should spend it.\n  In fact, when we passed a tax relief bill this summer, we made it \nclear that the surplus--the portion that does not come from Social \nSecurity payroll taxes--should be given back to the taxpayers, not \nspent on big government. That bill was vetoed, as expected, and the \nCongressional leadership and the Administration have given up on \nproviding meaningful tax relief to American families this year. But now \nwe are apparently planning to use this year's surplus--the surplus that \nwe were going to give back to the people--for more government spending.\n  The Nickles amendment does seek to protect the Social Security \nsurplus, and I applaud him for that effort. I have consistently \nsupported a lockbox to keep Congress' hands off these retirement funds.\n  However, I oppose the Nickles amendment because it contemplates \nspending the $572 billion allowed under the budget caps, as well as the \n$14 billion in non-Social Security surplus\n\n[[Page S12090]]\n\nfunds, and even billions of dollars more--and then indiscriminately cut \nevery program across-the-board by whatever percentage amount is needed \nto keep us from dipping into Social Security.\n  This ludicrous plan demonstrates just how badly the Congress is \naddicted to pork-barrel spending. Why not just cut out the pork?\n  I have identified over $10 billion in wasteful, unnecessary, and low-\npriority spending in the appropriations bills that have passed the \nSenate this year. Last year, when all was said and done, Congress spent \nover $30 billion on pork, some of it disguised as emergency spending, \nbut most of it everyday, garden-variety pork.\n  If we cut out every one of these pork-barrel spending projects--\nprojects added by Members of Congress for their special interest \nsupporters and parochial concerns--we wouldn't have to resort to budget \ngimmicks like creating a thirteenth month in the next fiscal year, or \ndelaying payments to our neediest families, or resorting to a \nCongressional sequester.\n  I have published on my Senate website voluminous lists that include \nevery earmark and set-aside added by Congress this year and for the \nprevious two years. I urge my colleagues to look over these lists. \nSurely, these pork-barrel projects aren't as deserving of taxpayer \nfunding as, say, funding for our children's education, veterans health \ncare programs, getting our military personnel and their families off \nfood stamps, and the many other national priorities that would be cut \nin an across-the-board sequester gimmick.\n  Mr. President, I also want to make the point that voluntarily \nreturning to the indiscriminate sequestration process of Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings--a process that was instituted as a last-ditch effort to rein \nin enormous annual deficits--is not responsible budgetary stewardship. \nIt is an admission of defeat, an admission that the Congress cannot \ncontrol its appetite for pork-barrel spending.\n  Regarding the Lautenberg amendment, I voted to table that amendment \nfor two reasons. First, by its silence on the issue, the amendment \nimplicitly endorses spending the $14 billion non-Social Security \nsurplus in the appropriations process. Second, the amendment \ncontemplates closing special interest tax loopholes, which I fully \nendorse, but for the purposes of raising more money to spend on more \ngovernment. I believe any revenues raised by making our tax code fairer \nand less skewed toward special interests should be used to provide tax \nrelief for American families.\n  I agree that we must not dip into the Social Security Trust Funds; \nthat would merely exacerbate the impending insolvency of the system. \nBut I cannot support a plan to use the non-Social Security surplus for \nanything other than shoring up Social Security and saving Medicare, \npaying down the $5.6 trillion national debt, and providing tax relief \nto lower- and middle-income Americans. Neither the Nickles or \nLautenberg amendments protect the entire surplus from the greedy hands \nof government.\n  Mr. President, we have a budget process and we have spending caps to \nmake sure we keep the budget balanced. We should ensure that \nappropriations stay within the caps. We should cut out the wasteful and \nunnecessary spending. And we should make sure that America's priorities \nare funded, not the priorities of the special interests.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nAbraham be recognized to offer his amendment, that immediately \nfollowing the reporting by the clerk the bill be laid aside until 9:30 \na.m. on Thursday, and at that time Senator Abraham be recognized to \nmake his opening statement on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have been authorized by the leader to \nsay that in light of this last agreement there will be no further \nrollcall votes this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1828\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for any program for the \n    distribution of sterile needles or syringes for the hypodermic \n                     injection of any illegal drug)\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1828.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan (Mr. Abraham), for himself, Mr. \n     Coverdell, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Ashcroft, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1828.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 80, strike lines 1 through 8, and insert the \n     following:\n       Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     no funds appropriated under this Act shall be used to carry \n     out any program of distributing sterile needles or syringes \n     for the hypodermic injection of any illegal drug.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, if I could, based on the prior agreement \nthat was entered into, we will begin a fuller discussion of this issue \ntomorrow morning, and I will be here along with other Members who wish \nto speak on it.\n  In a nutshell, this amendment to the appropriations bill before us \nwould prohibit the use of our Federal dollars for the purpose of \nengaging in needle exchange programs.\n  I simply wish to indicate that when we discuss this in the morning, I \nwill lay out arguments in support of the amendment. I believe the \narguments would strongly buttress the case that we should not use the \ntaxpayer dollars for purposes of needle exchange programs.\n  I am sure there will be a spirited discussion of this in the morning. \nI look forward to it.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, is the parliamentary situation such that \nthe Senator from Virginia can make a unanimous consent request on a \nmatter not related to the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to address the issue of the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and to apprise the Senate of \ninformation presented at hearings of the Armed Services Committee over \nthe last two days. The committee today conducted the second of its \nseries of three hearings this week on the CTBT.\n  Yesterday morning, the Armed Services Committee heard classified \ntestimony from career professionals, technical experts with decades of \nexperience, from the Department of Energy laboratories and the CIA. At \nthat hearing, the committee received new information having to do with \nthe Russian nuclear stockpile, our ability to verify compliance with \nthe CTBT, as well as DOE lab assessments of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. \nMuch of what the committee heard during that hearing was new \ninformation--information developed over the past 18 months--and \ntherefore was not available to the Congress and the President when the \nCTBT was signed in 1996. Since 1997, when the intelligence community \nreleased its last estimate on our ability to monitor the CTBT, new \ninformation has led the intelligence community--on its own initiative--\nto conclude that a new, updated estimate is needed. I have been \ninformed that this new estimate will be completed late this year or \nearly next year.\n  This morning, the Armed Services Committee heard from the Secretary \nof Defense, William Cohen, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, General Shelton. This afternoon, we heard from Dr. James \nSchlesinger, former Secretary of Defense and Energy and former Director \nof Central Intelligence, and General Shalikashvili, former Chairman of \nthe JCS. Their testimony is available on the Committee's web page.\n  In today's hearing, I highlighted my serious concerns with the CTBT \nin three areas:\n  1. We will not be able to adequately and confidently verify \ncompliance with the treaty.\n  2. CTBT will preclude the United States from taking needed measures \nto ensure the safety and reliability of our stockpile.\n\n[[Page S12091]]\n\n  3. The administration has overstated the effectiveness of the CTBT in \nlessening proliferation.\n  Regarding the safety of the U.S. nuclear stockpile, today's witnesses \nhighlighted the fact that only half of the nuclear weapons in the U.S. \nstockpile today have all the modern safety features that have been \ndeveloped and should be included on these weapon systems. We will not \nbe able to retrofit these safety features in our weapons in the absence \nof nuclear testing. These are weapons that are stored at various \nlocations around the world; weapons that rest in missile tubes \nliterally feet away from the bunks of our submarine crews; weapons that \nare regularly moved across roads and through airfields around the \nworld.\n  Regarding the reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile, Secretary \nCohen and General Shelton acknowledged that it could be ten years or \nmore before we will know whether the Stockpile Stewardship Program--\ncomputer simulation tools--needed to replace nuclear testing will work. \nSecretary Schlesinger clarified that, if we substitute computer \nsimulation for actual nuclear testing, the most we can hope for is that \nthese computer tools will slow the decline--due to aging--in our \nconfidence in the stockpile. Will we ever be able to replace nuclear \ntesting?\n  Regarding proliferation, Secretary Schlesinger highlighted the fact \nthat the diminishing confidence in our stockpile, which is inevitable \nif we were to ratify CTBT, may actually drive some non-nuclear \ncountries to reconsider their need to develop nuclear weapons to \ncompensate for the diminished credibility of the U.S. deterrent force. \nThis declining confidence in the U.S. stockpile is a fact of science \nthat has been progressing since the United States stopped nuclear \ntesting in 1992. Our nuclear weapons are experiencing the natural \nconsequences of aging. Dr. Schlesinger stated it clearly when he asked: \n``Do we want a world that lacks confidence in the U.S. deterrent or \nnot?''\n\n  Regarding verification, this morning Secretary Cohen confirmed that \nthe United States will not be able to detect low yield nuclear testing \nwhich can be carried out in violation of the treaty. In addition, we \nexposed the fallacy of the administration's claim that CTBT will \nprovide us with important on-site inspection rights. We would need to \nget the approval of 30 nations before we could conduct any on-site \ninspections. That will be very difficult, to say the least.\n  Although I believe all of our witnesses have conducted themselves \nvery professionally, I heard nothing at either of our hearings that \nchanges my view of the CTBT. I am deeply concerned that the \nadministration is over-selling the benefits of this treaty while \ndownplaying its many adverse long-term consequences.\n  My bottom line is this: reasonable people can disagree on the impact \nof the CTBT for U.S. national security. As long as there is a \nreasonable doubt about whether the CTBT is in the U.S. national \ninterest, then we should not ratify it.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow morning the Armed Services Committee will \nconduct the third of its CTBT hearings. We will hear from the DOE lab \ndirectors and others responsible for overseeing the stockpile. We will \nalso hear from former officials and other technical experts with years \nof experience in developing, testing and maintaining our nuclear \nweapons.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record material \npresented at today's hearing, including a letter to me dated October 5, \n1999, from former Chairman of the JCS, John W. Vessey, USA-Ret; a \nletter to the Senate leaders from six former Secretaries of Defense and \na letter from other former Government officials.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Garrison, MN, October 5, 1999.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Armed Services Committee,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: If the news reports are correct, the \n     Armed Services Committee will be addressing the proposed \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in the next few days. \n     Although I will not be able to be in Washington during the \n     hearings, I want you to have at least a synopsis of my views \n     on the matter.\n       I believe that ratifying the treaty requiring a permanent \n     zero-yield ban on all underground nuclear tests is not in the \n     security interest of the United States.\n       From 1945 through the end of the Cold War, the United \n     States was clearly the preeminent nuclear power in the world. \n     During much of that time, the nuclear arsenal of the Soviet \n     Union surpassed ours in numbers, but friends and allies, as \n     well as potential enemies and other nations not necessarily \n     friendly to the United States, all understood that we were \n     the nation with the very modern, safe, secure, reliable, \n     usable, nuclear deterrent force which provided the foundation \n     for the security of our nation and for the security of our \n     friends and allies, and much of the world. Periodic \n     underground nuclear tests were an essential part of insuring \n     that our nuclear deterrent force remained modern, safe, \n     secure, reliable and usable. The general knowledge that the \n     United States would do whatever was necessary to maintain \n     that condition certainly reduced the proliferation of nuclear \n     weapons during the period and added immeasurably to the \n     security cooperation with our friends and allies.\n       Times have changed; the Soviet Union no longer exists; \n     however, much of its nuclear arsenal remains in the hands of \n     Russia. We have seen enormous political, economic, social and \n     technological changes in the world since the end of the Cold \n     War, and the these changes have altered the security \n     situation and future security requirements for the United \n     States. One thing has not changed. Nuclear weapons continue \n     to be with us. I do not believe that God will permit us to \n     ``uninvent'' nuclear weapons. Some nation, or power, will be \n     the preeminent nuclear power in the world, and I, for one, \n     believe that at least under present and foreseeable \n     conditions, the world will be safer if that power is the \n     United States of America. We jeopardize maintaining that \n     condition by eschewing the development of new nuclear weapons \n     and by ruling out testing if and when it is needed.\n       Supporters of the CTBT argue that it reduces the chances \n     for nuclear proliferation. I applaud efforts to reduce the \n     proliferation of nuclear weapons, but I do not believe that \n     the test ban will reduce the ability of rogue states to \n     acquire nuclear weapons in sufficient quantities to upset \n     regional security in various parts of the world. ``Gun type'' \n     nuclear weapons can be built with assurance they'll work \n     without testing. The Indian and Pakistani ``tests'' \n     apparently show that there is adequate knowledge available to \n     build implosion type weapons with reasonable assurance that \n     they will work. The Indian/Pakistan explosions have been \n     called ``tests'', but I believe it be more accurate to call \n     them ``demonstrations'', more for political purposes than for \n     scientific testing.\n       Technological advances of recent years, particularly the \n     great increase in computing power coupled with improvements \n     in modeling and simulation have undoubtedly reduced greatly \n     the need for active nuclear testing and probably the size of \n     any needed tests. Some would argue that this should be \n     support for the United States agreeing to ban testing. The \n     new technological advantages are available to everyone, and \n     they probably help the ``proliferator'' more than the United \n     States.\n       We have embarked on a ``stockpile stewardship program'' \n     designed to use science, other than nuclear testing, to \n     ensure that the present weapons in our nuclear deterrent \n     remain safe, secure, and reliable. The estimates I've seen \n     are that we will spend about $5 billion each year on that \n     program. Over twenty years, if the program is completely \n     successful, we will have spent about $100 billion, and we \n     will have replaced nearly every single part in each of those \n     complex weapons. At the end of that period, about the best \n     that we will be able to say is that we have a stockpile of \n     ``restored'' weapons of at least thirty-year-old design that \n     are probably safe and secure and whose reliability is the \n     best we can make without testing. We will not be able to say \n     that the stockpile is modern, nor will we be assured that it \n     is usable in the sense of fitting the security situation we \n     will face twenty years hence. To me that seems to foretell a \n     situation of increasing vulnerability for use and our friends \n     and allies to threats from those who will not be deterred by \n     the Nonproliferation Treaty or the CTBT, and there will \n     surely be such states.\n       If the United States is to remain the preeminent nuclear \n     power, and maintain a modern safe secure, reliable, and \n     usable nuclear deterrent force, I believe we need to continue \n     to develop new nuclear weapons designed to incorporate the \n     latest in technology and to meet the changing security \n     situation in the world. Changes in the threat, changes in \n     intelligence and targeting, and great improvements in \n     delivery precision and accuracy make the weapons we designed \n     thirty years ago less and less applicable to our current and \n     projected security situation. The United States, the one \n     nation most of the world looks to for securing peace in the \n     world, should not deny itself the opportunity to test the \n     bedrock building block of its security, its nuclear deterrent \n     force, if conditions require testing.\n       To those who would see in my words advocacy for a nuclear \n     buildup or advocacy for large numbers of high-yield nuclear \n     tests, let me say that I believe we can have a modern, safe, \n     secure, reliable and usable nuclear deterrent force at much \n     lower numbers than we now maintain. I believe we can keep it \n     modern and reliable with very few actual nuclear tests and \n     that those tests can in all\n\n[[Page S12092]]\n\n     likelihood be relatively low-yield tests. I also believe that \n     the more demonstrably modern and usable is our nuclear \n     deterrent force, the less likely are we to need to use it, \n     but we must have modern weapons, and we ought not deny \n     ourselves the opportunity to test if we deem it necessary.\n           Very respectfully yours,\n\n                                               John W. Vessey,\n\n                             General, USA (Ret.), Former Chairman,\n     Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lott and Daschle: As the Senate weighs \n     whether to approve the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), \n     we believe Senators will be obliged to focus on one dominant, \n     inescapable result were it to be ratified: over the decades \n     ahead, confidence in the reliability of our nuclear weapons \n     stockpile would inevitably decline, thereby reducing the \n     credibility of America's nuclear deterrent. Unlike previous \n     efforts at a CTBT, this Treaty is intended to be of unlimited \n     duration, and though ``nuclear weapon test explosion'' is \n     undefined in the Treaty, by America's unilateral declaration \n     the accord is ``zero-yield,'' meaning that all nuclear tests, \n     even of the lowest yield, are permanently prohibited.\n       The nuclear weapons in our nation's arsenal are \n     sophisticated devices, whose thousands of components must \n     function together with split-second timing and scant margin \n     for error. A nuclear weapon contains radioactive material, \n     which in itself decays, and also changes the properties of \n     other materials within the weapon. Over time, the components \n     of our weapons corrode and deteriorate, and we lack \n     experience predicting the effects of such aging on the safety \n     and reliability of the weapons. The shelf life of U.S. \n     nuclear weapons was expected to be some 20 years. In the \n     past, the constant process of replacement and testing of new \n     designs gave some assurance that weapons in the arsenal would \n     be both new and reliable. But under the CTBT, we would be \n     vulnerable to the effects of aging because we could not test \n     ``fixes'' of problems with existing warheads.\n       Remanufacturing components of existing weapons that have \n     deteriorated also poses significant problems. Manufacturers \n     go out of business, materials and production processes \n     change, certain chemicals previously used in production are \n     now forbidden under new environmental regulations, and so on. \n     It is a certainty that new processes and materials--\n     untested--will be used. Even more important, ultimately the \n     nuclear ``pits'' will need to be replaced--and we will not be \n     able to test those replacements. The upshot is that new \n     defects may be introduced into the stockpile through \n     remanufacture, and without testing we can never be certain \n     that these replacement components will work as their \n     predecessors did.\n       Another implication of a CTBT of unlimited duration is that \n     over time we would gradually lose our pool of knowledgeable \n     people with experience in nuclear weapons design and testing. \n     Consider what would occur if the United States halted nuclear \n     testing for 30 years. We would then be dependent on the \n     judgment of personnel with no personal experience either in \n     designing or testing nuclear weapons. In place of a learning \n     curve, we would experience an extended unlearning curve.\n       Furthermore, major gaps exist in our scientific \n     understanding of nuclear explosives. As President Bush noted \n     in a report to Congress in January 1993, ``Of all U.S. \n     nuclear weapons designs fielded since 1958, approximately \n     one-third have required nuclear testing to resolve problems \n     arising after deployment.'' We were discovering defects in \n     our arsenal up until the moment when the current moratorium \n     on U.S. testing was imposed in 1992. While we have \n     uncovered similar defects since 1992, which in the past \n     would have led to testing, in the absence of testing, we \n     are not able to test whether the ``fixes'' indeed work.\n       Indeed, the history of maintaining complex military \n     hardware without testing demonstrates the pitfalls of such an \n     approach. Prior to World War II, the Navy's torpedoes had not \n     been adequately tested because of insufficient funds. It took \n     nearly two years of war before we fully solved the problems \n     that caused our torpedoes to routinely pass harmlessly under \n     the target or to fail to explode on contact. For example, at \n     the Battle of Midway, the U.S. launched 47 torpedo aircraft, \n     without damaging a single Japanese ship. If not for our dive \n     bombers, the U.S. would have lost the crucial naval battle of \n     the Pacific war.\n       The Department of Energy has structured a program of \n     experiments and computer simulations called the Stockpile \n     Stewardship Program, that it hopes will allow our weapons to \n     be maintained without testing. This program, which will not \n     be mature for at least 10 years, will improve our scientific \n     understanding of nuclear weapons and would likely mitigate \n     the decline in our confidence in the safety and reliability \n     of our arsenal. We will never know whether we should trust \n     Stockpile Stewardship if we cannot conduct nuclear tests to \n     calibrate the unproven new techniques. Mitigation is, of \n     course, not the same as prevention. Over the decades, the \n     erosion of confidence inevitably would be substantial.\n       The decline in confidence in our nuclear deterrent is \n     particularly troublesome in light of the unique geopolitical \n     role of the United States. The U.S. has a far-reaching \n     foreign policy agenda and our forces are stationed around the \n     globe. In addition, we have pledged to hold a nuclear \n     umbrella over our NATO allies and Japan Though we have \n     abandoned chemical and biological weapons, we have threatened \n     to retaliate with nuclear weapons to such an attack. In the \n     Gulf War, such a threat was apparently sufficient to deter \n     Iraq from using chemical weapons against American troops.\n       We also do not believe the CTBT will do much to prevent the \n     spread of nuclear weapons. The motivation of rogue nations \n     like North Korea and Iraq to acquire nuclear weapons will not \n     be affected by whether the U.S. tests. Similarly, the \n     possession of nuclear weapons by nations like India, \n     Pakistan, and Israel depends on the security environment in \n     their region, not by whether or not the U.S. tests. IF \n     confidence in the U.S. nuclear deterrent were to decline, \n     countries that have relied on our protection could well feel \n     compelled to seek nuclear capabilities of their own. Thus, \n     ironically, the CTBT might cause additional nations to seek \n     nuclear weapons.\n       Finally, it is impossible to verify a ban that extends to \n     very low yields. The likelihood of cheating is high. ``Trust \n     but verify'' should remain our guide. Tests with yields below \n     1 kiloton can both go undetected and be military useful to \n     the testing state. Furthermore, a significantly larger \n     explosion can go undetected--or be mistaken for a \n     conventional explosion used for mining or an earthquake--if \n     the test is ``decoupled.'' Decoupling involves conducting the \n     test in a large underground cavity and has been shown to \n     dampen an explosion's seismic signature by a factor of up to \n     70. The U.S. demonstrated this capability in 1966 in two \n     tests conducted in salt domes at Chilton, Mississippi.\n       We believe that these considerations render a permanent, \n     zero-yield Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty incompatible with \n     the Nation's international commitments and vital security \n     interests and believe it does not deserve the Senate's advice \n     and consent. Accordingly, we respectfully urge you and your \n     colleagues to preserve the right of this nation to conduct \n     nuclear tests necessary to the future viability of our \n     nuclear deterrent by rejecting approval of the present CTBT.\n           Respectfully,\n     James R. Schlesinger.\n     Frank C. Carlucci.\n     Donald H. Rumsfeld.\n     Richard B. Cheney.\n     Caspar W. Weinberger.\n     Melvin R.

Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lott and Daschle: The Senate is beginning \n     hearings on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (``CTBT''), \n     looking to an October 12 vote on whether or not to ratify. We \n     believe, however, that it is not in the national interest to \n     vote on the Treaty, at least during the life of the present \n     Congress.\n       The simple fact is that the Treaty will not enter into \n     force any time soon, whether or not the United States \n     ratifies it during the 106th Congress. This means that few, \n     if any, of the benefits envisaged by the Treaty's advocates \n     could be realized by Senate ratification now. At the same \n     time, there could be real costs and risks to a broad range of \n     national security interests--including our non-proliferation \n     objectives--if Senate acts prematurely.\n       Ratification of the CTBT by the U.S. now will not result in \n     the Treaty coming into force this fall, as anticipated at its \n     signing. Given its objectives, the Treaty wisely requires \n     that each of 44 specific countries must sign and ratify the \n     document before it enters into force. Only 23 of those \n     countries have done so thus far. So the Treaty is not coming \n     into force any time soon, whether or not the U.S. ratifies. \n     The U.S. should take advantage of this situation to delay \n     consideration of ratification, without prejudice to eventual \n     action on the Treaty. This would provide the opportunity to \n     learn more about such issues as movement on the ratification \n     process, technical progress in the Department of Energy's \n     Stockpile Stewardship Program, the political consequences of \n     the India/Pakistan detonations, changing Russian doctrine \n     toward greater reliance on nuclear weapons, and continued \n     Chinese development of a nuclear arsenal.\n       Supporters of the CTBT claim that it will make a major \n     contribution to limiting the spread of nuclear weapons. This \n     cannot be true if key countries of proliferation concern do \n     not agree to accede to the Treaty. To date, several of these \n     countries, including India, Pakistan, North Korea, Iran, \n     Iraq, and Syria, have not signed and ratified the Treaty. \n     Many of these countries may never join the CTBT regime, and \n     ratification by the United States, early or late, is unlikely \n     to have any impact on their decisions in this regard. For \n     example, no serious person should believe that rogue nations \n     like Iran\n\n[[Page S12093]]\n\n     or Iraq will give up their efforts to acquire nuclear weapons \n     if only the United States signs the CTBT.\n       Our efforts to combat proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction not only deserve but are receiving the highest \n     national security priority. It is clear to any fair-minded \n     observer that the United States has substantially reduced its \n     reliance on nuclear weapons. The U.S. also has made or \n     committed to dramatic reductions in the level of deployed \n     nuclear forces. Nevertheless, for the foreseeable future, the \n     United States must continue to rely on nuclear weapons to \n     contribute to the deterrence of certain kinds of attacks on \n     the United States, its friends, and allies. In addition, \n     several countries depend on the U.S. nuclear deterrent for \n     their security. A lack of confidence in that deterrent might \n     itself result in the spread of nuclear weapons.\n       As a consequence, the United States must continue to ensure \n     that its nuclear weapons remain safe, secure, and reliable. \n     But the fact is that the scientific case simply has not been \n     made that, over the long term, the United States can ensure \n     the nuclear stockpile without nuclear testing. The United \n     States is seeking to ensure the integrity of its nuclear \n     deterrent through an ambitious effort called the Stockpile \n     Stewardship Program. This program attempts to maintain \n     adequate knowledge of nuclear weapons physics indirectly by \n     computer modeling, simulation, and other experiments. We \n     support this kind of scientific and analytic effort. But even \n     with adequate funding--which is far from assured--the \n     Stockpile Stewardship Program is not sufficiently mature to \n     evaluate the extent to which it can be a suitable alternative \n     to testing.\n       Given the absence of any pressing reason for early \n     ratification, it is unwise to take actions now that constrain \n     this or future Presidents' choices about how best to pursue \n     our non-proliferation and other national security goals while \n     maintaining the effectiveness and credibility of our nuclear \n     deterrent. Accordingly, we urge you to reach an understanding \n     with the President to suspend action on the CTBT, at least \n     for the duration of the 106th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     Brent Scowcroft.\n     Henry A. Kissinger.\n     John Deutch.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/06/senate-section/article/S12093-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, today I attended an event in the White \nHouse at which 31 nobel laureates, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, four previous chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \nSecretary of Defense, and the President, among many others, supported \nthe ratification by the Senate of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty.\n  The point was made in those presentations that this treaty is not \nabout politics. It is not about political parties. It is about the \nissue of the proliferation or spread of nuclear weapons and whether the \nUnited States of America should ratify a treaty signed by the President \nand sent to the Senate over 700 days ago that calls for a ban on all \nfurther testing of nuclear weapons all around the world.\n  For some months, I have been coming to the floor of the Senate \nsuggesting that after nearly 2 years we ought to be debating the \nquestion of whether this country should ratify the Comprehensive \nNuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n  I have exhibited charts that have shown the Senate what has happened \nwith respect to other treaties that have been sent to the Senate by \nvarious Presidents, how long it has taken for them to be considered, \nthe conditions under which they were considered, and I have made the \npoint that this treaty alone has languished for over 2 years without \nhearings and without discussion. Why? Because there are some in the \nSenate who oppose it and don't want it to be debated or voted upon.\n\n  There are small issues and big issues in the course of events in the \nSenate. We spent many hours over a period of days debating whether to \nchange the name of Washington's National Airport. What a debate that \nwas--whether to change the name of Washington National Airport. That \nwas a small issue. It was proposed that former President Reagan's name \nbe put on that airport. Some agreed, some disagreed. We had a vote, \nafter a debate over a number of days. The naming of an airport, in my \njudgment, is a small issue.\n  An example of a big issue is whether we are going to do something as \na country to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Now a big issue comes \nto the floor of the Senate in the form of a request for ratification of \na treaty called the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It is not a new \nidea, not a new issue. It started with President Dwight Eisenhower \nbelieving we ought to exhibit the leadership to see if we could stop \nall the testing of nuclear weapons around the rest of the world. It has \ntaken over 40 years. Actually, 7 years ago this country took unilateral \naction and said: We are going to stop testing. We, the United States, \nwill no longer test nuclear weapons. So we took the lead, and we \ndecided 7 years ago we would not any longer test nuclear weapons.\n  The treaty that is now before the Senate, that was negotiated with \nmany other countries around the world in the last 5 years and sent to \nthe Senate over 2 years ago, is a treaty that answers the question: \nWill other countries do what we have done? Will we be able to persuade \nother countries to decide not to test nuclear weapons?\n  Why is that important? Because no country that has nuclear weapons \ncan acquire more advanced weaponry without testing. And no country that \ndoes not now have nuclear weapons can acquire nuclear weapons with any \nassurance they have nuclear weapons that work without testing. Prohibit \ntesting, stop the testing of nuclear weapons, and you take a step in \nthe direction of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons around this \nworld.\n  We have some 30,000 nuclear weapons in the arsenals of Russia and the \nUnited States. We have other countries that possess nuclear weapons. We \nhave still other countries that want to possess nuclear weapons. We \nhave a world that is a dangerous world with respect to the potential \nspread of nuclear weapons. The question is, what shall we do about \nthat? What kind of behavior, what kind of response in this country, is \nappropriate to deal with that question?\n  Some say the response is to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. \nI believe that. I believe that very strongly. Others say this treaty \nwill weaken our country, that this treaty is not good for our country, \nthis treaty will sacrifice our security. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. Nothing. Some say that--not all--have never supported any \narms control agreements, never liked them. I understand that, despite \nthe fact those people have been wrong.\n  Arms control agreements have worked. Actually, agreements that we \nhave reached through the ratification of treaties have resulted in the \nreduction of nuclear warheads, the reduction of delivery vehicles. Some \narms control treaties have worked. However, there are some who have not \nsupported any of those treaties. I guess they are content to believe it \nis their job to oppose treaties. There are others who have \nsupported previous treaties who somehow believe this treaty is \ninappropriate. Perhaps they read a newspaper article last week that \nsaid there are new appraisals or new assessments by the CIA that \nsuggest it would be difficult for us to monitor low-level nuclear \ntests. That article was wrong. The article in the newspaper that said \nthe CIA has a new assessment or a new report is wrong. The CIA has no \nnew assessment. The CIA has no new reports. I have talked to the \nDirector of the CIA. No such report and no such assessment exists.\n\n  Do we have difficulty detecting low-level nuclear explosions, very \nlow-level nuclear explosions? The answer is yes. But then, the answer \nis also: Yes; so what? Will the ability to detect those kinds of small \nexplosions--explosions which, by the way, don't give anyone any \nenhanced capability in nuclear power or nuclear weaponry--will we be \nable to better detect those and better monitor those if we pass this \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty? The answer to that is an unqualified \nyes.\n  I have a chart to demonstrate what I mean. This chart shows the \ncurrent monitoring network by which we attempt to monitor where nuclear \ntests may have occurred in the world. This bottom chart shows current \nmonitoring. The top chart shows monitoring\n\n[[Page S12094]]\n\nthat will occur after we have a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in place. \nIs there anyone who can argue that having this enhanced monitoring in \nplace will not enhance our capability of detecting nuclear weapons \ntests? Of course it will. That is why every senior military officer in \nthis country who has been involved in this--from the Joint Chiefs to \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs to the other senior officers--have \nsaid passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is good for this \ncountry and will not jeopardize this country's security. They know and \nwe know it will enhance this country's ability to detect nuclear tests \nanywhere around the world.\n  It baffles me that on an issue this big and this important, we have \npeople who seem to not want to understand and debate the facts. I \nmentioned I have been on the floor for some months pushing for \nconsideration of this treaty. Probably partly as a result of that, \nprobably partly as a result of a letter that all 45 Members of the \nDemocratic caucus sent to the majority leader saying we think the \nSenate ought to consider this treaty, we ought to have hearings, about \na week ago the majority leader abruptly decided, all right, we will \nconsider this Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; we will consider it by \nhaving a vote in a matter of 10 days or so.\n  We had held no hearings. This has not been a thoughtful process of \nconsideration. We have not held comprehensive hearings; we have sparked \nno national debate. We will just go to a vote--as far as I am \nconcerned, that is not a very responsible thing to do, but I won't \nobject to that--go to a vote if that is what you want to do.\n  It is very interesting how those in this Chamber treat the light \nseriously and treat the serious lightly. If ever there was a case of \ntreating serious issues lightly, it is this. We have a treaty dealing \nwith the banning of nuclear testing in this world, negotiated and \nsigned by 145 countries, languishing here for 2 years, and now in 10 \ndays let's have a vote--and, by the way, we don't intend on having \nsignificant hearings.\n  The Senator from Virginia indicated he will have hearings. I applaud \nhim for that. He is a thoughtful Senator, in my judgment; I respect him \ndeeply. He disagrees with me on this issue. I have deep respect for \nhim. I think it is appropriate there are hearings being held this week. \nI think they probably thought--some thought--you can't call this up for \na vote without at least showing you will have some hearings. I am told \nthe requests to have people testify at the hearings who support the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty was not met with great success. Who \nknows; we will see the record of that, I suppose, toward the end of the \nweek.\n  Let me show what our allies have done with respect to this treaty. We \nspent a lot of time on the floor of the Senate talking about NATO. We \nhave been involved with NATO, in Kosovo and elsewhere. In fact, the \nSenate voted to expand NATO. NATO is an important security alliance. \nWhat have our NATO allies done with respect to this Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty? Most of them have already ratified it. Two of the NATO \nnuclear powers have ratified the treaty, England and France. NATO \nitself endorsed the treaty at the April 1999 conference. The United \nStates has yet to ratify it. Some would say: Neither have China and \nRussia. Of course they are not NATO members. Neither have China nor \nRussia. That is true, they have not. They will, in my judgment, when \nthis country ratifies it. They did when this country ratified the \nchemical weapons treaty.\n\n  My point is this: I think this country has a responsibility to \nprovide leadership, moral leadership, on an issue this important. Are \nthere questions that can be raised about this treaty? Yes. And every \nsingle one of them can be answered easily and decisively, every one. \nThere is not a question that has been raised that casts a shred of \ndoubt on what the outcome ought to be on the vote in this Senate on \nthis treaty. If you believe this country has a responsibility to \nprovide leadership to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and reduce the \nthreat of nuclear war, then this Senate ought to ratify this treaty.\n  Perhaps it would be useful to quote President Kennedy who succeeded \nPresident Eisenhower. President Eisenhower, 40 years ago, said:\n\n       One of greatest regrets of any administration of any time \n     would be the failure to achieve a nuclear test ban treaty.\n\n  President Kennedy, following President Eisenhower's lead, said the \nfollowing:\n\n       A comprehensive test ban would place the nuclear powers in \n     a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest \n     hazards man faces. It would increase our security. It would \n     decrease the prospects of war. Surely this goal is \n     sufficiently important to require steady pursuit, yielding \n     neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort nor the \n     temptation to give up our insistence on responsible \n     safeguards.\n\n  President Johnson said:\n\n       We shall demonstrate that, despite all his problems, \n     quarrels and distractions, man still retains a capacity to \n     design his fate rather than be engulfed by it. Failure to \n     complete our work will be interpreted by our children and \n     grandchildren as a betrayal of conscience in a world that \n     needs all of its resources and talents to serve life, not \n     death.\n\n  When Nikita Khrushchev, in discussions and dialog with President \nKennedy, described nuclear war as ``a circumstance in which the living \nwould envy the dead,'' that was almost 40 years ago, long, long ago, \nbefore we had arsenals of 30,000 nuclear weapons, some in airplanes, \nsome on submarines, some on missiles, some in storage facilities, with \nmany countries around the world wanting to achieve the opportunity to \npossess nuclear weapons.\n  We have very few opportunities to do work as important as will be \ndone if the Senate ratifies this treaty. My expectation is that when we \ndebate this treaty in the coming couple of days--the schedule is for a \ndebate Friday and a debate the following Tuesday--at the culmination of \n14 hours, we would discuss the advisability of the Senate ratifying \nthis treaty. There will be a lot of discussion by those who believe it \nis ill advised and by those who believe it is imperative the Senate \nratify this treaty.\n\n  Let me make a couple of other comments that might describe some of \nthis debate. The debate will not be about the American people's \ninterests. According to surveys, 82 percent of the American people \nsupport a comprehensive nuclear test ban--82 percent of the American \npeople. The debate, in my judgment, will not be about espionage by the \nChinese. Some have said the Chinese espionage allegations at National \nLaboratories actually weaken the case for a Comprehensive Nuclear Test \nBan Treaty. In fact the Cox report, which was published earlier this \nyear, pointed out that if China were a signatory to and were to adhere \nto the CTBT, its ability to modernize its nuclear arsenal would be \nsignificantly curtailed.\n  Let me put up the chart of the monitoring stations. After we ratify \nthe treaty, let me ask if anyone in this Chamber could make the \nargument that we have less capability to monitor than we do now? No one \ncan make that case. We will have more capability. And no one can make \nthe case there is some new assessment or new report by the CIA that \nposes a danger, saying we can't detect tests of nuclear explosions. \nThat is not accurate either. Despite the story in the newspaper, the \nCIA says there is no new assessment. The CIA says there is no new \nreport.\n  Can we detect low-level explosions that have no consequence in the \ndevelopment of advanced weapons or the acquisition of nuclear weapons? \nThe answer is no; we cannot detect those low-level explosions. And the \nresponse is, so what? So what? We could not 4 years ago; we cannot now. \nHave our abilities to detect been enhanced in the last few years? The \nanswer is yes. But we will hear those charges nonetheless. I think it \nis important for people to understand the charges are without merit.\n  Today at the White House, 31 Nobel laureates were in attendance. \nThese are those honored physicists and chemists who have won the \nhighest awards, who have powerful intellects, the scientists who \nunderstand and evaluate these issues. One of those scientists who spoke \ntoday is Dr. Charles Townes. He is the man who invented radar during \nthe Second World War for our airplanes, and the laser--a towering \nintellect. He spoke with passion about the need for this country to \nratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n  These scientists almost uniformly indicate they have no questions \nabout our ability to detect explosions of consequence. They have no \nquestions\n\n[[Page S12095]]\n\nabout our ability to require compliance with this treaty and detect \ncheating. In the front row of that meeting at the White House today \nwere the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili, the former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs; General Shelton, the current Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs; Gen. David Jones, a former Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs; Admiral Crowe, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs--all of them \nwere there to support this treaty.\n  Why? Because it weakens this country? No; of course that's absurd. It \ndoes not weaken this country. They were there because they know it \nstrengthens this country. They know, from a security standpoint and \nfrom a military standpoint, the ratification of this treaty strengthens \nthis country.\n  I know I have heard about briefings that are held which suggest that \nthere is information that is not available to the American people that \nsuggests something different. It is not the case. It is just not the \ncase. I am sorry. I respect those who disagree with me. They are \nwelcome to come to the floor of the Senate, and will, and they will \ndebate. I am sure they will be persuasive, in their own way. But I am \ntelling you in my judgment, there is nothing, there is nothing that \nwould persuade the last four Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nincluding Gen. Colin Powell, to support the ratification of this test \nban treaty if they felt this treaty would injure this country.\n  Does anyone in this Chamber believe that Gen. Colin Powell is \nadvocating ratification of a treaty that will weaken this country? If \nso, come and tell us that. Or perhaps we will have people come and say \nGen. Colin Powell doesn't understand. Or, if he understands, he is \nmisinformed. I don't think so. Not General Powell, not General \nShalikashvili, not General Jones, not Admiral Crowe, and not General \nShelton. All of them come to the same conclusion: This treaty will \nstrengthen our country. The ratification of this treaty will strengthen \nthe security of this country. The ratification of this treaty will \nallow us to better monitor whether anyone cheats on a treaty that is \ndesigned to ban nuclear testing.\n  Again, there is room for disagreement, but in my judgment there is \nnot room for the Senate to say to the world: We quit testing in 1992 \nunilaterally, and our position is we quit testing, but anyone else out \nthere, our message is: You go ahead; we do not want to impose the same \nlimitation on you; we have quit testing nuclear weapons, but we do not \nwant to impose the limitation on you.\n  We have two countries that have nuclear capability: India and \nPakistan. They do not like each other much, and they are neighbors. \nThey share a contentious border. Earlier this year, they each exploded \na nuclear weapon literally under each other's chin. That should provide \na sober warning to the rest of this world that we need to stop nuclear \ntesting and need a ban on nuclear testing, especially to the Senate, a \nsenate in a country that possesses the best capability of leadership in \nthe entire world on this issue. The proliferation of nuclear weapons \nand the willingness to use them, the willingness to test them, is a \nvery serious issue. It is a big issue, and this Senate has a \nresponsibility to address it.\n  It would be unthinkable for me to see this Senate proceed in the \nmanner it now appears to be proceeding, and that is to take an issue \nthis important and to blithely say: All right, it's been here 2 years; \nwe have not cared much about it, and a week from Tuesday, we will bring \nit up and kill it because we do not believe in arms control; if you \ndon't like that, that's tough luck.\n  That is not a responsible way to legislate. I did not object to \nbringing it up on Tuesday. There was a unanimous consent request. I did \nnot object to it. If that is the only way to get a vote, as far as I am \nconcerned, so be it. But it is not a responsible way to legislate. All \nof us know better than that. We know better on issues this important \nthat the way to legislate is to take a treaty that has been signed by \n154 countries, and have a series of hearings. We should have men and \nwomen across this country weigh in on this issue, have a robust, \naggressive, thoughtful, interesting, exciting debate, and then the \nSenate should vote. That is not what has happened here. We know that.\n  Two years have passed, and this treaty has been in prison. This \ntreaty has not seen the light of day. I know we had a Senator saying \nthat is not true, there have been hearings. Senator Biden came to the \nfloor to refute that. There have been no hearings. This week, there \nhave been a couple of hearings. The Senator from Virginia just talked \nabout hearings. He is a man for whom I have great respect. I only \nregret he is on the other side of this issue.\n  Everyone in this Chamber knows better than to proceed with this issue \nin this manner. This has great consequences all around the world. This \ncountry has a responsibility all around the world. Everybody in this \nChamber knows better. That is not the way you handle a treaty of this \nimportance, by standing up and saying: If you want a treaty, then let's \ndo it in 10 days, and if you don't like it, tough luck.\n  If that is the only opportunity presented to the Senate to decide we \nare going to lead the world in arms control and say to the rest of the \nworld we have quit testing nuclear weapons and we want you to as well, \nwe are going to ratify the treaty, that is fine.\n  If there are those who stand up and say: We do not support a ban on \nnuclear testing; in fact, we ought to test more; we do not want to send \na signal to India and Pakistan not to test; we do not want to send a \nmessage to Russia and China to ratify the pact, they can say that. That \nis the democratic way. But they will not say it with my vote. It is the \nwrong direction for this country. It is not leadership. It is an \nabdication of leadership, in my judgment. I hope in the coming days we \nwill find a way to see if we cannot have a more thoughtful approach to \nthis country doing what it ought to do.\n  I want to conclude with one additional chart that has some quotes \nwhich I think are important. This is the Joint Chiefs of Staff Annual \nPosture Statement 1999, responding to the question raised by those in \nthe Senate who say the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will injure this \ncountry's preparedness and security. Nonsense. It says:\n\n       In a very real sense, one of the best ways to protect our \n     troops and our interests is to promote arms control. . . . In \n     both the conventional and nuclear realms, arms control can \n     reduce the chances of conflict. . . . Our efforts to reduce \n     the numbers of nuclear weapons coincide with efforts to \n     control testing of nuclear weapons . . . and the Joint Chiefs \n     support ratification of this treaty.\n\n  I want to hear in this debate from those who believe that the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, heading the military services in our country, have \nsomehow concluded they want to support something that injures this \ncountry's defense. It is preposterous. The Joint Chiefs of Staff \nsupport this because they understand it will enhance this country's \ndefense; it will make this country and this world more secure.\n  Gen. Colin Powell, General Shalikashvili, Adm. William Crowe, and \nGen. David Jones said the following:\n\n       We support Senate approval of the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty together with six safeguards under which the President \n     will be prepared to conduct necessary testing if the safety \n     and reliability of our nuclear deterrent could no longer be \n     verified.\n\n  This treaty has safeguards. Gen. Colin Powell says he supports this \ntreaty. It will not injure this country's security or preparedness. I \ndo not think we have to go further on the floor of the Senate. We can \nhave folks come over here and raise their fists, get red in the face, \nthe veins in their necks can bulge, they can hyperventilate, and they \ncan speak loudly about their vision of what this might or might not do \nwith respect to this country's military preparedness. But when they are \ndone, I will ask them to go visit with Colin Powell, I will ask them to \nvisit with General Shelton or the Joint Chiefs of Staff and try to \nreconcile the position the military leaders in this country have taken \nwith respect to this treaty to the allegations made without a good \nbasis on the floor of the Senate about this treaty.\n  We are given 14 hours, starting Friday and continuing Tuesday, to \ndebate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. If that is the procedure for \ndebate that exists at the end of this week, then I will be here, and I \nintend to speak at some length, as will my colleagues, Senator Biden \nand many others, who feel strongly about this.\n\n[[Page S12096]]\n\n  I look forward to engaging in this debate. I know there are some who \nare concerned, upset, and nervous about heading toward a vote that \nlooks as if we probably will lose. But I say this: At least we are on \nthe right subject for a change. At least we are talking about the right \nissue for a change. If talking about the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \ntakes goading the majority into saying to us: We are going to give you \n10 days with no hearings, essentially, and then we are going to force \nyou to vote and defeat this treaty because that is what we want to tell \nthe world about our position on nuclear weapons and arms control, that \nis fine with me because we are talking about the right subject.\n\n  If we do not ratify this treaty now, we will ratify it next year, and \nif we do not ratify it next year, then we will ratify it the year \nafter. Because at some point, when 82 percent of the American people \nwant arms control to reduce the spread of nuclear weapons through the \nratification of this treaty, and when the Joint Chiefs of Staff say it \nwill not injure the security of this country, at some point the \nAmerican people will say: We want to have our way on this issue, and we \nwill impress our way on this issue by having the Senate come to this \nChamber and vote for ratification. If not now, later. But at some \npoint, the American people will demand this country provide leadership \nin reducing the threat of nuclear war and reducing the spread of \nnuclear weapons.\n  The Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, is on the floor. I mentioned a \ncouple of times--I did not mention his name--but I referred to him as \n``the Senator from Virginia.''\n  I say to Senator Warner, I mentioned--when I think you were not on \nthe floor--one of my great regrets is that you are not with us on this \nissue because I have great respect for you and your abilities. I also \nappreciate the fact that some hearings are being held this week.\n  But I confess, as I have said, I think this is not a good, thoughtful \nway to deal with something this important. I am not talking about the \nSenator's hearings. I am talking about, after 2 years of virtually no \nactivity, saying: All right. Ten days from now we're going to have a \nvote. In the meantime, we'll cobble together a couple hearings and then \nfigure how we get there, and vote the treaty down, and tell the world \nthat is our judgment.\n  I do not think that is a good way to do it. I think that is treating \nthe serious too lightly. I do not think it is the best we can do. The \nbetter way for us to have done this, in my judgment, is to have decided \nwe would hold a comprehensive set of hearings over a rather lengthy \nperiod of time, develop a national discussion about the import and \nconsequence of a treaty of this type, and then have the Senate consider \nit. That is not what is being done.\n  If we vote next Tuesday, I am here and I am ready. I am ready Friday \nand Tuesday to debate it. But I very much wish this had been dealt with \nin a much more responsible way. By that comment, I do not mean to \nsuggest the Senator from Virginia is in any way involved in that. I, \nagain, appreciate the fact that he is holding some hearings this week, \nhearing from people who are weighing in on both sides of this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I simply say to my good friend and colleague that I \naddressed many of the issues he has addressed in the last few minutes \nin a press conference today that I think covers the work of the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  We are trying to do a very thorough job. We have had 10 hours of \nhearings in the last 48 hours. We will go into lengthy hearings again \ntomorrow morning.\n  I thank my friend for his views.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/06/senate-section/article/S12096-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12096-S12097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HIGH DENSITY RULE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, although I have serious reservations with \nrespect to one or two provisions, I rise in support of the amendment by \nSenators Gorton and Rockefeller to replace the slot-related provisions \nin the bill.\n  It won't surprise anyone to hear that my reservations primarily \nconcern Reagan National. It is deeply regrettable that the amendment \ntakes a step backward in terms of competitive access to Reagan \nNational. The Commerce Committee overwhelmingly approved providing 48 \nslot exemptions for more service. This amendment will cut that number \nin half. I understand that this bill may not have come to the floor if \nthis compromise had not been made, but I certainly am not happy about \nit. Nevertheless, some additional access is better than none at all.\n  The most frustrating aspect of this compromise is that the continued \nexistence of slot and perimeter restrictions at Reagan National flies \nin the face of every independent analysis of the situation. To support \nmy position, I can quote at length from reports by the General \nAccounting Office (GAO), the National Research Council, and others, all \nof which conclude that slots and perimeter rules are anticompetitive, \nunfair, unneeded, and harmful to consumers. Despite the voluminous \nsupport for the fact that these restrictions are bad public policy, we \nallow them to continue.\n  Reagan National should not receive special treatment just because it \nis located inside the Beltway. This amendment will already lead to the \neventual elimination of the high density rule at O'Hare, Kennedy, and \nLaGuardia. If we believe it is good policy at those airports, why is it \nnot the same for Reagan National? Arguments that opening up the airport \nto more service and competition will harm safety, exceed capacity, or \nadversely affect other airports in the region are without merit. The \nGAO recently concluded that the proposals in the committee-reported \nbill are well within capacity limits and would not significantly impact \nnearby airports. In addition, the DOT believes that increased flights \nwould not be a safety risk.\n  With any luck, the wisdom and benefits of increasing airline \ncompetition will eventually win out over narrow parochial interests. It \nsaddens me to say that it will not happen today. Another opportunity to \ndo the right thing by the traveling public is being missed.\n  But my concerns about the Reagan National provisions do not in any \nway diminish my enthusiastic support for the other competition \nenhancing provisions in the bill. Eliminating the slot controls at the \nother restricted airports is a remarkable win for the principle of \ncompetition and for consumers. As GAO and others have repeatedly found, \nmore competition leads to lower fares and better service. And in the \ninterim, new entrants and small communities will benefit from enhanced \naccess, which is more good news.\n  I want to make our intent clear with respect to the provisions that \ngovern the time period before the slot restrictions are lifted. We are \nproviding additional access for new service to small communities and \nfor new entrants and limited incumbent airlines. Because these airports \nare already dominated by the major airlines, which jealously hold on to \nslots to keep competitors out, we intentionally limited their ability \nto take advantage of the new opportunities.\n  The amendment directs that Secretary of Transportation to treat \ncommuter affiliates of the major airlines the same, for purposes of \napplying for slot exemptions and for gaining interim access to O'Hare. \nLet me be perfectly clear about what this provision means. It means the \nSecretary should consider commuter affiliates as new entrants or \nlimited incumbents for purposes of applying for slot exemptions and \ninterim access to O'Hare. A major airline should not be allowed to game \nthe system and add to its hundreds of daily slots through its commuter \naffiliates and codeshare partners. Genuine new entrants and limited \nincumbents are startup airlines that cannot get competitive access to \nthe high density markets.\n  Many provisions in this amendment are just as that Senate approved \nthem in last year's bill, so I will forgo a discussion of the various \nstudies and other requirements that ensure people residing around these \nairports have their concerns addressed. Suffice it to say that the FAA \nand DOT will be very busy monitoring conditions in and around the four \naffected airports over the next few years. If these provisions begin \nhaving seriously adverse impacts, which I do not anticipate, we will \ncertainly know about them.\n  The benefits of airline deregulation have been proven time and again \nin\n\n[[Page S12097]]\n\nstudy after study. But the job that Congress started 20 years ago is \nincomplete. We still retain outdated controls over the market. Even \nworse, these controls work to the benefit of entrenched interests and \nto the detriment of consumers and competition. The sooner the Federal \nGovernment stops playing favorites in the industry the better off air \ntravelers will be. The majority of provisions in this bill will get us \ncloser to the goal of completing deregulation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Gorton amendment and vote against \nany second degree amendment that might weaken its move toward a truly \nderegulated aviation system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/06/senate-section/article/S12097-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     GORTON-ROCKEFELLER AMENDMENT TO S. 82, THE AIR TRANSPORTATION \n                            IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate that the Senate has finally \nacted on S. 82 to reauthorize the FAA and to deal with some of our \nNation's air transportation issues.\n  In particular, I am pleased that the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Washington and the Senator from West Virginia was adopted to allow \nexemptions to the current perimeter rule at Ronald Reagan Washington \nNational Airport. I recognize that this is a serious matter affecting a \nnumber of cities and high-profile airports, and I commend my colleagues \nwho worked long and hard to develop this amendment.\n  While I would have preferred that the final bill include the 48 \nexemptions contained in S. 82 as it was reported by the Commerce \nCommittee, I recognize that reducing this number to 24 reflects a \nreasonable compromise. I believe the amendment proposed by Senators \nGorton and Rockefeller achieves the central objective, which was to \nmaintain the current level of safety while improving air service for \nthe flying public--which is now almost everyone at one time or another. \nThe compromise also assiduously avoids adversely affecting the quality \nof life for those living within the perimeter.\n  Today, my constituents in Utah and in other western communities must \ndouble or even triple connect to fly into Washington, DC. The Gorton/\nRockefeller amendment goes a long way to addressing this inconvenient \nand time-consuming process and to ensuring that passengers in Utah and \nthe Intermountain West have expanded options.\n  I believe that use of this limited exemption should be to improve \naccess throughout the west and not limit the benefits to cities which \nalready enjoy a number of options.\n  Therefore, when considering applications for these slots, I think it \nis important for the U.S. Department of Transportation to consider \ncarefully these factors and award opportunities to western hubs, such \nas the one in Salt Lake City, which connects the largest number of \ncities to the national transportation network. I want U.S. DOT \nofficials to know that I will be carefully monitoring the \nimplementation of the perimeter slot exemption.\n  I look forward to working with Transportation Department officials as \nwell as my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that the traveling public \nhas the greatest number of options available to them. I thank the \nchair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/06/senate-section/article/S12097-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CABIN AIR QUALITY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to draw attention to a problem \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle have no doubt encountered--\npoor air quality on commercial airline flights.\n  Cabin environmental issues have been a part of air travel since the \ninception of commercial aircraft almost 70 years ago. However, with the \nexception of the ban on smoking on domestic flights in 1990, no major \nchanges have occurred to improve the quality of air on commercial \nflights.\n  Commercial airplanes operate in an environment hostile to human life. \nAccording to Boeing, the conditions existing outside an airplane cabin \nat modern cruise altitudes off 35,000 feet, are no more survivable by \nhumans than those conditions that would be encountered outside a \nsubmarine at extreme ocean depths.\n  To make air travel more conducive to passengers and flight crews, \nairplanes are equipped with advanced Environmental Control Systems. \nWhile these systems are designed to control cabin pressurization, \nventilation and temperature control, they have not diminished the \nnumber of health complaints reported by travelers.\n  It should come as no surprise to my colleagues that the most common \ncomplaints from passengers and flight crew are headaches, dizziness, \nirritable eyes and noses, and exposure to cold and flu. With the amount \nwe travel, I would not be surprised to learn some of my friends in the \nSenate have suffered some of these symptoms themselves. But complaints \nof illness do not stop there. Some passengers complaints are as serious \nas chest pains or nervous system disorders. This is a serious \nconsideration and should be addressed.\n  Airlines say the most common complaints are a result of the reduction \nin humidity at high altitudes, or of individuals sitting in close \nproximity to one another. Airlines even say the air on a plane is \nbetter than the air in the terminal. But the airplane cabin is a \nunique, highly stressful environment. It's low in humidity, pressurized \nup to a cabin altitude of 8,000 feet above sea level and subject to \ncontinuous noise, vibration and accelerations in multiple directions. \nAir in the airplane cabin is not comparable with air in the airport \nterminal. It's apples and oranges.\n  The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning \nEngineers--or ASHRAE--recently released standards it found suitable for \nhuman comfort in a residential or office building. ASHRAE determined \nthat environmental parameters such as air temperature and relative \nhumidity--and nonenvironmental parameters such as clothing insulation \nand metabolism--all factored in to create a comfortable environment. \nAirlines immediately chimed in, saying average cabin temperatures and \nair factors fell within the ASHRAE guidelines for comfort.\n  But once again, the air in an airplane cabin is not comparable to air \nin an office building. The volume, air distribution system, air \ndensity, relative humidity, occupant density, and unique installations \nsuch as lavatories, galleys all make for a unique condition. The ASHRAE \nguidelines simply do not translate to the airplane cabin.\n  It is high time we make a concerted effort to study the air quality \non our commercial flights and make some changes. Studies done by the \nairlines are simply not thorough enough. My amendment directs the \nSecretary of Transportation--in conjunction with the National Academy \nof Sciences--to conduct a study of the air on our flights. After \ncompletion of the 1-year study, the results will be reported to \nCongress. It is my sincere hope this will be a step toward more \ncomfortable travel conditions for everyone.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/06/senate-section/article/S12097-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12097-S12098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I voted yesterday to oppose the \nnominations of Ronnie White to serve as District Court Judge for the \nEastern District of Missouri, and Raymond C. Fisher to sit on the Ninth \nU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  As a newly elected member of the Senate, I am acutely aware of our \nobligation to confirm judges to sit on the Federal courts who will \nenforce the law without fear or favor.\n  But, after carefully considering Judge White's record, I am compelled \nto vote ``no.'' I believe that he has evidenced bias against the death \npenalty from his seat on the Missouri Supreme Court, even though it is \nthe law in that State. He has voted against the death penalty more than \nany other judge on that panel, and I am afraid that he would use a \nlifetime appointment to the Federal bench to push the law in a \nprocriminal direction rather than deferring interpreting the law as \nwritten and adhering to the legislative will of the people.\n  Although Judge Fisher has been recognized as ``thoughtful liberal,'' \nI cannot in good conscience vote to appoint him to serve a lifetime \nappointment to the Ninth Circuit Court. Over the last decade, the Ninth \nCircuit has been a fertile breeding ground for liberal judges to \nadvance their activist agenda--a fact evidenced by the Supreme Court's \nconsistent reversal of cases referred to them from the Ninth Circuit--\nand I am afraid that Judge Fisher would continue this disturbing\n\n[[Page S12098]]\n\ntrend. Probably more than any other circuit in the America, the views \nof the Ninth Circuit are unquestionably out of alignment with \nmainstream America, and I believe the panel badly needs a sense of \njudicial balance. I do not believe that Judge Fisher would have helped \nto provide that balance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/06/senate-section/article/S12098-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AMERICA'S HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wish to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues one of the most insightful articles that I have read in \nregard to the most effective way to promote health care and patient's \nrights.\n  Written by Mr. M. Anthony Burns of Ryder System Inc., the comments \nappear on the op-ed page of yesterday's Washington Post. Mr. Burns \nspeaks as the CEO of a company which provides health care benefits for \n80,000 employees and family members. At a time when courage appears to \nbe in short supply, it is refreshing to find a person who is able and \nwilling to publicly examine a complex issue in such a lucid, thoughtful \nmanner.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to read and consider carefully the \nanalysis offered by Mr. Burns. I ask unanimous consent that the article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 5, 1999]\n\n                  An Assault on America's Health Care\n\n                         (By M. Anthony Burns)\n\n       As the CEO of a $5 billion transportation company, when I \n     need legal advice, I listen to the experts. Congress should \n     do the same when it considers the Dingell-Norwood ``Patients' \n     Bill of Rights,'' which would allow patients to sue their \n     HMOs but would also make employers liable in state court for \n     the health care benefits they provide.\n       The sponsors claim their legislation includes an exemption \n     to shield employers from liability, but Reps. John Dingell \n     and Charlie Norwood are just dead wrong on that. A new study \n     prepared by independent legal experts shows this so-called \n     employers' ``shield'' is nothing more than a legal mirage \n     that provides only the illusion of protection. In reality, \n     very few companies could withstand the lawsuit exposure this \n     bill would impose on every business in America.\n       David Kenty and Frank Sabatino, experts in employee \n     benefits law and co-authors of the publication ``ERISA: A \n     Comprehensive Guide,'' found that under the Dingell-Norwood \n     bill ``employers would be subject to state law causes of \n     action replete with jury trials, extra-contractual damages, \n     and punitive damages.'' This would ``dramatically change the \n     way that group health benefits claims are litigated in the \n     United States,'' conclude the authors. ``Anyone who claims \n     the contrary is simply failing to comprehend the thrust of \n     the legislation.''\n       Trial lawyers could initiate lawsuits against employers \n     based on a number of legal arguments, according to Kenty and \n     Sabatino.\n       First, plaintiffs could argue that insurance companies or \n     third-party administrators are merely the agents of the \n     employer and therefore--shield language notwithstanding--the \n     employer is also responsible.\n       Second, a lawyer could argue that by selecting one health \n     care provider over another, the employer's discretionary \n     decisions played an integral part in a particular employee/\n     patient outcome.\n       Third, most employers commonly retain the right to override \n     the decisions of their health care provider or fiduciary to \n     enable them to serve as patient advocates for their \n     employees. The Dingell-Norwood bill would turn that \n     relationship on its ear, forcing most companies to abandon \n     their advocacy role altogether.\n       Supporters of the lawsuit provisions scoff at the notion \n     that trial attorneys would abuse the health care system or \n     employers who provide insurance. Tell that to the West \n     Virginia convenience store that got hit with a $3 million \n     judgment when one of its workers injured her back opening a \n     pickle jar.\n       The likely epidemic of litigation this kind of legislation \n     would generate creates an impossible choice for employers. \n     They can continue to provide health care coverage and risk \n     financial disaster if they find themselves on the losing end \n     of a health care lawsuit, whether they had anything to do \n     with treatment decisions or not. Or they can stop providing \n     health care altogether.\n       In fact, according to a recent survey of small business \n     owners, six out of 10 reported they would be forced to end \n     employee coverage rather than face this risk. Today my \n     company, Ryder, provides top quality health care benefits to \n     22,000 employees covering more than 80,000 people. We monitor \n     employee satisfaction with our health care providers, and we \n     act as a strong advocate for employees in disputes with these \n     providers.\n       But if Dingell-Norwood passes, we will be forced to \n     seriously reevaluate whether and how we can continue to offer \n     health benefits to our employees. As with most businesses \n     today, the exposure could simply be too severe for us. It \n     would put our traditional employer-provided system of health \n     care at extreme risk.\n       Add rising health care costs to this new threat of \n     expensive litigation and it's clear that this legislation is \n     a prescription for disaster. Last year healath care costs \n     went up 6 percent and the average employer spent $4,000 per \n     employee on health care. This year, health care costs are \n     expected to go up an average 9 percent, and potentially much \n     higher for small businesses.\n       As a result, it will be harder for employers to offer \n     health insurance and, as some costs are passed on, harder for \n     workers to afford it. Research shows that every one percent \n     increase in costs forces 300,000 more people to lose their \n     health care coverage.\n       A lot of people agree that ``right-to-sue'' provisions \n     don't make sense for either employers or employees. The U.S. \n     Senate, 25 state legislatures and President Clinton's own \n     hand-picked Health Care Quality Commission all refused to \n     support similar provisions to expand liability.\n       Congress says it wants to make managed care more \n     accountable, but Dingell-Norwood would only raise health care \n     costs, increase the number of uninsured and punish the \n     nation's employers who voluntarily provide health care to \n     millions of American workers and their families.\n       This legislation isn't a ``Patients' Bill of Rights.'' It's \n     a devastating assault on America's health care system, and \n     Congress should reject it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/06/senate-section/article/S12098-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

and\n       Whereas, The Japanese military invaded Nanking, China, from \n     December 1937 until February 1938, during the period known as \n     the ``Rape of Nanking,'' and brutally slaughtered, in ways \n     that defy description, by some accounts as many as 300,000 \n     Chinese men, women, and children and raped more than 20,000 \n     women, adding to a death toll that may have exceeded millions \n     of Chinese; and\n       Whereas, The people of Guam and the Marshall Islands, \n     during the Japanese occupation from 1941-1944, were subjected \n     to unmentionable acts of violence, including forced labor and \n     marches, and imprisonment by the Japanese military during its \n     occupation of these islands; and\n       Whereas, Three-fourths of the population in Port Blair on \n     Andaman Islands, India, were exterminated by Japanese troops \n     between March 1942 and the end of World War II; many were \n     tortured to death or forced into sexual slavery at `'comfort \n     stations,'' and crimes beyond description were committed on \n     families and young children; and\n       Whereas, at the February 1945 ``Battle of Manila,'' 100,000 \n     men, women, and children were killed by Japanese armed forces \n     in inhumane ways, adding to a total death toll that may have \n     exceeded one million Filipinos during the Japanese occupation \n     of the Philippines, which began in December 1941 and ended in \n     August 1945; and\n       Whereas, At least 260 of the 1,500 United States prisoners, \n     including many Californians, believed to have been held at \n     Mukden, Manchuria, died during the first winter of their \n     imprisonment and many of the 300 living survivors of Mukden \n     claim to suffer from physical ailments resulting from their \n     subjection to Japanese military chemical and biological \n     experiments; and\n       Whereas, The Japanese military enslaved millions of \n     Koreans, Chinese, Filipinos, and citizens from other occupied \n     or colonized territories during World War II, and forced \n     hundreds of thousands of women into sexual slavery for \n     Japanese troops; and\n       Whaeras, The International Commission of Jurists, a \n     nongovernmental organization (NGO) in Geneva, Switzerland, \n     ruled in 1993 that the Government of Japan should pay \n     reparations of at least $40,000 for the ``extreme pain and \n     suffering'' caused to each woman who was forced into sexual \n     slavery by the Japanese military (referred by the Japanese \n     military as ``comfort women''), yet none of these women \n     have been paid any compensation by the Government of \n     Japan: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California urges the Government of Japan to finally bring \n     closure to concerns relating to World War II by doing both of \n     the following:\n       (1) Formally issuing a clear and unambiguous apology for \n     the atrocious war crimes committed by the Japanese military \n     during World War II.\n       (2) Immediately paying reparations to the victims of those \n     crimes, including, but not limited to, United States military \n     and civilian prisoners of war, the people of Guam and the \n     Marshall Islands, who were subjected to violence and \n     imprisonment, the survivors of the ``Rape of Nanking'' from \n     December 1937 until February 1938, and the women who were \n     forced into sexual slavery and known by the Japanese military \n     as ``comfort women''; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of California \n     calls upon the United States Congress to adopt a similar \n     resolution that follows the spirit and letter of this \n     resolution calling on the Government of Japan to issue a \n     formal apology and pay reparations to the victims of its war \n     crimes during World War II; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of California \n     requests that the President of the United States take all \n     appropriate action to further bring about a formal apology \n     and reparations by the Government of Japan to the victims of \n     its war crimes during World War II; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the Japanese Ambassador to the \n     United States, the President of the United States, the \n     President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and each California Member of the Senate and \n     the United States House of Representatives.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-363.

It was one of the main drivers of the \n     California comeback as the state recovered from the \n     protracted recession of 1991, however, other countries \n     aggressively promote incentives for filming outside of \n     California. This competition translates into a significant \n     share of tax revenue that is not directed to California. \n     According to published estimates by the Motion Picture \n     Association of America (MPAA), every one percent of \n     entertainment jobs in California represents about $9 million \n     in state tax revenue; and\n       Whereas, The MPAA also notes that most forecasts predict \n     that the demand for motion picture, television, and \n     commercial products will increase. The issue is whether the \n     future economic activity that this growth may generate will \n     occur in California or elsewhere; and\n       Whereas, The film industry has a significant effect on \n     other industries, including the multimedia industry, tourism, \n     toys, games, and industries that perpetuate the ``California \n     look'' in apparel and furniture manufacturing. This is part \n     of the residual effect of the film industry; and\n       Whereas, The enormity of the film industry makes it an \n     important contributor of tax revenue to this state; and\n       Whereas, While there is an abundance of available labor in \n     the film industry in the Los Angeles region, many below-the-\n     line union workers are currently unemployed; and\n       Whereas, Canada is enticing entertainment industry jobs out \n     of this country by offering significant tax credits to United \n     States production companies. This practice is resulting in \n     less work for American film crews as more and more movies, TV \n     series, sitcoms, mini-series, etc. are being relocated there; \n     and\n       Whereas, A continued exodus of motion picture and \n     television production to foreign countries such as Canada \n     will not only eliminate thousands of well-paying jobs, it \n     will mean the United States will lose a growing and very \n     lucrative industry that it created: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature respectfully \n     memorializes the President and the Congress of the United \n     States to evaluate the problems caused by relocating film \n     industry business to Canada and other foreign nations, to \n     evaluate the current state and federal tax incentives \n     provided to the film industry, and to promote trade-related \n     legislation that will persuade the film industry to remain in \n     California; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate of the \n     United States, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/06/senate-section/article/S12100-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12100-S12101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. CHAFEE, from the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works, with an amendment in the nature of a substitute:\n       S. 1398.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a \nstudy on the reclamation and reuse of water and wastewater in the State \nof Hawaii; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduced S. 1694, the Hawaii \nWater Resources Reclamation Act of 1999. Senator Inouye joins me in \nsponsoring this legislation.\n  My colleagues, rural Hawaii faces difficult economic times. The past \ndecade has been especially challenging for agriculture in our state. \nSugar has declined dramatically, from 180,000 acres of cane in 1989 to \n60,000 acres today, and with this decline has come tremendous economic \ndisruption.\n  120,000 acres may not seem like much to Senators from large states of \nthe continental U.S., but in Hawaii the loss has huge implications. \n120,000 acres represents more than 45 percent of our cultivated farm \nland. Hawaii County, where the greatest impact of these losses is felt, \nfaces double digit unemployment.\n  As Carol Wilcox, author of the definitive history of irrigation in \nHawaii noted in her recent book ``Sugar Water,'' the cultivation of \nsugarcane dominated Hawaii's agricultural landscape for the last 25 \nyears of the 19th century and for most of this century as well. ``Sugar \nwas the greatest single force at work in Hawaii,'' she wrote, and water \nwas essential to this development.\n  The face of Hawaii agriculture is changing. During the past decade, \n95 sugar farms and plantations closed their doors. Today, many rural \ncommunities in Hawaii are struggling to define new roles in an era when \nsugar is no longer the king of crops. We have entered a period of \nrebirth. A new foundation for agriculture is being established.\n  Diversified agriculture has become a bright spot in our economy. Farm \nreceipts from diversified crops rose an average of 5.5 percent annually \nfor the past three years, surpassing the $300 million mark for the \nfirst time. Hawaii still grows sugarcane, but diversified farming \nrepresents the future of Hawaii agriculture.\n  The restructuring of agriculture has prompted new and shifting \ndemands for agricultural water and a broad reevaluation of the use of \nHawaii's fresh water resources. The outcome of these events will help \ndefine the economic future of rural Hawaii.\n  While the Bureau of Reclamation played a modest role in Hawaii water \nresource development, sugar plantations and private irrigation \ncompanies were responsible for constructing, operating, and maintaining \nnearly all of Hawaii's agricultural irrigation systems. Over a period \nof 90 years, beginning in 1856, more than 75 ditches, reservoirs, and \ngroundwater systems were constructed.\n  Although Hawaii's irrigation systems are called ditches, the use of \nthis term misrepresents their magnitude. Hawaii's largest ditch system, \nthe East Maui Irrigation Company, operates a network of six ditches on \nthe north flank of Haleakala Crater. The broad scope of East Maui \nirrigation is extensively chronicled in ``Sugar Water'':\n\n       Among the water entities, none compares to EMI. It is the \n     largest privately owned water company in the United States, \n     perhaps in the world. The total delivery capacity is 445 mgd. \n     The average daily water delivery under median weather \n     conditions is 160 mgd . . . Its largest ditch, the Wailoa \n     Canal, has a greater median flow (170 mgd) than any river in \n     Hawaii . . . The [EMI] replacement cost is estimated to be at \n     $200 million.\n\n  Most of Hawaii's irrigation systems--ditches as we know them--are in \ndisrepair. Some have been abandoned. Those that no longer irrigate cane \nlands may not effectively serve the new generation of Hawaii farmers, \neither because little or no water reaches new farms or because the \nditches have not been repaired or maintained. Thus, the wheel has \nturned full circle: the challenge that confronted six generations of \ncane farmers, access to water, has become the challenge for a new \ngeneration that farms diversified agriculture.\n  In response to these changing events, the Hawaii Water Resources \nReclamation Act authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to survey \nirrigation and water delivery systems in Hawaii, identify the cost of \nrehabilitating the systems, and evaluate demand for their future use. \nThe bill also instructs the Bureau to identify new opportunities for \nreclamation and reuse of water and wastewater for agriculture and non-\nagricultural purposes. Finally, the bill authorizes the Bureau to \nconduct emergency drought relief in Hawaii. This is especially \nimportant for struggling farmers on the Big Island.\n  While I hesitate to predict the findings of the Bureau's study, I \nexpect we will learn that some of the ditch systems should be repaired \nor improved, while others should be abandoned. We may also learn that \nthe changing face of Hawaii agriculture justifies entirely new systems \nor new components being added to existing ditches. Because the bill \nemphasizes water recycling and reuse, the report will identify \nopportunities to improve water conservation, enhance stream flows, \nimprove fish and\n\n[[Page S12102]]\n\nwildlife habitat, and rebuilding groundwater supplies. These important \nobjectives will help ensure that any legislative response to the \nBureau's report is ecologically appropriate.\n  The process outlined in S. 1694 cannot advance unless sound \nenvironmental principles are observed. Those who are for Hawaii's \nrivers and streams, as I do, believe that water resource development \nshould not adversely affect fresh water resources and the ecosystems \nthat depend upon them. Hawaii's rivers support a number of rare native \nspecies that rely on undisturbed habitat. Perhaps the most remarkable \nof these is the goby, which actually climbs waterfalls, reaching \nhabitat that is inaccessible to other fish. As a young boy, my friends \nand I caught and ate o'opu, as the goby are known to Hawaiians, at \nOahu's streams. I am determined to preserve this, and the other forms \nof rich biological heritage that inhabit our streams and watersheds.\n  My remarks would not be complete without a review of the history of \nFederal reclamation initiatives in Hawaii. Hawaii's relationship with \nthe Bureau of Reclamation dates from 1939, when the agency proposed \ndeveloping an aqueduct on Molokai to serve 16,000 acres of federally \nmanaged Hawaiian Home Lands. While this project did not proceed, in \n1954 Congress directed the Bureau to investigate irrigation and \nreclamation needs for three of our islands: Oahu, Hawaii, and Molokai. \nA Federal reclamation project on the Island of Molokai was eventually \nconstructed in response to this investigation. The project continues in \noperation today.\n  In the first session of Congress following Hawaii's statehood, \nlegislation authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to develop \nreclamation projects in Hawaii under the Small Reclamation Projects Act \nwas signed into law. The most recent interaction with the Bureau \noccurred in 1995 when Congress authorized the Secretary to allow Native \nHawaiians the same favorable cost recovery for reclamation projects as \nIndians or Indian tribes.\n  I will work closely with my colleagues on the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee to pass the Hawaii Water Resources \nReclamation Act. I ask that a copy of S. 1694 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1694\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Convention on Cultural Property \nImplementation Act to improve the procedures for restricting imports of \narchaeological and ethnological material; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the cultural property procedural reform act\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \namend the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (CCPIA). \nThis legislation improves the procedures for restricting imports of \narchaeological and ethnological materials. I am pleased that the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, joins \nme, as well as my distinguished colleague from New York, Senator \nSchumer.\n  This legislation provides a necessary clarification of the Convention \non Cultural Property Implementation Act. The CCPIA was reported by the \nSenate Finance Committee and passed in the waning days of the 97th \nCongress. The CCPIA implements the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means \nof Prohibiting the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of \nCultural Property. It sets forth our national policy concerning the \nimportation of cultural property. As the last of the authors of the \nCCPIA remaining in the Senate, it falls to me to keep a close eye on \nits implementation.\n  Central to our intention in drafting the CCPIA was the principle that \nthe United States will act to bar the importation of particular \nantiquities, but only as part of a concerted international response to \na specific, severe problem of pillage. The CCPIA established an \nelaborate process to ensure that the views of experts--archaeologists, \nethnologists, art dealers, museums--and the public, are taken fully \ninto account when foreign governments ask us to bar imports of \nantiquities. The Congress put these safeguards in place with the \nspecific intent to provide due process.\n  The need for this bill arises from the recent proliferation of import \nrestrictions imposed on archaeological and ethnological artifacts from \na number of countries, including Canada and Peru. Restrictions may soon \nbe imposed on imports from Cambodia, and I am told that the Government \nof Italy has now requested that the United States impose a sweeping \nembargo on archaeological material dating from the 8th century B.C. to \nthe 5th century A.D.\n  My understanding is that the standards and procedures the Congress \nmeant to introduce in the CCPIA are not being followed. The chief \nconcerns are two-fold: (1) the Cultural Property Advisory Committee, \nwhich reviews all requests for import restrictions, remains essentially \nclosed to non-members despite the provisions of the 1983 Cultural \nProperty Act--which I co-authored with Senators Dole and Matsunaga--\nthat call for open meetings and transparent procedures; and (2) the \nCommittee lacks a knowledgeable art\n\n[[Page S12103]]\n\ndealer--in large part because the Executive Branch has interpreted the \nstatute--incorrectly, in my view--to require that Committee members \nserve as ``special government employees'' rather than--as was \nintended--``representatives''--of dealers. Candidates have thus been \nsubjected to insurmountable conflict-of-interest rules that have \neffectively prevented experts from serving on the Committee--the very \nindividuals whose advice ought to be sought.\n  The amendments I offer today would open up the proceedings of the \nCultural Property Advisory Committee and the administering agency \n(formerly USIA, now an agency under the Department of State) to allow \nfor meaningful public participation in the fact-finding phase of an \ninvestigation, i.e., the stage at which the Committee and the agency \nreview the factual basis for a country's request for import \nrestrictions. The bill would require that notice of such a request be \npublished in the Federal Register, that interested parties be provided \nan opportunity to comment, and that the Committee issue a public report \nof its findings in each case. Once the evidence is gathered, the \nCommittee would, as under current law, be permitted to conduct its \ndeliberations behind closed doors so as not to jeopardize the \ngovernment's negotiating objectives or disclose its bargaining \nposition.\n  The amendments would also clarify that Cultural Property Advisory \nCommittee members are to serve only in a ``representative'' capacity--\nas is the case with members of the President's trade advisory \ncommittees--and not as ``special government employees.'' It was my \nclear understanding, as one of the chief drafters of the law, that \nmembers of the Advisory Committee would be acting in a representative \ncapacity. The CCPIA sought to ensure that there would be a ``fair \nrepresentation of the various interests of the public sectors and the \nprivate sectors in the international exchange of archaeological and \nethnological materials,'' by designating members to represent those \nvarious perspectives. The CCPIA reserves specific slots on the Advisory \nCommittee for representatives of the affected interest groups, \nincluding as I mentioned earlier, art dealers. The special conflict-of-\ninterest provisions applicable to ``special government employees'' \nwould probably prevent any active art dealer knowledgeable in the \naffected areas of trade from serving on the Committee, depriving the \nCommittee of invaluable expertise.\n\n  This bill, clarifying Congressional intent, is essential to \nsuccessful implementation of the CCPIA. If I may ask the Senate's \nindulgence, I would like to summarize the key provisions of the bill:\n  Procedural requirements.--The bill amends Section 303(f)(2) of the \nCCPIA to provide that a foreign nation's request for relief shall \ninclude a detailed description of the archaeological or ethnological \nmaterial that a party to the 1970 Cultural Property Convention seeks to \nprotect and a comprehensive description of the evidence submitted in \nsupport of the request. This information is to be included in the \nFederal Register notice required to initiate proceedings under the \nCCPIA.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to provide interested parties with \nadequate notice of the nature of a foreign nation's request and the \nevidence in support of an allegedly serious condition of pillage, which \nis evidence essential to any response under CCPIA. In the past, \nproceedings before the CPAC and the administering agency (formerly \nUSIA, now an agency under the Department of State) have been conducted \nalmost in total secrecy, thus denying interested parties the \nopportunity to prepare rebuttal and response to the evidence presented \nby a foreign nation on alleged pillage and with respect to the other \nstatutory requirements that must be satisfied. The result is that the \nCommittee is denied a full, unbiased record upon which to make its \ndecisions.\n  The bill also amends Section 303(f)(1)(C) of the CCPIA to provide \nthat interested parties shall have an opportunity to provide comments \nto Executive Branch decision-makers on the findings and recommendations \nof the CPAC, which are to be made public under a separate provision of \nthe bill. To date, interested parties have not had an effective \nopportunity to bring their perspectives to the attention of the \nstatutory decision-maker.\n  Proceedings before the committee.--The bill amends Section 306(f)(1) \nof the CCPIA to provide that the procedures before the Advisory \nCommittee shall be conducted to afford full participation by interested \nparties in the fact-finding phase of the CPAC review.\n  This provision draws a clear line between the fact-finding \ninvestigation and the deliberative review phases of the Committee's \nproceedings and provide for full public participation in the fact-\nfinding phase. It also responds to concerns that, under current \nprocedures, the Committee is denied full information from interested \nparties relating to the foreign nation's request because there is no \npublic information about the specific nature of a request nor of the \ndata supporting it.\n  Also, in an amendment to Section 306(f)(1) of the CCPIA, the \nCommittee is directed to prepare, and then publish in the Federal \nRegister, a report which includes, inter alia, its findings with \nrespect to each of the criteria described in Section 301(a)(1) of the \nAct, which sets forth the requirements that must be met before import \nrestrictions may be imposed. This amendment is essential to ensure that \nthe Committee faithfully responds to each of the statutory criteria.\n  Import restrictions.--Our bill amends Section 303(a)(1)(A) of the \nCCPIA, dealing with the authority to impose restrictions, to make clear \nthat there must be evidence of pillage which supports the full range of \nany import restrictions under the CCPIA and that such evidence must \nreflect contemporary pillage. Evidence of contemporary pillage is \nessential to the working of the Act, which is based on the concept that \na U.S. import restriction will have a meaningful effect on an ongoing \nsituation of pillage.\n  There is striking evidence that the Committee and the administering \nagency are now promulgating broad-scale import restrictions where there \nis no evidence of contemporary pillage that would justify the scope of \nthose restrictions. Recent examples include omnibus import restrictions \ninvolving cultural property from Canada and Peru, extending over \nthousands of years. Vast portions of the Canadian restrictions were \nsupported by no evidence whatsoever of contemporary pillage. Likewise, \nthe Peruvian restrictions extend far beyond any evidence of current \npillage contained in the administrative record. I am told that the \nGovernment of Italy has now requested that the United States impose a \nsweeping embargo on Italian archaeological materials dating from the \n8th century B.C. to the 5th century A.D.\n  This provision also makes clear that an import embargo cannot \nbe based on historical evidence of pillage; rather, there must be \ncontemporary pillage. This amendment responds to recent instances where \nthe committee has made recommendations, which the agency has accepted, \nbased upon evidence of pillage that is many years old, and indeed, \nevidence of pillage that occurred hundreds of years previously. It is \nquite obvious that an import restriction in 1999 cannot deter pillage \nthat took place decades or even centuries ago. This provision is \nimperative to ensure that the administrative process under the act is \nfaithful to the statutory goals of CCPIA.\n\n  Continuing review.--Our bill amends section 306(g) of the act to make \nmore specific the obligation of the committee to conduct reviews, on an \nannual basis, of existing agreements providing for import restrictions; \nto publish in the Federal Register the conclusions of such reviews; and \nto report on those agreements not reviewed during the preceding year \nand the reasons why such agreements were not reviewed. The amendment \nprovides for full public participation in the fact-finding phase of the \nannual reviews. It is prompted by the committee's failure to undertake, \nwith full public participation, a prompt review of existing import \nrestrictions, particularly those relating to Canada, for which serious \nquestions have been raised as to the claims of pillage made in support \nof the omnibus U.S. import restrictions.\n  Multinational response.--These provisions deal with the action \nrequired by other art-importing nations in connection with non-\nemergency import restrictions imposed under the act. The\n\n[[Page S12104]]\n\nact requires that any import restriction under Section 303 of the act \nbe accomplished by corresponding import restrictions by other nations \nhaving a significant trade in the cultural properties barred by the \nU.S. import restriction. The rationale for this requirement is that one \ncannot effectively deter a serious situation of pillage of cultural \nproperties if the U.S. unilaterally closes its borders to the import of \nthose properties, and they find their way, in an undiminished stream of \ncommerce, to markets in London, Paris, Munich, Tokyo, or other air-\nimporting centers.\n  Congress imposed a specific requirement of an actual multinational \nresponse. There is a concern that the committee is simply disregarding \nthese requirements in its recent actions imposing far-reaching \nrestrictions on cultural properties. Therefore, this subsection amends \nsection 303(g)(2) of the act to require the administering agency to set \nforth in detail the reasons for its determination under this provision.\n  Consultation by committee members.--These provisions relate to the \nappropriate activities of committee members. In order to provide that \nmaximum information and insight be brought to bear upon the committee's \nfact-finding and deliberations, all members of the Committee will be \nfree to consult with others in connection with non-confidential \ninformation in an effort to secure expert advice and information on the \njustification for a particular request, and to share non-confidential \ninformation received from a requesting country in support of its \nrequest. Any such consultation must be reported in the committee's \nrecords. In the past, committee members have been advised that they \nwould face severe sanctions if they were to consult with experts on the \nextent of pillage or other pertinent facts in connection with a foreign \nnation's request.\n  Cultural Property Advisory Committee membership.--Our bill clarifies \nthat members of the CPAC serve in a representative capacity and not as \nofficers or employees of the government or as special government \nemployees (``SGEs''). This additional language is necessary because \nofficials at the administering agency and elsewhere in the executive \nbranch appear to have misconstrued congressional intent in this regard.\n  Because CPAC members are expected to bring their particular \ninstitutional perspectives to CPAC deliberations, the CCPIA seeks to \nensure a ``fair representation of the various interests of the public \nsectors and the private sectors in the international exchange of \narchaeological and ethnological material,'' by designating members to \nrepresent various perspectives. To accomplish this purpose, Congress \nreserved specific slots on the CPAC for representatives of the affected \ninterest groups.\n  Despite this language, the administering agency has asserted that \nCPAC members serve as SGE rather than in a representative capacity. As \na result, certain experts have been prevented from serving on the CPAC. \nThe proposed amendment would restate and clarify that all members of \nthe CPAC serve in a representative capacity.\n  Federal Advisory Committee Act.--Finally, the bill makes clear that \nthe transparency provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act \n(e.g., open meetings, public notice, public participation, and public \navailability of documents) apply to the fact-finding phase of the \ncommittee's actions. Those provisions shall not apply to the \ndeliberative phase of the committee's action if there is an appropriate \ndetermination that open procedures would compromise the Government's \nnegotiating objectives or bargaining position.\n  This provision would open to the public the fact-gathering phase of \nthe CPAC's work, while retaining discretion, consistent with section \n206(h) of the CCPIA, to close the deliberative phase where the \ngovernment's negotiating objectives or bargaining positions may be \ncompromised.\n  Mr. President, I urge the speedy passage of this legislation and ask \nunanimous consent that the full text of the bill appear in the Record \nalong with a brief section-by-section description of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1696\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It \n     also clarifies that members of the Cultural Property Advisory \n     Committee (``CPAC'' or ``Committee'') are appointed to act in \n     a representative capacity and are not special government \n     employees.\n\n\n                         section 1. short title\n\n       The title of the bill is the ``Cultural Property Procedural \n     Reform Act.''\n\n\n                    sec. 2. procedural requirements\n\n     (a) In general\n       First, Section 303(f)(2) of the CCPIA is amended to provide \n     that a foreign nation's request for relief shall include a \n     detailed description of the archaeological or ethnological \n     material that a party to the 1970 Cultural Property \n     Convention seeks to protect and a comprehensive description \n     of the evidence submitted in support of the request. This \n     information is to be included in the Federal Register notice \n     required to initiate proceedings under the CCPIA.\n       Second, Section 303(f)(1)(C) of the CCPIA is amended to \n     require that interested parties have an opportunity to \n     provide comments to the administering agency (formerly USIA, \n     now an agency under the Department of State) on the findings \n     and recommendations of the CPAC.\n     (b) Proceedings before committee\n       Section 306(f)(1) of the CCPIA is amended to draw a clear \n     distinction between the fact-finding phase of the Cultural \n     Property Advisory Committee's investigation and its \n     deliberative review of the evidence. The amendment requires \n     the Committee to provide interested parties both notice and \n     an opportunity to comment during the fact-finding phase of \n     the CPAC review.\n       Section 2(b) of the bill amends Section 306(f)(1) of the \n     CCPIA to direct the Committee to publish in the Federal \n     Register its report, which is to include, inter alia, its \n     findings with respect to each of the criteria described in \n     Section 301(a)(1) of the Act, which sets forth the \n     requirements that must be met before import restrictions may \n     be imposed.\n     (c) Import restrictions\n       Section 303(a)(1)(A) of the CCPIA, dealing with the \n     authority to enter into import restrictions, is amended to \n     make clear that there must be evidence that particular \n     objects of the cultural patrimony of the country requesting \n     an embargo be in jeopardy of pillage. The legislation \n     clarifies that historical evidence of pillaging is not \n     sufficient to support the imposition of import restrictions; \n     rather the evidence must reflect contemporary pillage.\n     (d) Continuing review\n       Under current law, the Committee is required to review the \n     effectiveness of existing import restrictions on a continuing \n     basis. The legislation makes more specific the obligation of \n     the Committee to conduct such continuing reviews of \n     outstanding agreements. It clarifies that reviews will be \n     conducted on an annual basis, and requires the Committee to \n     publish in the Federal Register the conclusions of such \n     reviews, and to include in an annual report a description of \n     those agreements not reviewed during the preceding year and \n     the reasons why such agreements were not reviewed. This \n     provision requires that notice of the review be published in \n     the Federal Register and that interested parties be afforded \n     an opportunity to comment in the fact-finding phase of the \n     annual reviews.\n     (e) Multinational response\n       This subsection deals with the action required by other \n     art-importing nations in connection with non-emergency import \n     restrictions imposed under the Act. The Act requires that any \n     import restriction under Section 303 of the Act be \n     accompanied by corresponding import restrictions by other \n     nations having a significant trade in the materials barred by \n     the U.S. import restriction. This subsection amends Section \n     303(g)(2) of the Act to require the President to set forth in \n     detail the reasons for a determination that multilateral \n     action is not required.\n     (f) Consultation by committee members\n       This subsection provides that Committee members are free to \n     consult with experts and, in connection with such \n     consultations, to share non-confidential information receive \n     from a country in support of its request for an import \n     embargo. Any such consultations must be reported in the \n     records of the Committee.\n\n\n              sec. 3. cultural property advisory committee\n\n     (a) In general. (see (b), below)\n     (b) Conflict of interest provisions\n       These subsections clarify that members of the CPAC serve in \n     a representative capacity and not as officers or employees of \n     the government or as special government employees.\n     (c) Application of Federal Advisory Committee Act\n       Subsection (c) of Section 3 of the bill makes clear that \n     the transparency provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee \n     Act (e.g., open meetings, public notice, public \n     participation, and public availability of documents) apply to \n     the fact-finding phase of the Committee's actions. Those \n     provisions shall not apply to the deliberative phase of the \n     Committee's action if the President or his designee \n     determines that open procedures would compromise the \n     Government's negotiating objectives or bargaining position.\n\n\n                      sec. 4. technical amendments\n\n       This section makes technical changes to the CCPIA in light \n     of the abolition of the United States Information Agency, and \n     consequent transfer of its functions to the Department of \n     State.\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleagues \nSenators Moynihan and Roth in introducing legislation today that I feel \nis long overdue.\n  More than 20 years ago, in an attempt to end the looting and \npillaging of important archaeological and cultural sites, and to \nprotect the integrity\n\n[[Page S12106]]\n\nof a country's cultural patrimony, Senator Moynihan and others labored \nto develop an international protocol that struck a balance between a \ncountry's desire to protect its heritage and the art world's desire to \nhave a healthy trade in and exhibition of cultural artifacts. After \nyears of deliberation, these efforts resulted in the UNESCO Convention \non Cultural Property--a delicately balanced set of rules and guidelines \nto protect countries from looting, but to allow a legitimate trade in \nhistorical objects and the showing of those objects in museums around \nthe world.\n  Congress later established the Cultural Property Advisory Committee \n(CPAC) to assist the President in making determinations under this \nconvention about whether to restrict or allow the trade of \narchaeologically significant materials when another country claims \nharm. Once again, Senator Moynihan was the impetus and intellectual \nmight behind this legislation.\n  For years, this was a balanced process that weighed the claims of \ncountries against the competing interests of museums, art dealers, and \nauction houses. The CPAC itself was comprised of individuals \nrepresenting the interests of the museums, auction houses, dealers, \narchaeologists, and anthropologists. This committee, with the help of \nstaff, made determinations based on fact (was there sufficient evidence \nof looting or pillaging?) and effectiveness (if the U.S. unilaterally \nbanned the import of certain items, would it have a reasonable chance \nof reducing or ending the looting?). The original international \nprotocol as well as the enacting legislation passed by the Congress, \nspecifically discouraged unilateral or bilateral actions. The protocols \nand the legislation were designed to lead to a cohesive international \nresponse, not a country-by-country response to looting.\n  Somewhere along the line, that delicate balance shifted. CPAC \nhearings that were once open became closed. Actions that were once \nmultilateral became unilateral. A process that was once inclusive \nbecame exclusive. Decisions that in the past were based on a fair \nhearing on the merits became instead a foregone conclusion against the \nmuseums and the dealers. I would go as far as to say that for those \nrepresenting museums and art dealers, the process became overtly \nhostile and secretive.\n  More than a year ago, I convened a meeting with then-USIA director \nJoe Duffy, members of the art community, and the staff of Senator \nMoynihan. The meeting was called because of a sweeping action taken by \nthe CPAC regarding Canadian Native American artifacts. Without dwelling \non the details of the complaint by the Canadian government or the \ndecision to bar any imports by the U.S. of thousands of artifacts--the \nmeeting was extraordinary. Director Duffy, who as USIA head oversaw the \nCPAC, admitted that they were way out of line. He admitted that the \nprocess had become closed and hostile to dealers and the museums. And \nhe suggested to me and by proxy to Senator Moynihan that we supply him \nwith a name of a person to fill a vacancy on the CPAC to help restore \nthe balance that once was the norm. We gave him the name of Andre \nEmmerich, a semi-retired dealer in artifacts and probably the most \nrespected voice in the field of cultural property. Director Duffy said \nto me that Andre Emmerich was the perfect choice.\n  More than one year later and unfortunately after Director Duffy \nretired, Andre Emmerich's nomination was rejected because, the CPAC \nclaimed, as a dealer he had a conflict of interest. Let's face facts. \nThe entire CPAC is designed to be a conflict of interest. The balance \nof the committee membership is supposed to reflect that conflict of \ninterest. That conflict of interest is essential to the inner workings \nof the committee as the expertise supplied by those in various fields \nis also intended to edify the rest of the committee to help them make \nthe right decision.\n  That brings us to today. We are introducing legislation that is \nintended to clean up the CPAC--to make the process open, fair, \ntransparent, and accountable. Among other provisions, the legislation \nforces CPAC to open meetings that have been absurdly secretive. The \nneed for cloak and dagger, spy vs. spy, CIA level secrecy over the \nimportation of Peruvian pottery escapes me.\n  I am proud to be joining both Senator Moynihan and Senator Roth--two \nof the most respected leaders in the Senate--in introducing this \nlegislation. I hope we can move this bill quickly, because this is a \nsituation that needs a remedy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH:\n  S. 1699. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nauthorize appropriations for State water pollution control revolving \nfunds, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n            clean water infrastructure financing act of 1999\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Clean \nWater Infrastructure Financing Act of 1999, legislation which will \nreauthorize the highly successful, but undercapitalized, Clean Water \nState Revolving Loan Fund (SRF) Program administered by the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Clean Water SRF Program is an \neffective and immensely popular source of funding for wastewater \ncollection and treatment projects. Congress created the SRF in 1987, to \nreplace the direct grants program that was enacted as part of the \nlandmark 1972 Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or as it is known, \nthe Clean Water Act. State and local governments have used the federal \nClean Water SRF to help meet critical environmental infrastructure \nfinancing needs. The program operates much like a community bank, where \neach state determines which projects get built.\n  The performance of the SRF Program has been spectacular. Total \nfederal capitalization grants have been nearly doubled by non-federal \nfunding sources, including state contributions, leveraged bonds, and \nprincipal and interest payments. Communities of all sizes are \nparticipating in the program, and approximately 7,000 projects \nnationwide have been approved to date.\n  Ohio has needs for public water system improvements which greatly \nexceed the current SRF appropriations levels. According to the latest \nstate figures, more than $7 billion of improvements have been \nidentified as necessary. In recent years, Ohio cities and villages are \nspending more on maintaining and operating their systems than in the \npast, which is an indication their systems are aging and will soon need \nto be replaced. For example, the City of Columbus recently requested \nSRF assistance amounting to $725 million over the next five years.\n  While the SRF program's track record is excellent, the condition of \nour Nation's environmental infrastructure remains alarming. A 20-year \nneeds survey published by the EPA in 1997 documented $139 billion worth \nof wastewater capital needs nationwide. This past April, the national \nassessment was revised upward to nearly $200 billion, in order to more \naccurately account for expected sanitary sewer needs. Private studies \ndemonstrate that total needs are closer to $300 billion, when \nanticipated replacement costs are considered.\n  Authorization for the Clean Water SRF expired at the end of fiscal \nyear 1994, and the failure of Congress to reauthorize the program sends \nan implicit message that wastewater collection and treatment is not a \nnational priority. The longer we have an absence of authorization of \nthis program, the longer it creates uncertainty about the program's \nfuture in the eyes of borrowers, which may delay or in some cases \nprevent project financing.\n  The bill that I am introducing today will authorize a total of $15 \nbillion over the next five years for the Clean Water SRF. Not only \nwould this authorization bridge the enormous infrastructure funding \ngap, the investment would also pay for itself in perpetuity by \nprotecting our environment, enhancing public health, creating jobs and \nincreasing numerous tax bases across the country. Additionally, the \nbill will provide technical and planning assistance for small systems, \nexpand the types of projects eligible for loan assistance, and offer \ndisadvantaged communities extended loan repayment periods and principal \nsubsidies.\n  At the local level, there are numerous areas like the town of Glenn \nRobbins in Jefferson County, Ohio, which cannot afford a zero percent \nloan to build the cost-effective facilities they\n\n[[Page S12107]]\n\nneed. Estimates indicate that among towns of less than 3,500 population \nin Ohio, there are $1.5 billion in needs.\n  The health and well-being of the American public depends on the \ncondition of our Nation's wastewater collection and treatment systems. \nUnfortunately, the facilities that comprise these systems are often \ntaken for granted because they are invisible absent a crisis. Let me \nassure my colleagues that the costs of poor environmental \ninfrastructure are simply intolerable. Recent flood disasters have been \na stark reminder of the human costs that stem from the contamination of \nour Nation's water supply.\n  The Clean Water SRF Program has helped thousands of communities meet \ntheir wastewater treatment needs. My legislation will help ensure that \nthe Clean Water SRF Program remains a viable component in the overall \ndevelopment of our Nation's infrastructure for years to come. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation, and I urge it's \nspeedy consideration by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1699\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to \nallow a defendant to make a motion for forensic testing not available \nat trial regarding actual innocence; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S12108]]\n\n           the right to use technology in the hunt for truth\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the hallmark of our criminal justice \nsystem has always been the search for the truth. With this goal in \nmind, I am introducing legislation to ensure the quality of justice in \nour criminal courts through the use of DNA testing.\n  In the last decade, the use of DNA evidence as a tool to assign guilt \nand acquit the innocent has produced dramatic results. The Innocence \nProject at the Cardozo School of Law has identified 62 cases in the \nUnited States since 1988 in which the use of DNA technology resulted in \noverturned convictions. In my home State of Illinois, 12 innocent men \nin the past 12 years have been released from Illinois' Death Row after \nDNA testing or other evidence proved their innocence.\n  The bill I am introducing today, The Right to Use Technology in the \nHunt for Truth (TRUTH) Act will amend the Federal Rules of Criminal \nProcedure. Specifically, the bill will allow Federal defendants to file \na motion to mandate DNA testing to support claims of actual innocence. \nUnder current law, rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \nimposes a 2-year time limitation for new trial motions based on newly \ndiscovered evidence. This time limitation can act as a carrier even in \ncases where the evidence of actual innocence is available. My bill will \nallow defendants to bring a motion for forensic DNA testing without \nregard to the 2-year time limitation. It will not waive the 2-year time \nlimit for all new trial limitations. Only motions for forensic DNA \ntesting under limited circumstances will not subject to the 2-year time \nlimitation.\n  This Federal rule change allows a defendants to utilize technology \nthat was unavailable at the time of their conviction. The bill requires \nthe defendant to show that identity was an issue in the trial which \nresulted in his conviction and that the evidence gathered by law \nenforcement was subject to a chain of custody sufficient to protect its \nintegrity.\n  DNA technology has undergone rapid change that has increased its \nability to obtain meaningful results from old evidence through the use \nof smaller and smaller samples. In the World Trade Center bombing case, \nDNA was recovered from saliva on the back of a postage stamp.\n  In the past, crime laboratories relied primarily on restriction \nfragment length polymorphism (RFLP) testing, a technique that requires \na rather large quantity of DNA (100,000 or more cells). Most \nlaboratories are now shifting to using a test based on the polymerase \nchain reaction (PCR) method that can generate reliable data from \nextremely small amounts of DNA in crime scene samples (50 to 100 \ncells).\n  Two States in the country, New York and Illinois, have laws mandating \npost-conviction DNA testing. The Illinois law has led to as many as six \noverturned sentences, including some murder charges.\n  When the measure was debated in the Illinois Legislature, some \nlawmakers raised concerns that allowing DNA-based appeals would lead to \nan avalanche of prisoners' demands for such tests.\n  But the response from experts is that such motions have not been \nexcessive because prisoners who were justifiably convicted of crimes \nwould have that DNA tests would only underscore their guilt.\n  Recently, a high-level study of a commission appointed by Attorney \nGeneral Janet Reno has encouraged prosecutors to be more amenable to \nreopening cases where convictions might be overturned because of the \nuse of DNA testing. The Innocence Project in New York estimates that 60 \npercent of the samples it sends out for testing come back in their \nclients' favor.\n  Justice Robert Jackson wrote some 40 years ago, ``[i]t must prejudice \nthe occasional meritorious application to be buried in a flood of \nworthless ones. He who must search a haystack for a needle is likely to \nend up with the attitude that the needle is not worth the search.'' \nThis bill will help make the hay stack smaller by separating out \nmotions for new trial based on scientific evidence of actual innocence.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort to protect the \nintegrity of the criminal justice system by utilizing all that \ntechnology has to offer. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1700\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reform civil asset forfeiture, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     civil asset forfeiture reform\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the \nSessions/Schumer Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 1999. This bill \nis the product of many months of work by a bipartisan group of \nJudiciary Committee Senators. It will make many needed reforms to the \nlaw of civil asset forfeiture. At the same time, our measures preserve \nforfeiture as a crucial tool for law enforcement.\n  The Sessions/Schumer bill was drafted in close consultation and with \nthe support of the Justice and Treasury Departments. It has the support \nof the FBI, the DEA, the INS, and the U.S. Marshall's Service.\n  There are five major reforms in the Sessions/Schumer bill. First, we \nhave raised the burden of proof on the government in forfeiture claims \nfrom probable cause to preponderance of the evidence, the same as other \ncivil cases.\n  Second, Sessions/Schumer requires that real property can only be \nseized through the court. It will be illegal for federal agents to \nphysically seize real property until the property has been forfeited in \ncourt.\n  For those who cannot afford the cost bond, our bill also adds a \nproperty bond alternative for contesting forfeiture. This provides \npotential claimants with more flexibility in choosing how to proceed \nwith a claim against seized assets. It will no longer be necessary to \nprovide cash up front to file a claim. Instead, a claimant can simply \npledge an asset to cover the anticipated costs or, if the claimant \ncannot afford this, proceed without posting any bond.\n  Sessions/Schumer also creates a uniform innocent owner defense; an \ninnocent owner's interest in property cannot be forfeited by the \ngovernment. An innocent owner includes one who had no knowledge that \nthe property may have been used to commit a crime. And\n\n[[Page S12109]]\n\nin cases where the property was acquired after the crime, the uniform \ninnocent owner defense includes bona fide purchases who have no reason \nto know that the asset they have purchased may be tainted.\n  The fifth major reform provides payment of attorney's fees. If a \nclaimant receives a judgment in his favor, the Government will pay the \nclaimant's reasonable attorney's fees.\n  I am pleased to note that this bill has the support of a broad \ncoalition of law enforcement groups. It has been endorsed by the \nFraternal Order of Police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officer's \nAssociation, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the \nInternational Brotherhood of Police Officers, the National Association \nof Police Organizations, the National District Attorney's Association, \nthe National Sheriff's Association, and the National Troopers' \nCoalition.\n  As one who believes in justice and who spent many years as a federal \nprosecutor, I know how important asset forfeiture is in the war on \ndrugs. We cannot allow exaggerated rhetoric and outdated examples to \ndestroy asset forfeiture as a law enforcement tool. I believe that this \nbill will strike an appropriate balance between those on the front \nlines of the war on drugs and advocates for reform.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nthe Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 1999. This important \nlegislation makes needed reforms to Federal civil asset forfeiture \nwhile preserving Federal civil asset forfeiture and its important role \nin fighting crime.\n  The government has had the authority to seize property connected to \nillegal activity since the founding days of the Republic. Forfeiture \nmay involve seizing contraband, like drugs, or the tools of the trade \nthat facilitate the crime.\n  Further, forfeiture is critical to taking the profits out of the \nillegal activity. Profit is the motivation for many crimes like drug \ntrafficking and racketeering, and it is from these enormous profits \nthat the criminal activity thrives and sustains. The use of traditional \ncriminal sanctions of fines and imprisonment are inadequate to fight \nthe enormously profitable trade in illegal drugs, organized crime, and \nother such activity, because even if one offender is imprisoned the \ncriminal activity continues.\n  Asset forfeiture deters crime. It has been a major weapon in the war \non drugs since the mid-1980s, when we expanded civil forfeiture to give \nit a more meaningful role.\n  The Judiciary Subcommittee on Criminal Justice Oversight which I \nchair, held a hearing recently on this important issue. We heard from \nthe Department of Justice, the Department of Treasury, the law \nenforcement community and others involved in this issue. The \nDepartments and law enforcement expressed support for reform but \nconcerns about going too far.\n  As I stated at that time, many believe the government should have the \nburden of proving that it is more likely than not that the property was \ninvolved in the criminal activity, rather than the owner having to \nprove that the property was not involved. There is wide support for \ndeveloping a more uniform innocent owner defense. Further, some are \nconcerned that under current law the government is not liable when it \nnegligently damages property in its possession, even when the property \nis later returned to its innocent owner.\n  I believe we have addressed these concerns in this bill. We have \nraised the burden on the government to the preponderance of the \nevidence standard, which is the general burden of proof used in civil \ncases.\n  We have developed a uniform innocent owner defense to protect an \nowner's interest in property when he did not have knowledge of the \ncriminal activity or took reasonable steps to stop or prevent the \nillegal use of the property. The bill also protects the bonafide \npurchaser who purchased the property after the fact without knowledge \nof the criminal activity.\n  As an additional reform provision, this legislation holds the \ngovernment liable for the negligent damage to property as the result of \nunreasonable law enforcement actions while the property is in the \ngovernment's possession.\n  This bill requires the government to make seizures pursuant to a \nwarrant, based on probable cause, and requires a timely notice to \ninterested parties of the seizure. When a claim has been filed for the \nreturn of property, the government must conduct a judicial hearing \nwithin 90 days, and if the court enters a judgment for the claimant, \nthe government must pay reasonable attorney fees to the claimant. This \nis a reasonable way to award attorney fees to the claimant after the \ncourt has determined that the claim was justified. This provision also \nprotects the government from frivolous claims because it maintains the \npossibility of awarding cost to the government if the claim is \ndetermined to be frivolous.\n  In this legislation, we encourage the government to use criminal \nforfeiture as an alternative to civil forfeiture. We also allow for the \nuse of forfeited funds to pay restitution to crime victims by expanding \nthe ability of the Attorney General to use property forfeited in a \nFederal civil case to pay restitution to victims of the underlying \ncrime.\n  This bill represents a compromise between the many interests involved \nin this issue. I would like to commend my colleagues Senators Sessions, \nBiden, Schumer, and Feinstein for their work on this complex issue. \nAfter the hearing in my Subcommittee, we worked hard to create \ncomprehensive, bipartisan legislation, and I believe we have succeeded.\n  This bill has been endorsed by law enforcement organizations \nincluding the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of \nPolice Organizations, the National District Attorneys Association, the \nNational Troopers Coalition, the National Sheriffs Association, and the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police.\n  This is a balanced reform of Federal civil asset forfeiture laws. It \ndoes not tie the hands of law enforcement and does not give criminals \nthe upper hand. It makes needed reforms of civil asset forfeiture while \npreserving civil asset forfeiture as an essential law enforcement tool.\n  I hope our colleagues will join with us in supporting this important \nbipartisan legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1702. A bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to \nallow shareholder common stock to be transferred to adopted Alaska \nNative children and their descendants, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         alaska native claims technical amendments act of 1999\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce \nlegislation that would make technical changes to the Alaska Native \nClaims Settlement Act (ANCSA).\n  As my colleagues know, ANCSA was enacted in 1971 stimulated by the \nneed to address Native land claims as well as the desire to clear the \nway for the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and thereby \nprovide our country with access to the petroleum resources of Alaska's \nNorth Slope. This landmark piece of legislation is a breathing, living, \ndocument that often needs to be attended for Alaska Natives to receive \nits full benefits. This body has amended the Act many times including \nthis Congress.\n  This bill has nine provisions. One provision would allow common stock \nto be willed to adopted-out descendants. Another provision would \nclarify the liability for contaminated lands in Alaska. The \nclarification of contaminated land would declare that no person \nacquiring interest in land under this Act shall be liable for the costs \nof removal or remedial action, any damages, or any third party \nliability arising out or as a result of any contamination on that land \nat the time the land was acquired.\n  In 1917, the Norton Bay Reservation was established on 350,000 acres \nof land located on the north side of Norton Bay southeast of Nome, \nAlaska, for the benefit of Alaska Natives who now reside in the village \nof Elim, Alaska. The purpose of the establishment of the reservation \nincluded providing a land, economic, subsistence, and resources base \nfor the people of that area.\n  In 1929, through an Executive Order, 50,000 acres of land were \ndeleted from the reservation with little consultation and certainly \nwithout the informed consent of the people who were to be most affected \nby such a deletion. After passage of ANCSA, only the remaining\n\n[[Page S12110]]\n\n300,000 acres of the original reservation were conveyed to the Elim \nNative Corporation. This loss of land from the original reservation has \nbecome over the years a festering wound to the people of Elim. It now \nneeds to be healed through the restoration or replacement of the \ndeleted fifty thousand acres of land to the Native Village Corporation \nauthorized by ANCSA to hold such land.\n  Section 5 of the bill amends the Act further to allow equal access to \nAlaska Native veterans who served in the military or other armed \nservices during the Vietnam War. I want to spend a moment speaking \nabout this provision in particular, Mr. President, because I feel a \ngreat injustice has occurred and the current Administration has turned \nits back to these dedicated American veterans.\n\n  Under the Native Allotment Act, Alaska Natives were allowed to apply \nfor lands which they traditionally used as fish camps, berry picking \ncamps or hunting camps. However, many of our Alaska Natives answered \nthe call to duty and served in the services during the Vietnam War and \nwere unable to apply for their native allotment. This provision allows \nthem to apply for their native allotments and would expand the dates to \ninclude the full years of the Vietnam War. The original dates \nrecommended by the Administration only allowed the dates January 1, \n1969 to December 31, 1971. Our Alaska Native veterans should not be \npenalized for serving during the entire dates of the Vietnam conflict. \nThis provision corrects that inequity by expanding the dates to reflect \nall the years of the Vietnam War--August 5, 1964 to May 7, 1975.\n  Mr. President, Alaska Natives have faithfully answered the call of \nduty when asked to serve in the armed services. In fact, American \nIndians and Alaska Natives generally have the highest record of \nanswering the call to duty. Where their needs are concerned I believe \nwe should be inclusive, not exclusive. What this Administration has \ndone to deny them their rights is shameful. Unfortunately, their \ntreatment of Alaska Native Veterans is reflective of their treatment of \nAlaska Natives in general.\n  As I am sure my colleagues will agree, the history of our Nation \nreflects many examples of injustices to Native Americans. As hearings \nwill confirm, this issue calls out to be sensibly remedied and can be \nwith relative ease as outlined in this section of the bill.\n  I plan on holding a hearing on this legislation at the earliest \npossible opportunity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1703. A bill to establish America's education goals; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n            establish america's education goals legislation\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 1704. A bill to provide for college affordability and high \nstandards; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                      access to high standards act\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \ntwo education bills for consideration in the context of reauthorization \nof the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (``ESEA''). Two weeks \nago, I introduced two education bills related to raising standards and \nimproving accountability for our public school teachers. Last week, I \nintroduced three bills related to raising standards and accountability \nin our schools. The two bills that I introduce today focus on raising \nstandards and accountability for student performance. One bill \ncontinues our commitment to provide support for the standards-based \nreform movement taking place in virtually every State by reauthorizing \nthe National Education Goals Panel. The other bill, the Access to High \nStandards Act, which I introduce on behalf of myself and Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison, will provide our high school students with greater \naccess to rigorous, college level courses through advanced placement \nprograms.\n  I think most people would agree that in order to compete and continue \nto prosper in our global economy, it is imperative that our students \nare provided with a world-class educational program. To that end, we \nowe it to our students to define high academic standards, monitor their \nprogress and provide them with the resources they need to succeed. The \nNational Education Goals Panel has played a crucial role in achieving \nthese objectives by focusing attention on the need to raise standards \nand effective methods for achieving higher performance on the local \nlevel. As a founding and current member of the National Education Goal \nPanel, I am pleased to introduce a bill that would reauthorize the \nPanel so that it can continue its efforts to provide leadership and \ntrack progress for local efforts to raise standards for student \nperformance.\n  The Goals Panel is a bipartisan body of federal and state officials \nmade up of eight governors, four members of Congress, four state \nlegislators and two members appointed by the President. The Panel is \ncharged with reporting national and state progress toward goals set \ninitially by the nation's Governors during a National Education Summit \nmeeting with President Bush and expanded during the 1994 ESEA \nreauthorization Summit meeting with President Bush and expanded during \nthe 1994 ESEA reauthorization process in the Educate America Act. The \nPanel also identifies promising practices for improving education and \nhelps to build a nationwide, bipartisan consensus to achieve the goals. \nThe eight National Education Goals call for greater levels of: school \nreadiness; student achievement and citizenship; high school completion; \nteacher education and professional development; parental participation \nin the schools; literacy and lifelong learning; and safe, disciplined \nand alcohol- and drug-free schools.\n  We need to continue the Panel's work, because we are not yet where we \nneed to be with respect to meeting the goals or with respect to \nsupporting state and local efforts to put in place standards-based \neducational programs. Data collected by the Goals Panel has helped and \ncan continue to help State and local officials to formulate \ncomprehensive school improvement policies. The Goals Panel also has \nprovided and can continue to provide guidance to federal, state and \nlocal policy-makers by providing a national picture for student \nperformance. We have made good progress towards developing more \ncompetitive, high quality educational systems in our states and \nlocalities, but we must not leave the task incomplete. We must continue \nto focus attention and resources on incorporating high standards into \npublic education. As Secretary Riley stated before the nation's \ngovernors and President Bush met in 1989, ``Significant educational \nimprovements do not just happen. They are planned and pursued.'' I hope \nthat my colleagues will support continuation of the Goals Panel so that \nwe can continue to use the Panel as a tool for setting and achieving \nhigh standards for student performance.\n  Building on the successful expansion of the Advanced Placement \nIncentive Program achieved in the last Congress, the Access to High \nStandards Act is intended to help foster the continued growth of \nadvanced placement programs throughout the nation and to help ensure \nequal access to these programs for low income students. Advanced \nplacement programs already provide rigorous academics and valuable \ncollege credits at half the high schools in the United States, serving \nover 1.5 million students last year. Many States that have advanced \nplacement incentive programs have already shown tremendous success in \nincreasing participation rates, raising achievement scores, and \nincreasing the involvement of low-income and under-served students. \nNevertheless students--particularly low-income students--continue to be \ndenied or have limited access to this critical program.\n\n  Despite recent growth in state initiatives and participation, AP \nprograms are still often distributed unevenly among regions, states, \nand even high schools within the same districts. Just a few months ago, \na group of students filed a complaint in federal court against the \nState of California seeking equal access to advance placement programs. \nOver forty percent of our nation's public schools still do not offer \nany Advanced Placement courses. The\n\n[[Page S12111]]\n\nAccess to High Standards Act is intended to take additional steps in \nfostering the continued growth of advanced placement programs \nthroughout the nation and to help ensure equal access to these programs \nfor low-income students. This bill creates a $25 million demonstration \ngrant program to help states build and expand advanced placement \nincentive programs giving priority to districts with high \nconcentrations of low-income students and to State programs targeting \nlow-income students. In addition, the bill authorizes a pilot grant \nprogram for States seeking to provide advanced placement courses \nthrough Internet-based on-line curriculum to students in rural areas or \nareas where the lack of available advanced placement teachers make it \nimpossible to provide traditional courses. The bill also make AP a part \nof other federal education programs such as the Technology for \nEducation Act programs that I helped author in 1994. In this way, \nfederal initiatives will be encouraged to incorporate the high \nstandards and measurable results of the AP program.\n  As many of my colleagues know, college costs have risen many times \nfaster than inflation over the last decade, making attendance more \ndifficult for high school graduates and creating tremendous financial \nburdens. Advanced placement programs address this issue by giving \nstudents an opportunity to earn college credit in high school by \npreparing for and passing AP exams. In fact, a single AP English test \nscore of 3 or better is worth approximately $500 in tuition at the \nUniversity of New Mexico, and the credits granted to students \nnationwide are worth billions each year.\n  By promoting AP courses, we also address the need to raise academic \nstandards. Many states and districts are struggling to develop and \nimplement rigorous academic standards and concrete measures of \nachievement--an approach that is advocated by many experts, lawmakers, \nand the public. By implementing high academic standards and providing \nstandardized measures for achievement through AP programs, we can help \nprepare students for college. This is clearly a necessary goal. Almost \n33 percent of all freshmen fail to pass to pass basic entrance exams \nand are required to take remedial courses. And, at least in part due to \nacademic difficulties, over 25 percent of freshmen drop out before \ntheir second year.\n  In addition, expanding AP programs improve students' academic \nperformance in college. And because the vast majority of AP teachers \nteach several non-AP classes as well, AP programs also have a tendency \nof raising schoolwide standards and achievement among the 400 new \nschools adopting the program each year. As Secretary Riley has said, \nexpanded AP will ``help fight the tyranny of low expectations, which \ntragically hold back so many of our students.''\n  Of course, there is no single remedy or federal program that can hope \nto address all of the issues that public education must face in order \nto improve the achievement and preparation of our students. However, I \nbelieve that high college costs and low academic standards deserve our \nclosest attention, and I am confident that expansion of advanced \nplacement programs will help states address these issues effectively.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to incorporate the two \nbills I am introducing today, as well as, the education bills \nintroduced in recent weeks into the ESEA. I believe that they will go a \nlong way towards improving education in the United States by focusing \non raising standards and ensuring accountability for teacher, school \nand student performance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/06/senate-section/article/S12111-1", "month":

PROTECTING SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Congressional Budget Office has projected that \n     Congress is headed toward using at least $19,000,000,000 of \n     the social security surplus in fiscal year 2000.\n       (2) Amendment number 1851 calls for across-the-board cuts, \n     which could result in a broad-based reduction of 10 percent, \n     taking into consideration approved appropriations bills and \n     other costs likely to be incurred in the future, such as \n     relief for hurricane victims, Kosovo, and health care \n     providers.\n       (3) These across-the-board cuts would sharply reduce \n     military readiness and long-term defense modernization \n     programs, cut emergency aid to farmers and hurricane victims, \n     reduce the number of children served by Head Start, cut back \n     aid to schools to help reduce the class size, severely limit \n     the number of veterans served in VA hospitals, reduce the \n     number of FBI and Border Patrol agents, restrict funding for \n     important transportation investments, and limit funding for \n     environmental cleanup sites.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that instead of raiding social security surpluses or \n     indiscriminately cutting defense, emergency relief, \n     education, veterans' health care, law enforcement, \n     transportation, environmental cleanup, and other \n     discretionary appropriations across the board, Congress \n     should fund fiscal year 2000 appropriations, without using \n     budget scorekeeping gimmicks, by closing special-interest tax \n     loopholes and using other appropriate offsets.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       KENNEDY AMENDMENT NO. 2268\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1650, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       In order to improve the quality of education funds \n     available for education, including funds for Title 1, the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Pell Grants \n     shall be excluded from any across-the-board reduction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                ABRAHAM (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2269\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Ashcroft, \nand Mr. Smith of New Hampshire) submitted an amendment intended to be \nproposed by them to amendment No. 1828 proposed by Mr. Coverdell to the \nbill, S. 1650, supra; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no funds \n     appropriated under this Act shall be used to carry out any \n     program of distributing sterile needles or syringes for the \n     hypodermic injection of any illegal drug.

Before the season began, the Braves and \nbaseball as a whole were shaken by the news that Andreas Galarraga, the \nAll-Star first baseman of the Braves, had been diagnosed with non-\nhodgkin's lymphoma, a form of cancer. Although Galarraga had to sit own \nthe entire 1999 season, he has now fully recovered and everyone is \neagerly awaiting his return to the field next year.\n  Despite the loss of Galarraga and several other individuals who had \nbeen an integral part of the previous championship teams, the Atlanta \nBraves never gave up. Through this difficult time, the Braves played to \nthe best of their ability and exceeded everyone's expectations. This \nseason the Braves won more games than any other team in baseball which \nis why, including the worst to first season of 1991, this season may \nhave been the most meaningful of all their recent successes.\n  In this year when each major league team individually celebrated Hank \nAaron Day--a day devoted to the memory of baseball's all time homerun \nleader breaking Babe Ruth's staggering record of 714 homers--the \nAtlanta Braves once again rose to the top. Their national following \ncombined with their hard work and perseverance have given the Braves \nthe moniker of ``America's Team,'' an honor well suited for these \nchampions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/06/senate-section/article/S12114-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              COOPERATIVES\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, October is ``Co-op Month,'' and \ntoday I would like to stress the importance of cooperatives to the \nnation and especially to my state of North Dakota. Cooperatives are \npure examples of good business--companies formed, owned and \ndemocratically controlled by the people who use its services and who \nreceive benefits from patronage. Cooperatives are institutions that \ndemonstrate people making their lives better through hard work and \ntheir knowledge of the American economic system.\n  In fact, the notion of cooperation is an ideal--people working \ntogether to accomplish a task and provide products and services for the \npublic good. It is this basic philosophical idea, which so many find \ndifficult to achieve, that the citizens of my state have been \nparticularly adept at making a reality. North Dakota farmers have been \nleaders when it comes to improving their economic and social positions \nthrough cooperative community enterprise. From the great traditions of \nearly political movements that created cooperative momentum--the \nAmerican Society of Equity, the Nonpartisan League, and the Farmers \nUnion--an educational base was formed that today still influences the \ndrive for cooperative development. As a result, electricity and \ntelephone service, pasta, sugar, bison and scores of other marketing \nand service cooperatives cover North Dakota today. Income is \ndistributed, products and services are supplied, and employment and \nopportunity are spread throughout the state.\n  Cooperatives are formed to protect the way of life for independent \nproducers and provide essential services for rural communities. Member \neducation, one-member, one-vote equity in business decisions, and \nrelying on neighbors to form and maintain the institution are all \ncooperative principles that underpin the success of these ventures. The \nlegendary hardships that have been overcome in my state's pioneering \nhistory required cooperation among neighbors for everything from food \nand shelter to aid in farm labor and human companionship. Cooperation \nand the formation of cooperative enterprise were logical means of \nensuring rural survival. We have long known that through organization, \nwe can accomplish any goal, and through cooperation we can work \ntogether to benefit all. Therefore, during October, the month \ndesignated to recognize the importance of cooperatives, I thank the \nmembers of cooperatives for taking the initiative to direct their \neconomic futures and for contributing to the unique economic heritage \nof North Dakota and this nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/06/senate-section/article/S12114-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12114-S12115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN CELEBRATION OF REV. GREGORY J. JACKSON\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nthe Reverend Gregory J. Jackson as he celebrates his 15th year as \npastor of the Mount Olive Baptist Church in Hackensack, New Jersey. \nReverend Jackson has been an ordained minister for over twenty-three \nyears and has ministered to the Hackensack community since 1984. It is \na pleasure for me to be able to honor his accomplishments.\n  Since his ordination on May 16, 1976, Reverend Jackson has worked to \nhelp those less fortunate throughout New York and New Jersey. During \nhis career, Reverend Jackson has shown commitment to public service as \nwell as dedication to the disabled. These life experiences have proved \ninvaluable in his ministry. His activism is widely known and admired \nthroughout the State of New Jersey.\n  In addition to his ministry in Hackensack, Reverend Jackson has \nplayed a very active role in strengthening the political and economic \nlife of New Jersey. He has served on a number of civic organizations \nincluding the NAACP of Bergen County, Fair Housing Board of Bergen \nCounty, and the Advisory Board of the Office on Aging. He has also \nserved as the President of the Hackensack Board of Education, Treasurer \nof the North Jersey Baptist Association, Vice-President of the \nFellowship of Black Churches and as Vice-President of the Bergen County \nCouncil of Churches. Reverend Jackson recently been named as Director \nof Promotions of the Lott Carey Baptist Foreign Mission Convention.\n  Although Reverend Jackson has dedicated so much time to civic \norganizations, he has never lost sight of the need to serve his \ncommunity. During his fifteen year tenure as the pastor of Mount Olive \nBaptist Church, the parish has grown by more than 1,000 new members. In \naddition, Reverend Jackson has implemented ministry programs to improve \nthe Hackensack community both spiritually and educationally.\n  I am pleased to recognize a leader of great stature in New Jersey, \nand a close friend. Through all of the years\n\n[[Page S12115]]\n\nwe have spent, working to strengthen New Jersey's communities, I have \nalways known Reverend Jackson to stand on principle, loyalty, and \ncommitment. I look forward to continuing to work with Reverend Jackson, \nand I wish him the best as he celebrates this momentous \noccasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/06/senate-section/article/S12115-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE SS WAYNE VICTORY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' \nattention to a new exhibit of artifacts from the SS Wayne Victory. The \nexhibit, which is located at Wayne State University in my home town of \nDetroit, MI, is being dedicated on Friday, October 8, 1999.\n  The SS Wayne Victory was a so-called ``Victory Ship,'' one of several \nhundred ships built during the final two years of World War II to serve \nas cargo and troop transport vessels. The SS Wayne Victory was named \nfor Wayne University, now known as Wayne State University. Commissioned \nin 1945, the SS Wayne Victory served in World War II, the Korean \nconflict and the Vietnam war.\n  Thanks to the efforts of a Wayne State University alumnus, the \ncontributions of the SS Wayne Victory to our armed forces will be \ncelebrated for years to come. Many ships of its kind fell into disuse \nand were forgotten after their service. Fortunately, Joe Gerson, who \ngrew up in Detroit and graduated from Wayne State University in 1951, \nlocated the SS Wayne Victory and negotiated with the federal government \nfor the permanent loan of several artifacts from the ship to the \nuniversity. These artifacts include the ship's bell, engine order \ntelegraph, wheel, furniture, oars, life rings, and name board. Mr. \nGerson also generously contributed funds which allowed the university \nto transport the artifacts to Detroit and to display them in the \npermanent exhibit being dedicated this Friday.\n  Mr. President, the preservation of artifacts like those from the SS \nWayne Victory is critical if we are to continue to learn from history. \nThanks to Joe Gerson and Wayne State University, one small, but \nsignificant, piece of American military history will be available for \npeople to study in the 21st century. I know my colleagues join me in \nextending Joe Gerson and Wayne State University our thanks and \ncongratulations for their commitment to the preservation of the memory \nof the SS Wayne Victory's role in some of the most significant military \nconflicts in our nation's history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/06/senate-section/article/S12115-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12115-S12146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AIR TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  On October 5, 1999, amended and passed H.R. 1000.

TOURISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) through an effective public-private partnership, \n     Federal, State, and local governments and the travel and \n     tourism industry can successfully market the United States as \n     the premiere international tourist destination in the world;\n       (2) in 1997, the travel and tourism industry made a \n     substantial contribution to the health of the Nation's \n     economy, as follows:\n       (A) The industry is one of the Nation's largest employers, \n     directly employing 7,000,000 Americans, throughout every \n     region of the country, heavily concentrated among small \n     businesses, and indirectly employing an additional 9,200,000 \n     Americans, for a total of 16,200,000 jobs.\n       (B) The industry ranks as the first, second, or third \n     largest employer in 32 States and the District of Columbia, \n     generating a total tourism-related annual payroll of \n     $127,900,000,000.\n       (C) The industry has become the Nation's third-largest \n     retail sales industry, generating a total of $489,000,000,000 \n     in total expenditures.\n       (D) The industry generated $71,700,000,000 in tax revenues \n     for Federal, State, and local governments;\n       (3) the more than $98,000,000,000 spent by foreign visitors \n     in the United States in 1997 generated a trade services \n     surplus of more than $26,000,000,000;\n       (4) the private sector, States, and cities currently spend \n     more than $1,000,000,000 annually to promote particular \n     destinations within the United States to international \n     visitors;\n       (5) because other nations are spending hundreds of millions \n     of dollars annually to promote the visits of international \n     tourists to their countries, the United States will miss a \n     major marketing opportunity if it fails to aggressively \n     compete for an increased share of international tourism \n     expenditures as they continue to increase over the next \n     decade;\n       (6) a well-funded, well-coordinated international marketing \n     effort--combined with additional public and private sector \n     efforts--would help small and large businesses, as well as \n     State and local governments, share in the anticipated \n     phenomenal growth of the international travel and tourism \n     market in the 21st century;\n       (7) by making permanent the successful visa waiver pilot \n     program, Congress can facilitate the increased flow of \n     international visitors to the United States;\n       (8) Congress can increase the opportunities for attracting \n     international visitors and enhancing their stay in the United \n     States by--\n       (A) improving international signage at airports, seaports, \n     land border crossings, highways, and bus, train, and other \n     public transit stations in the United States;\n       (B) increasing the availability of multilingual tourist \n     information; and\n       (C) creating a toll-free, private-sector operated, \n     telephone number, staffed by multilingual operators, to \n     provide assistance to international tourists coping with an \n     emergency;\n       (9) by establishing a satellite system of accounting for \n     travel and tourism, the Secretary of Commerce could provide \n     Congress and the President with objective, thorough data that \n     would help policymakers more accurately gauge the size and \n     scope of the domestic travel and tourism industry and its \n     significant impact on the health of the Nation's economy; and\n       (10) having established the United States National Tourism \n     Organization under the United States National Tourism \n     Organization Act of 1996 (22 U.S.C. 2141 et seq.) to increase \n     the United States share of the international tourism market \n     by developing a national travel and tourism strategy, \n     Congress should support a long-term marketing effort and \n     other important regulatory reform initiatives to promote \n     increased travel to the United States for the benefit of \n     every sector of the economy.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to provide \n     international visitor initiatives\n\n[[Page S12125]]\n\n     and an international marketing program to enable the United \n     States travel and tourism industry and every level of \n     government to benefit from a successful effort to make the \n     United States the premiere travel destination in the world.\n       (c) International Visitor Assistance Task Force.--\n       (1) Establishment.--Not later than 9 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce shall \n     establish an Intergovernmental Task Force for International \n     Visitor Assistance (hereafter in this subsection referred to \n     as the ``Task Force'').\n       (2) Duties.--The Task Force shall examine--\n       (A) signage at facilities in the United States, including \n     airports, seaports, land border crossings, highways, and bus, \n     train, and other public transit stations, and shall identify \n     existing inadequacies and suggest solutions for such \n     inadequacies, such as the adoption of uniform standards on \n     international signage for use throughout the United States in \n     order to facilitate international visitors' travel in the \n     United States;\n       (B) the availability of multilingual travel and tourism \n     information and means of disseminating, at no or minimal cost \n     to the Government, of such information; and\n       (C) facilitating the establishment of a toll-free, private-\n     sector operated, telephone number, staffed by multilingual \n     operators, to provide assistance to international tourists \n     coping with an emergency.\n       (3) Membership.--The Task Force shall be composed of the \n     following members:\n       (A) The Secretary of Commerce.\n       (B) The Secretary of State.\n       (C) The Secretary of Transportation.\n       (D) The Chair of the Board of Directors of the United \n     States National Tourism Organization.\n       (E) Such other representatives of other Federal agencies \n     and private-sector entities as may be determined to be \n     appropriate to the mission of the Task Force by the Chairman.\n       (4) Chairman.--The Secretary of Commerce shall be Chairman \n     of the Task Force. The Task Force shall meet at least twice \n     each year. Each member of the Task Force shall furnish \n     necessary assistance to the Task Force.\n       (5) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Chairman of the Task Force shall \n     submit to the President and to Congress a report on the \n     results of the review, including proposed amendments to \n     existing laws or regulations as may be appropriate to \n     implement such recommendations.\n       (d) Travel and Tourism Industry Satellite System of \n     Accounting.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Commerce shall complete, \n     as soon as may be practicable, a satellite system of \n     accounting for the travel and tourism industry.\n       (2) Funding.--To the extent any costs or expenditures are \n     incurred under this subsection, they shall be covered to the \n     extent funds are available to the Department of Commerce for \n     such purpose.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) Authorization.--Subject to paragraph (2), there are \n     authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary \n     for the purpose of funding international promotional \n     activities by the United States National Tourism Organization \n     to help brand, position, and promote the United States as the \n     premiere travel and tourism destination in the world.\n       (2) Restrictions on use of funds.--None of the funds \n     appropriated under paragraph (1) may be used for purposes \n     other than marketing, research, outreach, or any other \n     activity designed to promote the United States as the \n     premiere travel and tourism destination in the world, except \n     that the general and administrative expenses of operating the \n     United States National Tourism Organization shall be borne by \n     the private sector through such means as the Board of \n     Directors of the Organization shall determine.\n       (3) Report to congress.--Not later than March 30 of each \n     year in which funds are made available under subsection (a), \n     the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Commerce of \n     the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation of the Senate a detailed report \n     setting forth--\n       (A) the manner in which appropriated funds were expended;\n       (B) changes in the United States market share of \n     international tourism in general and as measured against \n     specific countries and regions;\n       (C) an analysis of the impact of international tourism on \n     the United States economy, including, as specifically as \n     practicable, an analysis of the impact of expenditures made \n     pursuant to this section;\n       (D) an analysis of the impact of international tourism on \n     the United States trade balance and, as specifically as \n     practicable, an analysis of the impact on the trade balance \n     of expenditures made pursuant to this section; and\n       (E) an analysis of other relevant economic impacts as a \n     result of expenditures made pursuant to this section.\n\n     SEC. 423.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n     Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Department of Transportation.\n\n     SEC. 904. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Nation's air transportation system is projected to \n     grow by 3.4 percent per year over the next 12 years.\n       (2) Passenger enplanements are expected to rise to more \n     than 1 billion by 2009, from the current level of 660 \n     million.\n       (3) The aviation industry is one of our Nation's critical \n     industries, providing a means of travel to people throughout \n     the world, and a means of moving cargo around the globe.\n       (4) The ability of all sectors of American society, urban \n     and rural, to access and to compete effectively in the new \n     and dynamic global economy requires the ability of the \n     aviation industry to serve all the Nation's communities \n     effectively and efficiently.\n       (5) The Federal Government's role is to promote a safe and \n     efficient national air transportation system through the \n     management of the air traffic control system and through \n     effective and sufficient investment in aviation \n     infrastructure, including the Nation's airports.\n       (6) Numerous studies and reports, including the National \n     Civil Aviation Review Commission, have concluded that the \n     projected expansion of air service may be constrained by \n     gridlock in our Nation's airways, unless substantial \n     management reforms are initiated for the Federal Aviation \n     Administration.\n       (7) The Federal Aviation Administration is responsible for \n     safely and efficiently managing the National Airspace System \n     365 days a year, 24 hours a day.\n       (8) The Federal Aviation Administration's ability to \n     efficiently manage the air traffic system in the United \n     States is restricted by antiquated air traffic control \n     equipment.\n       (9) The Congress has previously recognized that the \n     Administrator needs relief from the Federal Government's \n     cumbersome personnel and procurement laws and regulations to \n     take advantage of emerging technologies and to hire and \n     retain effective managers.\n       (10) The ability of the Administrator to achieve greater \n     efficiencies in the management of the air traffic control \n     system requires additional management reforms, such as the \n     ability to offer incentive pay for excellence in the employee \n     workforce.\n       (11) The ability of the Administrator to effectively manage \n     finances is dependent in part on the Federal Aviation \n     Administration's ability to enter into long-term debt and \n     lease financing of facilities and equipment, which in turn is \n     dependent on sustained sound audits and implementation of a \n     cost management program.\n       (12) The Administrator should use the full authority of the \n     Federal Aviation Administration to make organizational \n     changes to improve the efficiency of the air traffic control \n     system, without compromising the Federal Aviation \n     Administration's primary mission of protecting the safety of \n     the travelling public.\n\n     SEC. 905. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM DEFINED.\n\n       Section 40102(a) is amended--\n        (1) by redesignating paragraphs (5) through (41) as \n     paragraphs (6) through (42), respectively; and\n        (2) by inserting after paragraph (4) the following:\n\n[[Page S12140]]\n\n       ``(5) `air traffic control system' means the combination of \n     elements used to safely and efficiently monitor, direct, \n     control, and guide aircraft in the United States and United \n     States-assigned airspace, including--\n       ``(A) allocated electromagnetic spectrum and physical, \n     real, personal, and intellectual property assets making up \n     facilities, equipment, and systems employed to detect, track, \n     and guide aircraft movement;\n       ``(B) laws, regulations, orders, directives, agreements, \n     and licenses;\n       ``(C) published procedures that explain required actions, \n     activities, and techniques used to ensure adequate aircraft \n     separation; and\n       ``(D) trained personnel with specific technical \n     capabilities to satisfy the operational, engineering, \n     management, and planning requirements for air traffic \n     control.''.\n\n     SEC. 906.
