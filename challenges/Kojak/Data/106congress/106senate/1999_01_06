You alone are Sovereign of this land and demand our \nindefatigable loyalty; You are our Lord and require our obedience. This \nis an awesome moment of encounter with You for the Senators-elect who \nwill make an unreserved commitment to You, to our beloved Nation, and \nto our cherished Constitution. Give them a vision of their greatness as \nleaders of this Nation that You had in mind when You first thought of \nthem before they were born. Thank You for the families who nurtured \nthem, the mentors who sculpted their characters, the loved ones who now \nsustain and encourage them. They are here by Your choice and are \nultimately accountable to You for how they lead this Nation under Your \nguidance. May the vows they take and the immense responsibilities they \nassume bring them to profound humility and an unreserved openness to \nYou. Save them from the seduction of human power by the steady flow of \nYour power; free them from any addiction to popularity by the reminder \nthat You only must be pleased; and replace any aggrandizement of pride \nwith an aggregate of praise for You and the privilege of being servant \nleaders. In the pressures, keep their priorities straight: You and \ntheir families, first; the good of the Nation, second; consensus around \ntruth, third; party loyalties, fourth; and, last of all, personal \nsuccess.\n  And now, gracious God, we claim Your faithfulness for the Senators-\nelect and for all the Senators. May the soul-sized issues before them \nbring them to deeper prayer than ever before. Anoint their minds with \nYour Spirit, guide them to creative solutions, grant them Your \nsupernatural power for facing this challenging hour. Through our Lord \nand Saviour. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/06/senate-section/article/S1-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1-S4]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CERTIFICATES OF ELECTION\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, as all Members are aware, I have been \nworking for some time on various rules changes that would ensure a more \nefficient process by which the Senate considers appropriations bills. \nOne of our concerns has been reinstating rule XVI with respect to \nlegislation on appropriations bills. I believe that many of the \nextraneous items that have been added to appropriations bills over the \npast few Congress would have been ruled out of order if the Senate \nstill had the ability to raise a point of order against legislation on \nappropriations bills formerly contained in rule XVI.\n  Other rule abuses occurred during the closing days of the 105th \nCongress. Consequently, I will shortly introduce five Senate \nresolutions regarding rules and budget process changes and will ask for \ntheir proper referral. Once the resolutions have been referred to the \nappropriate committee, it is my hope the chairmen of the committees \nwill begin swift committee work on the resolutions so the committees \ncan act on the changes as early as possible in the 106th Congress. I \nurge Senators to consider these resolutions and hope when the Senate \nvotes on these measures they will receive huge bipartisan votes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/06/senate-section/article/S6-12", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6-S7]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ORDER PROVIDING FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION AND STATEMENTS ON \n                            JANUARY 19, 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, during the impeachment trial of President \nAndrew Johnson, the Senate limited access to the Senate wing of the \nCapitol, the Senate floor, and the Senate galleries to those with \nofficial business and those with tickets to the proceedings.\n  Over the Christmas holidays, staff of the Office of the Secretary of \nthe Senate, including the Parliamentarian, legislative clerk and \nothers, and staff of the Office of the Sergeant at Arms, and others, \nhave reviewed the historical precedents but also considered what we \ncould do to facilitate the public's access to the proceedings while \ntaking into account contemporary security requirements and the flow of \nbusiness here in the Chamber. Staff have recommended some restrictions \nto the access of the Senate wing, floor, and galleries coupled with a \nticketing system that will make as many seats in the gallery available \nto the public and others as is possible for us to do.\n  Accordingly, in a few minutes I will ask unanimous consent be given \nto a set of policies that reflect the staff recommendations which will \nconfine access to the Senate floor and galleries and to the second and \nthird floors of the Senate wing of the Capitol during the consideration \nof the articles of impeachment and at all times the Chief Justice is \npresiding.\n  I thank the distinguished Democratic leader for his efforts and his \ncooperation in this matter. We have been very careful to make sure we \nreviewed all the precedents, all the rules; that he has had a chance to \ncheck off on these rules, as I have. And I wish to thank all staff who \nresearched the precedent and evaluated current conditions to develop \nthese recommendations. Before seeking unanimous consent, however, I \nwill now yield to the assistant Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The assistant Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the statement of the majority \nleader. He has been very gracious in reaching out to this side of the \naisle on the standards that are going to be initiated and actually used \nduring the impeachment proceedings. I think that the Secretary of the \nSenate and the Sergeant at Arms did an excellent job today of \nexplaining to the Democratic caucus the procedures. I think there was \ngeneral agreement that they were favorable and would certainly make the \nprocess here one of which we could all be proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/06/senate-section/article/S7-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7-S8]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--SENATE ACCESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, for those of us granted the rare \nprivilege of representing our citizens as United States Senators, the \nconvening of a new Congress is a moment filled with hope and optimism. \nI know this is a sentiment shared by my colleagues who have served here \ntogether for many years; I am equally certain it is a feeling in the \nheart of every new member whom we welcome into the Chamber today.\n  We all choose to enter public service in the belief that small \ndifferences made every day somehow contribute in large measure to the \nbetterment of our national life. For me, this has always been a day \nthat represented great promise and potential.\n  And despite the difficult circumstances that confront us on the first \nday of the 106th Congress, I choose to face the grim task of the \nimpeachment proceedings with a sense of hope and optimism, too.\n  It is my sincere hope that we can continue to be guided in the Senate \nby a completely nonpartisan approach to our responsibilities--and I \npledge the cooperation of the entire Democratic caucus in that effort. \nWe remain optimistic that Republicans and Democrats in the Senate can \ncome together on a sensible plan that adheres to the principles of \nfairness, expedition and due process.\n  The promise of bipartisan consensus is within our grasp. If we \nsucceed in coming to closure on an acceptable resolution to govern \nthese proceedings, then we have the potential for not only ending this \nunfortunate episode, but for laying a foundation for rebuilding a \nworking coalition to address the critical policy issues that so demand \nour absolute attention.\n  But to complete the work at hand, we must first set some things \naside. We must set aside our partisan instincts. We should reject any \nnotion of political advantage in this process, and act solely in the \nnational interest.\n  We must set aside feelings of grave disappointment and anger directed \nat the President for his actions. We must also set aside the resentment \nmany feel over the manner and method of the long investigation that \nbegat these articles of impeachment.\n  Regrettably, we must also set aside--until this matter is resolved--\nimportant legislative work on matters like education, health care, \nMedicare and Social Security. This, in and of itself, should serve to \nmotivate us to proceed with deliberate dispatch on these articles, \naccepting not even a day's delay in the coming trial.\n  And finally, we should set aside the rancor and recriminations that \nhave marked these sad deliberations, and rise to a level of dignity and \ndecency that will be judged favorably in history's long light.\n  But we will not set aside our responsibility. We will not defer our \nduty.\n  Make no mistake: Senate Democrats will follow the Constitution. We \nintend to abide by the Senate's procedures. We will respect past \nprecedents. We will duly consider these articles. We will insist on \nfair treatment of the President. And we will hear the evidence \npresented by the House Republicans who have made these charges.\n  But we should not put process ahead of progress in this matter. We \nmust\n\n[[Page S9]]\n\nfind a way to resolve this, and move forward.\n  The United States Constitution is a document that continues to reveal \nan uncanny resiliency after two centuries. It's as if the framers found \na formula to adapt to contingencies unseen; and to circumstances \nunknowable. Their wisdom in drafting the Impeachment clause affords us \nthe opportunity to seize one of the options we are considering today. \nIf we now simply apply some common sense, we will find common ground, \nand the result will be the common good.\n  I have faith in the Senate, and faith in my colleagues, that we will \ndo so.\n  The Senate may never decisively resolve this maddening legal \nargument; but we must find a way to end this lingering national \ntorment.\n  As do all my colleagues, I love this country. And I care deeply for \nthis institution, the Senate of the United States. I want to do right \nby both. Working together, Republican and Democrat, I think we can.\n  Just as we have sworn an oath today to put the Nation's interests \nabove all others, tomorrow when we are sworn as judge and juror, we \nmust do the same. That will require absolute fairness, due process, \ndeliberate speed, and a final resolution of these charges. The \nDemocratic caucus is committed to each and every one of those goals, \nand is prepared to proceed immediately toward achieving them.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to welcome all the Senators to the \n106th Congress. We have had an all too brief and somewhat overwhelming \ninterlude since the last day of the 105th Congress in October. That \ninterval turned out to be dramatic and eventful in more ways than one, \nand because of events that occurred therein, the Senate's agenda for \nthis year will be more important than ever.\n  We will soon be considering charges brought by the House of \nRepresentatives against the President of the United States. I cannot \nthink of a more serious subject. Yet the Senate has its well-\nestablished procedures to deal with this situation. While it is not \nexactly routine, neither is it totally unique.\n  We have our responsibilities under the Constitution, and we will meet \nthose responsibilities in an orderly fashion. That is why I have met \nseveral times and talked by phone other times with Senator Daschle, the \nDemocratic leader, and why the two of us have met with the Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court, whose duty it is to preside over a Senate \ntrial involving the President. We have both consulted and are still \nvery actively involved in consulting with fellow Senators, with \nconstitutional scholars, with officers of the Senate, in terms of the \nlaw and the rules of the Senate.\n  Our duty is clear: To demonstrate anew our national commitment to \njustice and fair play. That is what the public expects from us, \nregardless of their individual opinions concerning the President. That \nis why I am confident that is what they will receive. No Senator in \nthis Chamber needs to be reminded that we are here first and foremost \nto serve the American people. Americans today look to the future with \nthe same hopes that have inspired and sustained this country for more \nthan 200 years. They want a better life for themselves and, more \nimportantly, for their children. Not just economically, but also in \nterms of a decent future and a just and caring society.\n  I want to emphasize now that I have not gone to the media and \noutlined exactly how this impeachment process will go forward because \nno final conclusion has been made. This is not something that can be \nreported in an evolutionary way because there are too many things that \nhave to be considered, too many different parties--Senate Republicans, \nSenate Democrats, House Members, the White House--and we have had to \ncontinue to consider the opinions of all to try to develop a fair way \nto have an expeditious trial that gets justice based on the rule of \nlaw. I think that it is more important that we hear from all parties \nand come to, hopefully, a conclusion that sets an outline of how we \nwill proceed from beginning to end than it is to always be reporting on \nthe current developments.\n  Never before have I had so much reported about what I was thinking, \ndoing, or saying when I have said so little. I have been accused of \nbeing ``holed up'' in my hometown of Pascagoula, MS. Where would you \nexpect me to be during the holidays? How about at home with my family \nand with my constituents, enjoying that precious season of the year.\n  However, I had no moss growing under my feet. I was talking with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, listening and thinking and \ndeveloping and evolving a process that I think will get the job done. I \nbelieve we can very well achieve that goal within the next 24 hours--\none that neither the House nor the White House will necessarily think \nis wonderful--giving all parties a fair chance to make the case and \nreach a conclusion that is equitable. We will get that done. And we \nwill get it done, hopefully, in a relatively short period of time, \nwithout limiting it to a day or 3 days, or 3 weeks for that matter. It \ncould very well take longer than that. But it will be a fair trial.\n  Then we have other very serious responsibilities that we must deal \nwith. It has been said as long as we are dealing with this issue that \nwe can't deal with any other substantive issue in the Senate. Wrong.\n  We have responsibilities that go forward, and we will do our very \nbest to have a dual track. Now, we may not be having debate and votes \non the floor of the Senate on bills or on changes in the budget \nprocedures around here, but we will begin to prepare. We will have our \ncommittee assignments all completed today. There will be committee \nhearings this week before the Judiciary Committee, before the Armed \nServices Committee, before the Education and Labor Committee--although \nit has a different name here in the Senate, I prefer to call it the \nEducation Committee because it has that very important jurisdiction \nunder its responsibilities.\n  We will begin the process and have hearings and meetings. Depending \non how this process goes forward, and realizing that we have to \nunderstand the Supreme Court has a schedule that it has to comply with, \nwhich might give us some time to do some business, we will do our very \nbest to get prepared for the regular legislative process while we are \ndoing our duty with regard to impeachment.\n  But the goal that I hope we will move to immediately after the \ncompletion of the impeachment process, whenever that may be, is to \ndevelop some constant themes we want to work on during the 106th \nCongress. I think they can be described in words like these: security, \nresponsibility, opportunity, and freedom. Now, those are not \nconflicting goals; they complement and support one another. Security, \nafter all, enables responsibility; responsibility gives purpose to \nfreedom; freedom ensures opportunity; and opportunity fosters security. \nWhen I talk about security, I think about security for my mother, \nsecurity for my son and my daughter and my grandson. I think about \nhealth security, Social Security, national security, security in our \nneighborhoods. So that word encompasses an awful lot.\n  Our task is to advance on all four fronts this year: To enhance \nsecurity, promote responsibility, strengthen freedom, and foster \nopportunity for all. In doing so, we face a tight schedule. We always \ndo, but it is a manageable one if the Senators will help the leadership \ndo our jobs. There are matters that we can consider promptly before our \nlegislative committees even begin reporting major bills that must \ncompete for a place and time on the Senate schedule.\n  One of the first matters we should take up is a clarification of \nSenate rules, to restore this institution's position regarding the \nconsideration of authorizing legislation on appropriation bills. It is \nout of hand. The biggest fight now in all the appropriations bills \noccurs not on the appropriations but on amendments that are legislating \non appropriations bill. I believe we can accomplish that change back to \nthe way\n\n[[Page S10]]\n\nit was in a bipartisan fashion. I certainly hope so.\n  I hope we can do the same thing regarding our budget process, \nalthough I may be erring on the side of optimism in that regard. This \nis priority legislation, I think, that is required to restore public \nconfidence in the budget process. Do any of us feel that the process at \nthe end of the last year was a good one? I don't think so. In the end, \nit is going to require will and determination by Senators and House \nMembers to do their jobs on time and on schedule. There are some \nchanges in the process that will help facilitate that. It will enable \nus to prevent Government shutdowns. It is ridiculous that there is even \nthat possibility. It will control emergency spending. It has reached \nthe point where we have not one super or extra special emergency bill \neach year, now we have to have two. And it makes a requirement that we \ntake a long, hard look at how that is paid for and at current budget \nrules.\n\n  Important as budget reform is, rebuilding America's national security \nis even more pressing. Press reports have indicated that the \nadministration will propose some increases in defense spending. That is \ngood, and the Senate will take a very close look at that in committee \nand in the full Senate. I worry that those proposals are not sufficient \nor maybe the way it would be done is not the best way in trying to \naddress the questions of pay and pensions and readiness for our \nmilitary. But we should give that a very high priority. We have been \nlosing ground in this area. This Congress must stop that erosion of our \nreadiness and the morale of our military if we are going to be able to \npreserve our own national security and protect peace wherever our \ninterests are in the world.\n  Education is going to be a central issue this year. Democrats say it \nis important and it will be a high priority. Republicans say it is a \nhigh priority. This past Congress passed not one, not two, but five \nmajor education bills, and we got very little credit for it. There was \neverything from some additional funds for IDEA to vocational education, \nhigher education, and other things in between.\n  For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. That is important. Since its enactment more than 30 \nyears ago, that legislation has been the channel through which tens of \nbillions of dollars have flown from the taxpayers to Washington and \nback to the school districts again at the local level. In retrospect, \nperhaps that has not been the most productive system that we could \ndevise, to put it mildly. I think we need to look at ways to cut out \nsome of those stops along the way, the distance between the taxpayers, \nparents, and government, and how we improve our schools.\n  We need to find more ways to get more dollars back to the schools and \nespecially back to the classrooms. We need to strengthen local \ndecisionmaking so the parents and teachers--the people most involved \nwith their children--can act in the best interest of those youngsters.\n  We should foster quality teaching and promote family choice in \neducation, especially for poor families whose kids are stuck in dead-\nend schools that are dangerous and drug infested and where they are not \nlearning. We should not, on the other hand, presume to dictate to \nparents and educators what their priorities should be and how they \nshould spend their tax dollars. So, clearly, this is something on which \nwe will spend a lot of time.\n  We must continue to address the question of oppressive taxation. Most \npeople will acknowledge that Americans are paying a heavy burden in \ntaxes now. It affects the way they think and act as a family or how \nthey save or invest. One of the most crushing tax burdens in this \ncountry is the payroll tax; it is a high percentage. That is the one in \neverybody's check at the end of the work week and they say, gee, this \nFICA tax is the one that is nailing me. Congress needs to look at that. \nWe need more tax relief for working families so they can keep more of \ntheir own money. We need to have a tax code that is pro growth, pro \ninvestment, and pro jobs, so that we don't just give people a tax break \nbut we give consideration to how the changes or tax reductions would \nlead to improvement in lives and jobs all across this country.\n  Tax simplification is a continuing need. We need to think about how \nwe can get lower insurance premiums for the taxpayers, whether it is \nfor their automobile insurance or their health insurance. We need to \npromote regulatory reform and relief across the board, but especially \nfor small businesses.\n  Nothing this 106th Congress might do--whether in education, tax \npolicy, or environmental protection--would mean as much to the American \npeople as a long-term solution to the problems of Social Security and \nMedicare. So from the first day of this Congress right up to the last \nday toward the end of the year 2000, it will be my goal to see if we \ncan find a broad, bipartisan agreement in those two crucial areas.\n  The Congress can't do it alone, though. The President has to provide \nleadership. It is not enough to just have conferences and talk about \noptions. What is the solution? What are we going to be able to do to \nresolve the problems on Medicare? Will the Medicare Commission that \nreports back in March have a report we can act on or not? Or will it \ndecay in partisan disagreement? Can we find a way to act in good faith \non Social Security?\n  To show my good faith, I have said that if the President will send us \na proposal he would like for us to consider, I will introduce his bill \nand we will begin hearings the next day in the Senate Finance Committee \nand see if we can go forward. Or if that is not the way it can be done, \nI am willing to look at other ways that we can accomplish that goal. It \nis too important to just set it aside because it is too tough.\n  There are a lot of other issues we will deal with in the regular \norder. For example, bankruptcy reform, liability reform for charities, \ncharitable choice in Federal programs, to end discrimination against \nfaith-based organizations, prohibition against partial-birth abortions, \nas well as child custody protections to safeguard family rights, and \nmodernization of financial services. I have spoken with Senator Gramm \nand encouraged him, as the new chairman of the Banking Committee, which \nhas jurisdiction, to pick up the legislation and see if he can forge an \nagreement that we can move forward on so that we will have broader \nchoices and better service for consumers.\n  In due time, we will deal with all of those and a great many other \nsubjects. During the next few weeks, I realize that the news media will \nbe focused on one thing. My remarks here will be little noted or \nremembered--other than the part on the impeachment proceedings. But the \nrecord must begin to be made now that we have other very important \npriorities that are the people's priorities back in our respective \nStates.\n  This Senate was designed by the Framers of the Constitution to be the \nsteady element in Government, the place where passions are cooled and \njudgments come slowly.\n\n  It serves us well when we take our time and we make sure that the \nprocess is fair and the result is equitable.\n  I expect that to happen in the days ahead. No one can predict the \noutcome of the deliberations on impeachment, but everyone can expect \nthe calm and careful exercise of our duty under the Constitution. That \nwill not conflict with our role as legislators. It will rather confirm \nthat we are more than mere lawmakers. As Members of the Senate, we are \nguardians of the rule of law and defenders of the rights of every \nAmerican. That is our most important role, our most solemn charge, and \nour most enduring honor.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President. I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to take just a moment following \nthe presentation by the majority leader to\n\n[[Page S11]]\n\nsay that he begins this session of Congress with a very substantial \nweight on his shoulders. He is a leader in a Congress that is facing a \nvery unique challenge. I consider the majority leader a friend. I know \nthat these are not easy times for him, and I hope that as we proceed \nwith the important matter of impeachment that all of us in this Chamber \ncan work together with Senator Lott and the Democratic leader, Senator \nDaschle, to see that we do the job that we are required to do by the \nConstitution in a thoughtful, deliberative, and bipartisan way.\n  I know there are some outside these Chambers who are worried about \nthe Senate proceeding too quickly with the impeachment trial. Those who \nhave had an opportunity to read two centuries of history of the U.S. \nSenate know that one of the last worries that one ought to entertain is \nthat the Senate will ever move to quickly, or follow too closely.\n  The U.S. Senate is an extraordinary, deliberative body. The problem \nhas seldom ever, in the history of this country, been that the Senate \nmoves too quickly. Rather, my concern is that we discharge our \nresponsibilities to do our duty and do it in a way that will give the \nAmerican people confidence that the Senate exhibited the dignity they \nwould expect from this institution.\n  The Senator from Mississippi, the majority leader, indicated that \nthere are many other issues that challenge us and that will require our \nattention. He is absolutely correct about that. I, too, hope that we \ncan join together to deal with these issues in a more bipartisan spirit \nin this Congress than we have seen in recent Congresses.\n  I want to mention just a couple of those challenges.\n  The Senator from Mississippi said that the way the last session ended \nwas not a good way to end. He is right about that. It was shameful that \nso much business was left on the table at the end to be considered and \ndealt with by a few people--many of them unelected--behind closed doors \nand then brought to the floor by unanimous consent. That is not a way \nto do the Senate's business. It is not a way to do the business of \nCongress. All of us know that. All of us knew it then, and we ought to \nsee if we can find a way to change the rules to prevent that from \nhappening in the future.\n  With respect to challenges that we face, first the challenges abroad: \nAll of us understand the dilemma that is posed to us and the entire \nworld in what is increasingly a global economy as a result of the \neconomic collapse and significant challenges facing the economies of \nthe Asian countries. All you have to do is ask American farmers what \nthey have experienced as a result of Asian economies being weak and, \ntherefore, purchasing less in farm commodities from our country, and \nyou will understand the direct impact, not just in that sector, but in \nvirtually every sector in this country. We have a stake in how well \nother countries in the world are doing. When the Asian economies \nexperience significant trouble--recession and collapse--it affects our \ncountry and our future. When the Russian economy collapses, it affects \nus. When the Brazilian economy is in trouble, it affects us.\n\n  So these difficulties that are being experienced in many areas of the \nworld have the capacity to affect in a significant way the American \neconomy. And we must work with our Secretary of Treasury, with the \nPresident, and with Members of Congress, to reach out and see that we \ntry to contain the spreading financial problems that exist in other \nparts of the world.\n  The other challenges are pretty obvious as well.\n  When the country of North Korea tests medium-range missiles, when the \ncountry of Iran begins testing medium-range missiles, presumably to \nhoist something aloft and threaten someone down the road, do we need to \nbe concerned about that? You bet. The testing of missiles by North \nKorea and Iran is a very ominous threat to this country and ought to be \nof great concern to us.\n  When India and Pakistan decide to punctuate their poor relationship \nby exploding nuclear weapons virtually under each other's chin, is that \ndestabilizing to the world? You bet it is. Do we need to be concerned \nabout that? Of course.\n  We have about 7,500 nuclear weapons in our arsenal. I expect that in \nRussia and other parts of the world there are 7,500 nuclear weapons. \nAnd if the Russian Duma decides to approve START II at some point in \nthe future, we whittle that number of nuclear weapons down to 5,000. \nThat is still far too many--5,000 nuclear weapons on each side? It \ndoesn't make any sense.\n  So we have a challenge to try to respond to that. We must respond to \nthe issue of the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  When you look at the potential threat to the entire world posed by \nIndia and Pakistan, two adversaries detonating these nuclear weapons \nvirtually in front of each other, and then consider that other \ncountries are trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction, as well as \nthe capability of delivering them on the top of a missile, is that a \nconcern. When countries like Iran and North Korea start testing \nmissiles, is that a challenge to this country? You bet it is. And this \nCongress needs to be concerned about it and work with this President to \ndevelop policies to try to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons \nand the technology for delivering those weapons.\n  Here at home the challenges also are obvious.\n  We are blessed with an economy that is growing and strong. Virtually \nevery indicator of economic health in this country is positive. \nUnemployment is down--way down. Inflation is down, almost nonexistent. \nHome ownership is up. Crime is down. Violent crime is way down.\n  You can take a look at a whole range of statistics to determine what \nis happening in this country. While we have a lot of challenges, you \nhave to conclude that things are better in this country as a result of \neconomic growth and other public policies that have encouraged changes \nin America.\n  That doesn't mean everything is just fine.\n  Among the challenges we have in this country is still to deal with \nthe issues of education and health care, for example.\n  The majority leader mentioned education. We don't run the education \nsystem in this country, and we shouldn't. Elementary and secondary \neducation is largely operated and controlled by local school boards, \nand by State legislatures. Local control of schools has been a hallmark \nin this country, and I don't quarrel with that. I support that. But we \ncan and should in this country develop national goals and aspirations \nof what we want to accomplish in education. Among the things we can do \nwill be to commit ourselves to repair or construct new school buildings \nto replace those that are falling down.\n  At the end of the Second World War, we had folks come back to this \ncountry who fought for our country's liberty and beat back the fascism \nof Hitler. They came back and got an education under the GI bill and \nhad families. They paid taxes to build schools. We had a lot of new \nschools built all over America in the 1950s. Today, many of those \nschools are in disrepair. We need new schools and bigger classrooms. We \nneed to repair schools that are crumbling.\n  I have spoken at length on this floor about going into a school that \neducates largely Indian children--the Cannon Ball Elementary School. At \nthis school, sewer gas comes up into a room used as a classroom at \nleast once or twice a week and the classroom has to be evacuated. 150 \nkids go to school in a building where there are two bathrooms and one \nwater fountain, where you can't connect a computer to the Internet \nbecause the wiring is so old, a building that has largely been \ncondemned.\n  Do we need to do something about that? Is it fair to a third grader \nto go to school in conditions like that? No. We can do something to \nencourage additional school construction and school repair to make \nthese facilities good facilities. We can also do something to encourage \nthe reduction of class size by the hiring of more teachers. We can \nencourage that through public policy here without deciding that we \nshould run the local school systems in this country.\n  But I will tell you, if we improve education nationally through \npublic policies that say education matters, this country will be \nstronger and better because of it. Education must be a priority. Our \nchildren are our future, and\n\n[[Page S12]]\n\nour ability to educate our children to become the best they can be is a \nsignificant investment in the future of America.\n  Health care is another important issue we must address. We had a \ndebate about this in the last session of Congress, but we did not solve \nthe problem. Mr. President, 160 million people are now herded into \nhealth care chutes called managed care organizations. And now too often \na family enrolled in an HMO discovers when a loved one gets sick that \nthe question of what kind of care they are going to get is not \nnecessarily just a function of what the doctor says that care ought to \nbe but also a function of whether an accountant 500 or 1,000 miles away \nin the insurance company office decides they want to allow that kind of \nmedical treatment to be performed.\n  We have talked on the floor of the Senate about the horror stories. I \nam not alleging that these incidents happen with all HMOs, but I am \nalleging that they happen all too often. We need to pass in this \nCongress a Patients' Bill of Rights to say to the American people that \nwhen you go to a doctor, you have the right to go to a doctor of your \nchoice who can meet your medical needs. You have a right to go to an \nemergency room if you need to.\n  I told a story several months ago about a woman who broke her neck \nand was taken to the hospital unconscious. She was told later that her \ncare was not covered because she didn't get prior approval to come to \nthe emergency room. Now, what kind of nut case would make that kind of \njudgment--that someone who is unconscious and has a broken neck needs \nprior approval to get emergency treatment.\n  We need a Patients' Bill of Rights, and this Congress ought to pass \nit. We didn't in the last session, and we need to this session. I hope \nwe can join together on this issue. If there are specific debates about \nthe details, let's work them out. Let's pass a Patients' Bill of Rights \nto respond to these problems.\n  I come from farm country. While this country is doing better, and \nthere are a lot of reasons to say our country is in pretty good shape, \nfamily farmers aren't in good shape. Those who went out and bought a \nChristmas ham probably paid $30 or $35 for a pretty good sized ham. Do \nyou know that at about the same time, there was a farmer who put a hog \nin a pickup truck and hauled that hog to market and sold it. That 200-\npound hog brought that farmer $20. The shopper bought a ham for $35 and \nthe farmer gets $20 for selling a 200-pound hog. Somebody is stealing \nin between. That is strong language, but the fact is that all of the \npacking plants, for beef, sheep, chickens and hogs, are now tightly \ncontrolled by just a few companies. If you are selling a cow, you sell \nit into a market system in which four companies control over 80 percent \nof the cattle slaughtered in this country. The same is true with hogs--\nslightly less but pretty much true.\n  The point is that these family farmers are experiencing collapsed \nprices for hogs, collapsed prices for cattle, collapsed prices for \ngrain. This country will end up without family farmers in its future if \nit doesn't come to grips with a better farm policy that gives family \nfarmers a chance to make a living.\n  Every single institution, every single enterprise that touches what \nfarmers raise is making record profits. Farmers who gas up the tractor \nand tend to the cattle are the ones who are losing their shirts. But \neverybody else is making record profits--railroads are making record \nprofits; the slaughter plants, record profits; the cereal \nmanufacturers, record profits. The farmer gets practically nothing for \nhis grain, and the manufacturer puts it in a plant someplace and puffs \nit up, and then puts it on the grocery store shelf as puffed wheat. The \nfarmer got close to nothing for the wheat and the folks who puff it up \nand put it in the box get rich because they are providing the puff to \nthe consumer.\n\n  Why have we decided in this country that family farming doesn't \nmatter? Because a majority of this Congress in recent years apparently \ndoesn't care whether we have family farmers in our future. I hope that \nchanges, and I hope in the 106th Congress we can go back and revise \nthat and have a farm program that really matters. We need a farm policy \nthat says to family farmers: this country is a better place if we have \na network of family farmers all across America, out there working and \nraising families under those yard lights that we call family farms.\n  You talk about family values. You can't be for family values if you \nare not for family farmers. The history of this country is one of \nnurturing family values on family farms. Those values roll out to our \nbig towns and big cities from our family farms. So that is another of \nthe challenges.\n  Finally, Senator Lott mentioned appropriately the challenge of \ndealing with the entitlements programs. We must in this Congress deal \nwith the long-term financial difficulties facing Social Security and \nMedicare. Is that a tough job? Sure, but we need to do it. The issues \nfacing Social Security and Medicare are born of success. If people \nweren't living longer, we wouldn't have financial strains on these \nprograms.\n  One hundred years ago, in the year 1900, if you were living in the \nUnited States of America, you were expected to live to be about 48 \nyears of age. Now a century later, you are expected to live, on \naverage, about 78 years in the United States. Is that good news? \nAbsolutely.\n  I was at a place a while back where there was a 94-year-old woman. \nShe danced all night at this place where they polka and waltz, and so \non. You can go out and find people living much longer, healthier lives, \ndoing things they never expected to do. Part of it is perhaps a better \nlifestyle, safer workplaces, part of it is better nutrition, part of it \nis the result of breathtaking medical changes. Fifty years ago, someone \nwho had cataracts would be blind. Today they get an operation, and they \ncan see. It used to be if you had bad knees or bad hips, you were in a \nwheelchair. Today you get new knees or new hips. Those who half a \ncentury ago would die of heart disease have heart surgery. You can find \npeople 80 years old who have new knees, new hips, heart surgery and no \ncataracts, and they say, ``We feel like a million bucks.''\n  All of these breathtaking medical advances have helped improve life \nin this country. People are living longer. That provides us with a \nchallenge. With more people living longer, it means we have more strain \non Social Security and the Medicare programs, but, gosh, that challenge \nis born of success. We ought not shrink from that. So we make some \nadjustments here and there, thoughtful adjustments that recognize these \nprograms work and they are good programs, but we can do that. This \nCongress can do that and should.\n  Mr. GREGG assumed the Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. President Clinton has proposed at a meeting I was at with \nthe bipartisan leadership of the Congress, that this is the year in \nwhich we tackle the challenges facing Social Security and Medicare. I \nthink the Presiding Officer was at that meeting. I think there is a \ndetermination by Republicans and Democrats in Congress, by the \nPresident and Congress, that we owe it to the American people to \naddress these entitlement questions, to make the kinds of changes that \nare necessary so that we can give the American people confidence that \nthese programs will be around for a long, long while. But I do want to \nemphasize this challenge is born of success because people are living \nlonger and better lives. I don't want people to come here saying these \nprograms don't work. The Social Security program and the Medicare \nprogram have been remarkably successful. Just before the Medicare \nprogram was developed, over half of the senior citizens in America had \nno health care coverage at all. None. Now, 99 percent of the senior \ncitizens in America are covered with health care. That is a dramatic \ndifference and an improvement in the lives of tens and tens of millions \nof Americans.\n  Mr. President, those are some of the challenges we face. I agree with \nthe majority leader that the sooner we get to them the better. We must \ndischarge our responsibility first on the impeachment issues, but then \nwe must turn to the business of this country and respond to the \nchallenges I have just described.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I make a point of order a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

His father had escaped with the Chei family to Hong Kong \nafter the communists took over the Chinese mainland in 1950. The trials \nfaced by the Chei family as they were uprooted from Peter's birthplace \nparallel the trials faced by many of America's first adopted citizens \nescaping religious persecution. Peter Chei's decision to move to the \nUnited States in 1965 and his decision to become a United States \ncitizen are made all the more meaningful by this stark comparison.\n  Having arrived in this country, Reverend Chei determined to serve God \nand his adopted country through a life of evangelism. His long history \nof ministerial and community service demonstrates his commitment. \nReverend Chei has volunteered as Head Start Policy Council President, \nHead Start Parents Association President, Coordinator for the American \nBible Society, Coordinator for the National Day of Prayer, Coordinator \nfor the International Year of Bible Reading, Coordinator for the 1999 \nYear of the Bible, and as a member of the Crosswalk Teen Center. The \nReverend Peter Chei founded Missouri Head Start Parents' Association, \nSingles and Families Educational Seminar, Christians Together in the \nCity of Nevada, His Hope House, the Christian Artist Series, Hope for \nAmerica, and Missionary to America. He has taken on all of these extra \nresponsibilities while serving faithfully as a minister of music and as \na pastor.\n  I consider it a great blessing to be counted among Reverend Chei's \nfriends and it is my distinct honor to salute this patriot on the \noccasion of his swearing in as a citizen of our great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/06/senate-section/article/S13-4", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13-S14]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HAROLD A. SHAUB: NOVEMBER 28, 1915-NOVEMBER 29, 1998\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, although the late Honorable Harold A. Shaub \nwas not a citizen of my State, I regarded his friendship, and his \ninterest in North Carolina, sufficient to qualify him to be declared an \nhonorary Tar Heel.\n  He was a remarkable gentleman whom I met casually one morning when he \nwas trying to find the office of then Senator Curtis of Nebraska. From \nthat day on, he was a friend for whom I had great admiration. He \nvisited occasionally when he was in Washington, and I enjoyed his \ncompany fairly often in the Senate Dining Room. Occasionally, Mrs. \nShaub and one or more of his and Mrs. Shaub's children joined us.\n  Mr. President, there was not one iota of pretense in Harold Shaub's \npersonality. Yet he was one of America's leading business men, perhaps \nmost notably as president and chief executive officer of the Campbell \nSoup Co.\n  I never asked Harold for a special favor, nor did he of me. There was \none occasion, a number of years ago, when North Carolina was one of the \nStates seeking to acquire a Campbell Soup Co. plant. I had studied the \ndata on each of the States competing against mine for the Campbell \nplant. I was convinced that North Carolina met Campbell Soup's needs \nbetter than did our competitors. So I called Harold, told him of my \ninterest in the proposed plant, and asked if he would object to my \nsending to him the details of why I sincerely believed North Carolina \nshould be chosen.\n  His response was that I should send the information as quickly as \npossible because the first decision deadline was near. I did--that very \nday. Within a week, he was on the telephone. He said, simply: ``I \nsuspect you would be wise to make arrangements for some news about a \nnew corporate citizen coming to North Carolina.''\n  Mr. President, I have at hand an obituary about my friend, Harold \nShaub, published in Pennsylvania. I ask that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n          Harold A. Shaub: November 28, 1915-November 29, 1998\n\n       Harold A. Shaub, 83, former President and Chief Executive \n     Officer of the Campbell Soup Company, died November 29 in \n     Bryn Mawr Hospital of heart failure.\n       Mr. Shaub, a native of Lancaster County, was a resident of \n     the Gladwyne/Bryn Mawr area for the past 30 years. He \n     graduated from Drexel University in 1939 with a Bachelor of \n     Science degree in Commerce.\n       Mr. Shaub's career at the Campbell Soup Company spanned 38 \n     years. He joined the Company in 1942 as Assistant to the \n     General Superintendent of the Camden, New Jersey plant and \n     subsequently held other supervisory positions there and at \n     the Company's Chicago plant. In 1957 he was elected Vice \n     President/General Manager of the Campbell Soup Company Ltd., \n     the Canadian subsidiary headquartered in Toronto, and from \n     1961 to 1966 served as President of the Canadian Company. \n     From 1966 to 1968 he was President of Pepperidge Farm, Inc. \n     in Norwalk, Connecticut.\n       Mr. Shaub returned to the Philadelphia area in 1968 \n     following his transfer to the Campbell Soup Company's \n     headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. He served as Senior Vice \n     President and then Executive Vice President prior to serving \n     as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1972 through \n     1980. He was elected to the Campbell Soup Company Board of \n     Directors in 1970 and served on the Board until 1988.\n       In addition in serving as a Director for the Campbell Soup \n     Company, Mr. Shaub served\n\n[[Page S14]]\n\n     on the Board of Directors of the Exxon Corporation, R.H. Macy \n     & Co., Scott Paper Company, The Federal Reserve Bank in \n     Philadelphia, New Jersey Bell Telephone, Westminster Paper \n     Company, LTD., the Food Processors Institute, and the Grocery \n     Manufacturers of America.

He played a key role \n     in the successful effort that brought the Saratoga for \n     overhaul to the Philadelphia Shipyard.\n       Throughout his lifetime Mr. Shaub was committed to \n     community service. He served on the Drexel University Board \n     of Trustees and was named an Emeritus Trustee. He was a Life \n     Trustee and Distinguished Fellow for the Cornell Institute \n     for Medical Research. His directorships included the United \n     Medical Corporation in Haddonfield, New Jersey, Queenway \n     General Hospital in Toronto; the Citizens Crime Commission in \n     Philadelphia; and Valley Forge Military Academy and Junior \n     College.

He had worked on behalf \n     of many other organizations including the Boy Scouts of \n     America, the United Way, and the Cooper Medical Center.\n       Mr. Shaub was the recipient of many awards and honors. The \n     Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce and Penjerdel Council \n     awarded him the prestigious William Penn Award in 1980 and \n     honored him as one of Fifty Distinguished Pennsylvanians in \n     1979.

Such false and misleading statements were \n     subsequently acknowledged by his attorney in a communication \n     to that judge.\n       (6) On or about January 18 and January 20-21, 1998, William \n     Jefferson Clinton related a false and misleading account of \n     events relevant to a Federal civil rights action\n\n[[Page S15]]\n\n     brought against him to a potential witness in that \n     proceeding, in order to corruptly influence the testimony of \n     that witness.\n       (7) On or about January 21, 23, and 26, 1998, William \n     Jefferson Clinton made false and misleading statements to \n     potential witnesses in a Federal grand jury proceeding in \n     order to corruptly influence the testimony of those \n     witnesses.

CONSIDERATION OF EMERGENCY LEGISLATION.\n\n       (a) Designations.--\n       (1) Guidance.--In the Senate for purposes of making a \n     designation of a provision of legislation as an emergency \n     requirement under section 251(b)(2)(A) or 252(e) of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, \n     the committee report, if any, accompanying such legislation, \n     shall analyze whether a proposed emergency requirement meets \n     all the criteria in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Criteria.--\n       (A) In general.--A proposed expenditure or tax change is an \n     emergency requirement if it is--\n       (i) necessary, essential, or vital (not merely useful or \n     beneficial);\n       (ii) sudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up \n     over time;\n       (iii) an urgent, pressing, and compelling need requiring \n     immediate action;\n       (iv) subject to subparagraph (B), unforeseen, \n     unpredictable, and unanticipated; and\n       (v) not permanent, temporary in nature.\n       (B) Unforeseen.--An emergency that is part of an aggregate \n     level of anticipated emergencies, particularly when normally \n     estimated in advance, is not unforeseen.\n       (3) Justification for failure to meet criteria.--If the \n     proposed emergency requirement does not meet all the criteria \n     set forth in paragraph (2), the committee report accompanying \n     such legislation shall provide a justification of why the \n     requirement is an emergency.\n       (b) Point of Order.--\n       (1) In general.--When the Senate is considering a bill, \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report, upon a \n     point of order being made by a Senator against any provision \n     in that measure designated as an emergency requirement \n     pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) or 252(e) of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and the \n     Presiding Officer sustains that point of order, that \n     provision along with the language making the designation \n     shall be stricken from the measure and may not be offered as \n     an amendment from the floor.\n       (2) Emergency legislation.--When the Senate is considering \n     an emergency supplemental appropriations bill, an amendment \n     thereto, a motion thereto, or a conference report therefrom, \n     upon a point of order being made by a Senator against any \n     provision in that measure that is not designated as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) or \n     252(e) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \n     Act of 1985 and the Presiding Officer sustains that point of \n     order, that provision shall be stricken from the measure and \n     may not be offered as an amendment from the floor.\n       (c) Waiver.--Paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) may \n     be waived in the Senate only by the affirmative vote of \n     three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (d) Appeal.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of this resolution shall \n     be limited to 1 hour of debate, to be equally divided \n     between, and controlled by, the appellant and the manager of \n     the legislation.

Mr. President, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act \nwas passed as part of the omnibus appropriations bill. As reported by \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, and as confirmed in all the \nstatements made when the bill passed the Senate, section 3347 of that \nstatute made clear that so-called vesting and delegation statutes \nallowing the heads of departments to delegate duties to other officials \nin their departments do not constitute statutes providing for the \nfilling of a specific vacant position that the law retains in lieu of \nthe procedures contained in the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. The \nvesting and delegation statutes were cross-referenced to not fall \nwithin the statutes that subparagraph (a)(2) of the bill retained. \nWhile that was the appropriate cross-reference as the bill was \nreported, subsequent language changes made to clarify the issue altered \nthe numbering of the subsections, but the earlier cross-reference was \nretained. As is obvious by reading the statements and the statutory \nlanguage itself, the clear intent was to state that vesting and \ndelegation statutes fall not within subsection (a)(2), which relates to \nrecess appointments, but to subsection (a)(1), statutes that provide \nfor the temporary filling of specific positions. We will make a \ntechnical change to the language next year, as the urgency of the \nlegislation sent this bill directly to the President for his signature \nwithout the chance to make that technical correction. There is no \nquestion that the vesting and delegation statutes do not constitute \nprovisions for the temporary appointment of specific officers, even \nwithout the crossreference, which was designed to be even more \nemphatic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/06/senate-section/article/S33-3", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S33-S34]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF KEITH PUTNAM\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I want to call attention to \na brave and selfless deed by a heroic young man from Hanahan, South \nCarolina. On August 6, 15-year-old Keith Putnam sacrificed his own life \nto save two women\n\n[[Page S34]]\n\nand a small child from a speeding train.\n  When Keith saw Maurica Hovey, her 3-year-old son John, and her friend \nLayonee Phillips stuck in the path of an oncoming train, he did what \nall of us hope we would have the courage to do in such a situation: he \nleapt from his truck and raced to aid those in danger. After saving \nMaurica, John, and Layonee, Keith returned to the abandoned car to make \nsure no one was left inside. At the moment he approached the car, the \nonrushing train slammed into it, sending it careening into Keith and \nfatally wounding him. Thanks to Keith's quick thinking and heroic \naction, all three of the people he saved from the train escaped without \nharm.\n  Mr. President, I have seen many heroic acts in my lifetime, in World \nWar II and in peacetime, but I don't believe I have ever seen a young \nman who has been more respected by his community than Keith Putnam. In \nevery way, he was a model citizen. Just before his death, Keith had \nbeen made an usher at Peace Lutheran Church, which he attended every \nSunday. A great patriot, Keith was dedicated to his country as well as \nhis neighbors. In fact, he planned to attend my alma mater, The \nCitadel, and then serve as a pilot in the Air Force.\n  Perhaps what was most noteworthy about Keith, especially in this day \nand age, was his willingness to help his neighbors and even total \nstrangers without ever thinking of himself or asking for anything in \nreturn. Keith was committed to public service through large and small \nacts, whether helping strangers carry groceries to their cars or saving \nthem from a fatal train collision. Since his death, his community has \nseen an incredible outpouring of emotion, as his neighbors, friends, \nand family express their grief at the loss of such an admirable and \ncaring young man.\n  Today, Mr. President, I would like to add my voice to theirs. It was \nnot my privilege to know Keith Putnam personally, but his heroism and \ngenerosity are an inspiration and an example to us all. I hope the \ntremendous admiration everyone felt for Keith, and the knowledge that \ntheir son's life was exemplary in every way possible, will be of some \ncomfort to Keith's family in their trying time of grief.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/06/senate-section/article/S33-4", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S34]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT DENNIS W.

Sergeant Finch \nwas not only a great family man, police officer, and Michigander, he \nwas a great American. The day of May thirteenth 1998 will forever be a \nday of mourning for the Traverse City community, a tragic day that will \nleave an indelible change on the fabric of life in Traverse City. \nSergeant Finch lost his life in the line of duty, protecting a \ncommunity that he loved. His dedication and pride is a testament to the \nextremely difficult and admirable role that police officers play in \nthis country. Sergeant Finch protected us proudly with the shield of \nthe Traverse City Police Department, and we will be forever thankful.\n  Sergeant Finch lived the life of hero, before becoming a Traverse \nCity Police Officer, Dennis served proudly in the United States Marine \nCorps in Vietnam. Dennis distinguished himself as a soldier, and was a \ndecorated combat veteran. In his thirty years of service to the \nTraverse City Police Department, Sergeant Finch was the Department's \nmost seniored Sergeant. He was a command officer in both the \nInvestigative Services Division and the Patrol Division for twenty-four \nyears.\n  During this difficult time, my thoughts and prayers go out to \nSergeant Finch's family, friends and all police officers who risk their \nlives every day in this country.

Mr. President, since 1983, the United States \nCongress and the German legislature have conducted an annual exchange \nprogram for staff members from both countries. The program gives \nprofessional staff the opportunity to observe and learn about each \nother's political institutions and convey Members' views on issues of \nmutual concern.\n  A staff delegation from the United States Congress will be selected \nto visit Germany May 22 to June 5 of this year. During the two week \nexchange, the delegation will attend meetings with Bundestag Members, \nBundestag party staff members, and representatives of numerous \npolitical, business, academic, and media agencies. Cultural activities \nand a weekend visit in a Bundestag Member's district will complete the \nschedule.\n  A comparable delegation of German staff members will visit the United \nStates for three weeks this summer. They will attend similar meetings \nhere in Washington and visit the districts of Congressional Members.\n  The Congress-Bundestag Exchange is highly regarded in Germany, and is \none of several exchange programs sponsored by public and private \ninstitutions in the United States and Germany to foster better \nunderstanding of the politics and policies of both countries. The \nongoing situation in the Persian Gulf, the expansion of NATO, the \nproposed expansion of the European Union, and the introduction of the \nEuro will make this year's exchange particularly relevant.\n  The U.S. delegation should consist of experienced and accomplished \nHill staff members who can contribute to the success of the exchange on \nboth sides of the Atlantic. The Bundestag sends senior staff \nprofessionals to the United States.\n  Applicants should have a demonstrable interest in events in Europe. \nApplicants need not be working in the field of foreign affairs, \nalthough such a background can be helpful. The composite U.S. \ndelegation should exhibit a range of expertise in issues of mutual \nconcern in Germany and the United States such as, but not limited to, \ntrade, security, the environment, immigration, economic development, \nhealth care, and other social policy issues.\n  In addition, U.S. participants are expected to help plan and \nimplement the program for the Bundestag staff members when they visit \nthe United States. Participants are expected to assist in planning \ntopical meetings in Washington, and are encouraged to host one or two \nBundestag staffers in their Member's district in July, or to arrange \nfor such a visit to another Member's district.\n  Participants are selected by a committee composed of U.S. Information \nAgency personnel and past participants of the exchange.\n  Senators and Representatives who would like a member of their staff \nto apply for participation in this year's program should direct them to \nsubmit a resume and cover letter in which they state why they believe \nthey are qualified and some assurances of their ability to participate \nduring the time stated. Applications may be sent to Connie Veillette in \nCongressman Regula's office, 2309 Rayburn House Building by noon on \nFriday, March 12.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/06/senate-section/article/S34-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S34-S35]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               A TRIBUTE TO GOFFSTOWN POLICE CHIEF MONIER\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nStephen R. Monier, Chief of Police for Goffstown, New Hampshire. \nThroughout Chief Monier's 28 year career with the Goffstown Police \nDepartment, he has continuously demonstrated all that is honorable \nabout law enforcement and public service.\n  His professional and personal life have been characterized by \nexcellence, leadership and service to others. The resume he has \ncompiled is extraordinary. To no one's surprise, he graduated magna cum \nlaude from St. Anselm College. After joining the police department, \nChief Monier rose through its ranks, serving as Patrol Officer, \nDirector of the Juvenile Division, Sergeant and Lieutenant before being \nappointed Chief on July 1, 1984. In addition, he is past President of \nthe New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police and served 9 years on \nthe Council of New Hampshire Police Standards & Training. He is also a \nmember of the New England Association of Chiefs of Police and the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police. In a well-deserved \nhonor, Chief Monier was selected to the 1996 Centennial Summer Olympics \nsecurity team in Atlanta.\n  His service to others goes beyond law enforcement. Even while growing \nup,\n\n[[Page S35]]\n\nthis quality was apparent. At Goffstown High School, for example, he \nserved as President of the Junior Class and President of the National \nHonor Society. This leadership continues to this day. Chief Monier is a \npast President and member of the Goffstown Chapter of Rotary \nInternational and a founding member of Crispin's House, a non-profit \norganization designed to assist at-risk youths and families. He has \nalso been assistant coach for the Goffstown Youth Basketball League. In \nhis spare time, Chief Monier coauthored ``Crime of the Century,'' a \nfascinating account of the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby. Although \nfollowing his example may be difficult to do, it is my hope that \neveryone will see the Chief as a role model.\n  Finally, I consider Steve Monier a true friend and someone whose \nadvice and support I deeply value. I expect that I can continue to call \non his wisdom. I wish him the very best as he moves onto the next \nchallenge in his life.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty transmitted to the Senate on January 6, 1999, by the President \nof the United States: The Hague Convention and Hague Protocol, Treaty \nDocument No. 106-1.\n  I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural \nProperty in the Event of Armed Conflict (the Convention) and, for \naccession, the Hague Protocol, concluded on May 14, 1954, and entered \ninto force on August 7, 1956. Also enclosed for the information of the \nSenate is the report of the Department of State on the Convention and \nthe Hague Protocol.\n  I also wish to take this opportunity to reiterate my support for the \nprompt approval of Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions of \n12 August 1949, concluded at Geneva on June 10, 1977 (Protocol II). \nProtocol II, which deals with noninternational armed conflicts, or \ncivil wars, was transmitted to the Senate for advice and consent to \nratification in 1987 by President Reagan but has not been acted upon.\n\n\n                          the hague convention\n\n  The Convention was signed by the United States on May 14, 1954, the \nsame day it was concluded; however, it has not been submitted to the \nSenate for advice and consent to ratification until now.\n  The Hague Convention, to which more than 80 countries are party, \nelaborates on obligations contained in earlier treaties. It also \nestablishes a regime for special protection of a highly limited \ncategory of cultural property. It provides both for preparations in \npeacetime for safeguarding cultural property against foreseeable \neffects of armed conflicts, and also for respecting such property in \ntime of war or military occupation. In conformity with the customary \npractice of nations, the protection of cultural property is not \nabsolute. If cultural property is used for military purposes, or in the \nevent of imperative military necessity, the protection afforded by the \nConvention is waived, in accordance with the Convention's terms.\n  Further, the primary responsibility for the protection of cultural \nproperty rests with the party controlling that property, to ensure that \nthe property is properly identified and that it is not used for an \nunlawful purpose.\n  The Hague Protocol, which was concluded on the same day as the \nConvention, but is a separate agreement, contains provisions intended \nto prevent the exportation of cultural property from occupied \nterritory. It obligates an occupying power to prevent the exportation \nof cultural property from territory it occupies, requires each party to \ntake into its custody cultural property exported contrary to the \nProtocol, and requires parties to return such cultural property at the \nclose of hostilities. However, as described in the report of the \nSecretary of State, there are concerns about the acceptability of \nSection I of the Hague Protocol. I therefore recommend that at the time \nof accession, the United States exercise its right under Section III of \nthe Hague Protocol to declare that it will not be bound by the \nprovisions of Section I.\n  The United States signed the Convention on May 14, 1954. Since that \ntime, it has been subject to detailed interagency reviews. Based on \nthese reviews, I have concluded that the United States should now \nbecome a party to the Convention and to the Hague Protocol, subject to \nthe understandings and declaration contained in the report of the \nDepartment of State.\n  United States military policy and the conduct of operations are \nentirely consistent with the Convention's provisions. In large measure, \nthe practices required by the Convention to protect cultural property \nwere based upon the practices of U.S. military forces during World War \nII. A number of concerns that resulted in the original decision not to \nsubmit the Convention for advice and consent have not materialized in \nthe decades of experience with the Convention since its entry into \nforce. The minor concerns that remain relate to ambiguities in language \nthat should be addressed through appropriate understandings, as set \nforth in the report of the Department of State.\n  I believe that ratification of the Convention and accession to the \nProtocol will underscore our long commitment, as well as our practice \nin combat, to protect the world's cultural resources.\n  I am also mindful of the international process underway for review of \nthe Convention. By becoming a party, we will be in a stronger position \nto shape any proposed amendments and help ensure that U.S. interests \nare preserved.\n  I recommend, in light of these considerations, that the Senate give \nearly and favorable consideration to the Convention and the Protocol \nand give its advice and consent to ratification and accession, subject \nto the understandings and declaration contained in the report of the \nDepartment of State.\n\n\n                         protocol ii additional\n\n  In his transmittal message dated January 29, 1987, President Reagan \nrequested the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification of \nProtocol II. The Senate, however, did not act on Protocol II. I believe \nthe Senate should not renew its consideration of this important law-of-\nwar agreement.\n  Protocol II expands upon the fundamental humanitarian provisions \ncontained in the 1949 Geneva Conventions\n\n[[Page S36]]\n\nwith respect to internal armed conflicts. Such internal conflicts have \nbeen the source of appalling civilian suffering, particularly over the \nlast several decades. Protocol II is aimed specifically at ameliorating \nthe suffering of victims of such internal conflicts and, in particular, \nis directed at protecting civilians who, as we have witnessed with such \nhorror this very decade, all too often find themselves caught in the \ncrossfire of such conflicts. Indeed, if Protocol II's fundamental rules \nwere observed, many of the worst human tragedies of recent internal \narmed conflicts would have been avoided.\n  Because the United States traditionally has held a leadership \nposition in matters relating to the law of war, our ratification would \nhelp give Protocol II the visibility and respect it deserves and would \nenhance efforts to further ameliorate the suffering of war's victims--\nespecially, in this case, victims of internal armed conflicts.\n  I therefore recommend that the Senate renew its consideration of \nProtocol II Additional and give its advice and consent to ratification, \nsubject to the understandings and reservations that are described fully \nin the report attached to the original January 29, 1987, transmittal \nmessage to the Senate.\n                                                  William J.

For the information of all Senators, the Senate will \nconvene then at 9:45 a.m.\n  The majority leader will be recognized in order to begin a live \nquorum. Following that live quorum at approximately 10 a.m., the Senate \nwill prepare to receive the managers from the House of Representatives \nfor the purpose of exhibiting Articles of Impeachment.\n  In addition, it is expected that at 1 p.m., the Senate will commence \nwith the swearing in of the Chief Justice of the United States and all \nSenators.\n  Mr. President, just one further note, if I might. I know that \nSenators, members of the media and the American people are anxious to \nknow how we plan to proceed. I think I should say at this point I think \nwe had a very productive day. A lot of activities have been going on in \na bipartisan way between Republicans, among themselves, and with the \nDemocrats in the Senate and in the House. There is, in fact, a meeting \nunderway right now with a bipartisan group of the Senate meeting with a \ngroup of managers from the House.\n  We intend to continue to try to narrow the list of questions and come \nforward with a proposal that would provide for an early beginning, an \nappropriate time for briefings to be filed, for a full trial to be \nprovided for, and votes on Articles of Impeachment at the end of the \nprocess. There are a lot of gaps around what I just said, but I think \nthat there is a sincere bipartisan effort and a nonpartisan effort to \ndo it in a way that is fair and that would get us to a conclusion on \nthis matter which has been presented to us or will be presented to us \nby the House of Representatives.\n  We have a duty. We will do our very best to carry it out in a way \nthat the American people will feel is appropriate for the Senate and \nthat is dignified and fair.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I just confirm the observations of \nthe distinguished majority leader. He has been faultless in his effort \nto find agreement on all sides in regard to all questions of which \nthere is yet no list or likely ever to be a final one. But we admire \nhim so and appreciate his efforts and will continue to work with him.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Moynihan for his remarks, for his wisdom, \nfor his leadership, counsel, and legislative acumen he has exhibited \nfor so many years, but also his efforts over this very day to remind us \nof what our responsibilities are and how difficult they will be and how \nthey can be misconstrued. We will do our best to stand together to get \nthis done in an appropriate way. I thank you for your comments.\n  Mr. President, I believe we are about ready to receive the official \nnotification of the managers for the purpose of exhibiting Articles of \nImpeachment. Therefore, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
