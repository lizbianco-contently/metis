Mr. President, yesterday, the President of the United \nStates announced his budget message, which is also the last budget \nmessage of the Clinton administration. When you consider the history of \nthis administration, beginning with deep deficits, and we are now at a \npoint in our history where we have had the longest economic expansion \nin the history of the United States, it is an entirely different budget \nmessage.\n  I still recall when only a few years ago one of our colleagues, the \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Orrin Hatch, came to the \nfloor to say to the assembled Senators that we had reached such a \ndesperate point in American history that we had to amend the \nConstitution of the United States to put in place what was known as the \nbalanced budget amendment, so that Federal courts would have the \nauthority to stop Congress from spending. It was a desperate move, \nsupported by Democrats and Republicans alike. We had so many years of \nred ink and so many deficits that many people thought there was no way \nit was going to get better, short of creating a new constitutional \nforce--the force of the Federal judiciary--to stop the Congress from \nspending and to require the kind of fiscal discipline for which \nAmerican families were asking.\n  What a difference 3 years later. We have debated, over the last year \nor so, what we are going to do with the surplus, not with the deficit. \nWe are no longer walking around in sack cloth and ashes through the \nHalls of Congress saying another torrent of red ink is about to hit us. \nWe are talking about an economy that continues to grow, with employment \ngrowing--unemployment, I think, last year was the lowest in 30 years in \nour Nation. People are buying businesses, building homes, and inflation \nis being held in check. It is a great period in our history for most \nfamilies across the Nation. The President's budget message now says to \nus, since we have turned that corner, since we are no longer talking \nabout deep deficits but, rather, a different era in Government \nspending, as well as our economy, let us look at it in a more positive \nfashion.\n\n  I want to submit for the Record the following:\n  In 1992, the deficit was a record $290 billion. The Congressional \nBudget Office projected that it would grow to $455 billion by this \nyear. Instead of a $455 billion deficit, we have a projected $167 \nbillion surplus--the third surplus in a row. Almost from the moment we \nstarted our debate on the balanced budget amendment, we started \ngenerating surpluses in this Government. Those who said we had to amend \nthe Constitution clearly--if they look back--now understand that it \nwasn't necessary. This represents $622 billion less savings, drained by \nthe Government in 1 year alone. So rather than having a deficit of $455 \nbillion, borrowing from the American people, as well as foreign \nsources, to pay it off, we have the surplus.\n  We also have something that I don't think anyone would have ever \nimagined. We have had the largest paydown of debt in the history of the \nUnited States--$297 billion. In 1998 and 1999, the debt held by the \npublic was reduced by $140 billion. It is projected that the Government \nwill pay down an additional $157 billion in debt held by the public \nthis year.\n  What does that mean? In taxes, each day we collect $1 billion from \nindividuals, families, and businesses. That billion dollars is \ncollected not to provide for any new educational opportunities or \nhealth care but to pay interest on the debt of the Government. About \nhalf of that is the publicly owned debt. Think of it--$1 billion in \ntaxes is collected every day to pay interest on old debt. So as we pay \ndown this debt, which we are currently doing, we are reducing the need \nfor this money to be collected from families and businesses to pay down \ninterest. This will bring the total debt paydown to $297 billion. It is \nthe largest 3-year debt paydown in American history.\n  In contrast, under the two previous Presidents, the debt held by the \npublic quadrupled--400 percent and more. Under this President, we are \nseeing the debt coming down. And we are seeing the smallest Government \nin over three decades. Government spending has declined from 22.2 \npercent of the economy in 1992 to 18.7 percent of the economy in 1999--\nthe lowest share in 33 years.\n  If you take any rational measurement and look at the size of our \neconomy and the percentage we spend on the Government, it has come down \ndramatically under the Clinton administration. To a great extent, that \naccounts for the savings about which we are talking. At the same time, \nthe Government has made important investments, including nearly \ndoubling investments in education and training.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Before the Senator moves on to the investment part, I \nthink the points the Senator from Illinois is making are astounding. To \nme, particularly our friends in the business community, and all of the \nAmerican people, ought to look at what the Senator from Illinois has \nsaid--deficits, biggest paydown ever--the usual criteria that \nconservatives use for how big and encroaching Government is, smaller \nthan it has been in three decades, smaller under Bill Clinton than \nunder Ronald Reagan.\n  To reiterate, because the facts are astounding, Government spending \nas a share of the economy went from 21.6 percent in 1980 to 22.2 \npercent in 1992. Under President Clinton, it has gone from 22.2 percent \nto 18.7 percent, which is lower than it has been under any year in 30 \nyears and under Ronald Reagan. Taxes and the number of jobs in the \nFederal Government are lower than anytime since 1966.\n\n  If you went to the business leaders and asked them what the Senator \nfrom Illinois is talking about, they would say no. The message sent to \nthe business community in the budget of this last year of the Clinton \nPresidency is that the fiscally responsible party is the Democrats; we \nbelieve in investment. I know what the Senator is talking about. But we \nalso believe in tightening the belt of Government. No one has done a \nbetter job of that than the President between 1993 and the present.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding. I just wanted to underscore that \npoint.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from New York.\n  Of course, we have our images--the Republican image and the \nDemocratic image. We try to paint each other's image. In this \nsituation, though, the Senator from New York makes the point: Just look \nat the facts. Don't look at the rhetoric or listen to the rhetoric. \nDon't look at all the things that are said in political campaigns but \nlook at the facts. The facts show we are bringing down the debt at a \nfaster rate than at anytime in our history.\n  I think more Americans--and particularly business people--are \ninterested in seeing the debt of this Nation reduced than some \ngrandiose plan for a tax cut that benefits the wealthiest people in \nthis country. They would rather see us take the fiscally responsible, \ndisciplined approach of bringing down their debt because they know that \nreduces the burden on our children.\n  Let me speak for a second about the tax burden for typical families \nin America. That is another thing that is often said. Of course, taxes \nare out of hand. But listen to this. At the same time all of these good \nthings are happening to our fiscal house, the typical American family \nwill shoulder the lowest Federal tax burden since 1978. It is amazing \nto them that their tax revenues are increasing because, frankly, people \nare making more money. You see it all the time for the middle-income \nand lower-income families--the lowest tax burden in over 20 years. That \nis something that is important to maintain.\n  I think it is responsible for the President to come forward and say: \nif we are\n\n[[Page S459]]\n\ngoing to have tax cuts, let us target them to these middle- and lower-\nincome families. Let's look at things such as a long-term care tax \ncredit because the largest growing segment of our population in America \nis those over the age of 85. Roughly half of them will need some \nspecialized medical assistance for problems they are going to face. \nTheir children and grandchildren need help in paying for that. The \nPresident's long-term care tax credit is a step in that direction.\n  I would like to ask my colleague from New York if he would yield. He \nhas a proposal embodied in the President's budget that tries to help \nfamilies pay for college education expenses, another one of the \nPresident's targeted tax cuts.\n  Would the Senator from New York be willing to explain that?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for asking me. Yes.\n  What we are trying to do overall, as the Senator from Illinois has \nstated in his proposal the President is trying to do and we are \nsupporting, is not a huge across-the-board tax cut, which generally \nbenefits the wealthiest people, the people who need it the least, but, \nrather, targeted tax cuts for the middle class.\n  The Senator has correctly pointed out, for instance, long-term care. \nMy parents are 76 and 71 years of age. Thank God--knock on wood--they \nare in decent health. But they were debating the other week whether to \npay a massive amount of money down now, which is hard for them to \nafford, so they will get long-term care if, God forbid, they become ill \nin later life.\n  The proposal I have been championing--I am delighted and grateful \nthat the President has put it in his proposal--another burden that \nmiddle-class families have is waking up at 2 a.m. in the morning \nworrying about young families who have kids who are about to go to a \nclinic.\n  We all know that college is a necessity these days if you want your \nchildren and grandchildren to have a better life. Yet it is so \nexpensive. Tuition has gone up more than any other portion of the \nfamily budget--over 250 percent since 1980. Even for a family that is \nmaking $50,000 or $60,000 a year, people are often neglected by the \nGovernment, and neglected by the kind of grandiose tax plans we have \nseen from the other side. College tuition bills bring shivers down \ntheir spine.\n  What we are saying, at the very least, is that Uncle Sam ought not \ntake his cut. If you are going to pay for tuition, which is good for \nyour children but also good for America--you ought to be allowed to \ndeduct that, or take a tax cut, whichever you prefer. This for the \nfirst time brings relief to middle-class families who really do not \nneed the Government day to day but who are worried about the big \nfinancial nugget such as long-term care and such as paying for college \ntuition. Our proposal would benefit them in ways they have never seen.\n  This is again a theme of the budget--not a broad, across-the-board \ntax cut that will benefit the top 5 percent, at most, and give a few \ncrumbs to the struggling middle class but, rather, target that part of \nthe middle class. There is no better target than college tuition.\n  I thank the Senator for asking me to extrapolate on that point.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from New York, because I think when \nwe talk about tax cuts, most Americans will, of course, applaud the \nidea of tax cuts, but they want to have responsible, targeted tax cuts \nto address specific problems, as the Senator from New York addressed \nwith his suggestion about deducting college education expenses and the \nlong-term care concerns of virtually every family across America.\n  We are also talking about increasing the earned-income tax credit \nunder the President's budget. What is that all about? If you are a \nworking person in a low-income situation with a family, we want to give \nyou a helping hand. We want to reward work. We want to strengthen \nfamilies. That is what the earned-income tax credit is about.\n  Let me mention two or three other points, and then I will yield the \nfloor to my colleague from Washington, who is also here to speak on the \nPresident's budget.\n  The benefits of fiscal discipline for our economy have been enormous. \nThis budget continues the idea of fiscal discipline leading to a \nstronger economy with targeted investments and the things Americans \nhold dear--targeted tax cuts to help families in difficult \ncircumstances.\n  Interest rates are lower than they would have been otherwise because \nwe have reduced the debt of this Nation, helping to fuel 7 consecutive \nyears of double-digit investment growth for the first time in our \nNation's history.\n  When I first came to Congress under President Reagan in 1982 and \n1983, virtually every problem in America was blamed on Jimmy Carter. It \nwas said that the Carter administration had left such a terrible legacy \nthat America was just deep in the mire and would never be able to get \nout. I thought that was a reasonable thing to say for a while. But the \nRepublicans continued to say it year after year. Pretty soon we were 5 \nor 6 years into the Reagan administration, and they were still blaming \nJimmy Carter. I wonder what the Republican Party will say now about the \nrecord under the Clinton administration.\n  This President can't take credit, nor does he try, for all of the \neconomic goodness in this country. But certainly his leadership has \nprovided a role, with the Congress, with the Federal Reserve, and \nbrought us to this position in our history.\n  We have seen this dramatic increase in our Nation's economic growth \nof a 4.7 annual growth rate from 1981 to 1992, and now a 12.1 percent \nreal annual increase in investment in business equipment and software \nsince 1993. Unemployment is the lowest in a generation--4.0 percent. We \nare also seeing the longest economic expansion in our Nation's history.\n  The bottom line is this. We believe the President's budget--the one \nhe comes forward with now, this positive message of continued economic \ngrowth--says keep the fiscal discipline for a strong economy and make \nstrategic investments, not in big government but smart government.\n  Take a look at the President's budget over a 10-year period of time. \nYou will find that he is slightly below the funding for current \nservices. That means, if you apply the rate of inflation for every \nsingle year to last year's budget, just keeping up with inflation at \nthe end of 10 years, the President's proposal for defense and \nnondefense spending is less than the increase for the rate of \ninflation. He is asking for not big government but smart government \ninvestments in education, health care--things families hold dear--and \nattractive, targeted tax cuts that American families applaud from \nIllinois and across the Nation.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I didn't have the opportunity to hear the initial \ncomments of the Senator, but I appreciate very much his calling \nattention to many of these issues. What an appropriate time to do it as \nwe consider the budget. The budget was just released yesterday.\n  Did the Senator from Illinois make comment that we actually have a \nlower percentage of Government spending as a percentage of GDP than at \nany time in the Reagan administration or, for that matter, any time in \nmodern days? Did the Senator state that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is exactly right. The Senator from South Dakota, the \nminority leader, has made the point. I think it is one that bears \nrepeating. Those who argue that we are ``growing'' the Government at \nthe expense of family needs across America just don't have the facts \nstraight.\n  Our gross domestic product, the sum total of goods and services in \nthis country, continues to show a decline in the percentage spent on \nGovernment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Did the Senator from Illinois also make the point \nearlier that we actually don't go into the non-Social Security surplus \nwith this budget, that we keep approximate current services, but we \ndedicate many of these new investments to areas that directly affect \nworking families? Did the Senator make that comment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senate minority leader is correct. I think it is a \nsharp contrast to some of the rhetoric we hear on the Presidential \ncampaign trail from the Republican candidates. Some have suggested \nagain this theory of massive tax cuts that go way beyond our ability to \npay without raiding the\n\n[[Page S460]]\n\nSocial Security trust fund. I think that has become an accepted premise \nfor all budgets on Capitol Hill, Republican and Democrat alike: We are \ngoing to say the Social Security trust fund is not going to be raided; \nwe will set it aside. We hear candidates on the campaign trail calling \nfor tax cuts that require raiding the Social Security trust fund.\n  The President does not. He says we will hold to that basic principle. \nI think in so doing, he is standing for principles Americans believe \nin: Protect Social Security and make certain we bring down the debt \nincurred by Social Security as a way of forcing fiscal discipline in \nthe process.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate the answer from the Senator from Illinois.\n  The debt, under this budget, would be completely retired by the year \n2013; Medicare solvency would be extended to the year 2025; Social \nSecurity solvency would be extended through the year 2050; we broaden \nhealth care coverage; all of these plus maintain the kind of commitment \nwe have begun to make in areas such as investments in education and in \nincreased law enforcement activity that have made a real difference in \nthis country.\n  Did the Senator from Illinois talk about those things as well?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from South Dakota has been on Capitol Hill a \nfew years longer than I have. I cannot recall a budget such as this \nbudget, one that is so positive, that looks to the future with such \noptimism, a budget based on reality and on fiscal discipline.\n  Many politicians on Capitol Hill throw charges around about \nirresponsible people, favoring increased taxes, big government spending \nand new programs. This budget says to America, we can continue this \neconomic expansion if we are careful, if we make sure we bring down \nthis debt and do it in a responsible way, with a targeted investment, \nso America can grow, so our families are healthy, so our children are \neducated.\n  I believe the Senator from South Dakota has made that point again. I \nhope during the course of this debate on the budget our friends across \nthe aisle will be as honest with this side as we will be with their \nside. We should accept the premise that we are not going to raid Social \nSecurity, that we are going to reduce the publicly held debt of this \nNation to zero by 2015 while making sure Social Security and Medicare \nare strong for years to come.\n  Often our friends on the Republican side of the aisle do not want to \nmention the word ``Medicare.'' Yet for tens of millions of Americans, \nMedicare is crucial. We need to make it part of this debate as well.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate very much the leadership of the Senator \nfrom Illinois in bringing Members to the floor for a colloquy of this \nimport as we consider the extraordinary implications of this budget.\n  I was disappointed this morning to read in one of the newspapers some \nof our Republican colleagues have already pronounced this budget dead \non arrival. What is there not to like about this budget? This is a \nbudget that protects the Social Security surplus, a budget that ensures \nwe protect the non-Social Security surplus for other commitments we may \nwant to make in tax cuts or in dedicated investments, a budget that \nensures the solvency of the Social Security trust fund through the year \n2050 and Medicare through 2025, a budget that understands, as the \nSenator from Illinois said, there is a prudent middle-center approach \nthat recognizes the importance of ensuring the tremendous strides we \nhave made in reining in Government and doing what we must to make the \nefficiency of the Government our task. All this is in this budget, and \nwe are told it is dead on arrival.\n  I am somewhat stunned and disappointed that some of our colleagues, \nwho I am sure have not thought through the implications of their \nstatement, would comment without a more careful consideration of the \nextraordinary impact that this budget could have if we pursued it this \nyear.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I close by saying the old cliche, ``If it ain't broke, \ndon't fix it,'' applies to this situation. Our economy isn't broken; it \nis strong. This budget will continue our economic growth as a nation. \nIn this budget I can say to my children and grandchildren: We are doing \nthe right thing. We are reducing the debt of the Nation so that your \nburden is reduced as well. We are providing for Social Security so that \nthis Senator and many others, when it comes time for retirement, will \nhave Social Security to turn to. A strong Medicare will be there as \nwell. We are going to invest in our future in terms of education, \nhealth care, the things Americans value, and provide tax cuts targeted \nfor middle- and low-income families to deal with long-term care \nexpenses as well as college education expenses and the other burdens \nthey face.\n  I challenge my friends on the other side of the aisle, in the true \nspirit of this deliberative body, to come forward with a better budget. \nLet's debate it on the floor. I am prepared to say at this moment that \nthe principles behind the President's budget are principles I endorse. \nThey are principles I think most of the American families endorse.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from South Dakota a \nquestion. In his questions to the Senator from Illinois, he has pointed \nout the core of this budget is balance. It is a balanced budget in the \ntraditional sense that we are not spending more than we bring in. In \nfact, we are doing the opposite, by paying down the debt. However, it \nis also balanced in terms of the needs of the American people.\n  The No. 1 priority we have is to save Social Security by buying down \nthe debt; second, target tax cuts for middle-class people who need \nhelp. They don't need help day to day. People are doing fine making \n$40,000, $50,000, or $60,000 a year, but they do need help with the big \nfinancial notes such as college tuition costs and long-term care.\n  Finally, spend in a careful way in areas where we have to, such as \neducation, where everyone knows we have to do better. I know the \nSenator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, has been a leader on this issue. \nI am sure we will hear from her.\n  I ask the Senator from South Dakota, our minority leader, in his \nyears of experience, has he seen a budget as balanced as this, that \ncares for the American people in a thoughtful, rational way, that is \nbuilt on a platform of prudent Government responsibility?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. In answer to the Senator from New York, I have to say \nno. What a contrast from the 1980s when we made the huge cuts in taxes \nand then ran up the huge trillions of dollars in a deficit we are still \ntrying to pay off today. What a remarkable contrast this is. This \nrecognizes the importance of fiscal responsibility. First and foremost, \nit says we have made some tremendous strides in our budgetary and \nfiscal policy in the last 7 years. This will build on it.\n  It is no accident today that we are seeing the economic achievement \nin this country with the fiscal and monetary policy. This says we want \nto build on that, we want to continue in this coming decade what we \nhave pursued in the last decade: We have the lowest number of Federal \nemployees since 1962, with the lowest percentage of spending for GDP \nsince 1967. We recognize we can do a lot more with a lot less. We \nrecognize we can still target tax cuts to the middle class. We \nrecognize the importance of education by providing the largest single \nHead Start expansion in history in this budget.\n  How remarkable it is in this budget we are able to keep our current \nservices at below the cost of inflation in the coming year and still \nprovide the largest Head Start expansion in history or deal with child \ncare by providing low-income families with more affordable child care \nthan they ever had in any other budget.\n\n  You can look all the way down the list of opportunities this budget \npresents: Helping working families with greater EITC, helping working \nfamilies with greater opportunities for college through deductibility, \nhelping working families by providing safer communities. This is a \nbudget of which we can be proud. It builds on what we have already \ndone. Are there going to be naysayers? Of course. There always are. We \nhave overcome them for 7 years. We will have to do it again.\n  But it is here. I ask my colleagues to look at it. My colleague from \nNew York asked exactly the right question:\n\n[[Page S461]]\n\n Is this a balanced budget? By any definition of that word, this is a \nbalanced budget.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from South Dakota and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wonder if my leader, Senator Daschle, will engage in \njust a bit more of a colloquy at this point?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have been on budget committees for years, 6 years in \nthe House and now, since I came to the Senate, it is a total of 13 \nyears. This is a remarkable moment in history, as my friend has pointed \nout. I wanted to talk to him about why we are where we are.\n  It has been very difficult for quite a while, back to the days of the \nburgeoning deficits that started under President Reagan and escalated \nunder President Bush and only were brought under control with the \nClinton-Gore team. Finally, we now can do something for the American \npeople, do something they need. Now we can do something they need in \neducation. We talked about Senator Murray's push to reduce class size. \nWe see in this budget the ability to do that. We see in this budget $1 \nbillion for afterschool care, for which we have struggled mightily, \nwhich means millions of kids are going to have that. We see the \ntargeted tax breaks.\n  So my question to my friend is, we are at this point and we are at \nthis point for a reason. It was hard to get here. Fiscal responsibility \ndoes bring rewards. We tell that to our children: Save for the time you \nneed to spend; be careful with your resources. We have done that. I \nwonder if my friend can recall the key vote, back in 1993, when, \nwithout one Republican vote, we were able to get through a budget which \nhas led to these kinds of surpluses and the surpluses, in turn, are \ngiving us the ability to pay down the debt, save Social Security, save \nMedicare, and make these targeted tax cuts and investments? Could he \nrecall for us what it was like to get that through?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator from \nCalifornia, under the previous order she has a minute and a half \nremaining.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask the colloquy be taken off my leader \ntime, if I could.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am done with my remarks. I want to get my friend to \nevoke for us how hard it was to get to this particular point in which \nwe find ourselves.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It was so hard that there are some colleagues who are no \nlonger here because they paid the price. Before we could see the \nresults, of course, there were some across the country who made a \njudgment about the prudence of their very difficult decisions in 1993 \nand chose not to send them back to Washington. They paid the ultimate \npolitical price so we could enjoy the fiscal glory we are enjoying \ntoday.\n  I can recall so vividly talking to some of my colleagues who, up \nuntil the very last moment, weighed whether this was the right thing to \ndo. Only in the last few moments they made the decision to take the \nchance. But this was in the face of tremendous opposition, vocal \nopposition from the other side, projecting recessions and unemployment \nand extraordinary fiscal repercussions that we would feel for perhaps \nthe rest of our professional lives. There were warnings, extraordinary \nin their scope and depth and visceral disgust, for what we were \nattempting to do.\n  It was an overpowering moment, to see the Vice President cast that \ntie-breaking vote to give us the opportunity to put this budget on the \nfiscal path, a moment that we now look back on with great pride. What \nremarkable opportunities it presented. Twenty million new jobs--how do \nyou put a value on that? We have an economy that has taken the stock \nmarket to heights we never dreamed. We have more homeowners than at any \ntime in our history; two out of every three people have their own homes \ntoday, in large measure because of our fiscal responsibility and the \nincredible success we have enjoyed. I would say these did not come \neasy.\n  Maybe the fight this year will not be in any way near the proportions \nor depth of feeling as when it was fought out on the floor of the \nSenate back in 1993. But it has the same repercussions. How fragile \nthis all is. How easy it would be to go back and cast our votes for a \nhuge tax cut that would destroy all of this in one fell swoop. It could \nhappen again. If we don't understand the repercussions of a tax cut by \nnow, it could happen again.\n  I urge my colleagues to read this budget, to think carefully about \nwhat it is we have been able to do and how we have been able to do it, \nand make absolutely certain, before we depart from a blueprint that I \nthink demonstrates remarkable balance, that we think long and hard \nabout alternatives.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the question proposed by the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 10:30 \na.m. shall be in the control of the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/08/senate-section/article/S461-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S461-S462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to comment a \nlittle. I suppose I might have a different view than what we heard in \nthe last 35 minutes, about what a wonderful budget we have and that we \ncan now return to the era of big government. Not everyone is happy \nabout that, as we might have heard over the last few minutes.\n  As we look realistically at these things, we have to look at a time \nthat has been prosperous. It started in 1991, in fact. We moved \nforward. We have a surplus projected, largely because of the strong \neconomy, of course. Also, it is a result, frankly, of a majority in \nthis Congress that, since 1994, has held down spending. That is a \nlittle difficult for my friends to accept, of course, but we have now \nan opportunity to take a look at a relatively prosperous time. \nCertainly, we want to continue that. We want to take a look at the \nthings that ought to be done for the people of the United States, using \ntheir tax money. We ought to take a look at how we strengthen education \nand return the opportunities to make the decisions about education to \nthe local level rather than doing what the President wants to do, and \nthat is to decide in Washington what each school district ought to \nhave.\n  We have quite a different philosophy on how we approach this, and \nthat is reasonable. That is why we are here, to represent different \nviews. The things we heard this morning would all represent the idea of \nmore Government, more Government spending, more decisions made in \nWashington. That is a legitimate point of view. It is a point of view \nof many in the minority. It is not the point of view of most of us in \nthe majority. So that is what we will be up to, over the next several \nmonths and, indeed, this year: deciding as best we can how to come \ntogether on these decisions.\n  It was not long ago, you will recall, when President Clinton \nsuggested in his State of the Union Address that the era of big \ngovernment was over. That seems now not to be the issue at all. In \nfact, apparently the era of big government has returned. If this budget \nis put into place, that is exactly what we will see. Many think that is \nthe greatest way to go. I think that is legitimate. So that is what the \ndebates will be about.\n  We have before us suggestions of substantial amounts of surplus. This \nis the first time in 25 years the budget has been balanced. That is \nlargely because of some controls on spending. We have been increasing \nspending over the last couple of years, I think amply, but still in the \nlevel of about 3 percent. Prior to that time, in the early 1980s and \nthe early 1990s, we were expanding as high as 12 percent. That has been \nreduced some, and that is part of it. Certainly the President's tax \nincrease, back in 1994-1995, had some effect.\n  Also, the tax reduction brought on by the Republicans helped \nstimulate the economy. We will have a lot of basic things about which \nto talk.\n  This is a huge budget, $1.8 trillion. What is that, 1,800 billion \ndollars? We will have to talk about each of the areas in which that \nspending will take place.\n  Basically, there are some philosophical things. If we think about\n\n[[Page S462]]\n\nwhere we are going with our Government and the decisions we will be \nmaking in elections--that is what politics is about, to set the \ndirection of Government, and we will be doing that.\n  We start with some basic things. We start with putting priorities on \nthe role of the Federal Government and then funding those priorities. \nAgain, not everyone will agree, but that needs to be done, it seems to \nme. There is no end to the way we can spend money. There are many \nprograms on which we can spend it. I believe we can start by saying to \nourselves: What are the legitimate functions of the Federal Government? \nWhat should the taxpayers' money be used for, and what are the \npriorities?\n  When we come to some agreement on that and, in fact, have begun to \nfund those priorities adequately--I just came from a breakfast with the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps. Having been in the Marine Corps, I was \nhappy to be there. The defense of this country is one of the real \npriorities, and certainly we need to fund the military adequately. We \nneed to fund education. We need to fund health care. There are a number \nof things, perhaps, at which we ought to take a long look.\n  The President has proposed 43, I believe--in the neighborhood of 40--\nnew programs. There is a surplus, he says, so let's spend the money. \nFine, but let's take a look at the priorities and see, with respect to \nlocal governments, if this is where it ought to be done.\n  Social Security: I do not think there is anyone who does not agree \nthat Social Security is an issue that is a high priority. As I said \nyesterday, these young people who are starting to pay into that program \nwill pay the largest percentage of their income for a longer time than \nthey will pay in any other tax. Are they going to have benefits at the \nend of 40 or 50 years? The answer should be, yes, they will. To do \nthat, we have to make some changes.\n  There are no proposals in this budget to make any significant changes \nin Social Security, other than to take something out of the general \nfund, which is not a long-range proposal. We have some ideas how we can \ndo that.\n  The other thing we have to recognize, even though certainly it is a \nstep in the right direction, is the idea of reducing the deficit with \nSocial Security funds. We have to take a long look at that. It is a \ngood idea, and we should put that Social Security money there as \nopposed to spending it in the general budget, but the fact is that we \nare replacing publicly held debt with some other debt that has to be \nrepaid by the taxpayers when that Social Security is drawn out. It is \nless expensive as well, so it is a good idea, and it does get it out of \nthe grasp of the Congress.\n  What we ought to be doing, if we are serious about the debt, is \ninstead of spending more, we ought to be saying: Let's take a certain \namount of that money out of the operating funds, decide over a period \nof time we are going to pay off this debt, and do it as one does with a \nhome mortgage--we are going to pay so much every year for 15 years; not \nSocial Security money, but regular operating money.\n\n  That Social Security money also needs to be taken out of our grasp, \nand we are hoping we can do that by having individual accounts where \nSocial Security money belongs to the older person who paid into it, \nwhere those dollars, as a way of ensuring there will be benefits, can \nbe invested in equities or bonds and will produce a higher return. It \nwill also belong to the person. If they are unfortunate enough not to \nlive to get all the benefits, it will go into their estate.\n  These are the things we ought to be talking about, not spending $400 \nbillion on new programs, not going through a State of the Union Message \nin which there is $4 billion a minute proposed. That is, I believe, a \nreckless budget, and I do not think that budget is going to move in \nthis Congress without a considerable amount of change.\n  There are, hopefully, some things on which we want to agree with the \nPresident. He wants to talk about strengthening the military. We ought \nto do that. We ought to do something to encourage recruiting, to \nencourage retention, and to provide what is necessary to carry out the \nmissions of the military. We certainly should do that.\n  We want to do some more things for schools based on the idea that it \nbe given to the districts, that they can make the decisions as to how \nthat is done, so we can strengthen education.\n  We ought to be doing something about Medicare prescriptions. We have \na program that can be done that keeps it in the private sector \ngenerally and allows those who have supplemental programs to continue \nto have them, perhaps supplement them with a tax reduction but not to \ndo an overall health program, as the President tried before. That is \nnot what we want to do.\n  It is interesting that, of course, we have this great surge of \nenthusiasm over the idea of spending all the money we possibly can, but \nwe ought to be thinking about taking a minimum amount of money from the \ntaxpayers of this country to run the Government. It has to be paid. \nEverybody understands that. But when we do have things like surpluses \nover time--certainly we do not want to be reckless--but to call every \ntax reduction reckless is distressing. That money belongs to the people \nwho paid into it.\n  If we do not have something to limit these kinds of surpluses, the \nvery thing will happen the President is talking about now, and that is, \nwe will find a way to spend it. What we are looking for is a way to \nadequately finance the Government, to deal with those things that are \nhigh priorities for America, to do something about the national debt, \nto secure Social Security, and then return this money to where it came \nfrom so that it is not here, so it has an opportunity to be in the \ncommunities, to be in the towns, to be in the States, and to strengthen \nthis economy. That is what keeps the economy going is people having \nmoney to invest and create jobs and these are the directions most \nimportant to us.\n  I wanted to let everyone know there are certainly more directions we \nwill take. There are different ideas, all legitimate, as to where we \nshould go. I hope as we proceed, we have an idea of where we want to \nend up.\n  I was reading ``Alice in Wonderland'' the other night. Remember when \nAlice fell down and she did not quite know where she was going. She ran \ninto various people. She talked to the rabbit who did not have any \nideas, except to promote himself, and the mushroom, who was very \nunpleasant, and the queen who was going to cut off everybody's head. \nFinally, she came to a juncture in the road, and there was the Cheshire \nCat sitting in a tree. She said: Mr. Cat, what road should I take?\n  He said: Where do you want to go?\n  Alice said: I don't know.\n  The cat said: It doesn't make any difference then, you take whatever \nroad you choose.\n  We need to know where we want to be when we look at this budget, what \nit has to do with principles of government, the principles of smaller \ngovernment, the principles of adequate government, and then try to \navoid the idea that there are some bucks out there. So let's try to \nfind a way to spend them.\n  I suspect that is what we will hear a great deal about in this \nsession. Unfortunately, I believe we will hear more about issues that \ncan be used politically than we will about trying to solve problems. \nThere are some we have identified and with which we agree. We need to \ncome together and find some solutions to those particular issues. The \ncountry will be much better off.\n  I thank the Chair for the time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, momentarily I will ask consent for the \nSenate to go to S. 1287, the nuclear waste bill. I know there have been \nnegotiations underway in an effort to reach a comprehensive agreement \non a manager's amendment to the nuclear waste bill. I thank Senator \nMurkowski for the work\n\n[[Page S463]]\n\nhe has put into this important legislation now going back at least 2 \nyears.\n  We have had a good amount of time spent on this legislation on the \nfloor of the Senate, having passed it once before. A lot of work has \ngone into it this year. I believe we are within the realm of being able \nto get an agreement which would allow this legislation to move forward \nand be completed in a very fair way this week.\n  I also extend my appreciation to the Democratic whip, Senator Reid, \nfor his diligence and for his work. He has always made an extra effort \nto make sure we are communicating and there are not any surprises or \ndilatory actions taken as we try to come to an agreement that is \nacceptable to the largest number of people. Senator Bryan of Nevada is \nhere. This is very important to these two Senators and to their State. \nI understand that and I have always tried to be sensitive, \nunderstanding their need to offer amendments or to make statements, and \nto be very careful as we consider this legislation. I thank them.\n  I understand negotiations have been underway between Senator \nMurkowski in discussions with Senator Bingaman and others, but I do \nthink we need to go forward. This is important legislation. I believe \nwe are very close to getting an agreement that is going to be \nacceptable to a large number of Senators. We do need to have either \nthis agreement worked out and understood so we can move forward without \na cloture vote or go ahead and go to cloture because we have to set up \na process that allows this to be considered, hopefully favorably, and \ncompleted this week. We have been working on it a long time and now is \nthe time to begin to close the deliberations and pass this legislation.\n\n  I understand Senator Reid has been attending a hearing and is on his \nway so we can proceed with this action. I do not wish to proceed \nwithout his presence because I know if any procedural action or any \nagreement is worked out, he wants to be here and be a part of what is \ndone. I do say, though, I do have a commitment on the House side I am \ngoing to have to attend. I was supposed to speak at 11 o'clock, so I do \nneed to go to the House to carry out my commitment as soon as possible. \nI will withhold any formal request at this time, but by making this \ncomment now I hope maybe we can move expeditiously to call up this bill \nand to filing cloture.\n  I have one final comment. I say again, as I have said several times \nin the Senate last year and the year before and again this year, this \nis one of the most important environmental bills we will have in this \nCongress. Billions of dollars have been spent on this issue, and an \ninordinate amount of time in the Senate, trying to find a way to get it \ndone. If we can come to an agreement and get this legislation \ncompleted, I believe history will look back on this action as one of \nthe most important bills we will have done this year. If, at the end of \nthis week, we will have already completed the final version of \nbankruptcy legislation, which included a minimum wage increase and tax \nrelief for small businessmen and businesswomen, and address the \nquestion of health care costs, and then pass this important nuclear \nwaste bill, we will be off on a very positive step. It will be done in \na way I think is fair to both sides of the aisle. We can continue to \nmake progress. As soon as Senator Reid arrives, we will move forward on \nthe nuclear waste legislation.\n  I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senators for being here as we prepare to move \nforward on this important legislation. I explained what has been \noccurring and the need to move forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/08/senate-section/article/S463-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S463-S469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I inquire of the distinguished majority \nleader, the Friday draft is the one from which we are working. There \nhave been so many. I just want to be sure. Is this the one marked \nFebruary 4, 2000, 4:45 p.m.?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe it is.\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is consistent with our understanding. I thank the \nSenator.\n  Mr. REID. If I may say to the leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the leader and the chairman of the full committee \nthat I am sorry I was late, but we had a hearing on suicide which \nSenator Specter was gracious enough to hold. I was there because, as \nthe leader knows, my dad killed himself a number of years ago. It was a \nvery emotional hearing for me. I know it has been inconvenient for \nSenator Murkowski and the leader, Senator Bryan, and others, but I do \nappreciate their understanding. The hearing is over, so I can give my \nfull time and attention to this matter. I appreciate everyone allowing \nme to be late.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Nevada, we were \naware of this particular hearing and how important and emotional it was \nfor him. We have to be prepared to yield to each other on occasion and \nbe considerate of each other's needs. We certainly understand. I also \nappreciate his cooperation in moving forward.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], for Mr. Murkowski, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2808.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the amendment to \nthe desk pursuant to the gentlemen's agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring \nto a close debate on the pending amendment to S. 1287, the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Amendments Act of 1999:\n         Trent Lott, Frank H.

Mr. President, as a result of our gentlemen's agreement \nlast week--and I know all the Senators involved have been working to \nkeep that commitment--I think progress has been made.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this cloture vote occur at 2:15 p.m. \ntoday, that the mandatory quorum be waived, and that Members have until \n6 p.m. this evening to file first-degree amendments and 12 noon on \nWednesday to file any second-degree amendments.\n\n[[Page S464]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I now send a cloture motion to the pending \nbill to the desk. Before the clerk reports the motion, it is my sincere \nhope this cloture vote will not be necessary. It is my hope that rather \nthan the cloture vote on the amendment today at 2:15 p.m., there will \nbe a bipartisan outcome and the Senate can conclude this bill in a \nrelatively short period of time. However, without that ironclad \nassurance, I have no choice but to file this cloture motion to the \nunderlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring \nto a close debate on Calendar No. 180, S. 1287, the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Amendments Act of 1999:\n         Trent Lott, Frank H.

Mr. President, again, I thank Senators on both sides for \ntheir cooperation.\n  I yield the floor to the chairman and ranking member and hope \nsubstantial progress can be made during today's session. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have a historic opportunity today to \nresolve a problem that has been occurring ever since the first nuclear \nplant came online in this country. That date was 1960.\n  The question was: While we now have this new source of power, clean \ngeneration, what are we going to do with the waste?\n  Today we have an opportunity to resolve what we are going to do with \nthat waste. It is an obligation that goes across party lines. It is an \nobligation, it is a responsibility, it is a commitment, to resolve this \nonce and for all.\n  How long have we been at this? One can go back 17 years when it was \naddressed at great length in an energy package that was debated at \ngreat length, but the portion on what to do with high-level nuclear \nwaste was not resolved.\n  Over a period of time, it was agreed that the Federal Government \nwould enter into a contractual commitment to take the waste in the year \n1998. That went by and, as a consequence, we find ourselves in the \nsituation where the ratepayers in this country who have the benefit of \nnuclear clean power have paid in some $15 billion to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Where did that go? It did not go into an escrow account. It went into \nthe general fund. But those ratepayers and those power-generating \ncompanies, utilities, went into that contractual agreement with the \nFederal Government in good faith, believing that the contract would be \nhonored by the Federal Government, believing that, indeed, the Federal \nGovernment was under an obligation under the sanctity of contract \nprinciple to honor the contractual commitment.\n  The Federal Government has not honored that commitment and, as a \nconsequence, we are dealing with an exposure to the American taxpayer \nof some $40 billion to $80 billion in damages associated with the \ninability of the Government to come to terms with the contractual \ncommitment it made with the utilities.\n  Each day we delay resolving how we are going to take that waste \nsubjects the American taxpayer to additional liability. We did a little \ncalculation, and the additional liability to each and every American \nfamily is somewhere between $1,300 and $1,400. That is the liability \nthat extends to the American family. That is why, in spite of the \ndifferences as to how we resolve this problem, the commitment should be \nto resolve this problem with the legislation we have or the amendments \nthat will be forthcoming.\n  There is a tradeoff. We have had clean power from these nuclear \nplants. These are not isolated sources of power. These plants \ncontribute approximately 20 percent of the domestic energy produced in \nthis country.\n  What is the tradeoff? The tradeoff is what we are going to do with \nthe waste. We made a commitment to put that waste at Yucca Mountain. We \nhave expended in excess of $6 billion on Yucca Mountain. There is a \nprocedure to go through before Yucca Mountain can be licensed. But I \nremind my colleagues and staff and those who are following this debate, \nwe simply must deal with it.\n  The Senator from Alaska does not have a constituency in his State \nrelative to nuclear power. We had a small plant at a military base at \none time, but it is long since gone.\n\n  But as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I have \na responsibility to address this. I have a responsibility to the \ntaxpayers. I have a responsibility to every Member of this body. That \nis what the professional staffs of both sides, Senator Bingaman, as the \nranking member, and myself, have been working towards.\n  We simply cannot address this debate in the theory of: If we don't \nlike this aspect or we don't like that aspect, if we can't come to \nterms on one point or another, we are going to simply throw the baby \nout. That is absolutely irresponsible. It is mandatory that we come \ntogether now and resolve this issue because we have that responsibility \nto the taxpayers of this country.\n  What is the administration's position on it? I can probably honestly \nsay it is split. That may mean they are for certain aspects we have \ncome to terms with but are opposed to certain other aspects. But I \nimplore the administration to recognize that they have an obligation to \ncome to grips with the contractual commitment that was made. The \nDepartment of Energy, as the lead agency, has to address how it is \ngoing to come about.\n  I have had numerous conversations with Secretary Richardson. I think \nwe have made progress. But the reality is, if we are going to pick this \nlegislation apart and lose sight of our objective, I am wasting my time \nand, Mr. President, you are wasting your time listening to me because \nwe are not going to get anywhere. We have to come into this debate \ncommitted to working this out and resolving this so we can address the \nproblems associated with what we are going to do with that waste.\n  I am not here to lament on what others are doing with high-level \nwaste. We know what the French are doing. They are reprocessing their \nwaste. They recover the plutonium. They put it back in the reactors. \nThey vitrify the waste which has less life and is disposed of. We do \nnot have that policy in this country. We may have it someday, but we \nare committed to a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.\n  You are going to hear a lot from my Nevada colleagues, as you should, \nbecause the difficulty with this issue is nobody wants the waste. You \ncannot throw it up in the air because it has to come down somewhere. \nThat is all there is to it. When you have a situation where nobody \nwants it, you have a real problem because those that come from the area \nwhere it is proposed to go are going to do everything they can to stop \nit.\n  That is the situation with regard to my colleagues from Nevada. Let's \nbe honest with one another. They have a vested interest. They don't \nwant it in their State. But we have to put it somewhere.\n  Let me refer to a couple of charts here because I think it represents \nreality and where we are today.\n  The chosen site for the waste is Yucca Mountain in Nevada. Everybody, \nI assume, knows where Nevada is. It is next to California and Arizona. \nBut what we also have on this chart is where the waste currently is. \nYou have it all over the East Coast. You have it in the Chicago, IL, \narea. You have it along the West Coast, and in south Texas, and so \nforth.\n  What we are looking at here, shown in brown on the chart, are the \ncommercial reactors. These are the power-generating reactors in the \nvarious States that generate power to light the homes, light the \nsidewalks, light the highways, heat the homes, heat the hot water \ntanks. This represents 20 percent of the energy in this country.\n\n  The storage facilities where this waste is were designed to hold a \nspecific volume of waste. That volume was\n\n[[Page S465]]\n\nbasically controlled by the various States. Many of these facilities \nare full or about to be full. These States are either going to allow \nthe increase of that storage in their State or in the reactor pool or \nthose reactors are going to have to be shut down. If you shut down the \nreactors, where are you going to pick up the power?\n  The critics of nuclear energy don't care about that because they do \nnot want to see nuclear energy expanded to any extent. They are not \ninterested in where you are going to get the power from another source. \nBut you only have so many alternatives. You can put in more coal-fire \nplants. That does not do anything for air quality. Some suggest we just \nhook up to gas, that gas is cheap.\n  But the National Petroleum Council came out with a report the other \nday that suggests that if those people think they are going to be able \nto plug into gas, they have another thing coming. The infrastructure \nisn't there for the volume demand. We are using about 20 trillion cubic \nfeet of gas currently in this country. It is anticipated in the next 10 \nyears that will be up over 31 trillion cubic feet of gas.\n  We have a problem with access in the areas on public lands, where we \ncould initiate exploration for gas, because this administration simply \nwill not open up public lands or offshore areas, for the most part. \nWhere are you going to find the new gas necessary to meet the \nanticipated demand, even without the exposure associated with the issue \nat hand; that is, what to do with the high-level waste?\n  The other issue with the gas, as I have indicated, is the \ninfrastructure isn't there yet. To suggest it is going to be cheap, you \nhave another thing coming. It is not going to be cheap. The price is \ngoing to increase. It is estimated the demand for gas, at the end of \nthe next 10-year period of time, is going to amount to about 14 million \nnew users. It is going to require an investment of about $1.5 trillion. \nSo for those people who suggest we just go get gas, that is not \nrealistic.\n  Some people say: Let's go to solar. It gets dark at night, in case \nsome have not noticed. In my State of Alaska, in the wintertime it is a \nlong night.\n  Wind. Sometimes the wind does not blow.\n  So for a long time we are going to be looking to our conventional \nfossil fuel sources. We should be looking to the role of nuclear.\n  But my point is, this chart highlights where the nuclear waste is. It \nis in 40 States. If we don't do something about this now, with this \nlegislation, it is going to stay in those 40 States. There are 80 sites \nwhere various reactors are located in the 40 States.\n  There is another contributing consideration to which every Member \nought to be very sensitive. We have shut down reactors with spent fuel. \nWe have them in California. We have them over here on the East Coast. \nWe have several throughout the country--in Oregon.\n  What are we going to do with that waste in those shut down reactors? \nThe alternative is to leave it there. Do you want to leave it there? \nNobody wants to leave it there. They want to move it.\n  We have commercial spent nuclear fuel storage facilities where we \nhave waste in a number of States. That is shown on the chart in black. \nAs a consequence, that will stay.\n  We have non-Department of Energy research reactors in States which \nare shown in green on the chart. What do we do with that? Leave it?\n  We have naval reactor fuel in Idaho and the State of Washington which \nare shown in yellow on the chart.\n  There is DOE-owned spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive \nwaste strung around the country at various places.\n  To those who say this isn't a crisis, that we don't really have a \nresponsibility here, I say that logic is simply ducking the \nresponsibility. We have to address a resolve of this issue at this \ntime.\n  We have to address what to do with the waste. We have to get it out \nof the areas where it currently resides. Those areas were not designed \nto hold and maintain that waste indefinitely.\n  They were designed to hold the waste up to their licensed capacity. \nSo that is the problem we have now.\n  I want to go through and try to regionalize and personalize how \nsignificant this crisis is by a series of charts, the first of which \nwill show you where we propose to put this waste in Nevada, in the \ndesert. We have a chart that shows the area out at Yucca Mountain as it \nexists today. This is the proposed location for the permanent \nrepository at the Nevada site.\n  I am sensitive to the reality that this is the soil of the State of \nNevada. But I am also a realist and recognize that, for 50 years, we \nhave been using this area for nuclear testing. It is hot, Mr. \nPresident. We have had over 800 nuclear weapons tests in this area. If \nyou believe in the theory that an area, at some point in time, becomes \npretty heavily polluted--if I can use the word--does it make sense, \nthen, to try to recognize a site for what it is and ask, well, if the \ngeological area is sufficient, is this a good site for a permanent \nnuclear repository underground?\n  That selection was made a long time ago, so that is not the issue \ntoday. The issue is how we are going to proceed with an understanding \nof how we can go forth, begin to move the waste, when this site is \nlicensed by the various agencies and we can proceed in placing the \nwaste in that permanent repository where we have spent $6 billion.\n  I have been there. I have been through the tunnel. The tunneling is \nbasically done. If we don't put it there, where are we going to put it? \nSome say, leave it at the site. Some others say, put it in casks above \nground and store it. Well, then what do you do with it--put it off? \nRemember, all this time, we are in violation of our contractual \ncommitment to take the waste in 1998. So the clock ticks. There is a \nfull employment act for lawyers who are filing damage suits. They love \nthis delay. The American taxpayer doesn't know what is hitting him \nbecause the damages click on. That is why we have an obligation as \nMembers of this body to address and resolve this now.\n  Let's go through some of the 40 States that are affected. I hope that \nthe staffs of each of the States watch this. If you disagree with me, \nthat is fine. Get ahold of the staff and we will try to proceed.\n  Arkansas. A few of our prominent people come from Arkansas. Arkansas \nresidents paid over $365 million into that waste fund in their utility \nbills. There are two units, Nuclear Unit 1 and 2. The waste stored is \n690 metric tons. Their waste--under their permit, unit 1 runs out in \n1996 and unit 2, in 1997. Those dates have passed. The State of \nArkansas gets 33 percent of its electricity from nuclear energy. These \ncharts were made up some time ago. So the waste stored now is more. The \nquestion of whether Arkansas is going to increase its licensing is up \nto the folks from Arkansas. But the point is, that is one State. We \nhave 40 States. I am going to go through a few of them.\n  Connecticut. Residents paid in $655 million. They have two units, \nMillstone 2 and 3. Waste stored is 1,445 metric tons, DOE/defense \nwaste. Millstone 2 runs out in 2 years; Millstone 3, in 2003. That \nState is 43-percent dependent on nuclear energy. That is the hard cold \nfact.\n  Massachusetts. Their waste fund is $156 million. One unit, Pilgrim 1. \nWaste stored is 495 metric tons. There is a vacancy if they install new \nracks. The State's electricity is 12-percent dependent.\n\n  Oregon. The waste fund is $108 million. One unit, Trojan. Waste \nstored is 424 metric tons. Hanford site, waste stored is 2,133 metric \ntons. Trojan closed for decommissioning. Think about that. Do you know \nwhat that means? That means that waste isn't going to go anywhere other \nthan to stay in Oregon, unless we pass some legislation that proceeds \nin a process so we can move this waste out of these sites.\n  Moving south, Louisiana. Residents paid $339 million. Two units, \nRiverbend 1 and Waterford 3. There are 567 metric tons stored. \nWaterford runs out in 2002; Riverbend, 2007. Louisiana is 22-percent \ndependent on nuclear energy.\n  Illinois. The waste fund is $2 billion. The residents of the State of \nIllinois have paid $2 billion in their electric bills. The reason they \npaid that is so the Federal Government would honor its contract and \ntake the waste in 1998. They have 11 units: Braidwood 1 and 2; Bryon 1 \nand 2; Clinton; Dresden 2 and 3; La Salle 1 and 2; Quad Cities 1 and 2.\n\n[[Page S466]]\n\n DOE research reactor full, stored 40 metric tons. Dresden 3 expires in \n2000. Dresden 2 expires in 2002. Clinton expires in 2003. Quad Cities \nexpires in 2006. Zion expires in 2006. La Salle expires in 2013. Bryon \nexpires in 2005. Braidwood expires in 2019. The State is 39-percent \ndependent.\n  From where is this power going to come? Not from thin air. Somebody \nhas to produce it. Do you want a brownout? These plants are in \nviolation after that date. There is a necessity of us resolving this in \na bipartisan manner. We have that obligation. We should make a \ncommitment on this floor to proceed with the objective of solving this.\n  Michigan. Their waste fund is $696 million. There are four units: \nCook 1 and 2; Fermi 2; Palisades. Waste stored is 1,493 metric tons. \nDOE research reactor. Palisades expires in 1992; Fermi, in 2001; Cook, \nin 2014. The State is 24-percent nuclear dependent.\n  Wisconsin. I remind my fellow colleagues from these States that if we \ndon't do anything, it is going to stay right in your State. Is that \nwhat you want to have happen? In Wisconsin, the waste fund is $344 \nmillion. They have three units, Kewaunee and Point Beach. Waste stored \nis 967 metric tons. Point Beach expires in 1995. Kewaunee expires in \n2001. They are 8-percent dependent. Maybe they are waiting on the \nassumption that we are going to address this problem once and for all.\n  Georgia, in the South. Their waste fund is $529 million. They have \nfour units: Hatch 1 and 2, Vogtle 1 and 2. The waste stored is 1,182 \nmetric tons. The Savannah River site waste stored is 206 metric tons. \nHatch 1 and 2 were out in 1999. The State is 30-percent dependent.\n  Washington State. The waste fund is $344 million. One unit, WNP 2. \nWaste stored is 292 metric tons. They are up this year. State's \nelectricity is 6 percent. To a large degree, they depend on hydro, but \nthey still have a problem.\n  Maine. Their waste fund is $233 million. One unit shut down, Maine \nYankee. Waste stored is 536 metric tons. Does Maine want that waste to \nsit there? Do the elected Representatives of the State of Maine want \nthis waste to sit there or move it to one central location that was \ndesigned to take the waste?\n\n  I see my colleague from Pennsylvania on the floor. In his State, the \nratepayers have paid $1.338 million for the waste fund. They paid $245 \nmillion in their electric bills. They have nine units: Beaver Valley, \nLimerick, Peach Bottom, Susquehanna, Three Mile Island, and 3,327 \nmetric tons. Beaver Valley is out in 2015, Limerick is out in 2005, \nPeach Bottom is out in 1999, and Susquehanna is out in 1998. \nPennsylvania has a generating capacity of 34 percent which is dependent \non nuclear energy.\n  Finally, Vermont. I am not going to go through all States. But I want \nto make the point that $186 million has been paid by the ratepayers \nwith one unit.\n  Vermont Yankee: Waste stored, 429 metric tons. Vermont Yankee runs \nout in 2005. In this State, generating capacity is 73 percent nuclear \nenergy.\n  I think that highlights my point that there are very few States that \nare exempt. Out of the 50 States, there are about 10 that have no \nnuclear waste in their States.\n  Again, the locations of the spent fuel and radioactive waste designed \nfor geologic disposal are all of these colors. From all of these places \nit is going to go to the proposed one site at Yucca Mountain. How can \nwe work with Nevada to reach some kind of an accord?\n  That is tough because Nevada doesn't want it as a principle, but it \ncreates jobs. But, by the same token, they are very sensitive to this. \nI can appreciate that sensitivity. I again appeal to reason. We have to \nput it somewhere. We identified this as the appropriate place.\n  We are proceeding with the process of licensing. We have an \nobligation as elected Representatives to resolve the problem. It is not \na partisan issue. I defer the thought process to the obligation we are \nputting on the taxpayers as we put off, whether it be the Senate, the \nHouse, or the administration, reaching a decision on how to proceed \nwith this because it is costing the taxpayers more money. One of these \ndays the taxpayers are going to wake up to the fact that each family in \nthis country is carrying a proportionate share of between $1,300 and \n$1,400 for the damages that are anticipated associated with the \ninability of the Government to take that waste in 1998 as it agreed to \ndo under a contractual commitment, let alone overlooking the fact that \nthe ratepayers have paid $15 billion to the Federal Government to take \nthe waste.\n  It is beyond me as to why the current administration has not been \nmore aggressive in saying, yes, it is our responsibility to get it \nresolved. We have had a number of objections from the administration \nover the years in the process of trying to proceed with this.\n  These objections cover a series of legitimate concerns. But I think \nin some sense they have lost sight of what our objective had to be, and \nthat is to recognize we have the obligation to resolve the problem.\n  I met with the Secretary of Energy early last year. At that time, we \nwere hung up on how to proceed and what to do about the extended \nlitigation that was occurring as a consequence of the Government's \ninability to honor the contractual commitment. The issue was, well, how \ncan we find a compromise? We agreed to meet the administration's \nproposal that the Department of Energy may take title to spent fuel and \nmay pay some of the costs of that storage. That was a significant good-\nfaith effort to try to reach an accord.\n\n  The other alternative would have been the utility simply suing the \nFederal Government. But this was the suggestion of the Secretary. We \nconcurred and agreed with it.\n  The other issue was the concern of previous bills which would allow \ninterim storage to occur at Yucca Mountain until Yucca Mountain was \nlicensed. This is important because we need relief. The most immediate \nway to get relief is to begin moving this waste to Yucca for temporary \nstorage in casks on the surface until such time as Yucca Mountain is \nlicensed and the waste can be put in a permanent repository. The \nadministration opposed that. Nevada opposed that because they looked at \nit as the last straw and with certainty that the waste was definitely \ngoing to Nevada. We were trying to find a way to remove the crucial \ntime element where some of these plants had to shut down, move the \nwaste out under some plan, and put it in casks on the surface until \nsuch time as Yucca Mountain opened. We dropped that at the insistence \nof the administration. We eliminated the ability to temporarily move \nthat waste until Yucca could be licensed.\n  That was a very significant effort to come to grips with the concerns \nof the administration. But clearly the administration was concerned \nabout elections in Nevada. I can understand that and appreciate that. \nWe didn't move the waste into temporary storage. Now the question that \nseems to be crucial is how we are going to get a radiation standard \nthat is attainable. It is a legitimate question.\n  We are proposing to get the best science available. What is the best \nscience? There is a lot of science out there. We want a radiation \nstandard that will be attainable which will allow us at such time as \nYucca is licensed to be able to move the waste there. If we have a \nstandard that is unattainable, this whole thing is for naught. We will \nhave expanded dramatically the obligation of the American taxpayer not \nonly in damages where we failed to adhere to the sanctity of the \ncontract but damages associated with further delay.\n  We have proposed in general terms to bring with the best science, \nwhich is pretty hard to do in this kind of climate. That science \nconsists of those who are very familiar with items of this nature. One \nof them is the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licensed the plants \nand which has probably more Ph.D.s associated with the nuclear industry \nand nuclear issues than any other agency--to bring that agency together \nwith the National Academy of Sciences and the Environmental Protection \nAgency to work towards a solution on a radiation standard in a positive \nsense so that we have good, sound science. We have a problem with that \nto some extent.\n  I hope we can come to grips and recognize in the spirit of good faith \nthe objective is to get the best science, from whatever sources.\n  The EPA has the final obligation for rulemaking. However, we are \nproposing that not occur until after June of the year 2001. In the \nmeantime, we want them to come together to achieve an\n\n[[Page S467]]\n\nattainable level of a radiation standard with which we can live. The \nradiation standards are all over the ballpark. They are in the eyes of \nthe beholder.\n  In this debate, we will have an opportunity to explain at greater \nlength the concern we have that, after completing this process, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency promulgates a rule on radiation \nstandards that is simply unattainable. If everything were equal in \nevaluating this, I would not have that concern. However, there are some \nin this country, including environmental groups--and I am sure the \nNational Academy of Science as well as the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission perhaps to a lesser extent, but certainly within the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency--who would like to see no solution.\n  What is their motivation? There is a fear that somehow we will expand \nnuclear energy or the role of nuclear energy. Some suggest if we \novercome what to do with the waste, it will stimulate the construction \nof new plants.\n  I am not here as an advocate of nuclear energy, but I am here as a \nrealist to recognize we cannot have it both ways. We are concerned \nabout air quality. We are concerned about global climate change. We are \nconcerned about Kyoto. We should be. Is there a role for nuclear \nenergy? There should be. From the administration, the Vice President, \nno mention is made of the role of nuclear energy in any proposals on \nclimate change. One can only assume that the environmental groups that \noppose the nuclear industry prevail in the mindset associated within \nthe administration. If they do, that is fine; let's be open. But we \nshould recognize we have an obligation to come up with an alternative.\n  To suggest the solution is simply to let this industry choke on its \nown waste is unrealistic and irresponsible. That is why we must work in \na bipartisan manner for a solution and not lose sight of our objective, \nwhich occurs around here, by getting hung up on various aspects of \ndetail and legalistic language. We are either going to move this waste \nor we are not. If we move it, we are going to save the American \ntaxpayer money. We will adhere to the sanctity of the contractual \nagreement to take that waste in 1998. That is where we are.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleagues want to be heard and we have not \nentered into any time agreement. Ordinarily, we break for the policy \nluncheon. I believe we have a cloture vote scheduled at 2:15. Without \nlosing my right to the floor, how can we accommodate our colleagues, \nrecognizing we have a limited time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, we break at 12:30 \np.m. for the policy luncheons. Under the Pastore rule, only germane \ndebate can be accepted in the first 3 hours.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That occurs beginning at 2 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. 11:21 was the start of the debate, so for the \nnext 3 hours the debate has to be germane.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is the intention to break at 12:30 and we come back \nin at 2:15 and we have a cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, if I could make a parliamentary inquiry, \nit is my understanding we have a unanimous consent agreement in place \ncalling for a vote on the cloture motion at 2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I hope to speak for about 15 minutes to \ngive an opening statement explaining my views on this issue. I know \nthere are other Senators wishing to speak on this issue. I have no need \nfor additional time other than that.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to my friend. I \nhope in a bipartisan spirit we can come to grips with our obligation to \nresolve this issue to benefit the American taxpayer as a renewed \nsanctity of the contractual commitment the Federal Government has made.\n  I pledge to work with the Senator and my colleagues from Nevada in \nthat spirit in hopes we can reach a satisfactory resolution and not be \nburied in an impossible situation that simply detracts from our \nobjective.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, as well as the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Let me first discuss where we are procedurally because I think it is \nimportant to put my comments in context. We are going to vote at 2:30 \non a cloture motion to proceed to consider an amendment I will be \ndiscussing in my remarks. There have been substantial discussions \nbetween the chairman and me since that amendment was distributed last \nFriday. It is my understanding there are going to be major changes made \nto this amendment after the cloture vote occurs. We will be able to see \nthose. We have not seen them in writing yet, but we have had extensive \ndiscussion.\n  I want to make it clear that I will raise serious questions about the \nbill on which we are voting cloture. At the same time, I will indicate \nI support cloture so we can move the process forward and I hope we can \nfind in the course of this debate a way to resolve the issues to which \nI will allude in these comments.\n  The issue of disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level \nradioactive waste has been debated in the Senate, in one form or \nanother, as long as I have been a Member.\n  Nuclear waste is a serious issue that demands serious attention by \nall Senators. It is a problem that is national in scope.\n  It is also a particular responsibility of the Federal Government. \nAfter all, it was the Federal Government that proposed, beginning with \nthe Atoms for Peace Program in the Eisenhower administration, to \ndevelop the peaceful uses of nuclear power. The problems of disposal of \nspent nuclear fuel that we face today are the legacy of our past laws \nand decisions.\n  There are serious problems facing the national nuclear waste program \nthat merit attention now, in this Congress.\n  I have some important disagreements with the chairman. I will go \nthrough those in some detail here, about the substitute amendment that \nis going to be voted on, on cloture, because I believe that particular \namendment is fatally flawed in several respects. But I also believe the \nchairman is doing the right thing by pushing the issue to decision and \nby forcing the Senate and the Congress to grapple with the issue of how \nto store our Nation's nuclear waste.\n  Let me point out what I think are some of the important nuclear \nwaste-related issues that call out for our attention and require us to \ntake some action, if we can, in this Congress.\n  First, ratepayers have paid over $8 billion in fees to the nuclear \nwaste fund. That money which has been paid in has earned about $2 \nbillion in interest. Only $5 billion of that total of $10 billion has \nbeen spent on the program. Our current budget rules and accounting \nprinciples make it nearly impossible to give the program, each year, \nthe appropriation it deserves and requires. For example, in fiscal year \n1996, the President asked for $640 million for DOE's Yucca Mountain \nprogram. Congress appropriated $315 million, less than half of that.\n  As a result, the program had to abandon a comprehensive program plan \nthat was less than 2 years old and go through yet one more strategic \nplanning exercise to figure out how to cope with the inadequate funding \nthey had been provided.\n  The result of all this is to create considerable concern on the part \nof many about this nuclear waste program, in particular the Nuclear \nWaste Technical Review Board, which has stated the program is not \nmaking adequate technical progress at Yucca Mountain in order to make a \ndefensible determination of its suitability in the next few years.\n  I think that is a concern we need to take seriously in the Senate. \nNot surprisingly, the utilities themselves and the public utility \ncommissions and the States that are paying in $600 million each year \nand seeing only a fraction of that being spent, and the possibility \nlooming there will be further delays because we lack the technical \nanswers to questions about site suitability, are also upset by the \nstate of affairs, and they have every right to be.\n  Let me go on to another reason why we need to address this issue in \nthis Congress. The Department of Energy did not meet the January 31, \n1998, deadline to which Chairman Murkowski referred. That is a deadline \nto dispose of spent nuclear fuel. Not only did we not meet that, we are \nway behind the original schedule in building the repository.\n\n[[Page S468]]\n\n Utilities and ratepayers are beginning to make plans to pay for onsite \nstorage for spent fuel in addition to what they would otherwise have \nneeded if the Department of Energy had met its deadline.\n  While many thought the 1998 deadline was unrealistic when it was \nfirst picked as a target date, nobody thought we would miss it by as \nwide a margin as we have. Lawsuits have been filed. The Department of \nEnergy has concluded it does not have the legal authority to settle the \nsuits by directly addressing the needs of utilities to do something \nwith the fuel that is on their hands. So additional legislation is \nrequired to deal with that issue. Hopefully, we can come up with an \nagreement on that legislation before we conclude action on this bill.\n  We could choose to ignore the problem, but I believe we would do so \nsomewhat at our own peril. Lawsuits are working their way through the \nCourt of Federal Claims with contradictory results at the lower levels \nof the court, so no one can say how the courts will ultimately rule on \nthe Department of Energy's contractual obligations--but the Federal \ncourts have surprised the Government previously in recent years with \nrulings in favor of the utilities.\n  A third reason we need to deal with this in this Congress is the \ntransportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste is a \nlegitimate concern to the communities through which it will travel on \nits way from the nuclear plants where it is located to any repository. \nThis is true nationwide. It is true in my own State of New Mexico. The \nstandards governing shipment of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste \nare currently below those for less radioactive waste streams, such as \nthe waste going to the WIPP project in my own State. This situation \narises because Congress instituted higher standards for packaging and \nshipment of transuranic waste in the WIPP Land Withdrawal Act of 1992. \nThe WIPP provisions have, so far, had some success. One could argue \nwhether there are lessons learned that should be applied to spent \nnuclear fuel and high-level waste in the form of even stricter \nrequirements than for WIPP, since spent fuel and high-level waste \nplausibly involve greater risks to the public, in case of an accident. \nIt certainly does not make much sense, though, and it is not in the \npublic interest to ignore the advances in standards and transportation \nprocedures that have occurred since passage of the original Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act of 1982.\n\n  These issues I mentioned speak for themselves. It is possible to \nbuild a good set of amendments to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, \nand to deal with these problems. The amendment we are going to vote \ncloture on does not do that. I hope the substitute we can come up with \nwill.\n  Let me cite some areas where we have agreement because there are \nsome. Clearly, those need to be mentioned. Anyone who looks at the \nsubstitute amendment and compares it to the original bill introduced in \nthe Congress has to admit, and I readily do, that although there are \nstill crucial flaws in the bill, major progress has been made on a \nnumber of topics--progress toward getting a decent bill. These include \nabandoning the plan to have interim storage in Nevada while the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission is deliberating on the license application for \nthe permanent repository. That was major progress for which I commend \nthe chairman.\n  Second, embracing instead a plan to have the Department of Energy \nauthorized to take title to fuel where it can work out settlement \nagreements with utilities, that is also major progress in my view. And \nmaking a significant move toward accepting the EPA's final rulemaking \nauthority, that is important. I hope that is something to which we can \nfinally agree.\n  But there are areas of disagreement. Let me mention those very \nbriefly. They include restrictions on the EPA standard-setting process; \nsecond, inadequate transportation safeguards--these are concerns with \nthe bill which we are voting cloture on; third, one-sided take-title \nprovisions--I can go into detail on these; fourth, the support for \nforeign reprocessing of nuclear fuel which, to my mind, is not a good \ninvestment of taxpayer dollars. If there is research to be done, we \nshould go ahead and do it, and there is clearly research to be done. \nAnd fifth, neglect for the pressing funding needs of the program, that \nalso is not addressed.\n  Preserving the integrity of the EPA rulemaking process for the Yucca \nMountain radiation standard is one of the threshold issues in this \nbill. The chairman's substitute dilutes both EPA's rulemaking authority \nfor the remainder of this administration as well as changing the \nsubstantive standard of protection. Right now, the standard EPA has to \nfollow is to protect public health and safety and the environment. \nUnder the chairman's substitute, EPA, for the next 16 months, would be \nable to do so only to the extent that it would allow the agency to meet \nthe standard of being ``attainable'' at Yucca Mountain. This \neffectively stacks the deck in the standard-setting process. It also, \nin my view, may create a more lasting problem of legitimacy for the \nstandard and for the program as a whole in the minds of disinterested \ncitizens.\n  In New Mexico, we have had experience with EPA standard setting for \nradioactive waste disposal facilities. EPA both set the compliance \ncriteria for the waste isolation pilot plant, or WIPP, and certified \nthat the faculty, as built, met those criteria. It was a long and \narduous process. But in the end, the fact that EPA was able to do the \njob on the merits was important to the facility gaining legitimacy in \nthe minds of most New Mexicans.\n  I believe that EPA can do a fair job of setting a standard for Yucca \nMountain, and I will continue in that belief until someone shows me the \nrecord in this rulemaking that indicates the contrary. Surely, the \ndraft rule published by EPA last August, which laid out a number of \noptions for such a standard, cannot be characterized as arbitrary or \ncapricious. DOE, the NRC, and the National Academy of Sciences have \ntaken exception to a number of options and approaches in the rule, as \nis their right. They have put comments in the rulemaking file that EPA \nwill have to grapple with honestly, if the agency wants to see its \nstandard survive judicial review.\n  Given this, I would not favor either transferring the job of EPA to \nanother agency, or giving some other Federal agency an effective veto \nover EPA's discretion. The bill reported from the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources did the former, and the chairman's substitute did \nthe latter. This is a major reason for my opposition to this \nsubstitute.\n  A second major concern that I have with the substitute is its \napproach toward the transportation of nuclear waste. Transportation of \nnuclear waste is a matter of concern to many members of the general \npublic. The chairman's substitute does not address these concerns \nadequately, in my view. There is no independent oversight of the design \nand manufacture of the shipping canisters in which nuclear waste will \ntravel. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has testified before the \nSenate Energy Committee that it lacks adequate regulatory authority \nover DOE shipments. Unfortunately, this gap in regulatory authority is \nnot addressed in the bill or the substitute. What is in the bill looks \nlike an excessively ornate structure of plans that conflict with one \nanother and probably give rise to lost of litigation. It is hard to see \nhow that sort of extra bureaucracy protects public safety.\n  In addition to provisions that don't effectively protect the safety \nof citizens living along routes where nuclear waste will be \ntransported, the chairman's substitute contains provisions that cancel \nout certain routes in certain states, by means of criteria such as \nmaximum downgrade percentages. I would oppose  this sort of provision \non principle, as I have consistently opposed carve-out amendments on \nprior nuclear waste bills. In this particular case, my own State of New \nMexico is being particularly disadvantaged, as trucking routes in \nColorado are canceled out, thereby shifting truck shipments through \nWyoming on I-80 and New Mexico on I-25 and I-40. Speaking for New \nMexicans, I can think of few worse places for a truck of nuclear waste \nthan on the interchange, in the center of Albuquerque, of I-25 and I-\n40. New Mexicans call it the ``Big I,'' and it is legendary for its \npoor design.\n\n  A third major flaw in this bill concerns the ground rules that the \nbill\n\n[[Page S469]]\n\nlays out for the Department of Energy in its negotiations with the \nutilities over taking title to spent nuclear fuel. The only reason to \nhave a take-title mechanism is to respond to DOE's non-performance with \nrespect to specific contracts. Yet, the language of the chairman's \nsubstitute contains several changes to what the committee reported last \nspring on these lines. All these changes are in the direction of \nclouding the issue of what DOE is responsible for. The probable result \nof this blurring of responsibility is that numerous utilities will \nclaim that the Congress intends for DOE to go beyond making them whole \nfor specific non-performance on specific contracts. The bill for this \nextra scope for DOE's relief of the utilities will be borne by either \nthe general taxpayer or the Nuclear Waste Fund, and both sources of \nfunds are a problem. In the former case, it is not fair. In the latter \ninstance, the Waste Fund is already supposed to pay for the repository \nand the legitimate costs of taking title. It is not reasonable to \ncreate a scenario where utilities can claim that Congress intended DOE \nto pay more than those legitimate costs associated with contractual \nbreaches.\n  A fourth major flaw in the bill is its authorization for DOE to spend \ntaxpayer dollars to fund foreign reprocessing and transmutation \nactivities in countries that are not willing to pay for such activities \nthemselves. I do not know why we should have blanket authority for DOE \nto spread reprocessing technology worldwide in this manner. Most other \ncountries that have looked at the sort of reprocessing and \ntransmutation that would be supported by this bill have concluded that \nthere are serious technical challenges that will take decades to \nresolve. Our own National Academy of Sciences agreed in its 1996 report \non ``Nuclear Wastes: Technologies for Separations and Transmutation.''\n  Finally, the fifth major flaw in the bill is its lack of attention to \nthe most critical problem facing the Yucca Mountain program--the lack \nof funding to characterize the mountain properly, or to build the \nrepository, if authorized. The chairman's substitute does nothing \neither to make the balances in the Nuclear Waste Fund more readily \navailable to fund the work needed to demonstrate the mountain's \nsuitability and licensability, or even to make a special one-time fee \nunder current law for certain utilities directly available to the \nprogram. The latter provision would not score under our budget rules, \nsince it is currently outside the 10-year scoring window. If DOE took \ntitle to fuel from certain utilities, it might be able to collect the \none-time fee early, but without special legislation, the fee would \nvanish into the Treasury without a trace, and without helping the \nprogram.\n  Let me get to a conclusion so others can speak before we go into \nrecess for our caucuses. I do think this issue of adequate funding so \nthe program can go forward, so the site can be characterized, is \nabsolutely crucial. I hope very much the Senate will address that \nbefore we pass a bill or before we conclude action on an amendment on \nthe Senate floor in the form of a substitute.\n  Let me conclude my remarks by reiterating the basic principles behind \nmy opposition to the substitute amendment. These are things which I \nhope very much can be resolved in the alternative that is now being \nprepared and is going to be available for us to review this afternoon. \nWe ought to focus, in this legislation, on making the current program \nwork. That means, No. 1, giving the Department of Energy the tools it \nneeds to resolve current litigation over its failure to meet past \ncontractual obligations. I hope we can do that in an effective way.\n  Second, it means upgrading transportation standards for spent nuclear \nfuel and high-level waste. Again, I hope we can do that in the \nlegislation we finally act on.\n  Third, it means making the needed funds available to characterize \nYucca Mountain, and to build Yucca Mountain if it is licensed by the \nNRC. I hope we can act on that.\n  The fourth item is, the program does not need to suffer a loss of \npublic legitimacy by legislatively stacking the deck against EPA's \nability to carry out its statutory authority on protecting health and \nsafety. We can find a solution to that. I hope very much we do.\n  Finally, the fifth item I want to mention is the program does not \nneed extra doses of paper-pushing bureaucracy and bureaucracy related \nto transportation of nuclear waste, accompanied with unrealistic \ndeadlines for putting waste on the road.\n  We found that we, American taxpayers, have incurred substantial \nliability because of our writing into law deadlines which turned out to \nbe unrealistic before. Let's not make that same mistake again in \nlegislation on the Senate floor this week.\n  I did not support the chairman's amendment even though I appreciate \nhis attempts to improve it.\n  He has been negotiating in good faith to improve this amendment, and \nI greatly appreciate that. We have not seen that alternative substitute \nprovision, so I cannot say whether we have reached agreement or not on \nthe various items I have identified, but I hope we have made progress \non each of them.\n  It is important to move the process forward. It is important to come \nto closure on this bill in a bipartisan way. This is not a partisan \nmatter. I hope all Senators will support the effort to invoke cloture \nso we can move ahead, and then I hope we can all work in good faith to \nimprove the basic bill we are considering before we have to vote on a \nfinal bill.\n  Obviously, I could not support a vote in favor of the final bill on \nwhich we are invoking cloture, but I hope before the process concludes \nI can support a piece of legislation that will solve the problems I \nhave enumerated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my intention to continue the \ndebate on the manager's amendment to S. 1287, the Nuclear Policy Act \nAmendments of 1999. It is appropriate to highlight a couple more charts \nbefore I explain what this manager's substitute does.\n  I will reiterate the purpose of addressing the responsibility we have \nas the Senate to resolve what we are going to do to dispose of this \nhigh-level waste in conformance with the contractual commitment that \nthe Department of Energy and the Federal Government entered into to \ntake the waste beginning in January of 1998.\n  As I indicated earlier today, the Federal Government is derelict in \nnot meeting its fiduciary responsibility. It is appropriate to point \nout that the ratepayers in this country have paid $15 billion to the \nFederal Government to take that waste beginning in 1998. Damages for \nnonperformance to the contractual commitment by the power industry in \nthis country against the Federal Government suggests the liability is \nsomewhere between $40 billion and $80 billion. The longer this body \ndelays in addressing its responsibility of disposal of this waste, the \ngreater the obligation to the American taxpayer, which currently is \nestimated to be about $1,400 per family.\n  As a consequence, we have the responsibility, in a bipartisan manner, \nto come together and resolve the obligation we were elected to address, \nand that is to meet contractual commitments, honor the sanctity of the \ncontract, and resolve the waste problem and not allow the nuclear \nindustry to, basically, choke on its own waste.\n  There are a couple of charts with which I want to proceed. First of \nall, I want to identify, again, the locations of the waste for those \nwho may have missed it earlier. Around this country, there are \napproximately 80 sites. One can see the sites on the map: the \ncommercial reactors, the shut down reactors with spent fuel onsite; and \nthey will not be removed unless we proceed with this legislation to \naddress one site at Yucca Mountain in Nevada for a permanent \nrepository. It also includes the commercial spent nuclear fuel storage, \nthe non-DOE research reactor, the naval reactors, and the DOE-owned \nspent nuclear fuel. My point is simply to show we have 80 sites in 40 \nStates. It is an obligation we have to universally address this with \nappropriate resolve.\n  The next chart shows radiation exposure. This is very important and \nvery germane to the debate because we are all concerned about the \nmanner in which the radiation exposure will be addressed and by what \nagency.\n  I am not here to promulgate who has the best science, but I think it \nis fair to say this issue deserves the very best science. \nTraditionally, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission addresses licensing, \nexamination, and conformance of nuclear plants. They are pretty good at \nit. They probably have more Ph.D.s than any other agency dealing with \nnuclear radiation.\n  However, the National Academy of Sciences also has a great deal of \nexpertise, and we are suggesting that their scientific contribution be \npart of a determination on setting a radiation level that will conform \nto, as well as achieve, our objective, and that is to put the waste in \na permanent repository at Yucca Mountain.\n  There is a lot of concern about radiation. I think it has to be put \nin some perspective that is understandable.\n  For those working in this Capitol, they get 80 millirems of exposure \neach year.\n  If one is living in a brick house, they get 70 millirems per year.\n  The exposure from cosmic radiation to residents in Denver is 53 \nmillirems.\n  The average annual radiation exposure from the ground is 26 \nmillirems.\n  Diagnostic x-rays are 20 millirems.\n  Dental x-rays are 14 millirems.\n  If one flies from New York to Los Angeles, they get 6 millirems.\n  Exposure for half an hour from a transport container on a truck 6 \nfeet away--let's assume they are moving this in a prescribed cask, \ntransporting it by rail or by highway with an escort--the exposure is 5 \nmillirems.\n  These are accurate measurements. The EPA's proposed radiation \nexposure level is 4 millirems, and that is a ground water standard.\n  I am not going to argue the merits of EPA other than to say that \ntheir exposure level, from the standpoint of its relationship with \nthese other exposure levels, seems a little out of line. We will let it \ngo at that because I want to move on. I want to make the point, as we \nlook at radiation exposure levels, it is important to keep in \nperspective what we are exposed to already.\n  Let's look at transportation because that is going to be debated \nextensively. We have been transporting used fuel from 1964 through \n1997, as this chart shows. These are the routes used for 2,913 \nshipments. Obviously, they have been going through all the States. They \nhave been going by railroad through Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, a \nportion of Nebraska, I believe Missouri, and a couple of other States, \nas indicated in red. We are and have been moving these shipments. The \nsignificance of this is that the public health has never been exposed \nto radiation from spent fuel cargo. We have never had an exposure. That \ndoes not mean it cannot happen; it means we have taken practical \nsafeguards to ensure the exposure is at a minimum.\n\n  I learned a long time ago in my State of Alaska when we had the Exxon \nValdez accident that these accidents can occur. That ship went aground \nin a 10.5-mile-wide channel simply because\n\n[[Page S471]]\n\nof the incompetence of those on the bridge. You can have accidents, and \nyou can prevent them.\n  We have a pretty good record here. Between 1971 and 1989, the \nDepartment of Transportation tells us there have been seven minor \naccidents that have occurred involving nuclear waste, but no \nradioactivity was released at any of the accident sites simply because \nof the containment of the vehicles that enclose the waste. Those, of \ncourse, are the canisters which are built to withstand exposure. Some \ntime ago when we were talking about moving nuclear waste by aircraft, \nthere was the assurance that we have the technology to build a canister \nthat would survive a free-fall from an aircraft at 30,000 feet.\n  As evidence of the thousands of safe used-fuel shipments since 1964, \nthis is the type of cask that is used, and the waste is stored in that. \nThese are required to survive a 30-foot drop onto a flat, unyielding \nsurface, a drop of 40 inches on a steel plate, being engulfed in a \n1,475-degree fire for 30 minutes, submersion under 3 feet of water for \n8 hours, and on and on. We have taken safeguards to construct these \ncasks in such a way as to ensure there is a minimum of risk associated \nwith transportation.\n  I have been to Great Britain, Sweden, and I have seen in France the \nmanner in which they move high-level waste. They move it by ship, by \nrail, by road, and they take safeguards to ensure that it is properly \ncontained.\n  We have transportation safety concerns. We have provisions in this \nbill to deal with them. It involves the Department of Energy developing \ncomprehensive shipping and transportation plans under the same \nguidelines as we currently move the WIPP. That is the waste isolation \nproject in New Mexico. These are the same guidelines we are going to be \nusing to move this waste.\n  We have been moving waste to New Mexico. That is basically low-level \nwaste. I have been there and been in the salt caverns and observed the \nprocess down there. There is great care taken to ensure there is no \nexposure that cannot be rectified through adequate engineering \ntechnology.\n  The used fuel is going to have to travel as designated by the States, \nthey having a determination of what the most appropriate route is. \nClearly, the material has to move; otherwise, you cannot get it out of \nthe States--280 sites and 40 States--and you cannot move it to one area \nthat we have predesignated, which is Yucca Mountain in Nevada.\n  Then we are going to have training which would meet Department of \nTransportation standards so that we have people who are adequately \ntrained to move this waste and cover whatever emergency response \nreadiness is necessary before the shipments begin.\n  So what we have done--perhaps we can do more and perhaps we should \nand I certainly am open to that--is taken every precaution to try to \nensure the exposure is taken out of the process.\n  Let me show you a couple other charts that I think are relevant. For \nthose of you who missed it, this is the location out in the Nevada Test \nSite that has been chosen to be the permanent repository. This site has \nbeen already pretty well bombarded as a consequence of over 50 years \nand 800 nuclear weapons tests. If you buy the theory that you kind of \ndesecrated one area so maybe that is the best area for a permanent \nrepository, this site should certainly fit.\n  Let me show you one other chart that shows another aspect. As I have \nindicated earlier, about 20 percent of our energy comes from nuclear \npower. You see on the chart, shown in red, nuclear power accounts for \n18 percent of our energy use in the country. In any event, this chart \nshows the mix: Coal is 53 percent; nuclear is 18 to 20 percent; natural \ngas is 14 percent; hydroelectric is 10 percent; other is 2.7 percent; \noil is 2 percent; wind is .08 percent; and solar is .02 percent.\n  It is obvious we are going to be dependent on these sources for some \ntime. If we do not address the nuclear waste issue, we are going to \npick up 20 percent of our power generation some other way. I think \nthose who are critical of the effort to address our responsibility are \na bit irresponsible in not suggesting where we are going to pick up \nthis differential.\n  On this next chart we look at air quality. If we look at our concern \nover global warming, if we look at our concern over Kyoto, we have to \nrecognize that there is significant avoidance of emissions by the \ncontribution of nuclear power. You can see shown on this chart the \nregions that were subject to caps from 1990 to 1995 and the emissions \navoided by having nuclear generation and where these States would be \nwithout it.\n  It is a pretty tough set of facts. The reality is, a good portion of \nthe Northeast corridor would no longer meet its mandate for emission \nreductions if, indeed, we had to sacrifice the nuclear power industry.\n  Approximately 80 of the 103 currently operating nuclear energy plants \nare located in or adjacent to areas that are unable to meet the Clean \nAir Act standards for ozone. Any use of emitting generation in these \nareas in place of the existing nuclear capacity moves the region \nfurther away from attainment of these standards. So I encourage my \ncolleagues from these States to recognize that the nuclear power \nindustry makes a significant contribution, and without it you are going \nto be looking to some other unidentifiable means to offset the loss of \npower from the nuclear industry.\n\n  Let me turn to the substitute that is before us and briefly reflect \non where we have been. We have passed bills in this body by a broad \nbipartisan margin. The last time the vote was 65 to 34--pretty close to \novercoming a veto but not quite.\n  I think these bills mark a historic pattern of trying to meet the \nobjectives of the administration through compromise, through changes, \nand through accommodations. Those bills were a complete substitute for \nthe existing Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 that gave authority to \nbuild an interim storage facility for nuclear waste, a temporary above-\nground storage pad adjacent to the Yucca Mountain site. It contained \nextensive provisions on licensing for Yucca Mountain and the interim \nstorage facility, including NEPA radiation protection standards and \ntransportation safety. But the administration was not satisfied. They \nsaw fit to veto the legislation because it opposed the interim storage \nbefore the viability assessment was made about the permanent \nrepository.\n  We still think we were doing the responsible thing by trying to \naddress the difficulty of those plants that were about out of license \ntime and would either have to shut down or seek additional relief under \nState licensing by allowing them to move their waste and store it at \nYucca Mountain until such time as a permanent repository was completed.\n  Obviously, there was a fear from Nevada that if that were adopted, \nthe waste would end up in Nevada. Of course, today we are faced with \nthe concerns of various Governors that if we adopt the take-title \nissue, and title is indeed taken, the waste will go into canisters and \nbe stored onsite in those States, the Government would have title and \nthe waste would still be in the States, that it would not move.\n  The point is that we are either committed as a body to resolve this \nproblem and get on with addressing the transportation of that waste to \na permanent repository, or we are going to be faced with the reality \nthat we will simply put it off for another day, put it off for another \nadministration. If we do that, I think we are acting irresponsibly.\n  What we have attempted to do in this bill is a different approach in \nthe manager's amendment. It is not a complete substitute for the old \nact. It is a minimalist approach. It does not contain an interim \nstorage provision. So we responded to the administration. We responded \nto the minority. We left that out. We said: It doesn't move until it is \nlicensed.\n  We propose to do two major things. We propose to give the Department \nof Energy the tools it needs to meet its commitment to move the spent \nfuel by opening a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. Secondly, we \nthink it provides fair treatment by permitting utilities to enter into \nvoluntary settlements with those who have fulfilled their end of the \nbargain by paying over some $15 billion which the ratepayers have paid \nover the contract.\n  What has the Department of Energy done? It left them holding the \nbag because the Department of Energy and the administration have not \nseen fit to lift the terms of the contractual agreement to take the \nwaste. So the manager's amendment to S. 1287 clarifies\n\n[[Page S472]]\n\nthe existing unconstitutional White House veto for raising the fee and \nstates that Congress can vote to raise the existing 1 million per \nkilowatt fee, if necessary, to pay the expenses of the program. It \nallows plaintiffs in the lawsuits and the DOE to reach voluntary \nsettlements of the Department of Energy's liability for failing to take \nthe waste in 1998.\n\n  I still have to refer to the example the Federal Government sets when \nit doesn't honor the sanctity of a contractual commitment. They simply \nignore it. They simply ignore the liability of the taxpayer, which, as \nI have indicated, is something in the area of $40 billion to $80 \nbillion in damages. We, as elected representatives, have an obligation \nto address and correct that. That is what we are attempting to do in \nthis legislation.\n  Further, it permits the EPA to continue with its rulemaking--and it \nis the appropriate agency--on radiation standards as long as we have \nthe best science. Where is the best science? As I have indicated, it is \nin the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in consultation with the National \nAcademy of Sciences. That is the best science we have in this country. \nIf that isn't good enough to set a radiation standard, I don't know \nwhat is.\n  Obviously, that standard will protect the public health and safety \nand the environment, but it has to be attainable. If the EPA has a \npolicy of nonattainment that we come up with ultimately, we will waste \na lot of time and money, and it will cost the taxpayers a lot of \ndollars. It will allow fuel to be accepted when the NRC authorizes \nconstruction of the permanent repository in the year 2007. Further, it \nallows the Department of Energy to begin moving fuel as soon as \npossible after Yucca Mountain is licensed.\n  Transportation provisions are based on those used for the waste \nisolation plan, as I have indicated. Furthermore, we have moved that \nfuel in the United States around the world. So S. 1287 builds on \nexisting safe systems by adding money for education, emergency \nresponse, local communities, transportation personnel, and provisions \nfor allowing the State to determine the routes and rules for population \nareas. Who is better qualified than the States? Also, there is advance \nnotification for local government.\n  As I have indicated, we have attempted to compromise, and we continue \nto try to meet the concerns of the administration and the minority. But \nin order to do that, we have to agree on our objective, and that is to \nmeet our obligation to address, once and for all, some finality to the \nnuclear waste storage dilemma. We have eliminated the source of the \nadministration's opposition to our previous bills on interim storage.\n  EPA, secondly, may proceed with its rulemaking. All they have to do--\nall we want them to do--is be reasonable in the sense of using sound \nscience and participating in peer review with both NRC and the National \nAcademy of Sciences. And in this existing proposal, we have allowed the \nutilities to enter into a voluntary settlement with the DOE. This was \nthe idea of Secretary Richardson.\n  The manager's amendment to S. 1287 gives us an opportunity, I think, \nfor a triumph of substance over process, safety of people over \npolitics. As I have indicated, the Senate has twice passed this \nlegislation by large, bipartisan margins.\n\n  Where does the administration stand on this? Well, I have a letter \nfrom the administration called ``statement of policy.'' I think it \nshould be ``statement of administrative mixed policy.'' It states that \nthe administration has reviewed the February 4 manager's amendment and \nthey find it unacceptable. Although the amendment appears to allow the \nEPA to exercise its existing authority, they still believe it would \nallow another entity to block EPA's authority. I don't know whether \nthey have read the bill or not, but that isn't what the bill says. \nConsequently, one can only assume the administration is opposed to it \nbecause it always has been, regardless of what we have attempted to \ncompromise. Furthermore, I think it is appropriate to recognize that.\n  Again, the administration seems to be working to create a problem \nthat really we can address. The rationale is, I assume, only that they \ncould object to the legislation. That really isn't an adequate excuse. \nI encourage my friends who have the same responsibility as I do to \nrecognize that the administration has an obligation to come forward and \nsay how we can meet this obligation collectively, the Congress and the \nadministration.\n  The administration, as I indicated, basically objects to a provision \nthat requires EPA to consult with scientists before adopting a \nstandard. What is wrong with the best science? The administration talks \nabout good science and making decisions based on sound science. In \nfact, the administration's position on science is that it is good. But \nI wonder if it is good only when it supports a predetermined policy \ndecision.\n  That is kind of where I think we are. I think that is unreasonable. I \nthink that is irresponsible. I think it deserves a greater explanation \nthan the one offered. The only reason for the administration to object \nto having EPA consult with scientists at the National Academy of \nSciences, or with the participation of the NRC, is that they know it is \npossible to adopt a reasonable standard but they simply don't want to \ndo it. I have a hard time with that because I think that in itself is \nsomewhat irresponsible.\n  I have some other examples that concern me. I will not take the time \nnow, but maybe I will later. The EPA is an extraordinary agency. They \ncarry a big responsibility, but one questions the balance they use. I \nam going to cite a couple of instances with which I have had personal \nexperience, and I invite my colleagues to share those. As we question \nthe legitimate authority of the EPA, which is statute--that is in law--\nEPA does have authority for final rulemaking; we just want them to use \nthe best science available.\n  In my hometown of Fairbanks, it snows. With snow, you have one of two \noptions: You either leave it there or you move it. Several years ago, \nthey had a heavy snowfall where the city and school buses park. This \nwas a paved lot. They moved the snow off the lot. The buses cooperated \nand they put it on the back lot, which was determined by EPA to be a \nwetlands. Well, the EPA notified the city of a violation of the \nwetlands permit. Now, there was snow that came naturally on that other \nlot where they pushed the snow. It makes no sense. The snow was frozen \nwater. How can wetlands be damaged by more snow? I don't know.\n  We had a problem in Anchorage, AK. This was a storm water treatment: \nwhen it rains, the rain goes off the highway into the gutters. In the \nparticular community of Anchorage, it was charged into Cook Inlet; this \nis water off the streets. Cook Inlet has some of the highest tides in \nthe world, next to the Bay of Fundy, nearly 30 feet, almost twice a \nday.\n  However, EPA Clean Water Act regulations interpreted that the city \nwas in violation because it had to remove 30 percent of the organic \nmatter from the untreated water. The problem was it was rain water. \nThere was no organic matter to remove. Yet they were still in \nviolation. But the water was too clean to begin with. The city appealed \nto the EPA. The EPA denied the appeal and told the city they were \nsubject to a fine. One of the city council members suggested they go \ndown to the fish plant and add some fish guts to the drain water so \nthere would be some organic matter to remove and thus meet the national \ndischarge standard. This got notoriety all over the country. It made no \nsense to pay to contaminate pure rain water and then pay to remove the \ncontamination. We were finally able to convince them as a consequence \nof public opinion and public notoriety of the impracticality of EPA.\n  In this instance, I have one more little item that I will share with \nyou. In 1993, the EPA proposed to take pepper spray bear repellent off \nthe market until its safety could be certified. The spray was at that \ntime the only effective nonlethal repellent that Alaskans could use to \nprotect themselves against bears. I say nonlethal. You can take a gun \nor you can take some pepper spray. While the EPA reconsidered the \ndecision and allowed the pepper spray repellent to remain while it \npermitted a speeded up regulatory review, the preliminary decision to \nrecall the spray was idiotic, to say the least. Alaskans or anyone who \nwants to can put cayenne pepper in their chili. They could\n\n[[Page S473]]\n\nlegally throw the pepper at a charging bear, if they wanted to. It was \ninsane to say that could not be placed within the spray can; namely, \nthe chili spray.\n  What was really insane was that EPA initially argued they couldn't \nspeed up registration of the pepper spray until it was field tested and \non, do you know what? Wild bears--a difficult and rather dangerous \nthing to do. It was especially odd that the bear undoubtedly would much \nrather be sprayed by the pepper spray than the alternative 30.06 \nbullet.\n  I have recycling asthma inhalant examples, vehicle gasoline rules, \nozone standards, background contamination on MTBE, battery enterprise \nexamples, mining examples, and recycling center examples.\n  I am not going to bore my colleagues with that other than to say what \nwe want is the best science. We want EPA to take advantage of that \nscience and then come down with their rulemaking. But very \nparticularly, we don't want EPA to set an attainment standard that is \nunattainable for the nuclear waste to be disposed of.\n  I know my friends want to be heard from, and there will be amendments \nforthcoming. But I want to conclude with a reference on what we can do.\n  Again, I point out that it is the obligation of the Government--that \nincludes those of us in the Congress and the administration--to solve \nthis problem. This bill is the congressional solution, and the \nadministration has an obligation as well.\n  We voted out this legislation in the last two Congresses by \nbipartisan votes--65 to 34 in the Senate, and in the House of \nRepresentatives 307 to 120--again, not enough to override a veto.\n  This year, we introduced the interim storage legislation, S. 608. The \nlegislation had votes to be favorably reported. I proposed that the \ncommittee consider a new approach to accommodate the Secretary and the \nadministration. We hoped to find a solution to the nuclear waste \ndilemma to gain full consensus and avoid procedural problems of the \npast. Senate bill 1287 was approved in the committee by a bipartisan \nvote of 14-6.\n\n  Here are the five essential points that I believe have to be \naddressed if we are going to have anything meaningful when we are \nthrough.\n  We need congressional approval before there is any increase in the \nnuclear waste figure. We simply cannot give the executive branch carte \nblanche. It has to have congressional approval; second, authorize \nsettlement of lawsuits for DOE's failure to perform; third, the \nradiation protection standards, as I stated, for the repository to be \nset by the agencies that have the expertise--the NRC, National Academy \nof Sciences working with the EPA.\n  I compromised on this point in my manager's amendment. The EPA may \nnow go ahead with its standard-setting regulations provided that they \ntake advantage of the best science available, and that the NRC in \nconsultation with the National Academy of Sciences and the EPA agree \nthat the standard is attainable.\n  Some suggest that the EPA cannot have the last word. That is not the \nintent. If we have to rephrase it, we will do it. The intent is \nauthority by statute to belong to the EPA, but clearly the best science \nshould include input from the National Academy of Sciences and the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  The fourth prerequisite: Operation of a repository fuel acceptance \nfacility key to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission authorization for the \npermanent repository in the year 2007, and a transportation system \nbased on the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant model, which is WIPP.\n  Those are the five principles that we outlined. Those are the \nprinciples that we worked on with the minority to try to achieve a \nconsensus.\n  I think the bill reflects significant concession by the supporters of \nthe past legislation. I believe this new approach still gives the DOE \nthe tools it needs. I still don't know why the administration seems so \npossessed, policy-wise, to oppose it. But that is what we have before \nus.\n  I conclude this portion of my statement by again identifying where I \nthink we are in the differences we have. That, again, is the radiation \nstandard.\n  As you heard me state time and time again, I think the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission is the appropriate determiner of that standard. \nBut the manager's amendment now contains new language that would permit \nthe EPA to go ahead as long as the National Academy and the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission are consulted. Obviously, that interest is a \nscience that will protect health, safety, and welfare. As to the \nobjective, it is most important that we have an objective of achieving \nthe radiation standard that is attainable.\n  This is a reasonable approach. It provides the best science after \npeer review. Yet it does allow EPA to ultimately complete the rule \nafter we have had the input of the best minds on the subject and have \nconsulted with one another.\n  If the EPA and the NRC cannot agree, then the EPA is not permitted, \nobviously, to adopt any rule until after June 1, 2001. But after June \n1, 2001, the EPA may go ahead and adopt a rule pursuant to existing \nauthority under section 801 of the Energy Policy Act.\n  Part of the problem with the EPA standard that was detailed in the \nproposed rules that came out last August was that it applied \nunrealistic standards to ground water. They proposed 4 millirems for \nground water. This is a standard that comes from the Safe Drinking \nWater Act, which I support.\n  This chart shows the levels of radiation. For those working in the \nCapitol, we get 80 millirems; anyone living in a brick house, 70 \nmillirems; annual exposure from cosmic radiation, 53 millirems; annual \naverage radiation from the ground, 26 millirems; x ray, 20 millirems; \ndental x ray, 14 millirems; round-trip flight from New York to Los \nAngeles, 6 millirems; exposure from a transport container carrying high \nlevel waste 6 feet away, 5 millirems. But the EPA proposal is 4 \nmillirems for the drinking water standard.\n  This chart shows the proposed site: 800 nuclear weapon tests over 50 \nyears. They are going to come down and propose a 5 millirem level; \nremember, 4 millirems is the level for drinking water.\n  Is that really in the interests of proceeding with this legislation \nor is it to set an unattainable standard? No one will drink the ground \nwater that comes from this site. I hope not.\n  The Safe Drinking Water Act should not be applied to ground water. \nHowever, if the water becomes tap water, the act should apply; but not \nwhile the water is in the ground. The EPA wants to take extremely low \nstandards that were designed to apply to drinking water out of a tap \nand apply to water in the ground, whether people drink it or not.\n  Let me be very clear. This dispute has nothing to do with a level of \nprotection for the people in Nevada. Whether or not the drinking water \nstandard is applied to ground water has nothing to do with how much \nadditional radiation, if any, Nevadans would be exposed to from the \nfacility. The EPA applied similar regulations to the WIPP Transuranic \nNuclear Waste Disposal Facility in New Mexico. The drinking water \nstandard was not an issue when WIPP was licensed by EPA because WIPP is \na salt mine. Obviously, there is no potable water around it. Maybe EPA \nthinks all nuclear waste should be disposed of in a salt cavity, but I \nam not sure everybody in the country or in this body would agree.\n  The National Academy of Sciences did not recommend that the Safe \nDrinking Water Act be applied to ground water. Instead, they addressed \n``requirements necessary to limit risks to individuals'' as required by \nlaw. In fact, the National Academy specifically said they don't make \nsuch a recommendation.\n  Finally, the National Academy concluded that the decision regarding \nthe acceptable level of risk for Yucca Mountain is a policy decision. \nWhat does that mean? That means a decision for Congress, not the \nscientists. In our legislation, we propose the best scientists come up \nwith a recommendation to EPA and EPA be part of that process. I think \nit is appropriate that Congress make a decision regarding the level of \nrisk.\n  Finally, the ultimate myth. I think everyone would agree, this \nadministration says it cares about clean air and preventing climate \nchange. Here is where our electricity comes from: 53 percent comes from \ncoal; 18 to 20 percent is nuclear; 14 percent is natural\n\n[[Page S474]]\n\ngas; 10 percent is hydroelectricity; the remaining few percent is oil, \nwind, and solar.\n  DOE's Energy Information Administration says the Kyoto treaty would \nrequire a 30-percent reduction of CO2 emissions from the predicted 2010 \nlevel.\n\n  How do we do this without nuclear power? We cannot get there from \nhere. There are no nuclear emission-free sources that can economically \ntake its place. For the moment, forget about the Kyoto treaty and think \nof the present.\n  This chart shows the emissions avoided from increased nuclear \ngeneration. This is a reduction in SO2 from nuclear power generation. \nFrom 1990 to 1995, 37 percent of the sulfur dioxide reductions required \nby the Clean Air Act came from increased generation from existing \nnuclear powerplants. That is where it came from. These were sulfide \nreductions.\n  Is that not ironic? They gave credit for the reductions to the \nnuclear plants. They don't have any emissions. That is where they get \nthe reductions. Clever. Even with nuclear power, it is difficult and \nexpensive to meet the new regs; without nuclear power it is impossible.\n  As this body addresses the broad obligation of reality, we have to \nfocus in on the difficulty we have. That is, that the nuclear industry \nis choking on its own waste. We have the responsibility to come up with \na solution.\n  This chart shows an overlay of nuclear plants in noncontainment \nareas. In fact, almost all nuclear plants are located in or near areas \nthat have significant air quality problems. What happens when the \nnonemitting sources are replaced with emitting sources--the only \nrealistic alternatives?\n  EPA can pass all the regulations in the world, but if the President \nand Vice President really did care about clean air, they would get \nbehind this bill. This contributes more to clean air than any possible \nthing we could do in the area of increasing dependence on hydrocarbons.\n  The administration has a policy: Delay and more delay, for the \nAmerican people who care for their safety, their environment, and their \npocketbook. Let's look at the pocketbook. The litigation goes on. The \n$15 billion has been paid by the ratepayers. The liability associated \nwith nonperformance to the contractual commitment, $40 to $80 billion, \nor $1,400 per family.\n  Is the President concerned about clean air, about climate change or \nis this some kind of a cynical diplomatic/political exercise? I don't \nknow. Previously, the administration said it objected to siting a \ntemporary storage facility before 1998 when the viability assessment \nfor Yucca Mountain would be completed. At that time, I said anyone who \nbelieves that the availability of the viability assessment will make \npassing legislation easier is out of touch with reality. I take no \npleasure in the fact that I was right. The reality is no one wants \nnuclear waste stored in their State. I am sensitive to that. I \nunderstand the position of my Nevada friends. However, we have it in 40 \nStates. Do we want to leave it there or put it in one area that has \nbeen determined to carry a repository for our high level waste?\n  At the committee hearing on S. 1287 in February, all four members of \nthe Nevada delegation stated that no level of scientific proof would \nlessen their objection to this project. Let me repeat that: All four \nmembers of the Nevada delegation stated that no level of scientific \nproof would lessen their opposition to this project. I understand that \nand I accept that. It doesn't make any difference what level of \nscientific proof is available, they are going to oppose it. A further \nreality is that this administration apparently will not support a \nsolution to this problem as long as the Nevada delegation opposes it. I \ncan understand that.\n  Let's call the shots as they really are. The ultimate reality is that \nthe Federal Government had an obligation to start taking the waste in \n1998 and it violated the sanctity of the contract. We have reached a \ncrossroad. The job of fixing this program is ours. Time for fixing the \nprogram is now. Much progress has been made at Yucca. Much money has \nbeen spent at Yucca. We can build on this progress.\n  The bill contains the tools that the Department of Energy needs to \nmake the permanent repository work. Every day we wait to move the fuel, \nthe liability of the American taxpayer increases. We can choose whether \nthe Nation needs 80 various storage sites in 40 States or just one: the \narid, remote, Nevada Test Site where we exploded scores of nuclear \nbombs during the cold war. Is that not the most safe and most remote \nlocation for nuclear waste storage? Over 800 nuclear tests were \nconducted at this site.\n\n  Mr. President, the time clearly is now. I note my colleagues from \nNevada are on the floor seeking recognition. I have taken a good deal \nof time and look forward to their statement. I am happy to respond, I \nmight add, to any questions they may pose. Obviously, we are going to \nbe on this for some time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, as is so often the case when it comes to \ndebating the various legislative proposals related to nuclear waste \nthat have been advanced since I have been a Member of the Senate, the \nissues generate more heat than light. With all due respect to the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, much of what he \nhad to say was utterly irrelevant to the situation we confront today. \nThe chairman would have us believe that unless this legislation is \nenacted, nothing will occur with respect to going forward and siting a \nhigh-level nuclear waste repository.\n  Let me be clear. The process that was used to select that site is one \nto which I am strongly opposed. But in reality, if this legislation \nnever leaves this Chamber--and it is my view it will never become law--\nthe process by which Yucca Mountain is to be studied--or the scientific \nterm, ``characterized''--goes forward. The time line that has been laid \nout is that sometime next year there will be a site recommendation; \nsometime in the year 2002 there will be an application for license; \nsometime thereafter there will be a construction authorization; and \nultimately licensure will be approved if, indeed, all of the scientific \nquestions that have been raised are satisfactorily resolved.\n  That is a process that began its course back in 1983. We continually \nrevert to the history of this process to illuminate those who have not \nfollowed it and lived with it as long as I and my fellow Nevadans have, \nto try to explain the context in which this debate is occurring.\n  In 1983, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was signed into law by \nPresident Reagan. It contemplated--and I must say I think the \nscientific approach was reasonable--that we would search the Nation; \nthat we would look for various kinds of geological formations in which \nhigh-level nuclear waste might be buried; that we would balance the \nburden, in terms of the storage of the nuclear waste, with some sense \nof regional equity. Three sites would be studied, or characterized, \nthose three sites would be presented to the President of the United \nStates, and the President would make that decision.\n  I was a newly elected Governor in 1983, and I believe the broad \noutline of that process, the approach, was reasonable; that is to say, \na national search would be conducted, and among the geological \nformations that were uppermost to be considered were granite formations \nin the northeastern part of the country, salt dome formations in the \nSoutheast, and in our part of the country the so-called welded tuff.\n  That was a piece of legislation that, by and large, sought to deal \nwith this issue. I think, to use the chairman's terminology, that was a \nresponsible approach. That was an inquiry that, although we in Nevada \nwere apprehensive about it because welded tuff was being considered, \nnevertheless represented science, it represented a fair approach, and \nit represented some regional balance and equity.\n  May I say, from that point on, what has occurred with respect to the \nsiting process should be referred to as an antiscience approach. It is \nblasphemy to discuss any kind of scientific orthodoxy in terms of what \nhas occurred. Let me remind my colleagues what occurred that in no \nsense of the word could be justified as in the interest of science.\n  Early on, some of my colleagues expressed concern they did not want \nit to go to the northeastern part of the country. I fully understand \nthat. That had nothing to do with science, everything to do with \npolitics. I have been in\n\n[[Page S475]]\n\nthe business a while. I understand that. And what occurred? The \nDepartment of Energy, in its own internal documentation, unilaterally \ndecided we ought not to look at the Northeast.\n\n  Was that science? Was that responsible? I think any person who had an \nassociate of arts degree in some area of science would conclude by no \nstandard could that be considered a scientific approach. It was \npolitics.\n  In the 1984 Presidential election, the issue came up as to those salt \ndome formations in the Southeast. What was said at that time? The \nPresident said: Look, not to worry, not to worry; we will not site it \nin a place where the salt dome formations are.\n  Does that have anything to do with science? Not even to look at it? \nTo, in effect, blind ourselves and say we ought not to look at the salt \ndome formation? We ought not to look at granite? Of course not. And no \nsensible person and no scientist worthy of being called a scientist \nwould ever assert for a moment that that had anything to do with \nscience. Was it responsible? Of course not. Was it political? Yes, \nindeed.\n  Then 1987 comes along, and a bill which shall live forever in the \ninfamy of congressional actions in our own State--the so-called ``Screw \nNevada'' bill. Let's call it what it is. Remember, I indicated the \noriginal legislation contemplated there would be three sites that would \nbe studied or characterized? What occurred in 1987?\n  In 1987, a decision was made to look only at one site, Yucca \nMountain--exclude any other consideration in any other region of the \ncountry. Was that science? Was that responsible? You do not have to \nhave a political science degree from Oxford to recognize that is \npolitics--politics, not science. So when I hear this great paean to \nscience and responsibility, I am compelled to revisit the history of \nthis process which has been corrupted and perverted in every stage in \nthe process where science ought to have prevailed. In every instance, \nit has been politics that prevailed.\n  So if I speak with some energy and if I speak with some anger, it is \nbecause we have been victimized, not by a scientific process but by a \npolitical process in which Nevada has been victimized, and I strongly \nobject to that as a Nevadan, as a citizen. I hope my colleagues will \nreflect in a broader sense that what has occurred to us could occur to \nthem in another context.\n  Having said that, the reality in which we deal today is that Yucca \nMountain is being considered. This process we have talked about, these \nmilestones, continues forward. So all this talk about nuclear waste \npiling up and responsibility, we have to do something--hopefully, we \nwill do the responsible thing; hopefully, we will do the scientifically \nprudent thing. But in no sense is this legislation necessary for this \nprocess. I do not like its origin, in terms of the ``Screw Nevada'' \nbill, but it is going forward. That is, currently, as we are debating \non the floor of the Senate, the steady process goes forward. The final \nenvironmental impact study is being finalized--not yet final.\n  Sometime late next year, we are going to have a site recommendation \nand sometime in the year 2002, or thereafter, an application for a \nlicense.\n  I say to my friends, no decision has been made at this point that, in \nfact, Yucca Mountain is suitable. That decision is yet to be made. \nHopefully, it will be made not in the political way in which other \ndecisions have been made, but it will be made in a scientific way.\n  The first thing I want to disabuse my colleagues of and those \nlistening is that somehow there is a compelling necessity to have this \npiece of legislation enacted, that if it is not enacted, somehow this \nprocess I have described to you will stop. That simply is not true. \nFrom a Nevada perspective, I am not happy with that process, but it is \ngoing forward and will continue to go forward.\n  Let me, as a sidebar, try to address the red herring that is raised \nevery time that somehow there is going to be some insurmountable \nproblem in providing onsite storage. That simply is not the case. Those \nutilities that need to provide additional onsite storage can do so in a \nmanner which is consistent with what the scientific community \nacknowledges, with a dry cask storage system, will be available.\n  In terms of dealing with the equities, about the ratepayers who have \npaid a lot of money, yes, they have paid a lot of money. That is not \nthe fault of people in my own State. That is part of a process which \nhas been very difficult, and I must say, rather ineptly handled by the \nDepartment of Energy over a number of years.\n  It is true, as the chairman pointed out, that 1998 was promised as \nthe date in which a permanent repository or a waste dump would be \nopened. We have passed 1998. It is now 2000. That permanent repository, \nthe dump at Yucca Mountain, will not, as I indicated in these \nguidelines, be available if ever--if ever--for some years to come.\n  Early on, as a new Member in the Senate, I recognized there was an \nequity argument, that to the extent ratepayers would have to pay for \nadditional storage as a result of the permanent waste dump not being \nopened in the year 1998, there ought to be some kind of relief and \ncompensation. I introduced legislation that said, in effect, to the \nextent that such delays occur, if they do, and if, indeed, as a result \nof those delays additional storage is required, the dry cask storage \nsystem is required, that whatever those expenses are ought to be \ndeducted from the amount of money the ratepayers are required to pay \ninto the nuclear waste fund. It strikes me as being fair.\n  That is where we begin to scratch the surface and find out that what \nis really involved in that kind of discussion is not fairness or \nequity, but the nuclear energy industry, through the Nuclear Energy \nInstitute, has a very different agenda because, incredibly, they oppose \nthat legislation.\n  Let me repeat that. For those who are listening who are ratepayers in \nStates that have nuclear utilities, I was prepared and remain prepared \ntoday and agree with those parts of the bill that provide such \ncompensation to any ratepayer who has been subjected to additional \nexpense as a result of the permanent waste dump not being available \nought to be compensated in some way, and the compensation should be \nreducing the amount of money the ratepayers are required to pay into \nthe nuclear waste fund by an amount equal to the expense they have \nincurred.\n  That is equity. That is fairness. Let me repeat, that is not what the \nnuclear industry is all about. They have no interest in that.\n\n  We have heard a good bit about responsibility and science. What we \nwant is the best science, we are told. I do not believe that is what \nthey want at all. Let me try to frame the issue and let me use the \nchairman's own words.\n  The chairman has said--and I appreciate his candor; we disagree very \nstrongly about this, but I want to make it clear to him and others that \nthis is not a matter of personal acrimony; it is a major policy \ndifference. This is what the chairman said in the last go-round we were \nabout to have. This is an article that appeared in the Las Vegas Sun, \nDecember 6, 1999:\n\n       What we want is to make sure that the measuring is under a \n     regulation that allows waste to go to Yucca.\n\n  ``What we want is to make sure that the measuring is under a \nregulation that allows waste to go to Yucca.''\n  Not one word is expressed about public health and public safety, and \nthat is precisely what they want. As my colleagues know, I will not be \na Member of this august body this time next year, but I predict that if \nthe nuclear utilities feel they need more legislation, they will be \nattempting to reduce the standards further.\n  S. 1287, which is the vehicle we are debating, as it came out of \ncommittee had these kinds of standards. Let's talk about that because \nthat is pretty important for our consideration.\n  S. 1287 provided that 30 millirems per year would be the authorized \ndosage each individual can receive. For most of us who are not \nscientists--and I acknowledge that I am not--I do not know that I would \nrecognize a millirem if I ran into one. Suffice it to say that \nmillirems are the way in which we measure radioactivity, radioactive \nexposure. We all know that.\n  Many of us who are getting a bit long in the tooth--and I exempt the \ndistinguished occupant of the Chair from that categorization--can \nremember in our youth when we would go to the shoe store and there \nwould be a little fluoroscope there. Your mom would be there, and that \nfluoroscope would flash\n\n[[Page S476]]\n\non and your bones in your feet would be exposed. The shoe salesman \nwould say: I think those are the right size for Richard because he can \nmove his toes freely.\n  As a kid, I revelled in it because I could see my feet--exposure, \nradioactivity. Do we do this today? The distinguished occupant of the \nChair and I not only are parents but grandparents and are proud of that \nfact and are interested in their health and safety. That was abandoned \na generation ago. Why? Because there are risks involved.\n  In less than a decade after Roentgen developed the x ray, there had \nbeen a fatality. That process indicates that radiation poses some very \nreal risks to human health and safety. The experience in my own \nlifetime has been that, by and large, those standards are tight. We do \nnot have fluoroscopes for fitting shoes on youngsters or adults, there \nis a constant effort to reduce the amount of exposure, and x rays we \nget when we go to the dentist are much less invasive than they were a \ngeneration ago. Why? Because the cumulative impact of all of that has a \nprofound impact on health and safety.\n  We are not talking about some theoretical concern that might happen. \nThat is the experience of more than a century, and although not \ncompletely applicable to this piece of legislation, we now know that \nworkers who were a part of the nuclear industrial development that made \nit possible for us to produce the atomic weapons upon which our \nsecurity has been predicated for more than half a century, the \nDepartment of Energy now acknowledges they were exposed to radiation \nand their health has been potentially impacted. They have acknowledged \nthat for the first time decades later.\n  We are talking about something that can have a profound, even a \npotentially deadly impact. Yet our friends in the Nuclear Energy \nInstitute and their allies shoehorn the standard so that it fits Yucca \nMountain, irrespective of what good scientists say about health and \nsafety.\n  Does that make me angry? You bet it does. Any parent, any \ngrandparent, any responsible citizen should be absolutely appalled at \nthe notion that this is being politicized, and it is. I will have more \nto say about that.\n  In 1983, the year the legislation was signed into law by President \nReagan, the Environmental Protection Agency was established as the \nindividual Federal agency to set the standard. Nobody challenged that.\n  In my first 6 years in the Senate, we had a decision with respect to \nthe WIPP facility, a nuclear repository dealing with transuranic waste \nlocated in the State of New Mexico.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency set the standard. What was the \nstandard they set? It was 15 millirems. Was there an objection from the \nnuclear industry? No. Was there a contention that somehow this was an \noutrageous and unreasonable standard? Was it suggested somehow this was \nwild science? No. It was set at 15 millirems.\n  At about that time, however, the nuclear energy crowd's interest in \nlocating a high-level waste dump in our State began to be a little \nfretful. Could Yucca Mountain, which was developing a number of \nproblems--a question of seismic activity, a question of volcanic \nactivity, a question in terms of water table or thermoloads that were \ngreater than expected, an earthquake which visited the site and created \nsome damage--all of this began.\n  So in the energy bill of 1992--never debated on the floor of the \nSenate or the House--that was going forward, all of a sudden a \nprovision was inserted into the bill that sought in some way to maybe \nbracket or to limit the EPA in setting the standard. In effect, what \nwas requested was that the National Academy of Sciences ought to take a \nlook and see if whatever the Environmental Protection Agency came up \nwith, to use a metaphor from the street, was in the ballpark: Are they \nbeing reasonable?\n  That was the first assault upon the EPA and its standard-setting \ncapability advocated by the proponents of the high-level nuclear waste \ndump at Yucca Mountain. This was not something the Senators from Nevada \nand those of us who have been concerned about health and safety \nadvocated. This was what the nuclear utilities argued for.\n  Let's go over the verdict. What was the cycle? The National Academy \nof Sciences did, in fact, take a look at the EPA standard that was \nproposed for us at Yucca Mountain. The EPA standard: 15 millirems, the \nsame as WIPP. Pretty reasonable.\n  The National Academy of Sciences, in looking at that standard, said: \nWe think the standard with respect to the milliremic exposure rate per \nperson per year is somewhere between 2 and 20. We think that is the \nrange.\n  So those are the brackets you see there on the chart: 2 and 20. \nFrankly, the EPA came right down in the middle. For those of us in \nNevada, we would much prefer that they would be at 2 or 5 or 10 \nmillirems. But it was set at 15. It was consistent with what had been \ndone in WIPP.\n  Let's talk about the agenda. What does the nuclear utility crowd \nwant? They don't want the 15-millirem standard. That is science. What \nthey want to do is to game the system--to, in effect, shoehorn in any \nkind of a standard that makes it possible for them to dump nuclear \nwaste in Nevada.\n  Their most recent iteration of this is S. 1287, the underlying \nvehicle, although the substitute amendment we are debating does have \nsome changes. I want to make that clear for the record.\n  What did they propose? Thirty millirems--twice as much. A moment ago, \nI stated it is my belief that next year, the year thereafter, we get to \n2002, and all of a sudden they will say: Look, we can't build that site \nwith a 30-millirem standard. They would be rushing onto the floor of \nthe Senate, as they have year after year, to say: Look, we need a \nstandard that allows an exposure rate of 60 millirems, or 90 millirems, \nor 100 millirems--whatever it takes.\n\n  That is the underlying basis for this statement right here. This \nreflects the policy: What we want is to make sure that the measuring is \nunder a regulation that allows waste to go to Yucca. There is not one \nreference to health, to safety, or to science. The shorthand view is: \nLook, whatever it takes to get it there, devil be whatever the \nstandards will be, that is what we want.\n  That is the risk we have. That is not responsible. I exhort my \ncolleagues to be responsible. That is not scientific. I urge my \ncolleagues to be scientific. That is not scientific.\n  Why should there be a different standard set for WIPP than there is \nfor Yucca? Why? Why is that necessary? No objection was raised to the \nWIPP standard. Why shouldn't it be the same? Logically, the EPA reached \nthe scientific conclusion that it should be the same.\n  The National Academy of Sciences--and there is nobody in Nevada who \nwas part of that review process--said: Look, that is within the \nrecommended range; that is fair. But fairness and science and \nresponsibility is not what this bill is all about. Any fair-minded \nperson would look at this and understand that it has a political \novertone.\n  In the last few days, the process has been extremely frustrating. On \nFriday, we received two different versions of the substitute. By 4:45 \non Friday afternoon, we had received the version that has been offered \ntoday.\n  Based upon that version, here is what we know: The EPA strenuously \nobjects to the language as it relates to standards that are in the \ndraft before us today. The Council of Environmental Quality strongly \nobjects to that standard as set forth in the substitute. And the \nPresident of the United States has indicated he will veto such \nlegislation if, indeed, the bill in that form reaches his desk.\n  This Statement of Administration Policy is dated February 8, 2000:\n\n       The Administration has reviewed a February 4, 2000, \n     manager's amendment to S. 1287--\n\n  That is the substitute we are talking about now--\n\n     and understands that this amendment will be brought to the \n     Senate floor.\n\n  Indeed, it has and is what we are debating.\n\n       Unfortunately, this amendment undermines EPA's existing \n     statutory authority to set standards to protect public health \n     and the environment from radioactive releases; therefore, it \n     is unacceptable to the Administration. Although the amendment \n     appears to allow EPA to exercise its existing authority to \n     set appropriate radiation release standards for the Yucca \n     Mountain repository, it will allow another entity to block \n     EPA's authority until June 1, 2001.\n\n\n[[Page S477]]\n\n\n  This may not be readily apparent to everyone, but the thrust of this \nnew language would be to strip the EPA of the authority to promulgate, \nin final form, this 15-millirem standard and kick it over until next \nyear. Why? Why would they do that? Is that science? Is there some \nscientific reason for that? No.\n  This rule has been in the gestation process since the early 1980s.\n  It has been out for public comment, which is certainly appropriate--\nthose who criticize it or support it make recommended changes to it; \nall of that has occurred. That is part of the process. That is not only \ngood science but it is responsible public policy. Is it responsible to \nsuggest that? No.\n  What is involved? Well, as we all know--and I must say it has begun \nfar too early for most of us, even those of us who have had a lifelong \nfascination with politics--this is about Presidential election \npolitics. We are going to have a new President next year. President \nClinton is constitutionally precluded from succeeding himself. We all \nknow that we are going to have a new President. So this is a political, \ncynical effort to deprive EPA of the authority to do its job in \naccordance with science and in a responsible fashion, and to inject \nwhat into the process? Politics. That began in 1983 with the Northeast \nbeing taken out of the dialog, and in 1984 with the salt dome \nformations in the Southeast being taken out in 1987--if we look at the \none-site and put-all-the-nuclear-eggs-in-one-basket approach.\n  Again--it should come as no surprise to those who have followed the \nprocess--we have politics as usual. Kick this into next year, to a new \nPresident who may take a less protective view of health and public \nsafety and responsibility and take a different approach. That is what \nwe are being asked to do.\n  This draft is replete with politics. Let me mention one of these \nprovisions to give you an idea. This draft has no more to do with \nscience or public responsibility; this is a political instrument; this \nis a political deal. Let's be honest about it. What do we have here? We \nhave a little sentence that talks about transportation. Let me say that \nthe concerns about transportation, shipping 77,000 metric tons of high-\nlevel nuclear waste on the interstate highway systems in America, on \nthe rail transportation corridors of America, that will go through 43 \nStates, 51 million Americans live within a mile or less. So lest those \nof you who may be observing this debate are thinking this only affects \nthe good people of Nevada, let me assure you that your backyard can be \naffected, as well as your church and schools that may lie within that \nmile or less of the Interstate Highway System or rail.\n  In looking at what those routes might be, one would think we ought to \ntry to take the safest, most direct route. But no, no, we have politics \nin this. We are told we should avoid highways with downgrades of more \nthan 7 percent. I know why that was put in there. He is a very good \nfriend of mine, but the able Senator from Colorado, who voted with us \nlast year in opposing this ill-conceived attempt--this is an attempt to \nacquire his support. I do not criticize him for it. He is trying to \nprotect his State. I offer no criticism. But that is the cynicism that \nis involved. No science. No public responsibility. This is politics.\n  Now, look, I happen to love politics. It has been a lifetime of mine. \nI am proud of my involvement. I have had experience at the local level \nand the State level, and I am proud to have been a Member of this \naugust body. This is my twelfth year. So I do not shirk from or blanch \nat the thought that we are talking about political issues and public \npolicy. That is why I came to the Senate. This is why I have devoted my \ncareer in public service to policy formation. But this is not public \npolicy; this is public cynicism. That is what this is all about. We \nought to reject this.\n\n  So I guess I will simply return to the premise I began with, which \nis, is this piece of legislation necessary? The answer is no. If this \nlegislation fails to be enacted into law, does it in any way impede the \nprocess occurring at Yucca Mountain? The answer is no. Parenthetically, \nI wish it did. But it does not impede it. That process goes forward. \nDoes it do anything with respect to these guidelines in the sense of \nwhen the decisions are going to be made in the year 2001 and site \nrecommendations? Does it deal with that guideline or the site \napplication for licensure process? No. That all goes forward. That is \nin the law now and that is part of the planning process. It is not \nnecessary. It is totally unnecessary.\n  What we are talking about is a very artful attempt to circumvent the \nprocess in which good science and good public policy ought to be used \nin making these decisions. That will not be allowed to happen in this \npiece of legislation in this form.\n  This is a moving target. I am talking about the substitute before us \ntoday. I alluded a bit ago to the frustration I have. This piece of \nlegislation affects my State more than any other State, although--let \nme be clear--43 States will be affected by the transportation \ncorridors. Yet we have largely been in the dark in terms of what kind \nof a substitute amendment we might face.\n  Friday afternoon, we received the version that we are debating today. \nWe are prepared to debate it. We are prepared to accept the President's \nveto, the support of all the environmental community, support of the \nEPA and Council on Environmental Quality, and all those charged with \nthat responsibility. We are prepared.\n  As we speak, a new substitute is being worked up. Whether or not \nthere will be agreement, we don't know. Perhaps some of these comments, \nin the context of the new substitute, may have to be modified. But that \nis a sense of frustration I share with colleagues. Imagine, if you \nwill, something that was particular to your own State, and the \nnegotiations affecting your State excluded you from the process. And \nyou kind of waited with bated breath each morning. You have a proposal; \ncan we see it? What is it going to be? That, Mr. President, is where we \nin Nevada have been.\n  I am deeply offended by that process. I was not sent to Washington by \nthe people whom I represent to sit on the sidelines and be that potted \nplant somewhere in the back part of the Senate Chamber. I want to know \nwhat is going to happen because I know from bitter experience that good \nscience and good public policy have absolutely nothing to do with the \nway this process has been implemented since its earlier auspicious \nbeginning in January of 1983.\n  So I recognize in these kinds of debates, I am sad to say, that \nunlike the days when the giants of the Senate took the floor and we saw \neach other and debated back and forth, that is not the way the process \nworks. I understand that, in numbers, we are no match for the phalanx \nof lobbyists from the nuclear utilities. We do not have their financial \nresources; I acknowledge that. All we have is our honor, our integrity, \nand what is good science and public responsibility.\n  I hope that argument will prevail because it ought to be the way we \nin this Chamber make the decision. It ought to be the process by which \nevery piece of legislation is dealt with on the floor of the Senate and \nin its various standing committees. We are here debating the \nsubstitute. We will wait and see what other pieces of legislation there \nmight be. But I implore my colleagues to look at this carefully and \nunderstand what is coming about. This is not necessary. It is not \nscience. It is simply not responsible public policy.\n  I urge you to oppose this legislation.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I have been coming to the \nfloor every day because of a commitment I made. I will just take a \ncouple of minutes on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in a postcloture situation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/08/senate-section/article/S478-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S478]]\n                         CAPITOL HILL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I have been speaking \nabout the security of the Capitol Hill police. I made a commitment to \nmyself, much less to others, that I would continue to speak on it. I \nalways start with the service for Officers Chestnut and Gibson and a \ncommitment I am absolutely sure we made to the Capitol Hill police that \nwe would do everything possible to assure security for them, much less \nthe public.\n  One of the things we have to do--and we have to do it today; if not \ntoday, tomorrow; but I don't think we should let time go by--is make \nwhatever kind of policy change and whatever kind of commitment of \nresources need to be made to assure that at every post there are two \nofficers.\n  Again, a lot of the posts have many people entering. If there is one \nofficer with lots of people coming through a door and, God forbid, \nsomebody deranged enters with the intention of committing an act of \nviolence, it would be very difficult for that single officer to deal \nwith such a person.\n  I again call on all Members to do better by these police officers and \nto live up to this commitment. I am sure Republicans and Democrats all \nagree, but I will focus on this until I am sure we have followed \nthrough on a commitment we made because I don't think we have followed \nthrough on it yet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/08/senate-section/article/S478-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                CHECHNYA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, yesterday I met with members of the \nChechen Government. They discussed the horrific conditions currently \nfacing their homeland. It is clear that the Russian Government must \nmove to immediately allow into Chechnya and neighboring Ingushetia an \ninternational monitoring force to monitor and report on the \nhumanitarian situation. It must also immediately move to assist those \npersons who have been displaced from Chechnya as a result of this \nconflict and to allow representatives of the international community \naccess to those persons in order to provide humanitarian relief.\n  As many of you know, the Russian assault on the Chechen capital \nGrozny is only one more campaign in a long series of Russian military \noffensives in Chechnya. In September I expressed my concerns to Boris \nYeltsin and Putin about the humanitarian tragedy that was--for the \nsecond time--unfolding in Chechnya. It is hard to imagine that after \nthe use of force in Chechnya from 1994-1996--which left over 80,000 \ncivilians dead--the Russian leadership could again see the use of force \nas enhancing the prospects for a durable settlement to this conflict. \nNonetheless, the Russian leadership has again chosen to use force and \nthe current tragedy has now reached unimaginable heights.\n  Russian forces have used indiscriminate and disproportionate force in \ntheir bombings of civilian targets. This has resulted in the deaths of \nthousands of innocent civilians and displaced over 200,000 others. But \nthe suffering is not limited to Chechnya. The neighboring province of \nIngushetia has been flooded with refugees. Mr. President, I remind you \nof the recent snow storm that swept the east coast. I need not remind \nyou of how it compares to a Russian winter. A humanitarian crisis equal \nto that within Chechnya itself is beginning in Ingushetia.\n  I implore President Putin to hold firm to his commitment made to the \nCouncil of Europe Parliamentary Assembly Group last month to allow into \nIngushetia an international monitoring presence to determine what is \nhappening--to determine the best means of getting some immediate relief \nto the refugees and those trapped in Chechnya. And I urge the Russian \nGovernment to lift its press restrictions so that the citizens of the \nRussian Federation see the truth for what it is. For there is no doubt \nthat if the people knew the full story of human suffering in Chechnya--\non both sides of the conflcit--they would devote every effort to its \npeaceful resolution.\n  Russian authorities maintain a virtual ban on access to Chechnya by \ninternational and local journalists. Groups--such as the Soldiers' \nMothers Committee can only monitor Russian casualties through their own \nsources, through word of mouth, and struggle to determine the fate of \ntheir sons in Chechnya. In the past few weeks Russia's main commercial \ntelevision station was kicked out of the military's journalist pool for \nshowing an interview with a Russian military officer describing troop \nlosses, and Russian officials arrested Andrei Babitsky, a 10-year-\nveteran reporter for the U.S.-sponsored Radio Liberty, who had been \nreporting from the capital Grozny. The Russian Government then \nexchanged the journalist for Russian soldiers held by Chechen rebels \nyet as of today, the journalist has not been seen or hear from.\n  The stories of the refugees fleeing Chechnya are horrific: incidents \nof widespread looting, summary executions, detentions, and rape.\n\n  Three weeks ago the Russian Commander for the North Caucasus Group of \nForces blamed Russian ``mistakes'' on their ``soft-heartedness.'' He \nthen ordered that only children under 10, men over 60, and girls and \nwomen would be considered refugees. Although the order was eventually \nrepealed, teenage boys and civilian men had been in effect sentenced to \ndie. Orders such as these are intolerable and must be condemned. It is \nfundamentally unacceptable to deny any civilian the right to flee the \nfighting--to trap them in this dangerous war. And where will these \ntrapped civilians go? Into detention camps? No one needs to be reminded \nof the systematic torture that took place in detention camps set up to \ndetail Chechens in the 1994-96 Chechen war. That event stains the \nmemory of the Chechen people--and its happening again. Today adolescent \nboys are being ripped from their mothers arms at the border as they try \nto escape. Mothers remain in the war zone because they refuse to leave \nwithout their sons.\n  Zura, a mother of three, told human rights monitors at the border \nthat guards prevented a 59-year-old man from crossing over, and that \ntwo boys, aged 12 and 13, made it past border guards only by concealing \nthemselves on the bus. Russian leadership are obligated under \nhumanitarian law to do everything to avoid civilian casualties and \nallow civilians to flee to safety.\n  Then there are the numerous reports of rape. In the Chechen town of \nShali a six-months pregnant 23-year-old woman was raped and murdered. \nHer mother-in-law was executed in the same incident. And Mr. President, \nmany incidents of rape and sexual abuse go unreported. For many women \nin towns and villages all over Chechnya the shame is simply too great--\nthey won't come forward to report these horrible crimes. Chechnya's \nculture and national traditions made it difficult to document cases of \nrape and sexual abuse--unmarried women who are raped are unlikely to be \nable to get married, and married women who are raped are likely to be \ndivorced by their husbands. The effects of these rapes on Chechen \nsociety will be profound and long lasting. I remind the Russian \nleadership that rape is war crime.\n  President Putin must move quickly to resolve this situation in a \nmanner consistent with Russia's obligations to the international \ncommunity. I urge my colleagues to join me in full condemnation of the \nuse of indiscriminate force against the civilians in Chechnya and to \nremind the Russian leadership that the world is watching. The Russian \nGovernment must move to immediately allow into Chechnya and Ingushetia \nan international monitoring force to determine what is happening. It \nmust immediately move to assist those persons who have been displaced \nfrom Chechnya as a result of this conflict and to allow representatives \nof the international community access to those persons in order to \nprovide humanitarian relief. And the Russian leadership must begin now \nto investigate and prosecute those responsible for human rights abuses \nin Chechnya--it promised to do this after the last Chechen War but \nfailed to do so. Those responsible for human rights abuses in Chechnya \nmust be held accountable.\n  President Putin must end this conflict and must devote every effort, \nincluding the acceptance of third party mediation offers made months \nago by the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe, to its peaceful resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/08/senate-section/article/S478-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S478-S479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have not read his article today in \nthe\n\n[[Page S479]]\n\nNew York Times, but I congratulate former Secretary Robert Reich for a \npiece he wrote. I have only had it summarized, but he raises questions \nabout this budget the President submitted. Without having even read the \npiece, I think I understand his framework.\n  I say to the administration and to Democrats, I find a little \nunbelievable, with the economy booming and such flush economic times, \nwhen one actually looks ahead over the next decade, the nonmilitary \ndiscretionary spending and where we are going to be making cuts. I hear \nthe Democrats talking about how we will reduce the debt, but I hear \nprecious little about the investment.\n  What I worry about is a disconnect between the words we speak and the \nbudgets we present. The President said he had a budget that was all \nabout making sure there would be health care coverage for every \ncitizen, that he had a budget which would be about ending child poverty \nin America, that he had a budget which would be about making sure every \nchild would come to kindergarten ready and able to learn, that he had a \nbudget which would provide economic security for senior citizens. But \nlooking at the investment in this budget, it is not there. I worry \nabout that.\n  I think one of the reasons people become disillusioned is that they \nthink they will make a difference. I gave an example today at our \nluncheon meeting. My parents both had Parkinson's disease. We hear \ndiscussion that there will be economic security for senior citizens, \nthere will be a commitment to long-term care, and then we see a tax \ncredit that amounts to a particular amount of money; maybe for an \nindividual family it would be $2,000 a year. For a family faced with \nlong-term care needs, trying to figure out a way of staying at home and \nto have people help one stay at home, $2,000 a year is not going to do \nit. It is not going to even come close.\n  I am troubled sometimes to hear my Senate colleagues, whom I love, \ntaking the position that discretionary spending is actually staying \nbelow the cost of living. We are really keeping it down. We are adding \nno new dollars.\n\n  But why is that good if, in the first place, some of our spending--I \nwill say that, or investment--is inadequate? We should be a major \nplayer in pre-K, pre-kindergarten. That is where the Federal Government \ncan make the biggest difference, getting the money and the resources \ndown to the communities and neighborhoods so we can make a commitment \nto early childhood development, so we can make sure the men and women \nwho want to work in this field are professionals who get decent \nsalaries, rather than getting paid $7 an hour with no health care \nbenefits; making sure families can afford this if both parents work or \na single parent works; making sure this child care is not custodial but \nit is developmental and really helps children. We are going to have to \nspend a lot of money. It cannot be done on the cheap.\n  We are going to have to dig into our pockets and make an investment. \nWith all due respect, I appreciate some money for refundable child care \ntax credits, but when I look at this overall budget, the investment is \nnot there. I am glad we are putting more money into Head Start, but we \nare not putting in anywhere near enough money to make sure every child \nwho could benefit from Head Start will be able to benefit. We are \ncertainly not putting the investment into affordable child care.\n  I would argue the most important national goal for our country would \nbe to make sure all children--no matter income or color of skin or \nrural or urban or boy or girl, by the time they go to kindergarten, \nthrough a combination of public sector investment, private sector help, \nvolunteers--have been read to widely, all these children know the \nalphabet and know colors and shapes and sizes, and they know how to \nspell their name and they have been challenged and there have been \npeople to nurture them and to support them.\n  We are not doing that. So I say to the Chair--he is a Republican--I \nam actually being more critical of Democrats. I am starting to think \nthe policy debate goes like this. Republicans say when it comes to the \nmost pressing issues of working families' lives, like affordable child \ncare, the President says we want health care coverage for citizens--but \nthis budget does not provide that. It does not take us anywhere near \nuniversal health care coverage. So Republicans say universal health \ncare coverage, affordable child care, investment in children--listen, \nwhen it comes to these issues, there is not that much the Government \ncan or should do.\n  I understand that. That is a legitimate ideology or point of view. \nAlthough, frankly, I think it works best for people who own their own \nlarge corporations and are wealthy. I don't think it works for most of \nthe people.\n  The President says: No, we care about children. We are going to \ninvest in children. We are going to have universal health care \ncoverage. We are going to have economic security for the elderly. We \nare going to make sure no child is in poverty. But then what we say is: \nBut, politically, we cannot make the investment because then it will \nlook as if we are spending too much. In which case, frankly, the \ndifferences between the two parties don't make a heck of a lot of \ndifference to a lot of our most vulnerable citizens.\n  So I wanted to come to the floor, first of all, to congratulate \nformer Secretary Bob Reich for raising questions about the priorities \nof the President's budget and all the money that is being put into debt \nreduction. You can and should put some money into debt reduction. But \ndo you know what else? It would seem to me we also want to make sure we \ndo well for children right now. In the next century, we are going to be \nasking them to carry an awful lot on their shoulders. We know there are \na lot of children we are not doing very well by. My question is, in the \nwords of Rabbi Hillel, his third century admonition: ``If not now, \nwhen?''\n  If we Democrats do not start speaking up for children and talk about \nthe need to invest in children and to invest in pre-K and get it right \nby way of developmental child care--which should be huge, it should be \nall over the country and there should be resources--if we do not speak \nup for children, Democrats, and for investment in early childhood \neducation, then who will?\n  ``If not now, when?''\n  I think I have run out of time.

Before the Senator from Minnesota leaves the floor, I would \nlike to have a brief colloquy with the Senator.\n  I say to my friend, I have watched very closely your public statement \nregarding law enforcement on Capitol Hill. I want to be as direct and \nforthright as I can be in underscoring the work you have done. I think \nI am the only U.S. Senator who has served as a Capitol policeman. I \nworked, when I went to law school, on the night shift and went to law \nschool in the daytime. I think I have some familiarity with what the \nCapitol Police go through.\n  I have to acknowledge and admit the work they do today, compared to \nwhen I was a Capitol policeman more than 30 years ago, is much more \ndangerous, much more terrorist threatened. They face many more dangers \nthan I have. I said on many occasions the most dangerous assignment I \nhad was directing traffic. But the fact of the matter is, I carried a \ngun and was responsible for maintaining the safety and security of the \nU.S. Capitol. I am very proud of that. I still have my badge that I \ncarried. I still have that in my office in the Hart Building.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has recognized that these men and women \nwork in harm's way every day. What the Senator from Minnesota has \nstated is when we have these doors, and these men and women are there \nalone, it is dangerous. Two of our law enforcement officers were killed \nas a result of a terrorist act, the act of a madman. I think the people \nwho maintain the Capitol Police should come to us. We are in an \nappropriations cycle. If they need more money, let them tell us they \nneed more money. We are in a period of time where we need to get the \nreal facts.\n  I say also to my friend from Minnesota, I am very concerned we have \nwaited all these many years and we still do not have a visitors center.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. We have taxpaying people who come to the U.S. Capitol and \nspend hours standing in the cold and the heat waiting to get in, \nwithout the opportunity to use a bathroom. There are no\n\n[[Page S480]]\n\nparking facilities around here, so they have all had to walk or take \npublic transportation for a long period of time.\n  I think it is below the dignity of the United States of America that \npeople wanting to visit this beautiful Capitol do not have a place \nwhere they can come and have a soft drink, a cup of coffee, a doughnut, \nor go to the bathroom. That is also a law enforcement issue. One of the \nreasons these Capitol policemen who protect us and the American public \nare threatened every day is because we don't have a visitors center \nwhere people can be screened, away from these doors.\n  So I commend, I applaud the Senator from Minnesota for standing up \nfor the American public and basically standing up for these people who \nhave no voice, the Capitol Police who protect us.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I might respond to my colleague, I \nappreciate his words. I think he is right. Senator Reid from Nevada is \nactually the only Senator who actually served on the Capitol Police.\n  I think on the question of appropriations, you are right. This is \ntimely. My own view is the police have a union so they do have a voice. \nThis is, of course, new. I think the union leadership is very involved. \nI also say Sergeant at Arms Zeiglar has been very good about this and \nhe thinks this is unacceptable and has to change. I don't think there \nis any question, whether it is an appropriations matter or whether it \nis reprogramming and having enough overtime pay so people can staff up \nthat way, I don't know the answer. But I do know this, I think my \ncolleague would agree, I don't believe any Senator or Representative \ncan credibly say to the Capitol Hill police, these law enforcement \nofficers: No, we can't spend the additional resources. It costs too \nmuch to make sure there is the security for them and the public. We \ncannot say that.\n  My God, we have gone through a living hell here. If you think of \nOfficer Chestnut and think of Agent Gibson and think of their families, \nI think the commitment we made to one another--of course you could \nnever come up with a 100-percent certainty that you could prevent this \nfrom happening again. But we want to do everything we can.\n  I appreciate what the Senator from Nevada said because it is true. \nWhen you have these posts, especially when there are lots of people \ncoming in, you cannot have one officer there. I appreciate the Senator \nfrom Nevada speaking out on this. The Capitol Police--I did not expect \nit necessarily would be this way, but everywhere I have gone the last \ncouple of days people have come up and been very gracious and said: \nThank you very much for doing it.\n  I think they feel in their hearts that it is important to get the \nsupport. For the Senator from Nevada to come out here and speak makes a \nbig difference. I thank him.\n  Mr. REID. If I may also say to my friend before he leaves the \nChamber, I hope it is more than just talk. I acknowledge Mr. Ziglar is \ndoing a wonderful job, and I appreciate that. But I want him to come \nforward with a program to accomplish what we need accomplished. After \nthe two officers were murdered at a door coming into the Capitol, \nprotecting us, there was a hue and cry that we had to start \nconstruction of a visitor's center.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Isn't it interesting, the colder they get in their graves, \nthe less talk there is about trying to take care of that problem. Had \nit been there, their lives would not have been snuffed out.\n  I am so appreciative of the Senator speaking out for people who have \nno voice.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/08/senate-section/article/S480-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S480-S482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1999--Continued\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the matter before the \nSenate today is the amendments to the Nuclear Policy Act of 1999; is \nthat the matter we are on?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I was a young man, I used to box. I \nfought in the ring. I can remember as a 20-year-old, I thought I was in \npretty good shape. I weighed 160 pounds or thereabouts. I had trained \nfor a fight near the place where they were building the Glen Canyon \nDam, which forms Lake Powell. I was ready to go and had trained for \nthis fight. I arrived there and was told the opponent was not going to \nfight, so I would not be able to fight that night. I was very \ndisappointed.\n  A manager came out and said: We have somebody here who could fight \nyou, but he has no experience. I know how badly you would like to \nfight, so if you agree to kind of take it easy on him, I will go ahead \nand let him fight. He is a little bigger than you are, but I am sure \neverything will be fine if you take it easy on him.\n  Mr. President, he worked me over really good. It was one of the worst \nbeatings I ever took. It was the first time I had ever had broken ribs \nfrom a fight.\n  The reason I mention this story is, I have learned since then that if \nyou are going to have a fight, you have to know the rules, you have to \nknow whom you are fighting. Ever since then, I have never gotten into a \nfight unless I pretty well understood who the opponent was.\n  With the matter now before the Senate, I am having some difficulty \nfinding out who the opponent is. We had been told there was going to be \nan amendment last Friday. We got an amendment last Friday, but it was \nnot the one we thought it was going to be.\n  I say to everyone within the sound of my voice, whatever happens in \nthe Senate these next few days on the matter that is now before the \nSenate, S. 1287, it is not the bill that directs nuclear waste to go to \nthe State of Nevada. If nothing happens in this Chamber regarding S. \n1287, as we speak, there is characterization taking place at Yucca \nMountain to determine if, in fact, Yucca Mountain is suitable for a \nnuclear repository. At a time subsequent, the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission will make a determination as to whether or not Yucca \nMountain is suitable to be licensed.\n  It does not matter what we do today, tomorrow, the next day, or \nwhenever we finish S. 1287. Characterization is still taking place; the \ndecision on licensing the site is up to the NRC.\n  What is happening in S. 1287 is the same thing that has happened in \nthe last 4 or 5 years with interim storage. The very powerful nuclear \nindustry wants to short-circuit the system, wants to do an end run \naround the system, wants to speed up the disposal of nuclear waste. \nGood sense dictated, and the President of the United States said he \nwould veto the interim storage bill.\n  As a result, interim storage is no longer an issue we are debating, \nfor that I am very grateful. I appreciate the chairman of the full \ncommittee taking another approach. That approach is S. 1287. I say to \neveryone in the Senate and others within the sound of my voice that S. \n1287, unfortunately, is still an attempt to short-circuit the system. \nIt is not the mass outage that interim storage would have caused, but \nit is still a short-circuit.\n  What does this bill do? Originally, the main purpose was to take the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency out of the business of setting \nstandards for radiation at Yucca Mountain. Again, the President issued \na veto statement and said: If that is in there, I am going to veto this \nbill.\n  There have been conversations between the chairman and the ranking \nmember that that is going to be taken out of the legislation and EPA \nwill still be in the driver's seat. We were told just the other day one \nof the standards in it was, you could not take nuclear waste through \nColorado. We understand that may be taken out of the bill.\n  The point I am making is this, we do not yet know what the vehicle \nis. We do not yet know whom we are going to be fighting. By the way, \nthe man I fought in Kanab, Utah was named\n\n[[Page S481]]\n\nSwaderski. I never forget that name. I do not know if this is a \nSwaderski or it is something else. Until the Senators from Nevada and \nthe rest of the Senate have an idea of what is going to be the vehicle \nwe are going to be debating, what the amendment is, we are at a real \nloss as to how we should proceed.\n  We have other problems with S. 1287, but the main problem is with the \nnuclear radiation standards we have talked about.\n  There are all kinds of things which at the right time we can talk \nabout in some detail--about radiation protection, what the standard \nshould be. What we have not talked about at all, and which we certainly \nneed to talk about, is not only the radiation standard generally, but a \nradiation standard for children.\n  For example, I did a lot of work on lead abatement. Lead in the \nenvironment is dangerous to adults, but not as dangerous and it is \ndisastrous to children. Little children's nervous systems cannot take \nlead. Most of the work we did with lead abatement was directed toward \nchildren.\n  As with lead, radiation more drastically affects children than it \ndoes adults, and this is something about which we will have the \nopportunity to speak at a subsequent time--the risk to children.\n  We are learning a lot about ground water protection as it relates to \nradiation. We know that ground water must be protected. There is such a \nshortage of it in Nevada and especially in the Yucca Mountain area. We \nwant to make sure that ground water which we believe flows into the \nAmargosa aquifer is something that is not going to be damaged.\n  We know during the last 3 years we have had a significant number of \nvery serious earthquakes at Yucca Mountain. We can talk about this in \nsome detail, but it is something that goes to the ultimate licensing of \nthis repository.\n  The cost of the program is in the billions of dollars. We were told \noriginally it would cost $200 million to do the characterization for \nthree sites, a total of $600 million. For just Yucca Mountain alone, we \nare now over $7 billion for the characterization. There has been a loss \nof confidence. We have various organizations that are concerned.\n  I have heard people come to the Senate floor and talk about, how they \nare taking care of nuclear waste in Europe. That is really not quite \ntrue. They are having all kinds of difficulty transporting the nuclear \nwaste. Of course, those are very small countries. Here in the United \nStates, we are talking about transporting nuclear waste not hundreds of \nmiles, as they have had difficulty doing in the European countries, but \ntransporting waste for thousands and thousands of miles. That is \nsomething we need to talk about. We need to discuss the loss of public \nconfidence in how we handle nuclear waste. Of course, transportation, \nas I have just mentioned, is a very serious problem.\n\n  Senator Bryan and I have had the good fortune of being able to travel \nto St. Louis, Denver, and a number of other places. But to take those \ntwo places alone, we met with the city council in both of those \nentities, and they immediately passed resolutions saying they did not \nwant nuclear waste in their cities and counties. If people know how \ndangerous it is to transport nuclear waste, they, of course, do not \nwant it.\n  Nuclear waste has to be transported either by truck or by train. In \nyears past, we have talked on this floor in great detail about how \ndangerous the transportation of anything is but especially something \nthat is the most poisonous substance known to man--plutonium.\n  Terrorist threat: We have recognized there is a terrorist threat with \nrespect to transporting nuclear waste. The sad part about it is, this \nis something that does not seem to concern some people. They simply \nwant to have a repository and will worry about how to transport it at a \nlater time.\n  We have a lot to talk about in relation to this legislation. But \nuntil we get a bill, until we know who we are fighting, and not only \nwho we are fighting but the whole context of the fight, we are not in a \nposition to work in detail to improve this legislation.\n  There will be amendments filed by the deadline tonight by some. I \nthink the Senators from Nevada, based on the situation now before us, \nare not going to file amendments because this legislation is such that \nwe do not know what amendments should be offered based upon the Record, \nwhich is now before us.\n  Cloture has been filed on the underlying bill, S. 1287. At a \nsubsequent time, we are going to have to take a look at that to \ndetermine whether or not we are going to ask our colleagues to support \nus in relation to the cloture motion, whether or not we should be for \nor against that.\n  I hope there can be a distribution of the proposed amendment at a \nrapid time so our staffs can have an opportunity to look at it. At this \nstage, there is an amendment out there somewhere, but it has not been \ngiven to our offices. We are having difficulty understanding what the \namendment is. It is a moving target, to say the least. It keeps \nchanging. Until that is defined, I think we are going to have a great \ndeal of difficulty talking to the White House as to whether or not this \nlegislation is in keeping with fairness, equity; whether the rulemaking \npower of this administration is being jeopardized.\n  We do know one of the provisions in the bill is to make sure this \ndecision made by the EPA is not going to be made until the next \nPresidential election, for obvious reasons; that is, the proponents of \nthis bill are hoping that a Republican will be elected because Vice \nPresident Gore has been a stalwart on this, recognizing the \nenvironmental dangers of what has been attempted by those people who \nwant to jam nuclear waste not only down the throat of Nevada but expose \nall the people along the transportation routes to Nevada.\n  So, again, at such time as we get this legislation, I will come back \nand revisit the legislation. At this time, I have no legislation to \nvisit and will have to wait until a subsequent time to make that \ndetermination as to how the legislation affects the State of Nevada and \nthe country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I just listened to the statement of my \ngood friend from Nevada. I thought perhaps I could contribute something \nmeaningful to our consideration by trying to explain some of the \nprocedure that we have run into and the rationale behind the process.\n  As the Senator from Nevada indicated, last Friday we were able to \nsupply the amendment which was acknowledged by the minority. In my \nnumerous conversations with the minority and the ranking member of the \ncommittee, it became necessary to consider making changes. We have been \nin constant consultation with the ranking member and professional staff \nto try to see if we could reach an accommodation on the suggested \nchanges that have been primarily communicated to us by the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  It was not the intention to do an end run, by any means, on my good \nfriends from Nevada. But it was an effort to try to advance, if you \nwill, the continuing negotiations. That situation has been changing. In \nmy opinion, the goalposts have been moved a little bit, but I am not \ngoing to argue the merits of that.\n  We have been talking about various aspects. I think it is a fair \ncharacterization by my friend from Nevada to say that if you do not \nknow who you are fighting, it is pretty hard to know what the rules \nare--or words to that effect.\n  We have to file the amendments prior to 6 o'clock. There obviously is \ngoing to be one more chapter and verse to this. I assume the two \nSenators from Nevada are conversing with the minority and are a part of \nthis process.\n  But, in any event, that is the best explanation I can offer as to why \nthis thing has not remained somewhat stationary but has been moving, as \nwe have tried to accommodate certain concerns that have been brought \nup, many of which have been quite germane and appropriate.\n\n[[Page S482]]\n\n  One of the things that I think we should identify is something that I \nhad been under the impression the Secretary of Energy was addressing; \nthat was the concern of a number of Governors. I will read the names of \nthose Governors. They include Governor Jeb Bush of Florida; Governor \nHoward Dean of Vermont; Governor Angus King, an independent, from \nMaine; Governor John Kitzhaber of Oregon; Governor Jeanne Shaheen of \nNew Hampshire; Governor Jesse Ventura of Minnesota; and Governor Tom \nVilsack of Iowa. Let me share with my friends what those Governors have \nsaid:\n\n       We Governors from states hosting commercial nuclear power \n     plants and from affected states express our opposition to the \n     plan proposed by Energy Secretary Richardson in his February \n     1999 testimony before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \n     committee. Secretary Richardson proposes that the Department \n     of Energy take title, assume management responsibility, \n     and pay costs at nuclear plant sites for used nuclear fuel \n     it was legally and contractually obliged to begin removing \n     in January 1998. This proposed plan would create \n     semipermanent, federally controlled, used nuclear fuel \n     facilities in each of our States.\n\n  I think it is rather ironic that the whole argument we previously had \nthe last time we took up this legislation was whether or not to site a \ntemporary repository in Nevada. The fear of the Nevadans is, if we \nstarted to move this waste out there, Nevada would be the proclaimed \nsite for the waste because it had already moved out there, even though \nthe process of licensing was to continue. Here we have the States \nexpressing the same concern Nevada had when the Nevadans argued against \nputting a temporary repository in their State and shipping the fuel out \nbefore Yucca Mountain was licensed.\n  Here are the Governors saying:\n\n       This proposed plan would create semi-permanent, federally \n     controlled, used nuclear fuel facilities in each of our \n     States.\n\n  They have the same fear. The fear is that if the Government takes \ntitle, the waste will sit there in their States. Now, there is some \nrationale in that fear because the Government certainly hasn't been \nupfront in addressing its responsibility, in contractual terms, to take \nthe waste in 1998. It seems as if the Government is prepared to leave \nthe waste wherever it might be rather than accept it. That is the only \nconclusion you can come to, as evidenced by the reluctance to take it \nin 1998, the reluctance to support previous legislation that would put \nthat waste in a temporary repository at Yucca Mountain until Yucca \nMountain was determined to be licensed. So now the fear is that these \nStates are going to be stuck with that waste because the Federal \nGovernment is going to take control of it in their State, and it will \nsit there.\n  Let me cite the specific reasons for the opposition of these \nGovernors. Again, they are Jeb Bush, Republican from Florida; Howard \nDean, Democrat from Vermont; Angus King, Independent from Maine; John \nKitzhaber, Democrat from Oregon; Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat from New \nHampshire; Jesse Ventura, the Reform Governor from Minnesota; Tom \nVilsack, Democrat from Iowa. That is a pretty broad bipartisan group. \nIn the letter, it says:\n\n       Specific reasons for our opposition are:\n       The plan proposes to use our electric consumer monies which \n     were paid to the Federal Government for creating a final \n     disposal repository for used nuclear fuel. Such funds cannot \n     [in their opinion] legally be used for any other purpose than \n     a Federal repository.\n\n  Well, if that is correct, then that is correct, they can't be used to \nstore the fuel in those States next to the reactors.\n  Further, it states:\n\n       This plan abridges States' rights. . . .\n\n  I think we need to hear a little bit more about States' rights around \nhere.\n\n       [I]t constitutes Federal takings and establishes new \n     nuclear waste facilities outside of State authority and \n     control.\n\n  Yet within their very States.\n\n       These new Federal nuclear waste facilities would be on \n     river fronts, lakes and seashores [where the plants are] \n     which would never be chosen for permanent disposal of used \n     nuclear fuel and in a site selection process.\n       The plan constitutes a major Federal action--\n\n  I think it does--\n\n     which has not gone through the National Environmental Policy \n     Act (NEPA) review process.\n\n  So the administration is circumventing NEPA.\n  Further:\n\n       The new waste facilities would likely become de facto \n     permanent [waste] disposal sites.\n\n  This is the crux of it, Mr. President. They say:\n\n       Federal action over the last 50 years has not been able to \n     solve the political problems associated with developing \n     disposal for used nuclear fuel. Establishing these Federal \n     sites will remove the political motivation to complete a \n     final disposal site.\n\n  The letter to the President concludes with:\n\n       We urge you to retract Secretary Richardson's proposed plan \n     and instead support establishing centralized interim storage \n     at an appropriate site. This concept has strong, bipartisan \n     support and results in the environmentally preferable, least-\n     cost solution to the used nuclear fuel dilemma.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used all his time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CURTIS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we begin the new session of the 106th \nCongress on a sad note, marking the passing of a good friend and former \ncolleague, Senator Carl T. Curtis of Nebraska, who died recently at the \nage of 94.\n  For those of you who are new to the Senate, Carl was a great man who \nrendered a valuable service to his state and our nation throughout his \ncareer. First elected to the United States House of Representatives in \n1938 and the United States Senate in 1954, Carl holds the record for \nbeing the Nebraskan to serve the longest in the United States Congress. \nIn total, he spent almost forty-one-years on Capitol Hill before \nretiring from the Senate in 1979.\n  During his tenure as a Federal legislator, he earned a well deserved \nreputation for fiscal conservatism, limited government, and was known \nas a champion of farmers and agricultural issues. He was party loyalist \nand a true conservative who never sacrificed personal convictions for \nthe sake of public opinion. Among other issues, he was steadfast in his \nbacking of President Nixon and our fight against communism in Southeast \nAsia even though these were highly unpopular positions at that time. An \nindication of his commitment to the conservative cause was the close \nalliance between he and Barry Goldwater, as a matter of fact, Carl \nmanaged the floor during the 1964 Republican Presidential Convention in \nSan Francisco when Senator Goldwater was seeking the nomination of the \nparty. Perhaps most importantly, Carl was known for his commitment to \nhis constituents, nothing was more important to him than helping the \npeople of Nebraska. Such dedication to helping others is truly the \nhallmark of an individual devoted to public service.\n  During the course of our time in the Senate together, I came to know \nCarl quite well as we had much in common, as a matter of fact, he and I \nboth entered the Senate in 1954 and that was not the least of our \nsimilarities. Beyond being like-minded on so many issues, we were \nessentially contemporaries, having grown-up on farms, read for the law \ninstead of going to law school, and prefering to be out meeting with \nour constituents. It was always a pleasure to work with Carl on any \nnumber of issues and I valued his alliance as a Senator and his \nfriendship as an individual. It was a high honor to be asked to serve \nas an honorary pall bearer by the Curtis family, though I hate to say \n``goodbye'' to my old friend.\n  Carl Curtis was the embodiment of a public-minded citizen who \ndedicated\n\n[[Page S483]]\n\nhis life to making a difference. From his stint as Kearney County \nAttorney to his role as an elder statesman, Carl Curtis always sought \nto build a community, state, and nation that were better for all its \ncitizens. He set an exemplary example for integrity, diligence, and \nconviction, and others would do well to follow the high standards to \nwhich he held himself. My sympathies go out to his widow, Mildred, his \nson Carl T. Curtis, Jr., his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. All \ncan be proud of this fine man who we are all better for having known.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/08/senate-section/article/S483-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S483-S485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ``DON'T BE DOWN ON THE FARM''\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last week I joined several of my \nDemocratic colleagues at a hearing on the agriculture crisis that is \nforcing many family farmers out of operation. We heard a number of \nwitnesses tell compelling stories about how the 1996 ``Freedom to \nFarm'' Act has failed them and their communities.\n  Lori Hintz, a registered nurse and farm wife, talked about the impact \nof the '96 farm bill on her community in Beadle County, South Dakota. \nShe emphasized that farmers are not the only ones in her area that are \nstruggling.\n  When farm prices are depressed in a rural community--like they are in \nLori's--small businesses, health clinics and schools also feel the \npinch. Lori spoke eloquently about the urgent need to invest in rural \ncommunities and promote a healthy farm economy, thereby reducing out-\nmigration and preserving the way of life that built and still defines \nthe Midwest.\n  I believe I speak for all Democratic Senators who participated in \nlast week's hearing when I say that the testimony presented by each \nwitness was both powerful and thought-provoking. That testimony only \nstrengthened our determination to address the agriculture crisis facing \nthis country.\n  Few people have a better appreciation for the problems confronting \nour family farmers, and for what we in the Senate need to do to fix \nthose problems, than my close friend and colleague, Senator Byron \nDorgan. Senator Dorgan has stood throughout his public career as an \neffective and tireless advocate for America's family farmers and \nranchers, and his perspective on the economic difficulties felt by many \nrural residents merits the undivided attention of policymakers in \nCongress and the Administration.\n  Today, I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to \nSenator Dorgan for an article published in a recent edition of the \nWashington Monthly that presents a poignant and persuasive argument for \nthe family farm. I commend this article, entitled ``Don't Be Down on \nthe Farm,'' to my colleagues' attention.\n  Senator Dorgan knows this topic as well as anyone. We have all \nlearned from Senator Dorgan's entreaties, many of which have been \ndelivered in this chamber, about the economic challenges facing the \npeople to whom we entrust the safe and abundant production of our \nnation's food and fiber supply. We have listened to Senator Dorgan's \nimpassioned oratory about conditions in rural North Dakota, and how the \neconomic survival of many communities in his state depends on \nsuccessful family farms. His words resonate deeply in me, because they \noften evoke similar scenarios in my state.\n  In his article, Senator Dorgan makes a number of important \nobservations--things we know to be true, but that too often are \nrecklessly discounted in the crafting of farm policy. He reminds us of \nthe proven efficiency of family farms, and how viable family farms \ntranslate into robust, successful communities. He also asks a question \nto which we still have not received a persuasive answer. What does \nsociety gain by replacing family farms with corporate farming \noperations?\n  Senator Dorgan also reminds us of the social costs that we may all \nhave to bear for the emergence of corporate agriculture, including the \nchallenge of waste disposal, the threat of related environmental \ndegradation and the loss of a valued way of life.\n  Finally, Senator Dorgan asks whether we will take steps necessary to \nensure the survival of family farms and ranches for the future. That is \na question of interest to many members in this chamber, and one to \nwhich we simply must find the right answer.\n  The eloquence and urgency of Senator Dorgan's message reinforces the \nviews of the many Senators who want to secure a strong future for our \ncountry's family farms. I appreciate both the effort and conviction \nevident in the article, and thank Senator Dorgan for his commitment to \nthis vital issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dorgan's article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Monthly, Sept. 1999]\n\n                       Don't Be Down on the Farm\n\n\n             What we can do to preserve a national treasure\n\n                       (By Senator Byron Dorgan)\n\n       A Traveler through Western Europe these days observes \n     something unusual to American eyes. Family-based agriculture \n     is thriving there. The countryside is dotted with small, \n     prosperous farms, and the communities these support are \n     generally prosperous as well. The reason, of course, is that \n     Europe encourages its family-scale agriculture, while America \n     basically doesn't care. The difference was apparent at the \n     World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle. The European \n     representatives were talking about families and communities, \n     while the Americans talked about markets. You listen to the \n     speeches, as I did, and a question looms up in your mind. If \n     American trade representatives think these European values \n     represent the problem, just what do they think represents the \n     solution? If prosperous rural economies are not a worthy goal \n     then what is?\n       The question is of great urgency among U.S. farmers these \n     days. Out beyond the prosperity of Wall Street and Silicon \n     Valley, the producers in America's food economy are \n     struggling for survival. The weather has been miserable. \n     Prices for some commodities are at Depression-era levels. \n     Imports are soaring, and giant agribusiness firms are \n     squeezing out farmers for a bigger share of the food dollar. \n     In this setting, farm auctions have become a grim daily \n     counterpoint to the Wall Street boom.\n       The stories are wrenching beyond description. I received a \n     letter from a woman whose son refused to get out of bed the \n     day the family farm was auctioned off. His dream was to \n     become a farmer like his dad, and he couldn't bear to watch \n     that dream get sold off by a bank. Suicides among farmers are \n     now three times the rate of the nation as a whole. One Iowa \n     farmer left a note that said, ``Everything is gone, wore out \n     or shot, just like me.''\n       Many in the opinion class offer an obligatory regret and \n     then wonder why we should care. Family farmers are just \n     poignant footnotes to the bright new economy, they say, like \n     the little diners that got left behind on Route 1 when the \n     interstates came in. ``The U.S. no longer needs agriculture \n     and is rapidly outgrowing it,'' said Steven Blank, an \n     economist at the University of California at Davis. In his \n     view, farms, like steel mills and television factories can \n     move to low-cost climes abroad, and should. ``It is the \n     improvement in the efficiency of the American economy.''\n       Most express themselves in more diplomatic terms. But \n     that's basically the expert view. An economy is just a \n     mathematical equation and efficiency, narrowly defined, is \n     the ultimate value. If family-based agriculture disappears, \n     so be it. This view isn't just distasteful. It is \n     shortsighted and wrong.\n       The fact is, family-based agriculture is not unproductive \n     or inefficient, even by the narrow calculus of the economies \n     profession. (I'll go into that a little later.) First off, if \n     we care about food, we will not welcome an economy in which \n     control of the food chain lies in a few corporate hands. \n     Monsanto-in-the-Fields is not everyone's idea of the food \n     economy they want. But the basic issue here goes far beyond \n     food. It speaks to us as citizens rather than just as \n     shoppers; ultimately it concerns the kind of country we are \n     going to be. The family farm today is a sort of canary in the \n     mine shaft of the global economy. It shows in stark terms \n     what happens to our lives, our communities, and our values \n     when we prostrate ourselves before the narrow and myopic \n     calculus of international finance. So doing, it raises what \n     is probably the single most important economic question \n     American faces: What is an economy for?\n       For decades the nation has listened to a policy \n     establishment that views the economy as a kind of ``Stuff \n     Olympics.'' The gold medal goes to the nation that \n     accumulates the most stuff and racks up the biggest GDP. \n     Enterprise is valued only to the extent it serves this end. \n     But what happens when we produce more stuff than we need but \n     less of other things, such as community, that we need just as \n     much? Do we continue our efforts to produce more of what we \n     already have a glut of? Or do we ask a different question? If \n     Americans say we need stronger families and better \n     communities, then we need to question whether our economic \n     arrangements are contributing to those ends. If we really \n     believe in traditionally family values, then should we not \n     support the form of agriculture--and business generally--\n     based upon those values?\n       There's a way to save our family-based agriculture. Harry \n     Truman had the answer more than fifty years ago. Put simply, \n     Truman wanted to confine the agricultural support system to \n     the family-sized unit. This\n\n[[Page S484]]\n\n     would promote a modern and productive farm economy and \n     healthy rural communities too. It would begin to align our \n     economic policies with our traditional family values and \n     social ideals. But in order to see the value of this \n     approach, we have to put off the mythologies and ideological \n     blinders that dominate the debate today.\n\n\n                             Over The Edge\n\n       These mythologies start with the assumption that the \n     struggles of family farmers are Darwinian proof of their own \n     unfitness to survive. The fact is, family farmers are in a \n     bind today because of deliberate actions and inactions here \n     in Washington. An impartial market didn't decree their \n     difficulties. Policy makers did. Yes, there has been lousy \n     weather, an expensive dollar, and the collapse of crucial \n     markets in Asia. These come with the territory. Since the New \n     Deal, the federal government has sought to help farmers get \n     through such tough times.\n       What's different now is that government has tried instead \n     to push family-based producers over the edge. The push \n     started with the trade agreements that opened the U.S. wide \n     to foreign production. Advocates of NAFTA and GATT promised \n     American producers vast new markets, yet today America's \n     trade deficit has reached record levels, and the balance of \n     agricultural trade is heading in the same direction. You need \n     that right. The coal is pouring into Newcastle. By the \n     sublime logic of the global economy, a nation that has \n     depressed prices of durum wheat is importing durum wheat, \n     fruit, poultry, and meat as well.\n       This did not happen because American farmers are backward \n     or inefficient. It happened because of a high dollar, which \n     works against exports; and because American trade negotiators \n     have been more attentive to the needs of corporate food \n     processors than to the farmers who grow the food. The U.S. \n     trade agreement with Canada is a prime example. Before that \n     agreement the U.S. imported virtually no durum wheat from \n     Canada. (Durum is the kind used in pasta.) The U.S. trade \n     representative at the time, Clayton Yeutter, assured Congress \n     in writing that the agreement would have no effect on grain. \n     Yet durum was pouring across the northern border almost from \n     the moment the agreement took effect. Today, Canadian imports \n     comprise nearly 25 percent of U.S. processed durum. These \n     imports nearly doubled in the first five months of 1999 \n     alone.\n       Some call this the Invisible Hand. But it has a lot more to \n     do with something called the Canadian Wheat Board, a \n     government agency that handles every bushel of wheat produced \n     in Canada. The Wheat Board publishes no price information, so \n     the workings of the Canadian market are inscrutable to U.S. \n     farmers. There are subsidies for grain handling and \n     transportation that give Canadian producers a further edge. \n     Canada is not an exception. Most nations try to protect their \n     own food production, and understandably so. They have long \n     memories of wars that made food a precious commodity; and as \n     true conservatives they value their rural traditions and \n     cultures.\n       So tough luck you say: The consumer is king, and cheap \n     imports mean low prices at the supermarket. This degradation \n     of the producer was not what Jefferson and others had in mind \n     when they founded our republic. But that aside, if you think \n     the farmer's travail has been the consumer's gain, you might \n     check your local supermarket. Somehow, those Depression-level \n     prices on the farm haven't shown up on the bar codes. Prices \n     of hamburger and bread have inched up, even as farm prices \n     have plummeted.\n       Someone is getting the spread, and that someone is the food \n     processing and packing industry, which has scored big off the \n     misery of U.S. farmers. The big four cereal manufacturers \n     have returns on equity of upwards of 29 percent even as \n     farmers go bankrupt. From a loaf of bread that costs $1.59 at \n     the store, the wheat farmer gets about five to six cents. In \n     1981 the wheat farmer got about double that. The processors \n     can reap where the farmer sows, in large part because the \n     industry has become so concentrated in recent years. When \n     Ronald Reagan become president, the top four beef processors \n     controlled about 36 percent of the market. Today the figure \n     is over 80 percent. A wheat farmer today is dealing with a \n     grain industry in which the top four firms control 62 percent \n     of the business. This means a marketplace with the power to \n     say, ``take it or leave it.''\n       The antitrust laws are supposed to prevent this kind of \n     bullying. But decades of erosion at the hands of \n     ideologically-disposed economists and judges have reduced \n     these laws to mere ``husks of what they were intended to \n     be,'' as the late Justice Douglas put it. Moreover, budget \n     cuts during the Reagan-Bush years crippled antitrust \n     enforcement just as the current merger wave was gaining \n     momentum. Even after modest increases under Clinton, the \n     antitrust budget has fallen in real terms since the late \n     1970s. The Microsoft trial has gotten a lot of headlines. But \n     when Cargill, the nation's number one grain exporter and the \n     largest privately-held company, can buy the grain operations \n     of Continental, which is number two, with barely a peep from \n     Washington, then the cops aren't exactly walking tall on the \n     antitrust beat.\n       There is a pattern here. The U.S. government has undertaken \n     to remake the world in the image of the multinational \n     corporation--an image in which all economic problems get \n     reduced to mathematics. Family-based production has stubborn \n     loyalties to locality and place. It provides a buffer against \n     the ruthless--and often misleading--mathematics of the \n     market. Therefore the government seeks to engineer it out of \n     existence and to replace it with the corporation that has no \n     such inconvenient human tendencies. This was the implicit \n     logic of the Farm Bill of 1996.\n\n\n                           failing the farms\n\n       The Farm Bill of 1996 was touted as a radical break from \n     the past. Proponents said that it would ``free'' farmers from \n     the stifling bureaucracy of the federal government and enable \n     them to make their fortunes in the global marketplace. They \n     called the bill--with mordant irony--the Freedom to Farm Act. \n     It seemed plausible in the flush times of the mid-'90s. But \n     the agricultural marketplace soon cratered, and farmers found \n     out quickly what the bill really left them free to do--Get \n     Out of Farming Fast.\n       Put simply, the bill phases out the federal-price support \n     program over a period of seven years. During that time, it \n     doles out between $5 billion and $6 billion a year in \n     transition payments, supposedly to wean farmers off the \n     federal supports. These go to all agricultural entities, \n     regardless of size and regardless of need. The bigger you \n     are, the more you get--no matter how much money you have \n     sitting in the bank.\n       It sounds like a parody of a government program. Yet that's \n     how the bill works--or, more accurately, doesn't work. A year \n     after the bill took effect, Congress was enacting \n     ``emergency'' relief to help undo the damage it had just \n     done. Congress just enacted another emergency measure this \n     year. There is no end in sight. Congress buys a little quiet \n     while the nation's family-based producers twist slowly in the \n     wind.\n\n\n                         community matters too\n\n       From the time Franklin Roosevelt established the first \n     farm-support programs during the Depression, a central \n     question has gone unresolved: What is the farm program really \n     for? People in Washington have always wrung their hands over \n     hard-pressed family farmers. But the programs they've enacted \n     have favored the biggest farmers and hastened the demise of \n     the smaller ones. In its many permutations, the farm program \n     has proceeded on the assumption that the mode and scale of \n     production don't matter, and all that counts is a given \n     quantity of beef or grain. This view dominates the policy and \n     media establishments and the result is a facile cynicism \n     regarding efforts to help the family-based producer. We need \n     to reexamine this assumption. The embrace of text-book \n     orthodoxies tends to blind reporters to economic reality, and \n     to the social dimension of economic enterprise.\n       In reality, a family-based enterprise such as a farm \n     produces much more than corn or wheat. It also produces a \n     community. One might say it has a social product as well as a \n     material product. This social product is invisible to \n     economists and policy experts because they see only what they \n     can count in money. But it is crucial in a nation that has \n     more stuff than it knows what to do with but less community \n     and stability than it needs.\n       This is not rural romanticism. I'm talking about the \n     opposite--the ways that family-based enterprise provides a \n     matrix for community life. A small town cafe, for example, \n     contributes much more to the life of a rural community than \n     its financial balance sheet would suggest. It is a hub of \n     social interaction, a crossroads where people meet in person \n     rather than just as blips on a computer screen. It serves to \n     reinforce the formal organizations in the town, from the \n     volunteer fire department to the PTA. Cafes are so \n     important to small-town life that in Havana, North Dakota, \n     (pop. 124) folks actually volunteer at the local cafe to \n     keep it open.\n       Family-based agriculture is a prolific source of social \n     product. Study after study has documented this effect. The \n     most famous was that of Walter Goldschmidt of the University \n     of California, comparing two California farm communities in \n     the 1940s. One was comprised of small and medium sized family \n     farms; the other of large scale producers. The localities \n     were similar in other significant respects. Goldschmidt found \n     that the family farms produced a measurably stronger social \n     unit. People showed ``a strong economic and social interest \n     in their community. Differences in wealth among them are not \n     great, and the people generally associate in those \n     organizations which serve the community.'' The locality with \n     larger farms, by contrast, had a more pronounced class \n     structure, less stability, and less civic participation.\n       This will come as no surprise to people who grew up in such \n     settings. The family and community values that people give \n     speeches about in Washington are a fact of daily life. I \n     remember a farmer in my home town of Regent, North Dakota, a \n     fellow named Ernest, who had a heart attack around harvest \n     time. His neighbors took their combines and harvested his \n     grain. The economics textbooks call these farmers \n     ``competitors,'' and if they were corporations they would \n     behave that way. But because they are real people they acted \n     like neighbors and friends.\n       The social dimension of enterprise is crucial even in \n     conventional economic terms. Francis Fukuyama, the respected \n     writer on social dynamics, developed this subject in his book \n     Trust. ``Virtually all serious observers understand,'' he \n     wrote, ``that liberal political and economic institutions \n     depend on a healthy and dynamic civil society for their \n     vitality.'' Society needs enterprise but enterprise also \n     needs a society.\n\n[[Page S485]]\n\n       Jefferson was right. The kind of agriculture we choose \n     affects the kind of communities we have and the kind of \n     nation we are going to be. A nation that tries to divorce the \n     processes of production from larger social concerns--as \n     policy experts do--eats its own seed corn. Neglect the social \n     product of private enterprise, and we create the conditions \n     for our own decline.\n\n\n                       small farms are efficient\n\n       Against this, we have to ask what's to gain by displacing \n     family-based farming with corporate agribusiness firms. The \n     answer is, very little.\n       The supposed efficiency of corporate-scale operations has a \n     large dose of hype. Farms can reach peak efficiency at well \n     within the range of a family operation. Michael Duffy, an \n     agricultural economist at Iowa State University, has found \n     that corn and soybean producers in that state reach the low \n     point on the production cost curve at between 300 and 500 \n     acres. The top 10 percent of pig producers, based on cost of \n     production, averaged 164 sows.\n       Wheat farmers reach lowest costs at a somewhat larger \n     scale, but still well within a family-sized operation. The \n     belief that bigger corporate operations mean more productive \n     agriculture is just a ``bunch of crapolla,'' Duffy says.\n       The claims of efficiency, moreover, ignore the costs that \n     sprawling agribusiness operations impose upon the rest of us. \n     Partly these costs are social. When there are no neighbors to \n     drive Aunt Ella a hundred miles to the clinic, she has to use \n     a taxpayer-funded van instead. But the biggest costs may be \n     environmental. Corporate pig factories, for example, have \n     become a nightmare for their neighbors. They foul local water \n     supplies and emit a colossal stink into the air.\n       A county in Illinois actually had to reduce property \n     assessments by 30 percent in the vicinity of such a plant. In \n     North Carolina, which has emerged as a pig factory haven in \n     recent years, Hurricane Floyd caused massive flooding of the \n     huge lagoons that hold the wastes. The sludge spread over the \n     countryside and leached into the groundwater. Residents were \n     advised to drink bottled water and even to have their wells \n     redrilled. That might be efficiency for the corporation. But \n     it's not for the neighbors, nor for the society as a whole.\n       I see an economist scowling in the back row. If people want \n     social product, he mutters, then they would demand it in the \n     market.\n       But that's precisely the problem. Americans can't speak \n     through the market unless the market gives them an effective \n     choice, and under current arrangements they don't have one. \n     When we buy pasta or pork chops at the supermarket there's \n     nothing on the label to tell us the kind of farm it came \n     from.\n       Markets are the best means we have for allocating \n     resources, when people have both information and choices and \n     when all costs are accounted for. But they don't work so well \n     when information and choice are lacking the costs get shifted \n     into others, and that's what happens with agricultural \n     production today. Farmers aren't getting full compensation \n     for their production, including social product. They should. \n     The question is how.\n\n\n                            the brannan plan\n\n       After his improbable reelection in 1948 President Harry \n     Truman introduced a farm bill that had a truly far-sighted \n     provision to limit federal farm supports to the family-sized \n     unit. Farmers could become bigger if they wished. They could \n     produce as much as they thought they could sell. But they \n     couldn't expect the federal government to support all their \n     ambitions.\n       The Brannan Plan as it was called--after then Secretary of \n     Agriculture Charles Brannan--would have made it the policy of \n     the United States that scale and social impact matter, in \n     agriculture at least. Not surprisingly, the larger farm \n     interests opposed the Brannan Plan (thought mostly on other \n     grounds) and it died a quick legislative death.\n       In the 50 years since, the farm program has gone from one \n     extreme to the other--from supporting everything in sight to \n     hitching the nation's farmers to a market ideology in a world \n     that doesn't always buy it. We've shed crocodile tears over \n     family farmers while promoting their demise. Now the \n     congressional majority is in a quandary. Republicans know \n     they have to do something. But many on that side can't bring \n     themselves to face the implications. So they heap more blame \n     on government, rail at the Federal Reserve Board and the \n     government's failure to open more foreign markets, and hope \n     the problem will just go away.\n       To be sure, the Federal Reserve Board is a deserving \n     target. When you hand the management of the economy over to \n     money center bankers, then farmers, who rely heavily on \n     credit, are going to get shortchanged. But it's not enough to \n     rail at the Fed. We need to put someone on the Fed who \n     understands the value of family-based farms and who can \n     provide some balance to the economists and bankers who run \n     the place now.\n       It is good too that Republicans want to open up foreign \n     markets, but we've also got to develop new domestic markets. \n     Since people can eat only so much, that means new uses for \n     farm products. Ethanol barely scratches the surface. There \n     are many materials, from plastics and building materials to \n     paper and inks, that are being made from crops. In Minnesota, \n     farmers are getting from $20 to $50 an acre for selling the \n     right to capture the wind energy from their land. David \n     Morris of the Institute for Local Self Reliance has sketched \n     out the possibilities in a report called, suggestively, ``The \n     Carbohydrate Economy.''\n       Farmers need more bargaining power in the market too, not \n     just more points of access to it. Senator Paul Wellstone of \n     Minnesota and I have proposed a moratorium on mergers in \n     agriculture-related industries, and a complete review of the \n     antitrust laws as they affect this part of the economy. The \n     measure failed to pass this fall, but we will introduce it \n     again.\n       But by far the most important issue is the economic safety \n     net. No matter what else you do, farmers are going to \n     confront bad years. There has to be a support structure of \n     some kind, and it should advance the social values of this \n     country rather than undermine them. Harry Truman had the \n     right idea. There should be a support price for an amount of \n     production that is within the range of a family-scale \n     operation. (This would vary by crop and region of the \n     country, of course.)\n       Beyond that, producers would be on their own. If they \n     wanted to exceed the support range and take their chances in \n     the world market, then more power to them. But we wouldn't \n     ask the taxpayers to support a scale of operation from which \n     there is no social benefit and for which there is no economic \n     need.\n       This approach would not encourage overproduction, since \n     there would be built-in limits on the amount of production \n     that was supported. The caps would be enough to sustain a \n     family-sized operation in bad years, but they would not make \n     anyone rich. This approach would begin to compensate farmers \n     for their contribution to rural communities--a form of \n     production for which the global market provides no monetary \n     return. It would recognize that the efficient destruction of \n     community in America is not the kind of efficiency the \n     government should encourage.\n       If this country can subsidize a public-housing program for \n     millionaire athletes and billionaire owners called pro-sports \n     stadiums, then surely it can provide a safety net for the \n     family-scale agriculture that contributes so much to this \n     nation. Anyone who thinks big corporations are less likely \n     than small enterprises to ask for government help hasn't been \n     paying much attention. Big companies, not little ones, get \n     bailed out in America. Already, the corporate pig factories \n     in North Carolina have asked for millions of dollars from \n     Congress to help upgrade their waste lagoons.\n       An economy is supposed to provide for human need. At a time \n     of material abundance but social scarcity, shouldn't we \n     encourage forms of enterprise that meet the needs of our \n     dwindling communities? If we truly believe in traditional \n     family values, shouldn't we support the forms of enterprise \n     that embody those values, including the family farm?\n       The crisis in the Farm Belt is one problem America knows \n     how to solve. We have both the means and the resources; the \n     question is whether we will use them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/08/senate-section/article/S485-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S485-S486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS COVENANT IMPLEMENTATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to express my whole-hearted \nsupport for S. 1052, the Northern Mariana Islands Covenant \nImplementation Act, which the Senate considered and passed on Monday, \nand to recognize Senator Akaka, Energy Committee Chairman Murkowski, \nand Ranking Senator Bingaman for their determined efforts to shepard \nthis bill through the Senate. During the recent recess, I had the \nopportunity to travel with Senator Akaka to South Asia. Once again, I \nwas reminded why Senator Akaka is one of the most respected members of \nthe Senate. As we met with leaders from India and Pakistan, Senator \nAkaka's humanitarian focus was evident time and again. Yesterday, \nSenator Akaka's concern for those without wealth and privilege was on \ndisplay once more. I wish I could have been here, yesterday, to \ncelebrate his legislative victory.\n  Senator Akaka's special interest in the welfare of the residents of \nthe Northern Mariana Islands dates back to WW II when he served with \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and spent time on both Saipan and \nTinian. In 1996, he and Senator Murkowski traveled to the Commonwealth \nto investigate reports of the horrible working conditions first hand. \nSenator Akaka returned with confirmation of those reports and worked \nquickly to introduce legislation, with Chairman Murkowski, to improve \nthe often horrific conditions faced by alien workers in the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Since then, Senator Akaka \nhas come to the floor repeatedly to draw attention to this problem and \nhe has worked tirelessly behind the scenes to build effective \nbipartisan support for this measure. Senator Akaka's\n\n[[Page S486]]\n\ndedication to this issue reminds us that our work here is not confined \nto the headline grabbing issues of the day but extends to the quiet \npursuit of humane working conditions everywhere.\n  S. 1052 is a bill to amend the legislation enacted by Congress in \n1976 through which the Northern Mariana Islands became a Commonwealth \nof the United States. This bill provides for a transition period during \nwhich the Commonwealth will be incorporated into our federal system of \nimmigration laws. The 1976 covenant enacted by Congress extended U.S. \ncitizenship to CNMI residents, but it exempted the Commonwealth from \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act. Over the years it has become clear \nwhat a mistake that was.\n  Today the immigration situation in the Commonwealth contributes to \nsome very grave social problems. Over the past twenty years, the number \nof citizens of the Commonwealth has doubled, while over that same \nperiod of time the number of alien workers has multiplied twenty-fold. \nThis huge demographic change, and the absence of effective immigration \ncontrol, has led to deplorable conditions for many of these alien \nworkers.\n  Senator Akaka addressed the Senate in October to describe the tragic \ncircumstances in which many alien workers are held as virtual prisoners \nand are not permitted to leave their barracks during non-working hours. \nHe reported that the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division had \nobtained criminal convictions of defendants who had forced alien women \ninto prostitution and held them in what has been described as ``modern \nday slavery.'' I was personally moved by his report. This bill will \nimmediately help to change the circumstances that contribute to these \nterrible conditions while at the same time minimizing any negative \neffect on the Commonwealth's legitimate businesses in the local tourism \nindustry. In fact, the bill calls for the Secretary of Commerce to \nprovide the kind of technical assistance that will help to encourage \nthe growth and diversification of the local economy and promote the \nNorthern Mariana Islands as a tourist destination.\n  This is a first step toward ensuring that every man and woman who \nworks under the U.S. flag works in conditions we can all be proud of. \nAs Senator Akaka knows, we should do more. We should also guarantee the \nminimum wage for workers in the Commonwealth, and if the Democratic \nminimum wage proposal is passed, we will do just that. But we should \nnot let what we know to be the best solution forestall our resolve to \nimplement a good solution, and so I am very proud that the Senate \npassed this much needed legislation and I thank Senators Akaka, \nMurkowski and Bingaman for their fine work in this important endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/08/senate-section/article/S486-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S486-S488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CIVILIAN PLUTONIUM AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, a front page article in yesterday's New \nYork Times announced an agreement that will halt Russia's production of \nplutonium from spent fuel used in its civilian power reactors. In \nexchange for a Russian moratorium on plutonium reprocessing, the United \nStates will provide a $100 million joint research and aid. I strongly \nsupport these efforts and believe that this proposal will help to \nreduce the threat of proliferation from nuclear materials in Russia.\n  However, as we pursue new initiatives to better safeguard Russia's \ncivilian plutonium, we must not waver in our support for the more \nurgent task of disposing of their weapons plutonium. The 50 tons of \nmilitary-grade plutonium that Russia has agreed is surplus could fuel \nmore than 6,000 modern weapons. I'm pleased that the Administration is \nalso recognizing that the lower-grade, civilian, plutonium presents \nsome risk--but we must continue to place our highest priority on their \nmilitary materials, which represent a significantly higher risk.\n  Currently, Russia possesses 30 tons of separated civilian plutonium \nat Mayak and continues to accumulate 2 tons per year from reprocessing \nat that facility. This is in addition to the 150 or more tons of \nweapons plutonium in the Russian complex.\n  First, we must ensure that these materials are safeguarded. Second, \nany burn capacity Russia has should be committed to first eliminating \nmilitary-origin plutonium as mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel. Until the threat \nfrom weapons plutonium is eliminated, Russia has no use for this \nreprocessed fuel, and its continued production represents a \nproliferation risk, albeit less then the risk from weapons-grade \nmaterials. This agreement will help address immediate needs.\n  As part of this agreement, the United States will contribute $45 \nmillion to improve control and accounting of civilian-grade plutonium \nalready stored at the Mayak site and build an additional large dry \nstorage facility elsewhere in Russia. Another $30 million will ensure \nadequate safeguards--protection, control and accounting--on the \nexisting materials. The balance of U.S. contributions--$25 million for \nresearch on proliferation-resistant fuel cycles and permanent \ngeological storage--is conditioned on Russia ending its sales of \nnuclear technology to Iran.\n  Mr. President, while I support this new initiative to temporarily \nhalt Russian extraction of plutonium from their spent nuclear fuel, I \nwant to be sure that my enthusiasm is not interpreted as support for \nstopping reprocessing on a global scale. Some nations, like Japan and \nFrance, have decided that reprocessing of spent fuel is key to their \nnuclear power plans. By this reprocessing, they not only recycle \nplutonium back into reactors, they mitigate the hazard associated with \ntheir nuclear wastes.\n  In contrast, the U.S. has stuck to an old, 1977, decision to simply \nbury our spent fuel--plutonium and all. That not only increases the \nhealth risk from our spent fuel relative to that in France or Japan, it \nalso means that we are proposing to bury a significant energy resource \nthat our own future generations may need. The origin of the 1977 \ndecision, fear of proliferation of reactor-grade plutonium, is \ncertainly not without validity. But reprocessing can be done, as the \nFrench and British have demonstrated, with sufficient care to ensure \nthat proliferation does not occur.\n  Reprocessing is not something that the U.S. should embrace today--it \nreally wouldn't be economical with today's cheap uranium prices. But \nI've worked with Senator Murkowski to introduce provisions into his \ncurrent Nuclear Waste bill to require that we study advanced \nreprocessing and transmutation systems that would both minimize \nproliferations concerns related to spent fuel, and also study \ntechnologies that minimize hazards from spent fuel for the public and \nfor workers. I will encourage that Russia continue to study these same \ntechnologies, because they have great expertise in these areas. \nSometime in the future, we may need to use reprocessing to regain use \nof the energy content in spent fuel.\n  Thus, I believe we should keep future options for civilian fuel \nreprocessing open even as we focus attention in Russia on burning \nmilitary-origin plutonium. Certainly for now, any attempt to burn \ncivilian-origin plutonium in Russia only delays progress in decreasing \nRussia's excess weapons plutonium stockpile.\n  Let me return briefly to the more urgent matters associated with \nmilitary-grade plutonium. As the Chair of the Senate Plutonium Task \nForce, I have pushed hard for completion of a U.S.-Russia agreement on \nmilitary plutonium. In 1998, I led the charge to appropriate $200 \nmillion for implementation of such an agreement.\n  I understand that negotiations for this plutonium agreement are very \nnear completion. This agreement will outline a framework within which \nthe U.S. and Russia will dispose of 50 tons of excess weapons \nplutonium. This framework will address timetables for progress, rates \nof disposal, and reciprocal verification of compliance. This agreement \nwill turn the U.S. and Russian political commitments regarding \nirreversibility into a physical reality.\n  However, I've been dismayed that the Administration has recently \nchosen to remove $49 million from the $200 million set aside for \ndisposition of weapons-plutonium to fund other priorities. That is very \nshort sighted reasoning. The full $200 million has served to keep \npressure on the negotiating teams to finalize the disposition \nprotocols. We send a completely inappropriate message when funds are \nwithdrawn from that account. I intend to work in the next few months to \nrestore this $49\n\n[[Page S487]]\n\nmillion. Furthermore, I will continue to oppose any future use of these \nfunds by the Administration for anything other than their intended \npurpose.\n  The Administration's new initiative can work in tandem with the \nefforts focused on military plutonium. I urge the Administration to \nmake quick and quantifiable progress on both of these fronts. The \nthreat of proliferation from the Russian nuclear complex continues to \ngrow. And it continues to be one of the greatest threats to U.S. \nsecurity today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this New York Times \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 7, 2000]\n\n         Moscow Takes Step To Ease U.S. Fears on Plutonium Use\n\n                           (By Judith Miller)\n\n       In a major agreement aimed at safeguarding nuclear fuel \n     that could be used to make weapons, Russia has promised to \n     stop making plutonium out of fuel from its civilian power \n     reactors as part of a $100 million joint research and aid \n     package from the United States, Clinton administration and \n     Russian officials say.\n       While the administration has several collaborative programs \n     that enhance the safety and security of plutonium produced by \n     Russia's military, this is the Energy Department's first \n     major attempt to secure Russia's huge civilian stockpile of \n     plutonium, from which 3,000 nuclear weapons could be made.\n       ``It's a bold initiative to reduce a 30-ton plutonium \n     threat from Russia's civilian nuclear sector,'' Secretary of \n     Energy Bill Richardson said in a telephone interview. His \n     department is to make public Russia's moratorium on plutonium \n     reprocessing today when it unveils its budget for the next \n     fiscal year.\n       Administration officials and arms control experts were \n     particularly pleased with the deal, more than a year in the \n     works, because it comes at a time of growing strains in \n     relations with Russia over its war in Chechnya, policy toward \n     Iraq, and access to Russian nuclear facilities.\n       The agreement is also likely to place added pressure on \n     other nuclear powers like Japan, Britain and France to follow \n     suit, arms control experts said. Because of concerns about \n     the environment and the spread of nuclear materials to \n     countries like Iran, Iraq and North Korea, the United States \n     has not reprocessed fuel since 1978.\n       Part of the accord--$25 million for long-term joint \n     research that is most attractive to Russia--is contingent on \n     an end to new sales and transfers of nuclear technology to \n     Iran. Washington believes that those transactions are helping \n     Tehran acquire nuclear weapons.\n       ``The money for this research will be in our budget,'' said \n     Ernest P. Moniz, the Undersecretary of Energy, who was in \n     Moscow last week to discuss the agreement. ``It's now up to \n     Russia to decide if they want it.''\n       But the bulk of the money will be given in exchange for \n     Russia's decision to halt reprocessing nuclear fuel from its \n     29 civilian power reactors. That will include, if Congress \n     approves, $45 million to better secure spent fuel already \n     stored at Mayak, a once closed nuclear complex in the \n     southern Urals, and to build a large dry storage site \n     elsewhere in Russia.\n       Yevgeny Adamov, Russia's atomic energy minister, insisted \n     in a telephone interview from Moscow that despite the \n     agreement, Russia would not stop competing to sell new \n     lightwater power reactors to Iran.\n       At the same time, he said, Russia has lived up to the \n     commitments made to Washington last year not to provide \n     sensitive material or technology to Iran. But it was willing \n     in principle to discuss additional safeguards and ``more \n     commitments for greater transparency to remove American \n     concerns.''\n       Mr. Adamov also stressed that Russia was not abandoning its \n     belief that plutonium, which is produced by all nuclear \n     reactors, could eventually be used to fuel a generation of \n     ``safe'' reactors, not yet developed, that would produce \n     waste more difficult to recycle into weapons.\n       ``We're talking in terms of decades,'' for the moratorium \n     on plutonium reprocessing, he said. ``At least two may be \n     enough.''\n       Russia, officials said, already possesses about 150 metric \n     tons of plutonium and 1,200 metric tons of highly enriched \n     uranium, both of which can be used in nuclear weapons.\n       Given that, said Thomas Graham Jr., a former arms control \n     negotiator who now is president of the Lawyers Alliance for \n     World Security, an arms control group in Washington, ``it is \n     important to stop the accumulation of material that some \n     rogue nations would love to get their hands on.''\n       ``This is a very important agreement,'' he added.\n       In 1998 alone, Energy Department officials said, Russia's \n     29 civilian reactors produced 798 metric tons of spent fuel. \n     Normally, Russia would send this material to Mayak for \n     reprocessing--that is, the separation of plutonium, which can \n     be used in weapons, from the rest of the fuel.\n       But under the new agreement, the plutonium will not be \n     separated out. Instead, the unreprocessed material will be \n     stored at a new site somewhere in Russia that the United \n     States will finance.\n       The location and ultimate cost of the site are still not \n     determined, but Mr. Adamov said he was leaning toward \n     Krasnoyarsk-26, a once closed nuclear city where the Russian \n     military made plutonium.\n       William C. Potter, the director of the Monterey Institute's \n     Center for Nonproliferation Studies, in California, \n     particularly praised an allocation of $3 million in the \n     aid package aimed at helping Russia reacquire Soviet-era \n     fuel from countries like Belarus, Ukraine and Yugoslavia. \n     He fears that the material is vulnerable to diversion or \n     military use.\n       Since the end of the cold war, the United States has spent \n     billions of dollars to protect nuclear materials in Russia \n     and the former Soviet Union and to prevent them from falling \n     into the hands of Iran, Iraq or other aspiring nuclear \n     powers. As of this year, Washington has spent about $1.2 \n     billion to help prevent the loss or theft of material that \n     could be used in nuclear weapons.\n       At Mayak, the United States is already financing the \n     construction of a warehouse to protect bomb-grade plutonium \n     extracted from nuclear warheads. A recent American visitor \n     there said that some plutonium was still being stored in \n     milk-pail-size canisters in a wooden storage shed secured \n     mainly by a padlock.\n       Since 1993, Washington has bought 500 metric tons a year of \n     highly enriched uranium from Russian weapons, sales worth \n     more than $400 million a year to Russia. The uranium, which \n     is blended down and sold as reactor-grade fuel for power \n     production, meets about half of America's nuclear power fuel \n     requirements.\n       The new aid package for Russia would provide $45 million \n     for the dry storage site and security upgrades for the \n     stockpiled civilian plutonium and $30 million for new efforts \n     to safeguard material from the military sector.\n       It would also provide $20 million for collaborative \n     research into devising reactors and fuel that cannot be used \n     to make weapons, and $5 million for research into the design \n     and development of a permanent geological repository to store \n     used fuel. Administration officials stressed that only those \n     last two items, which are longer-term projects, hinge on an \n     end to Russian nuclear sales to Iran.\n       Mr. Adamov said on Saturday that Washington would be \n     ``wrong'' to believe that a $100 million assistance package \n     would prompt Russia to forgo revenue from future reactor \n     sales, each of which could be worth up to $1 billion dollars.\n       ``These are huge orders for our industry, and we'll \n     aggressively pursue these orders and win them,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, in the fall of 1998 our majority leader \nnamed a bipartisan group of members to a Task Force on Plutonium \nDisposition to advise the Senate and the Administration on actions with \nrespect to U.S. policy and approaches to bilateral negotiations with \nRussia on the disposition of weapons-excess plutonium. I was pleased to \nbe invited to join the group and Senator Domenici was chosen to chair \nthe Task Force.\n  Mr. President, Senator Domenici has been a pioneer in the area of \nnuclear weapons material safety, security and elimination. He has spent \na great deal of time researching this initiative and engaging our \nRussian colleagues on the issue. He was instrumental in creating a \nbilateral dialogue on plutonium disposition that led to the protocol on \nplutonium disposition signed in September 1998 at the Moscow Summit. \nThis Protocol has led to ongoing negotiations to finalize a bilateral \nagreement to dispose of large quantities of weapons material.\n  The need for leadership in this area was clear. Unclassified sources \nestimate that the United States has 100 tons of plutonium and Russia \nhas more than 160 tons of plutonium. Most of this material is in pit \nform, or classified weapons shape. In other words, the material could \neasily be returned to weapons status. The U.S. and Russia have each \ndeclared that portions of their respective stockpiles are surplus. This \nmaterial represents thousands of nuclear weapons on each side, \nincluding Russian weapons that until a short time ago were pointed at \nAmerican cities.\n  Mr. President, the United States has been working with Russia to \ndismantle their nuclear arsenal through the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative \nThreat Reduction program. All over Russia American firms are \ncooperating with Russian counterparts in deactivating nuclear warheads \nand dismantling long-range ballistic missiles, strategic submarines and \nbombers. The U.S. secured Russian agreement to remove the material from \nthese warheads to safe and secure storage at the Fissile Material \nStorage Facility under construction at Mayak, Russia. But, the U.S. was \nstill left with the challenge of how to get rid of the plutonium, to \nensure that this material would never again threaten the American \npeople.\n\n[[Page S488]]\n\n  Through Senator Domenici's discussions it became evident that a wide \ngulf separated the views of the Administration and Russian leadership \nwith regard to the appropriate disposition actions. The Russians hold \nthe position that plutonium has great value, and want to ensure that \nany actions extract the energy resource remaining in the material by \nusing it as reactor fuel. The U.S. was considering both recovery of \nthis resource and immobilization. Immobilization mixes the plutonium \nwith ceramic material and surrounds it with vitrified, high-level waste \nfor long term storage. Some scientists and some Russian leaders have \nnoted that immobilization may be a less secure means of disposition \nthan use as a reactor fuel.\n  Senator Domenici encouraged a solution wherein both nations would \npursue the reactor fuel option, with so-called mixed oxide or MOX fuel. \nIn addition, the U.S. can use immobilization for some of its less pure \nmaterials that would require significant purification to incorporate \ninto reactor-grade fuel. This solution has been embraced in the current \nnegotiations by both countries. Now both nations are moving toward \nparallel reductions in amounts of plutonium.\n  Our Task Force has been briefed by the Departments of State and \nEnergy on the current status of negotiations on a Framework Agreement \nto implement a plutonium disposition process in Russia and the United \nStates. A U.S.-Russian agreement to dispose up to 50 metric tons of \nweapons grade material on each side is proceeding in a very positive \ndirection. I am hopeful that they will soon produce a draft agreement. \nThere are still important issues to be resolved and hurdles to be \ncleared but it is clear that we would not have enjoyed this significant \nprogress if it were not for Senator Domenici's leadership. His efforts \nin cooperation with Senator Stevens, the Chairman of our Appropriations \nCommittee, to secure forward funding for the implementation of this \nagreement was crucial in securing Russian participation.\n  I commend my good friend, the senior Senator from New Mexico, for his \nleadership in this area and thank him for what I hope will be a \ntremendously valuable national security program. We will all watch the \nnegotiations proceeding in Moscow and hope for a positive conclusion. \nWhen this agreement is finalized and implemented, which I believe it \nwill be, each of us will owe Senator Domenici a debt of gratitude for \nmaking the world safer for our children and grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/08/senate-section/article/S488-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF GEORGE T.

He has made our duties far easier and \nthroughout the years he has been the Ambassador of Goodwill with his \nwonderful smile, kind words, and unmatched style. He was always proud \nof being part of the Senate Family.\n  George will be very busy in retirement with church activities, a \ndemanding golf schedule, and the joy of a new grandson. Along with all \nof his friends, I commend George for his loyalty and dedicated service \nto the United States Senate. I know that all Senators will join me in \nthanking George, his wife Gloria, and his three children, Angie, \nSamantha, and George, Jr., for his dedicated and distinguished service. \nIt is with deep appreciation that we extend our best wishes for many \nyears of health and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/08/senate-section/article/S488-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FUNDING FOR THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenator Specter, as primary cosponsor of a sense of the Senate \nresolution, introduced yesterday, that puts the Senate on record that \nfunding for NIH should be increased by $2.7 billion in Fiscal Year \n2001. NIH is the premier medical research institution in the world--\nresearch funded by NIH is key to maintaining the quality of our health \ncare and key to finding preventive measures, cures and the most cost \neffective treatments for the major illnesses and conditions that strike \nAmericans.\n  Two years ago, our Appropriations Subcommittee provided NIH with a $2 \nbillion increase to set us on a five-year course to double NIH funding \nover five years. Last year, our Subcommittee was able to secure a $2.3 \nbillion increase for NIH--continuing on the course to double NIH \nfunding over five years. A $2.7 billion increase for NIH in Fiscal Year \n2001 would keep us on track to double NIH in the five years.\n  I was disappointed that the President's budget which we received \ntoday only requested a $1 billion increase for NIH. Funding biomedical \nresearch is especially important now when research on stem cells and \nprogress made on the Human Genome project offer such promise. I hope to \nwork closely with Senator Specter this year to build on last year's \nincrease for NIH as we move to doubling funding for NIH by 2003.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/08/senate-section/article/S488-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to reduce \naccidental injury and death resulting from medical mistakes and to \nreduce medication-related errors, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                  medical error reduction act of 2000\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Harkin and myself, I \nam introducing legislation captioned the Medical Error Reduction Act of \n2000. This legislation is introduced in response to a report from the \nInstitute of Medicine which shows a very high death rate as a result of \nerrors in hospitals.\n  The statistics show that the death rate from errors in hospitals may \nbe as high as 98,000 people. A chart has been prepared demonstrating \nthat at the 98,000 figure, which is the uppermost estimate, medical \nerrors are the fifth\n\n[[Page S490]]\n\nleading cause of death in the United States, problems which certainly \nneed to be addressed.\n  The legislation we are proposing follows a hearing which our \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nconducted on December 13, 1999, and also a hearing conducted on January \n25, 2000, in conjunction with the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Our \nlegislation has input--not support, but input--taking into account \nconcerns from the American Hospital Association, the American Medical \nAssociation, the American Nurses Association, the Institute for Safe \nMedication Practices, the American Psychological Association, and \nothers.\n  The core provisions of the bill will provide for 15 competitively \nawarded research demonstration projects to make a determination of the \nscope of medical errors and the ways to correct these medical errors \nsystemically. Five of these demonstrations will have a mandatory \nreporting requirement with confidentiality when there is a medical \nerror. Five of these demonstration projects will have a voluntary \nreporting program with confidentiality, and five of these demonstration \nprojects will have a mandatory reporting requirement and also a mandate \nthat the patient and/or the family be notified of the error.\n  This, we think, is fundamental in terms of the professional \nresponsibility of a doctor and the professional responsibility of a \nhospital to notify the injured party where error has occurred. \nParenthetically, a similar obligation, I believe, is incumbent upon \nprofessionals generally.\n  The legislation has further provisions for the studies to be \nconducted in a way to make a determination as to what is feasible on \nhand-held prescription pads and on other technical devices which will \nlook to the system's errors which are encapsulated and encompassed in \nhospitals and medical care.\n  On November 29, 1999, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a \nreport, ``To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System.'' The report \nconcluded that medical mistakes have led to numerous injuries and \ndeaths, affecting an estimated three to four percent of all hospital \npatients. The IOM report also concluded that health care is a decade or \nmore behind other high-risk industries in its attention to ensuring \nbasic safety.\n  According to the IOM, at least 44,000 Americans die each year as a \nresult of medical errors, and the number may be as high as 98,000. We \nmust put this statistic into perspective, as noted in this chart: at \n98,000 deaths per year, medical errors are catapulted into the ranking \nof fifth leading cause of death nationwide. This total outnumbers \ndeaths from motor vehicle accidents, breast cancer, and AIDS. Further, \nmedical errors resulting in injury are estimated to cost the nation \nbetween $17 billion and $29 billion, including additional health care \ncosts, lost income, lost household production, and disability costs.\n  The IOM findings are startling and beg for national attention to \ndetermine ways to reduce the number of medical errors. We have all \nheard and read media reports detailing the case of Betsy Lehman, a \nhealth reporter for the Boston Globe, who died from a chemotherapy \noverdose; or the tragedy of Willie King, who had the wrong leg \namputated in a Florida hospital. Unfortunately, these are not isolated \ncases.\n  On December 13, 1999, I chaired a hearing of the Labor-HHS-Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee to hear details of IOM's report findings. \nOn January 25, 2000, I chaired a joint Labor-HHS-Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee/Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing to \nconsider mandatory and voluntary reporting requirements and to begin to \ndetermine ways to reduce medical errors. Today, Senator Harkin and I \nare introducing legislation that seeks to find solutions to the problem \nof medical errors. This legislation was developed based on our hearings \nand with input from many health groups and experts in the field, \nincluding the American Hospital Association; American Medical \nAssociation; American Nurses Association; Institute for Safe Medication \nPractices; American Psychological Association; Federation of \nBehavioral, Psychological, and Cognitive Sciences; American Osteopathic \nAssociation; Association of American Medical Colleges; American \nAssociation of Health Plans; Hospital and Healthsystem Association of \nPennsylvania; and Iowa Hospital Association. It is our hope that we can \ncontinue to work together to reduce the number of injuries and deaths \nrelated to medical mistakes.\n  Let me review the key provisions of this bill. It would:\n  Make grants available to states so they can establish their own error \nreporting systems and collect data to provide to Federal researchers. \nThe compilation of such data will help researchers understand trends in \nerrors and determine ways to reduce them.\n  Require the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, in \nconjunction with the Health Care Financing Administration, to establish \n15 competitively-awarded research demonstration projects throughout the \nnation, in geographically diverse areas, to assess the causes of \nmedical errors and determine ways to reduce those errors.\n\n  Facilities participating in these demonstrations will be required to \nemploy appropriate technologies to reduce the probability of future \nerrors. Such technologies might include hand-held electronic \nprescription pads, training simulators for medical education, and bar-\ncoding of prescription drugs and patient bracelets.\n  Facilities participating in the demonstrations will also provide \nstaff training to reduce the number of errors, and encourage prompt \nreview of errors to determine ways to prevent them from recurring.\n  Of the 15 facilities who choose to participate in the demonstrations, \n5 will have a mandatory reporting requirement of all medical errors to \nHHS, 5 will have a voluntary reporting requirement to HHS, and 5 will \nhave a mandatory reporting requirement to HHS as well as to the patient \nand/or his family.\n  Require the Secretary of HHS to provide information to all patients \nwho participate in Federally-funded health care programs, educating \nthem on ways to reduce medical errors. Require the Secretary to develop \npatient education programs to encourage all patients to take a more \nactive role in their healthcare.\n  Make grants available to health professional associations and other \norganizations to provide training and continuing education in order to \nreduce medical errors.\n  Require the Secretary to report to the Congress within 180 days of \nenactment on the costs of implementing a program that identifies \nfactors that reduce medical errors, including computerized health care \nsystems. Require the Secretary to report on the results of the fifteen \nhealth system demonstration projects, focusing on best practices and \ncosts/benefits of applying these practices nationally.\n  Mr. President, patients must have confidence that when they seek \nmedical treatment, they will receive the highest quality health care in \nthe world. They should not be fearful of injuries or even death due to \nmedical mistakes. The Institute of Medicine panel projected that with \ncurrent knowledge and with implementation of medical error reduction \nmethods that are proven to work, we can achieve no less than a 50 \npercent reduction in medical errors over the next five years. I believe \nthat the research efforts authorized by this legislation will allow us \nto far exceed this goal, and immeasurably improve patient safety. I \nthink my colleagues will agree that America has zero tolerance for \npreventable medical mistakes, and that we should act immediately to \nprevent further deaths and injuries.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nSpecter, in the introduction of the Medical Errors Reduction Act of \n2000. Senator Specter just outlined the major provisions of the bill. I \nwill not go back over that; only suffice to say our bill addresses a \ncritical problem facing America's health care system, a problem that \nplaces millions of Americans at risk of serious injury or death every \ntime they seek medical attention.\n  Again, I thank my distinguished chairman, Senator Specter, for \nputting this bill together in such a timely\n\n[[Page S491]]\n\nfashion. This is something we have to address, and we have to focus on \nthis immediately.\n  Many of my colleagues are aware of the recently released Institute of \nMedicine report which describes a health care industry plagued with \nsystems errors and provider mistakes. If you are familiar with the \nreport, then you have discovered something I do not think a lot of \npeople are aware of and of which I was not aware, and that is, we are \nmore likely to die from a medical mistake than diabetes, breast cancer, \nor a traffic accident.\n  The report found that deaths due to medical errors are the fifth \nleading cause of death in this country. This chart is from the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health \nStatistics. It shows medical errors as the fifth leading cause of \ndeath. Some say it is the eighth leading cause of death. More people \ndie from medical errors than pneumonia, diabetes, accidents, or kidney \ndisease.\n  Whether it is the fifth or eighth, we have been given a wake-up call. \nThe cost to our health care system and national economy from medical \nerrors is enormous.\n  The total cost, we are told by the Institute of Medicine, of injuries \ndue to medical errors is $17 billion to $29 billion annually. This \nestimate cannot accurately reflect the true personal cost to patients \nand their families when a diagnostic test is misread, a drug that is \nknown to cause an allergic reaction is prescribed, or a surgery goes \nawry.\n  One does not have to look too far for stories. I know some personally \nin my own family. Another came from one of my staff members who told me \nabout the disastrous outcome of a conventional gall bladder procedure \nperformed on her father in 1991.\n  It seems he went in for a laparoscopy and came out with a severed \nbile duct. The gall bladder was removed surgically, and the patient was \nsent home to recuperate. Within days, he experienced great abdominal \npain, could not eat, and began to lose weight. His wife is a \nnutritionist and could tell something was very wrong. They kept going \nback to the doctors who performed the surgery only to be told they \ncould not find anything wrong and that his problems were probably \npsychological.\n  Finally, in great frustration, the man and his wife turned to a \nneighbor, an old-fashioned country doctor who sent them to a surgeon \nfriend of his. Sure enough, this doctor discovered the problem and it \nwas corrected, but only after several months of pain and frustration.\n  Deaths from medication errors total more than 7,000 annually. These \nerrors erode the trust Americans have in their health care system.\n  Let me be clear, most medical errors that occur in our health care \nsystem are not the fault of any one individual or institution. We have \nthe best trained, most sophisticated health care workforce in the \nworld. Thousands of highly skilled and conscientious doctors, nurses, \npharmacists, and other medical professionals operate under tremendous \npressure and time constraints.\n\n  It is a complex problem which must be addressed with comprehensive \nsolutions and rigorous changes that will help providers better perform \ntheir jobs and prevent medical errors from happening in the future. It \nis a problem that is systemic, not personal.\n  Again, we must work together, in a bipartisan way, because all \nAmericans enjoy the right to be free from accidental injury, accidental \ndeath, and medication-related errors when they need care.\n  Again, I thank my distinguished chairman for his leadership on this \nissue, for putting this bill together. I am proud to be his chief \ncosponsor.\n  In closing, this Congress now has an opportunity to join together to \naddress a problem that has the potential to impact the life of every \ncitizen who seeks health care. I hope all of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle will join Senator Specter and me in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n  I yield the floor to my distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, for \nhis cosponsorship and his work on this very important piece of \nlegislation, coming principally out of the subcommittee which Senator \nHarkin is the ranking Democrat and which I chair.\n  There are other Senators who are working on legislation arising out \nof the Institute of Medicine report. There is no doubt that it is a \nproblem of enormous magnitude. It is a life-and-death matter. We have \ntaken the lead early to bring this legislation to the floor in the \nhopes that this will stimulate other ideas, other legislative \nproposals, so we may address this very serious issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON:\n  S. 2039. A bill to amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development \nAct to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to provide emergency \nloans to poultry producers to rebuild chicken houses destroyed by \ndisasters; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n               poultry farmer disaster relief act of 2000\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, last month we had a very serious, \nsevere snow and ice storm in Arkansas. It brought life in Arkansas to a \nhalt. Schools and businesses closed, airports, including the Little \nRock Airport, were snowed in, and highways were littered with hundreds \nof stranded motorists. It was not too unlike the situation we had in \nthe Nation's Capital, except it blanketed the entire State of Arkansas. \nFortunately, there were very few human fatalities that were reported, \nbut Arkansas's poultry farmers and the poultry industry suffered very \nheavy losses. Snow and ice built up on poultry houses across the State, \nand the sheer weight caused the roofs on almost 800 poultry houses to \ncollapse, killing an estimated 10.5 million chickens.\n  Dennis Richie, a poultry farmer in Nashville, AR, had six poultry \nhouses the morning of Thursday, January 27. By Friday evening, half of \nhis houses were destroyed, along with the income he needs to provide \nfor his family.\n  Hubert Hardin, another poultry farmer near Nashville, AR, and a \nsingle parent, lost all of his poultry houses in the storm. That means \nfewer options for him in supporting his family, his children.\n  The poultry industry is a pillar of Arkansas's agricultural industry \nand one of my State's leading employers. These losses represent a very \nreal danger to my constituents and to Arkansas's economy. That is why, \ntoday, I am introducing the Poultry Farmer Disaster Relief Act of 2000.\n  This bill would amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act \nto allow a loosening of the restrictions currently in place for \nemergency loans through FSA. It would allow active poultry producers \nwho were previously ineligible for insurance to apply for emergency \nloans through FSA. The current law prohibits growers whose structures \nwere uninsured from receiving these low-interest loans. If the \nindividuals did not seek insurance and chose to risk not insuring their \nstructures, they would not qualify.\n  Under the bill I am introducing, these folks, who tried to get \ninsurance, tried to do the responsible thing, tried to do the right \nthing and were unable to get insurance, would be allowed to qualify for \nthese low-interest loans. This act will also allow growers whose \nstructures were insured to apply for the same low-interest loans to \ncover the difference between what the houses were insured for and the \ncost of rebuilding their structures to current industry standards. It \nis very important for them to be able to do that. The need for \nupgrading poultry houses comes from the new regulations within the \nindustry. Many poultry producers must increase the size of their houses \nand improve the safety of their facilities to meet these new \nregulations.\n  Without the availability of these new low-interest loans to cover the \ndifference, FSA officials in Arkansas estimate almost half of the \ngrowers who lost houses will not be able to rebuild, that is, half of \nthe poultry growers would be out of the business and unable to rebuild \nunless we pass this legislation. Currently, the FSA requires those \nseeking these emergency loans to prove they are unable to obtain \nsufficient credit elsewhere before the loans are approved.\n  Due to the severity of the destruction and the impact it could have \non poultry producers throughout Arkansas, this bill waives that \nrequirement, should there be a disaster designation\n\n[[Page S492]]\n\nfrom the President. This would allow the victims of this storm to apply \nfor and receive aid in the most expeditious manner possible. Finally, \nthis bill would require farmers who receive these FSA loans to insure \nthe new structures.\n  Poultry farmers in Arkansas are critical to the survival of the \nState's agricultural economy. Losses such as those suffered last month \nnot only create financial hardships for the growers, but dramatic \ndisruptions for poultry processors.\n  I ask my colleagues to look favorably upon this relief bill. The \npoultry processors and growers in Arkansas and across this country \ndeserve that. It certainly is in an area where we had a natural \ndisaster that has affected literally thousands of individuals now in \nthe State. This is a compassionate act and something I trust we will \nact upon in an expeditious manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url":

Res. 254\n\n       Whereas for over 100 years, the Olympic movement has built \n     a more peaceful and better world by educating young people \n     through amateur athletics, by bringing together athletes from \n     many countries in friendly competition, and by forging new \n     relationships bound by friendship, solidarity, and fair play;\n       Whereas the United States Olympic Committee is dedicated to \n     coordinating and developing amateur athletic activity in the \n     United States to foster productive working relationships \n     among sports-related organizations;\n       Whereas the United States Olympic Committee promotes and \n     supports amateur athletic activities involving the United \n     States and foreign nations;\n       Whereas the United States Olympic Committee promotes and \n     encourages physical fitness and public participation in \n     amateur athletic activities;\n       Whereas the United States Olympic Committee assists \n     organizations and persons concerned with sports in the \n     development of athletic programs for amateur athletes;\n       Whereas the United States Olympic Committee protects the \n     opportunity of each amateur athlete, coach, trainer, manager, \n     administrator, and official to participate in amateur \n     athletic competition;\n       Whereas athletes representing the United States at the \n     Olympic Games have achieved great success personally and for \n     the Nation;\n       Whereas thousands of men and women of the United States are \n     focusing their energy and skill on becoming part of the \n     United States Olympic Team, and aspire to compete in the 2000 \n     Summer Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, and the 2002 \n     Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City, Utah;\n       Whereas the Nation takes great pride in the qualities of \n     commitment to excellence, grace under pressure, and good will \n     toward other competitors exhibited by the athletes of the \n     United States Olympic Team; and\n       Whereas June 23 is the anniversary of the founding of the \n     modern Olympic movement, representing the date on which the \n     Congress of Paris approved the proposal of Pierre de \n     Coubertin to found the modern Olympics: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of the Olympics;\n       (2) calls upon the President to issue a proclamation \n     recognizing the anniversary of the founding of the modern \n     Olympic movement; and\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     such anniversary with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce a resolution to \nrecognize and support the United States Olympic Committee and the 2000 \nOlympic Games.\n  There are several reasons why I have a particular interest in the \nOlympic Movement and the U.S. Olympic Committee. I am the only Olympian \nin the United States Senate and Congressman Jim Ryun and I are the only \ntwo current Members of Congress to have been members of an Olympic \nTeam.\n  Years ago, I founded the U.S. Olympic Caucus with former Senator Bill \nBradley and former Congressman Tom McMillan. In addition, the United \nStates Olympic Committee is headquartered in Colorado Springs, \nColorado, along with the Olympic Training Center. Many athletes are \ncurrently training at that facility for future Olympic Games and \nespecially in preparation for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, \nAustralia.\n  As I look back on the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan, I remember \nhow proud I was to be on the U.S. Olympic Team. Carrying the United \nStates flag in the closing ceremonies was one of the greatest \nexperiences of my life. I remember how proud I was to be an American \nand an Olympian. I hold that moment in my heart and relive it at each \nnew Olympic Games to this day.\n  The Olympic motto is ``Swifter, Higher, Stronger'' and with that \nideal, the Olympic Movement brings out the very best in all of us--\nathletes and spectators alike. I believe, along with the U.S. Olympic \nCommittee, that competition and the athletes are the heart and soul of \nthe Olympic Movement. This is the reason that I offer this resolution \ntoday.\n  The United States Olympic Committee is to be highly commended for the \nprompt and decisive action it took after accusations of inappropriate \nsolicitations surfaced. I know how much good the games do for young men \nand women and for our country. I am convinced the U.S. Olympic \nCommittee has done everything in its power to get to the bottom of \nallegations, punish those who deserve it, and return the focus of the \nOlympic Movement back where it should be, with the athletes.\n  Most people don't realize that unlike many of the world's Olympic \nteams, the U.S. Olympic Team gets not one dime of federal money to \nsubsidize its sports operations. Our Olympic Team is solely supported \nby the contributions of millions of Americans and American businesses \nand corporations which are dedicated to the Olympic Movement.\n  The Olympic Movement will endure and prosper only by the continued \nvigilance and the ongoing commitment of organizers and supporters, and \nby our unwavering support of the athletes who are the future of the \nmodern Olympic Games.\n  As we begin the countdown towards the first Olympic Games of the new \nmillennium, my resolution would designate June 23, 2000, as Olympic Day \nin recognition of the anniversary of the founding of the modern Olympic \nMovement. I urge my colleagues to support prompt passage of this \nresolution.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/08/senate-section/article/S494-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S494-S503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S494]]\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            THE NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      MURKOWSKI AMENDMENT NO. 2808\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for Mr. Murkowski) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. \n1287) to provide for the storage of spent nuclear fuel pending \ncompletion of the nuclear waste repository, and for other purposes; as \nfollows:\n\n       Beginning on page 1, strike all after the enacting clause \n     and insert the following:\n\n     ``SECTION 1.

They have also donated $4,000 to \nthe UAF National Merit Scholarship to encourage talented students to \nattend the University of Alaska-Fairbanks.\n  The class began in 1991, when then Chancellor O'Rourke transferred \n$100,000 of University endowment money into the Student Investment Fund \nat Dean Witter. The account has been wholly managed by the students \nsince its inception. Only during the first year of the fund did it fall \nbelow a value of $100,000. It has grown every year since and has a \nreturn of 71 percent.\n  This class and its philanthropy are wonderful examples of how higher \neducation can benefit not only students, but the entire \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/08/senate-section/article/S505-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CORRECTING TECHNICAL ERRORS IN THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 764\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to talk \nabout the budget the President has presented to Congress this year. \nEvery budget is a statement of priorities, and I wanted to share with \nmy colleagues how this budget matches up with the priorities of the \npeople I represent. I will spend a moment talking about how we should \nconsider budgets in this remarkable period of economic strength.\n  The President's FY 2001 budget comes at a time of great prosperity \nand also great challenges. I take the budget decisions we will make \nthis year very seriously. We have an historic opportunity to meet our \nlong-term commitments and make vital investments. In looking at the \nbudget, I am focused on two priorities.\n  First, we cannot squander the surplus. It has been too hard to reach \nthis point of progress. When I came to the Senate in 1993, our fiscal \nhouse was a mess. But we made the tough, fiscally responsible decisions \nthat have brought us to this point. The surplus is not here by \naccident. We made very difficult choices, and now is not the time to \nabandon our steady, responsible approach.\n  We have a responsibility to use the surplus in ways that will meet \nour long-term commitments and continue our economic growth. We know \nthat Social Security and Medicare are running out of money. These are \npromises from one generation to the next. And it would be wrong--\nfiscally and morally--not to save those programs while we have the \nchance.\n  We should also remember that these surplus projections are just \nthat--protections. I worry that some of the projections my Republican \ncolleagues have used are too rosy--in part because they are based on \nfaulty assumptions, and they do not account for any slowing down of our \neconomy. I think we should use the most realistic estimates available.\n  Second, we have to continue to make the responsible investments that \nwill help our economy grow. We must maintain our investments in areas \nlike education, R, infrastructure, criminal justice, agriculture, and \ndefense. We must strengthen Social Security and Medicare. And we must \nprovide targeted tax relief. I am pleased that the President has \npresented a responsible plan for meeting those objectives.\n  One important investment is paying down the debt. We are responsible \nfor paying down a major portion of the public debt. A commitment of \n$2.5 trillion over ten years--as called for by the President--would \nmake us debt free within 13 years. Mr. President, now is the time to \npay down the debt--while the economy is strong.\n  I know there will be a lot of debate over tax cuts this year. There \nis room for tax cuts--but they need to be responsible. We should \nremember that just last year Republicans were pushing an irresponsible, \n$790 billion tax cut. I am glad the American people rejected it. And \nthis year, some presidential candidates appear willing to roll the dice \non even riskier schemes.\n\n[[Page S506]]\n\n  This year we should be on the look out for tax cuts that do not help \nour country. When looking at tax cuts, I will be asking: Do they \ncontribute to our future and promote our economic growth by investing \nin workers and education?\n  I would like to turn to the investments we have to make in education.\n  When I think of the types of investments that have real returns for \nAmerica's families--education tops the list. Investing in education \npays dividends in boosting our country's productivity and expanding our \npeople's potential. We must continue to invest in education so that \nevery American will have the tools and skills to succeed in the global \neconomy. We know that by reducing class size, investing in teacher \nquality, and making higher education more accessible, we are improving \nthe prospects for our nation and our people. And I am proud of the many \neducation investments this budget makes.\n  We must stay on the path of hiring 100,000 fully-qualified teachers \nto reduce class size. We know that kids learn the basics and have fewer \ndiscipline problems in smaller classes. The budget boosts funding to \n$1.75 billion, an increase of $450 million over the current level. \nThat's enough to hire about 49,000 teachers, nearly half-way to our \nlong term goal. So I commend the president's budget for its commitment \nto reducing class size. By working together over the past two years, \nwe've already made the classroom a better, more productive place for \n1.7 million students--and with the President's latest commitment, we \ncan bring the benefits of smaller classes to many more students.\n  We know that when we reduce the number of students in each \nclassroom--we need more classrooms, so I am pleased the President's \nbudget also follows through on our efforts to boost school \nconstruction.\n  The President's budget also takes greats steps forward to improve \nteacher quality. As I listened to the President's State of the Union \nAddress last month, I was excited to see that efforts to boost teacher \nquality are finally getting the national attention they deserve.\n  We need to have a plan to recruit, train and reward great teachers; a \nplan to help high-poverty school districts attract great teachers \nthrough better pay and higher standards; and a plan to reward school \ndistricts that make progress in reducing the number of uncertified \nteachers and teachers teaching outside their subject area. These would \nall represent great steps forward.\n  We need to boost hometown teacher recruitment, to help professionals \nfrom diverse fields make the transition to the classroom, and to \npromote professional development for school leaders.\n  But there is more we should do to boost teacher quality. That's why, \nlast year, I introduced the Quality and Accountability are Best for \nChildren Act--Quality ABCs (S. 1926). After talking with parents, \nteachers and students, I wrote a bill that will hold educators \naccountable for their students' progress. It will help keep great \nteachers in the classroom by offering them improved professional \ndevelopment and career ladders. It will reward and recognize great \neducators. It will offer a meaningful financial bonus for states to \nimprove teacher pay and it will ensure teachers have the training they \nneed to use technology in the classroom.\n  I believe the President's budget--and his State of the Union \nAddress--are a great start to boosting teacher quality across America.\n  The President's budget also makes important investments in early \neducation, in Headstart funding, in preventing youth violence, and in \nexpanding college access.\n  Mr. President, clearly this is a budget that recognizes the \nimportance of education. It matches our funding with our priorities.\n  But there are some initiatives that do not require a budget \nallocation. And I would like to spend a moment highlighting some of the \nefforts I will fight for as we reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  First, there is a lot we can do to boost parental involvement. \nParents are a child's first and best teachers, and studies have shown \nthat when families are involved in education their children do better \nin school. Today, it is difficult for parents and family members to \nparticipate in their children's education--either because they do not \nfeel welcomed by schools or because their time is limited by work and \nother constraints.\n  That is why I've introduced two bills to make it easier for parents \nto help their children succeed in school.\n  First, I introduced the Time for Schools Act, S. 1304, which allows \nparents to take up to 24 hours of unpaid leave from work each year to \nattend academic events at school.\n  And second, with input from parents and teachers, I wrote the Parent-\nFamily School Partnership Act, S. 1772, which will encourage families \nto participate in schools, will train educators in the best ways to \ninvolve parents, will invest in family involvement efforts, and will \nuse technology and community college partnerships to boost parental \ninvolvement.\n  A great classroom and a great teacher only go so far, these bills \nwill go a long way to ensuring that students get the most from school \nby having a parent involved.\n  We should also do more to expand technology in the classroom. In \n1997, we made sure that new teachers get the technology training they \nneed before they enter the classroom. This year, we should work to make \nsure that current teachers receive technology training as part of an \non-going professional development. That effort is part of my ``Quality \nABCs'' bill that I just referred to.\n  And I support increasing resources for, and access to, education \ntechnology, improving coordination and effective uses of education \ntechnology--including distance learning and advanced placement \nservices. And finally, protecting students from inappropriate material \non the Internet.\n  We should offer students a voice in education decisions. I have \nalways believed that young people should have a role in the decisions \nthat affect them. That's why I introduced the ``Youth and Adult School \nPartnership Act,'' S. 1773, which will create more meaningful roles for \nstudents in their schools and communities, invest in successful \nstudent-adult partnerships, and continue researching the link between \nstudent involvement and student achievement.\n  Finally, we should promote the types of local partnerships that help \nstudents succeed. As I have visited schools throughout my State, I have \nbeen impressed by how well they have formed partnerships with local \nbusiness and non-profit organizations. I visited one community, where \nthe local chamber of commerce runs a Teacher Internship Program--where \nteachers spend their summers in the business world--seeing--first-\nhand--the skills their students will need. And those efforts can have \ngreat results for our students. So we must continue to promote these \nlocal partnerships.\n  I have laid out my vision--the Democratic vision--for how we can \nimprove public education. I have been working on this for many years, \nand it seems that the response from the other side is always ``Schools \nare failing, and local control is the answer.''\n  Education in our country is already under local control. I served on \na local school board, and I can tell you that as a fact. Do we need to \nreduce paperwork? Yes. Do we need to be more flexible? Yes. But the \nreal question is: What are we doing to support education? This budget--\nand the ideas I just mentioned--offer a specific blueprint--for how we \ncan improve education.\n  I fear that instead of giving these tools to our educators, the \nmajority would rather criticize our public schools.\n  Too often, their rhetoric tears down, when we should be building up. \nThe majority's education agenda too often resembles an effort to assign \nblame. I believe a better approach--the Democratic approach--is to \nstrengthen the partnerships that improve education.\n  We Democrats--in the Senate and the House along with the President--\nare offering something positive--and I hope that this agenda of \nexcellence is greeted by honest examination and constructive debate \nfocused on helping students learn--and not the usual partisan blame \ngame.\n  We have a chance to lead. We have a chance to really improve public \neducation for all Americans. Let's not\n\n[[Page S507]]\n\nabandon the principles that have made our nation great. Let's not let \npartisan gamesmanship stand in the way of progress. Let's take this \nunprecedented opportunity in our nation's history to make the \ninvestments we need, and to do right by our nation's parents, our \nnation's educators, and--most importantly--our nation's future--the \nchildren attending our public schools.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/08/senate-section/article/S507-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:30 A.M.
