Today, may the Senators count on You more than \nthey count votes. This is a time neither for gloating over victory nor \nfor grimness over losing, but rather a period for grief over all that \nhas brought us to this day. We are one Nation under You; we repent as a \nNation; we turn from conditional ethics and seek to return to the \nabsolutes of Your Commandments.\n  Thank You, Lord, for the clarion convictions expressed during this \ntrial by so many Senators of both parties that morals do matter and \ncharacter does count. May this shared, common commitment unite them as \nthey lead this Nation. Now, as their chaplain, I hold them all before \nYour grace and mercy; as their friend, I intercede for their spiritual \nstrength and courage. When the final votes are taken, hold them \ntogether in the oneness America so desperately needs them to exemplify. \nHelp them to model rectitude and reconciliation. By Your power, the \nwinner will be neither the Republicans nor the Democrats, but the \nAmerican people. In Your holy Name. Amen.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Sergeant at Arms will make the proclamation.\n  The Sergeant at Arms, James W. Ziglar, made proclamation as follows:\n\n       Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are commanded to \n     keep silent, on pain of imprisonment, while the Senate of the \n     United States is sitting for the trial of the articles of \n     impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives against \n     William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States.\n\n\n                              The Journal\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE.

Our best guess, at this time, leaves approximately 37 \nSenators still intending to speak. It is possible that we could \nconclude and have the final votes this afternoon or late this evening, \nbut I don't think that is going to be possible at this time. When we do \napproach that point, I would like to do it in an orderly fashion, that \nMembers and those who are interested will be given notice. We have some \nbusiness we would have to conclude, also, after all the deliberations \nhave been complete. I will confer throughout the day with Senator \nDaschle to see how it is going, and as soon as we can see clearly when \nwe would want to actually move to the final vote, we will notify all \nthe Senators.\n  We will also take a lunch break sometime today between 12 and 12:30, \nand we will have, of course, some breaks throughout the day to take \nsome refreshments.\n  I yield the floor to allow the Chief Justice to close the session.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE.

A bill to provide for offsetting tax cuts whenever there is \nan elimination of a discretionary spending program; to the Committee on \nthe Budget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant \nto order of August 4, 1977, with instructions that if one Committee \nreports, the other Committee have thirty days to report or be \ndischarged.\n\n\n                              paygo reform\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, \ncosponsored by several of my colleagues that would reform the current \npay-as-you-go financing mechanism of our federal government.\n  As a critical step to help reform the federal government, I believe \nthat we need to change Congressional Budget Rules that make it illegal \nto use cuts in inefficient government spending to pay for tax cuts. \nOver the past century, our budget rules have been written in a way that \nfavors spending over savings. We must fundamentally reform Pay-as-you-\ngo (PAYGO) financing this year beyond the current law understanding \nwhich effectively turns PAYGO off during periods of an on-budget \nsurplus.\n  Currently, according to PAYGO, Congress cannot make cuts in wasteful, \neven harmful government discretionary spending programs in order to \nfinance tax cuts. For example, we can't cut the Advanced Technology \nProgram in the Department of Commerce to pay for a capital gains tax \ncut. Rather, Congress has to make cuts in popular mandatory spending \nprograms like Social Security and Medicare in order to pay for its tax \ncuts. I believe it is wrong to pit Social Security and Medicare against \ntax cuts. We need to flip the table on this false trade off by pitting \ntax cuts against wasteful big government spending.\n  Such a change would amount to a paradigm shift in how government \nfunctions and would help limit the size of government while at the same \ntime providing additional resources for meaningful tax relief. The \nmachinery of government is constructed to spend. We need reengineering \nof government so that the machinery produces savings.\n  My bill would change budget law in order to allow for tax cuts to be \nimplemented in the amount of program eliminations. In practice, if we \nare able to eliminate a program during consideration of an \nappropriations measure, that money would be credited to the PAYGO \nscorecard and reserved for tax cuts.\n  Therefore, should my bill be enacted, we could eliminate programs \nlike the Advance Technology Program, the National Endowment for the \nArts, the Department of Commerce, and a whole host of other government \nprograms while at the same time giving the taxpayers the tax relief \nthey deserve--and we can do it without making draconian cuts to \nmandatory spending programs that ultimately do little to save the \nprograms and much to simply prolong the crisis.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the coming debate on budget process \nreforms. I look forward to the bill that is being considered jointly by \nthe Governmental Affairs and Budget Committees, and I look forward to \nworking with the chairmen of each in order to accomplish the type of \nbudget reform that we truly need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. \n        Chafee, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Graham, Mr. Mack, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n        Dorgan, and Mr. Burns).\n  S. 414. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na 5-year extension of the credit for producing electricity from wind, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                         wind energy tax credit\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nimportant tax legislation for myself and Senators Jeffords, Conrad, \nMurkowski, Leahy, Wellstone, Chafee, Smith of Oregon, Breaux, Graham, \nMack, Daschle, and Dorgan.\n  Our legislation extends the production tax credit for energy \ngenerated by wind. This proposed bill resembles bi-partisan legislation \nintroduced in November of 1998 that, unfortunately, was not enacted.\n  As original author of the Wind Energy Incentives Act of 1993, I \nstrongly believe that the expansion and development of wind energy must \nbe facilitated by this production tax credit.\n  The Senate has previously supported wind energy production tax credit \nlegislation. I would therefore like to request that Senators again \nconsider this valuable initiative that would help secure this untapped \npotential for clean power.\n  Wind, unlike most energy sources, is an efficient and environmentally \nsafe form of energy use. Wind is renewable and does not obligate the \nUnited States to rely on unstable foreign states for sources of energy.\n  This legislation extends the production tax credit through the month \nof June, 2004. We all know the damaging effects fossil fuels have on \nour environment. Wind energy, by contrast, is clean, safe, and abundant \nwithin the United States.\n  Every 10,000 megawatts of wind energy can reduce carbon monoxide \nemissions by 33 million metric tons. Today, the United States produces \nonly 1,700\n\n[[Page S1440]]\n\nmegawatts of wind energy. However, experts estimate that American wind \ncapacity can produce up to 30,000 megawatts by the year 2010--that is \nenough energy to meet the demands of over 10 million homes, while \nreducing pollution in every state.\n  The production tax credit has brought wind power generation costs \nalmost down to the same as coal and gas energy levels. In order to \ncontinue this investment in America's energy future, we must extend the \nproduction tax credit.\n  Currently, my own state of Iowa has 5 new wind power projects ready \nto go online just this year. These 5 projects, with the megawatt \ncapacity of over 240, join the already existing 6 facilities in Iowa. \nEven large petroleum producing states like Texas, ranked 2nd in the \nnation in wind energy potential, recognize the growing significance of \nwind power.\n  Renewing the wind tax credit would allow for greater expansion into \nthe wind energy field. These projects take a long time to develop and \nassured tax breaks would help facilitate more wind power construction \ncontracts. Withhold the tax credit and investment will surely decline \nfor new wind projects. This is because it takes as much as 3 years to \nobtain financing and permitting to build a new facility.\n  Wind is a domestic natural resource, found abundant in almost every \nstate. Wind is homegrown energy, that cannot be controlled by any \nforeign state or power. American lives need not be put at risk to \nprotect overseas sources of wind energy.\n  Wind energy can be harnessed without the detrimental effects of \nfossil fuel pollution. Wind is a stable and reliable form of power that \nis renewable and inextinguishable. This legislation ensures that wind \nenergy does not fall by the wayside as a productive alternative energy \nsource. The Senate needs to extend this important legislation and I \nencourage all my colleagues to join us in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                 S. 414\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. 5-YEAR EXTENSION OF CREDIT FOR PRODUCING \n                   ELECTRICITY FROM WIND.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (3) of section 45(c) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (defining qualified facility) \n     is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(3) Qualified facility.--The term `qualified facility' \n     means any facility owned by the taxpayer which is originally \n     placed in service--\n       ``(A) in the case of a facility using wind to produce \n     electricity, after December 31, 1993, and before July 1, \n     2004, and\n       ``(B) in the case of a facility using closed-loop biomass \n     to produce electricity, after December 31, 1992, and before \n     July 1, 1999.''.\n       (b) Credit Not To Apply to Electricity Sold to Utilities \n     Under Certain Contracts.--Subsection (b) of section 45 of \n     such Code is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(4) Credit not to apply to electricity sold to utilities \n     under certain contracts.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The credit determined under subsection \n     (a) shall not apply to electricity--\n       ``(i) produced at a qualified facility placed in service by \n     the taxpayer after June 30, 1999, and\n       ``(ii) sold to a utility pursuant to a contract originally \n     entered into before January 1, 1987 (whether or not amended \n     or restated after that date).\n       ``(B) Exception.--Subparagraph (A) shall not apply if--\n       ``(i) the prices for energy and capacity from such facility \n     are established pursuant to an amendment to the contract \n     referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii);\n       ``(ii) such amendment provides that the prices set forth in \n     the contract which exceed avoided cost prices determined at \n     the time of delviery shall apply only to annual quantities of \n     electricity (prorated for partial years) which do not exceed \n     the greater of--\n       ``(I) the average annual quantity of electricity sold to \n     the utility under the contract during calendar years 1994, \n     1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998, or\n       ``(II) the estimate of the annual electricity production \n     set forth in the contract, or, if there is no such estimate, \n     the greatest annual quantity of electricity sold to the \n     utility under the contract in any of the calendar years 1996, \n     1997, or 1998; and\n       ``(iii) such amendment provides that energy and capacity in \n     excess of the limitation in clause (ii) may be--\n       ``(I) sold to the utility only at prices that do not exceed \n     avoided cost prices determined at the time of delivery, or\n       ``(II) sold to a third party subject to a mutually agreed \n     upon advance notice to the utility.\n\n     For purposes of this subparagraph, avoided cost prices shall \n     be determined as provided for in 18 CFR 292.304(d)(1) or any \n     successor regulation.''.\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I stand today with my colleague from \nIowa, Senator Grassley and others, as an original co-sponsor of a bill, \nS. 414, that would provide alternative energy tax credits that will \nhelp our nation become a leader in environmentally sound energy usages.\n  As a nation, we consume more energy per capita than any other country \nin the world. However, because of available technology and efficient \nuse of our resources, we are also a leader in the use of \nenvironmentally-friendly practices.\n  Last year, President Clinton and Vice-President Gore expressed their \ninterest in ratification of the Kyoto Treaty. I am concerned about the \nimplications of applying the Kyoto Treaty to the U.S. economy.\n  The treaty, negotiated by 160 countries in December 1997, would \nrequire the United States to reduce its energy-related emissions 30-40 \npercent below levels otherwise projected for the years 2008-2012.\n  To enter into force, at least 55 nations representing 55 percent of \nthe industrial world's 1990 emissions must ratify the agreement. The \nU.S. plays a pivotal role. If the U.S. does not ratify, neither Japan \nnor the European Union will do so.\n  In July 1997, the Senate passed, 95-0, a resolution opposing any \nagreement that exempts developing countries from emission limits. The \nTreaty does so exempt such countries. Key developing countries such as \nChina, India, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea have refused to limit \ntheir emissions. These countries create a proportionately larger share \nof emissions than developed countries.\n  Therefore it would be unfair for the Congress to subject the Treaty \non the American taxpayer. I am further concerned that the Clinton \nAdministration led by Vice-President Gore signed the Kyoto Protocol \nannouncing plans to launch new Kyoto-friendly federal energy \nprocurement and transportation initiatives.\n  If implemented, Kyoto could: Increase gasoline prices up to 53% (up \nto $1.91/gallon); Increase electricity prices up to 86%; Eliminate up \nto 16 million U.S. jobs over the next six years.\n  The Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration \nconcludes that natural gas market share will increase from 14% to 33% \nby 2020 and coal market share will decrease dramatically.\n  Mr. President, I am very committed to reducing global emissions but I \nam also convinced that such actions must not be at the expense of U.S. \nenergy consumers. We have not given proper attention to a largely \nuntapped and unlimited resource--that resource being wind generated \npower and other alternative energy sources.\n  If you drive through our State, you will feel the power of our \nunharnessed wind. Our Northerly wind can at times present a danger \nalong the Rocky Mountain front, and certainly makes it's presence felt \njust about any time of the year.\n  The vast majority of wind development has been in California. \nHowever, many states have a much greater wind potential than \nCalifornia. Montana has an annual wind energy potential of 1,020 \nbillion kilo Watt hours and little has been done to harness that \nenergy. Such potential deserves exploration and that exploration needs \nto be fostered.\n  Congress is also responsible to help foster such growths in other \nalternative energy sources. Last year, I was very active in efforts to \nprovide for an extension of the ``placed-in-service'' date of the \nSection 29 tax credit. Although this tax credit does not expire until \n2008, it is important for Congress to allow new entrants to develop \ntheir technologies and build their facilities.\n  I look forward to pursuing this issue again this year. It will be a \ngreat addition to current legislation supporting energy tax credits for \noil and gas development. I would like to request the attached colloquy \nfrom last year regarding Section 29 tax credits between me and twelve \nof my colleagues be entered into the Record.\n  The colloquy follows:\n\n       Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the \n     intent of Congress regarding tax\n\n[[Page S1441]]\n\n     incentives for alternative fuels. These incentives are \n     important tools for our nation's long-term energy policy.\n       Starting with the energy crisis in the 1970s, Congress has \n     acted on numerous occasions to provide tax credits intended \n     to develop alternative fuels. Prior Congresses took these \n     steps in recognition of the need to encourage the development \n     and use of alternative fuels which promise that we as a \n     nation will never be dependent on others for our energy \n     resources. For example, Section 29, which expired earlier \n     this year, and Section 45, which is due to expire next June, \n     were both intended to encourage the development of \n     nonconventional fuels.\n       Today, our nation not only needs to continue its efforts to \n     develop alternative fuel resources, but given our ever \n     growing energy requirements, we must consider the \n     environmental impact that conventional and nonconventional \n     fuels have on our environment, particularly in light of the \n     Clean Air Act.\n       In order to maximize the most efficient use of our nation's \n     resources, Congress needs to commit to the development of \n     clean alternative fuels. We need also to use our nation's \n     technologies to develop environmentally clean alternative \n     liquid fuels from coal.\n       In Montana, we have vast coal reserves. There are \n     technologies that can upgrade the coal from these reserves \n     and reduce current difficulties associated with the \n     development of these fields. However, these technologies are \n     not likely to be developed, and therefore these vast natural \n     resources are not likely to be used, unless Congress provides \n     incentives to develop clean alternative fuels.\n       I am concerned that we have not been able to fully discuss \n     the merits of such incentives in our budget debate this past \n     month. For example, an extension of Section 29 was included \n     in the Senate version of the tax extenders, but that \n     provision was not included in the final package.\n       I would urge my colleagues to bring this debate to the \n     floor in the 106th Congress to ensure that the issue of \n     encouraging the development of clean alternative fuels is a \n     priority in our nation's energy policy.\n       Mr. LOTT. I agree with my colleague from Montana. As our \n     nation continues to seek ways to improve environmental \n     quality and to reduce the need for imported energy, several \n     new technologies run the risk of not being developed if \n     Congress does not act to provide incentives to develop clean \n     alternative fuels.\n       These technologies provide two significant benefits to our \n     nation. First, the use of alternative fuels reduces our \n     reliance on foreign energy sources. Second, the technologies \n     provide cleaner results for our environment.\n       For these reasons, I want to assure my colleague from \n     Montana that I will make a priority of addressing the need \n     for tax incentives to produce clean alternative fuels.\n       Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with my colleagues from Montana and \n     Mississippi about this very important issue. The development \n     and use of alternative fuels are important to this nation, \n     and we must encourage their use and development.\n       Wind energy has long been recognized as an abundant \n     potential source of electric power. A detailed analysis by \n     the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest Laboratory in \n     1991 estimated the energy potential of the U.S. wind resource \n     at 10.8 trillion kilowatt hours annually, or more than three \n     times total current U.S. electricity consumption. Wind energy \n     is a clean resource that produces electricity with virtually \n     no carbon dioxide emissions. There is nothing limited or \n     controversial about this source of energy. Americans need \n     only to make the necessary investments in order to capture it \n     for power.\n       The Production Tax Credit, section 45 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code was enacted as part of the Energy Policy Act of \n     1992. This tax credit is a sound low-cost investment in an \n     emerging sector of the energy industry. I introduced the \n     first bill that contained this tax credit, so you can be sure \n     that I am sincere in my belief in the need to develop this \n     resource. This tax credit currently provides a 1.5 cent per \n     kilowatt hour credit for energy produced from a new facility \n     brought on-line after December 31, 1993 and before July 1, \n     1999 for the first ten years of the facility's existence. \n     Last Fall, I introduced a bill to extend this tax credit for \n     five years. My legislation, S. 1459, currently has 22 \n     cosponsors, including half of the Finance Committee. The \n     House companion legislation, introduced by Congressman \n     Thomas, currently has 90 cosponsors, including over half of \n     the Ways and Means Committee. These numbers are a strong \n     testament to the importance of the section 45, and renewable \n     fuels in general.\n       In addition, I plan to work to expand this tax credit to \n     allow use of the closed-loop biomass portion of this tax \n     credit. Switchgrass from my state and other Midwestern \n     states, eucalyptus from the South, and other biomass, can be \n     grown for the exclusive purpose of producting energy. This is \n     a productive use of our land, and will be an important step \n     in our use and development of alternative and renewable \n     fuels.\n       I was very pleased to see that Congress expressed its \n     understanding of the importance of alternative and renewable \n     fuels by extending the ethanol tax credit in this year's T-2 \n     legislation. These tax credits are a successful way of \n     promoting alternative sources of energy. These tax credits \n     are a cheap investment with high returns for ourselves, our \n     children, our grandchildren and even their grandchildren. \n     Congress needs to again pass this important legislation to \n     ensure that these energy tax credits are extended into the \n     century.\n       Mr. MURKOWSKI. I concur with my colleagues. Implementation \n     of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments is creating a real need \n     to develop clean alternative fuels.\n       For example, of the 64 remaining U.S. coke batteries, 58 \n     are subject to closure as a result of the Clean Air Act. The \n     steel industry can either use limited capital to build new \n     clean coking facilities  or they can choose to import coke \n     from China, which uses 50 year old highly pollutant \n     technologies. Restoring the section 29 credit to encourage \n     cleaner coker technologies will greatly reduce emissions \n     and will slow our increasing dependence on foreign coke, \n     at the same time creating jobs in the United States in \n     both the steel and coal mining industries.\n       In addition, the United States has rich deposits of lignite \n     and sub-bituminous coals. There are new technologies that can \n     upgrade these coals to make them burn efficiently and \n     economically, while at the same time significantly reducing \n     air pollution.\n       This is proven technology, but to make the development of \n     this technology throughout the nation feasible, the Congress \n     needs to provide tax incentives.\n       Mr. ENZI. The people of Wyoming have always had very strong \n     ties to our land. That is why the words ``Livestock, Oil, \n     Grain and Mines'' appear on our state seal. Those words \n     clearly reflect the importance of our natural resources to \n     the people of my state, and our commitment to using our \n     abundant natural resources wisely and for the benefit of \n     current and future generations of Wyomingites and the people \n     of this country.\n       Congress has determined the need to find newer and cleaner \n     technologies. Wyoming is blessed with an abundance of clean \n     burning coal reserves. It would seem to be a perfect match. \n     We are eager to provide what is needed for our country's \n     present and future fuel needs. But those reserves aren't \n     likely to be developed unless we provide the incentives \n     necessary to make it possible for the coal to be harvested in \n     a safe and environmentally friendly manner.\n       Mr. ABRAHAM. I concur with my colleagues. The development \n     and production of alternative fuels provides a real \n     opportunity for the country to improve the environment while \n     ensuring a constant, reasonably priced fuel supply. But \n     recent efforts to provide such assurances have been hampered. \n     For example, in the Small Business Job Protection Act of \n     1996, Congress extended the placed-in-service date for \n     facilities producing synthetic fuels from coal, and gas from \n     biomass for eighteen months.\n       However, progress in bringing certain facilities up to full \n     production has been hampered by the Administration's 1997 \n     proposal to shorten the placed-in-service date and because, \n     in many cases, the technology used to produce the fuels is \n     new. Such delays have created uncertainty regarding the \n     facilities eligibility under the placed-in-service \n     requirement of section 29.\n       While it is important that the Congress consider again this \n     issue in the 106th Congress, I would also urge the Secretary \n     to consider the facilities I mentioned qualified under \n     Section 29 if they met the Service's criteria for placed-in-\n     service by June 30, 1998 whether or not such facilities were \n     consistently producing commercial quantities of marketable \n     products on a daily basis.\n       Mr. CONRAD. I agree with my colleagues. Through the section \n     29 tax credit for nonconventional fuels, Congress has \n     supported the development of environmentally friendly \n     fuels from domestic biomass and coal resources. There are \n     lignite resources in my state that could compete in the \n     energy marketplace if we can find a reasonable incentive \n     for the investment in the necessary technology. As soon as \n     possible in the 106th Congress, I hope we will give this \n     crucial subject the attention it deserves.\n       Mr. HATCH. I concur with my colleagues. This is a very \n     important tax credit for alternative fuels. It is an issue of \n     fairness, not one of corporate welfare.\n       Earlier this year I, along with 18 of my colleagues, \n     introduced a bill that would extend for eight months the \n     placed-in-service date for coal and biomass facilities. The \n     need still exists to extend this date and I am very \n     disappointed that this was not included.\n       Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in \n     supporting tax incentives for alternative fuels. Our country \n     has assumed a leadership role in the reduction of greenhouse \n     gases because of the global importance of pollution \n     reduction. As my colleagues have also pointed out, promotion \n     of alternative fuels is not just an environmental issue, but \n     an issue important to our domestic economy and independence \n     as well. We cannot afford to slip back toward policies which \n     will leave us dependent upon foreign sources of oil for our \n     economic growth.\n       With the huge reserves of coal and lignite in the United \n     States and around the world, as well as the tremendous \n     potential for use of biomass, wind energy, and other \n     alternatives, it is particularly important to our economy and \n     the world's environment that new, more environmentally \n     friendly fuels are brought to market here and in developing \n     nations.\n       But bringing new technologies to market is financially \n     risky. In particular, finding investors to take a new \n     technology from the laboratory to the market is difficult \n     because so many technical problems need full-scale testing \n     and operations to resolve. Few investors are prepared to take \n     on the risks associated with bringing a first-of-a-kind, \n     full-\n\n[[Page S1442]]\n\n     sized alternative energy production facility on-line without \n     some level of security provided by a partnership with the \n     federal government.\n       Tax incentives represent our government's willingness to \n     work with the private sector as a partner to bring new, clean \n     energy technologies to the market. These incentives \n     demonstrate our country's commitment to the future.\n       Mr. GRAHAM. There are two principal reasons I support \n     extension of sections 29 and 45. First, in a period where \n     America is continuing to increase its dependence on foreign \n     oil, we need to develop alternative fuel technologies to \n     prepare for the day when foreign supply of oil is reduced. \n     These tax credits have spurred the production of fuel from \n     sources as diverse as biomass, coal, and wind. America will \n     desperately need fuel from these domestic sources when \n     foreign producers reduce imports. Second, the alternative \n     fuels that earn these tax credits are clean fuels. For \n     example, the capture and reuse of landfill methane \n     prevents the methane from escaping into the atmosphere. I \n     will support my colleagues in an effort next year to \n     extend these provisions.\n       Mr. THURMOND. I join my colleagues in support of extending \n     the tax credit for Fuel Production from Nonconventional \n     Sources. Through this credit, Congress has emphasized the \n     importance of establishing alternative energy sources, \n     furthering economic development, and protecting the \n     environment. The alternative fuels credit strikes a proper \n     balance between each of these objectives. I support efforts \n     to bring this issue to a satisfactory conclusion, early in \n     the next Congress.\n       Mr. THOMAS. I strongly agree with my colleagues regarding \n     the importance of the Section 29 tax credit. Wyoming has some \n     of the nation's largest coal reserves and this tax credit \n     gives producers an incentive to develop new and innovative \n     technologies for the use of coal. I am disappointed that an \n     extension of the Section 29 tax credit was not included in \n     the Omnibus Appropriations package and urge my colleagues to \n     make this matter a top priority during the 106th Congress.\n       Mr. ROTH. I understand my colleagues' concerns. For some \n     time now I have been studying how to provide targeted \n     incentives to develop clean alternative fuels. It is \n     essential for Congress to develop sound tax policy for \n     alternative energy to help protect our environment. Several \n     weeks ago, I introduced legislation to provide such \n     incentives for facilities that produce energy from poultry \n     waste. I look forward to working with my colleagues on these \n     issues early in the 106th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 415. A bill to protect the permanent trust funds of the State of \nArizona from erosion due to inflation and modify the basis on which \ndistributions are made from those funds; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n             ARIZONA STATEHOOD AND ENABLING ACT AMENDMENTS\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this Sunday, February 14, 1999, marks \nthe eighty-seventh anniversary of the granting of statehood to the \ngreat state of Arizona. On this historic occasion, I propose to amend, \nwith the attached bill, the act of Congress which in 1910 set in motion \nArizona's entry into the Union. The proposed amendment makes two small \nbut important modifications to the Arizona Enabling Act relating to the \nadministration of state trust funds. These changes have been requested \nby Governor Hull, the state legislature, and the citizens of Arizona.\n  Mr. President, the Arizona Enabling Act required the state to \nestablish a permanent fund collecting the proceeds of the sale of trust \nland and the land's mineral and other natural products. The principal \nof the fund is not expendable for any purpose. Instead, it is invested \nin interest-bearing securities, and the interest is used to support the \nfinancial needs of the beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, Arizona is currently prevented from maximizing the \nbenefits of the permanent fund. The state could improve management, and \ngenerate more revenues for the beneficiaries, by gaining authorization \nto invest part of the fund in stocks, and to reinvest some earnings to \noffset inflation. This amendment would allow the state treasurer to \npreserve the real value of the fund by reinvesting an amount equal to \nthe rate of inflation, thereby providing higher payments to \nbeneficiaries over time. This amendment is similar to the change that \nwas granted to New Mexico in 1997. It was approved by Arizona voters on \nNovember 3, 1998.\n  Mr. President, the second modification to the Arizona Enabling Act \ncontained in this bill would allow the state to expend monies from the \nMiners' Hospital Endowment Fund to benefit the Arizona Pioneers' Home. \nCurrent law prohibits the commingling of funds associated with state-\ntrust lands. Insufficient funds exist in the Miners' Hospital Endowment \nFund to build and operate a separate hospital for disabled miners, but \ndisabled miners have been cared for at the Arizona Pioneers' Home since \n1929. Miners who meet the statutory admission requirements for the \nHospital for Disabled Miners will continue to be admitted to the \nArizona Pioneers' Home on a priority basis.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                 S. 415\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Arizona Statehood and \n     Enabling Act Amendments of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROTECTION OF TRUST FUNDS OF STATE OF ARIZONA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 28 of the Act of June 20, 1910 (36 \n     Stat. 574, chapter 310) (as amended by section 2 of Public \n     Law 85-180 (71 Stat. 457)) is amended in the first paragraph \n     by adding at the end the following: ``The trust funds \n     (including all interest, dividends, other income, and \n     appreciation in the market value of assets of the funds) \n     shall be prudently invested on a total rate of return basis. \n     Distributions from the trust funds shall be made as provided \n     in Article 10, Section 7 of the Constitution of the State of \n     Arizona.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) Section 25 of the Act of June 20, 1910 (36 Stat. 573, \n     chapter 310), is amended in the proviso of the second \n     paragraph by striking ``the income therefrom only to be \n     used'' and inserting ``distributions from which shall be made \n     in accordance with the first paragraph of section 28 and \n     shall be used''.\n       (2) Section 27 of the Act of June 20, 1910 (36 Stat. 574, \n     chapter 310), is amended by striking ``the interest of which \n     only shall be expended'' and inserting ``distributions from \n     which shall be made in accordance with the first paragraph of \n     section 28 and shall be expended''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

CONSENT OF CONGRESS TO AMENDMENTS TO CONSTITUTION OF \n                   STATE OF ARIZONA.\n\n       Congress consents to the amendments to the Constitution of \n     the State of Arizona proposed by Senate Concurrent Resolution \n     1007 of the 43rd Legislature of the State of Arizona, Second \n     Regular Session, 1998, entitled ``Senate Concurrent \n     Resolution requesting the Secretary of State to return Senate \n     Concurrent Resolution 1018, Forty-Third Legislature, First \n     Regular Session, to the Legislature and submit the \n     Proposition contained in Sections 3, 4, and 5 of this \n     Resolution of the proposed amendments to Article IX, Section \n     7, Article X, Section 7, and Article XI, Section 8, \n     Constitution of Arizona, to the voters; relating to \n     investment of State monies'', approved by the voters of the \n     State of Arizona on November 3, 1998.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 416. A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to convey the \ncity of Sisters, Oregon, a certain parcel of land for use in connection \nwith a sewage treatment facility; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                         a solution for sisters\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am proud to \nintroduce legislation that will enable the city of Sisters, Oregon, to \nobtain Federal lands for the purpose of constructing a sewage treatment \nfacility. The federal government will benefit directly from this \nfacility, and we have the opportunity to show that we can be good \nneighbors and help solve local problems. This legislation, and the \napproach I have taken to provide a funding mechanism to benefit natural \nresources in the area, has broad support in the local community and the \nsurrounding region.\n  The city of Sisters, Oregon, is facing both environmental and public \nhealth problems due to the lack of a sewer system. Currently, all of \nthe homes and businesses inside the city limits must use septic \nsystems. In the summer, in order to accommodate tourists who often \nrecreate in the surrounding federal lands, the city must place \napproximately sixty portable toilets throughout the town. Deschutes \nCounty has\n\n[[Page S1443]]\n\nhad to develop alternatives to established regulations for septic \nsystems in order to continue use of some properties.\n  There are ongoing concerns about a possible outbreak of infectious \ndiseases from failed and leaking septic systems, and of groundwater \ncontamination. Obviously, this is a situation that cannot continue.\n  Fortunately, the city has risen to the challenge. In 1998, the 775 \nresidents of Sisters voted to issue up to seven million dollars in \nbonds to construct a sewer system and a wastewater treatment facility \nto service their municipality. This vote was noteworthy because Sisters \nis the fourth most economically depressed city in Oregon. Sixty-one \npercent of the town's residents are considered low to moderate income \nand the average annual income is $17,188.\n  While the city has put together a financing package of approximately \ntwelve million dollars, this financing package does not include funds \nfor land acquisition. Additional funds to acquire the land for the \ntreatment facility and for the disposition of the treated wastewater \nare beyond the resident's ability to pay, and pose a huge financial \nburden. There is a long-standing recognition in federal law, both in \nthe Townsite Act and in the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, that in \nsome instances the transfer of land out of federal ownership to serve \ncommunity objectives outweighs the goals of maintaining such a tract in \nfederal ownership.\n  This is definitely one of those cases. The city of Sisters is \nliterally surrounded by land managed by the Forest Service. After \nexamining numerous other non-federal sites in or near the city, it was \ndetermined that this parcel is large enough, and has the proper soil \nconditions for disposing of the treated wastewater.\n  I am proud to sponsor legislation that will not only resolve the \ncity's public health threat, but will benefit all the parties involved. \nMy bill calls for the Forest Service to convey land for the facilities \nat no cost to the city of Sisters. The legislation also stipulates \nthat, at the option of the United States, the land would revert to the \nForest Service upon termination of the specified uses.\n  In return, the Forest Service will benefit from the treatment \nfacilities themselves, as well as from improved environmental \nconditions. The Forest Service currently maintains eleven separate \nseptic systems in the city to serve existing administrative buildings. \nSince the Forest Service administers seventy-seven acres of land within \nthe city limits, the federal government will benefit from the expected \nincrease in land values directly attributable to the sewer system.\n  In order to capture some of this enhanced value for the benefit of \nthe environment, the Forest Service will also be required to sell no \nless than six acres of the unimproved administrative lands within the \ncity limits. The bill stipulates that the sale be at fair market value \nwithin three years of the enactment of the Act.\n  Most of the revenue from this sale will be used for activities which \nare directly related to improving the long-term conditions in the \nwatershed of Squaw Creek, a tributary of the Deschutes River. The \nremainder, not to exceed twenty-five percent, may be used for \nadministrative improvements by the Sisters Ranger District.\n  My legislation makes sense. It is a win-win solution that helps both \nthe community of Sisters and the environment. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport its early consideration by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be included in the \nRecord.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                 S. 416\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the city of Sisters, Oregon, faces a public health \n     threat from a major outbreak of infectious diseases due to \n     the lack of a sewer system;\n       (2) the lack of a sewer system also threatens groundwater \n     and surface water resources in the area;\n       (3) the city is surrounded by Forest Service land and has \n     no reasonable access to non-Federal parcels of land large \n     enough, and with the proper soil conditions, for the \n     development of a sewage treatment facility;\n       (4) the Forest Service currently must operate, maintain, \n     and replace 11 separate septic systems to serve existing \n     Forest Service facilities in the city of Sisters; and\n       (5) the Forest Service currently administers 77 acres of \n     land within the city limits that would increase in value as a \n     result of construction of a sewer system.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONVEYANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall \n     convey to the city of Sisters, Oregon, at no cost to the city \n     except the cost of preparation of any documents required by \n     any environmental law in connection with the conveyance, the \n     parcel of land described in subsection (b).\n       (b) Land Description.--The land described in this \n     subsection is the parcel of land located in--\n       (1) the SE quarter of section 09, township 15 south, range \n     10 west, W.M., Deschutes, Oregon, and the portion of the SW \n     quarter of section 09, township 15 south, range 10 west, \n     W.M., Deschutes, Oregon, that lies east of Three Creeks Lake \n     Road, but not including the westernmost 500 feet of that \n     portion; and\n       (2) the portion of the SW quarter of section 09, township \n     15 south, range 10 west, W.M., Deschutes County, Oregon, \n     lying easterly of Three Creeks Lake Road.\n       (c) Condition.--The conveyance under subsection (a) shall \n     be made on the condition that the city agree to conduct a \n     public process before the final determination is made \n     regarding land use for the disposition of treated effluent.\n       (d) Special Use Permit.--Not later than 120 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, in compliance with applicable \n     environmental laws (including regulations), the Secretary \n     shall issue a special use permit for the land conveyed under \n     subsection (a) that allows the city access to the land for \n     the purpose of commencing construction of the sewage \n     treatment plant.\n       (e) Use of Land.--\n       (1) In general.--The land conveyed under subsection (a) \n     shall be used by the city for a sewage treatment facility and \n     for the disposal of treated effluent.\n       (2) Optional reverter.--If at any time the land conveyed \n     under subsection (a) ceases to be used for a purpose \n     described in paragraph (1), at the option of the United \n     States, title to the land shall revert to the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

There \n     are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary \n     to prepare the sale.\n       (b) Deposit of Proceeds.--The Secretary shall deposit the \n     proceeds of a sale under subsection (a) in the fund \n     established by Public Law 90-171 (commonly known as the \n     ``Sisk Act'') (16 U.S.C. 484a).\n       (c) Use of Proceeds.--\n       (1) In general.--Funds deposited under subsection (b) shall \n     be available for expenditure, without further Act of \n     appropriation, as follows:\n       (A) Not more than 25 percent shall be available for \n     administrative improvements at the Sisters Ranger District.\n       (B) The remainder shall be available for purposes that are \n     directly related to improving the long-term condition of the \n     watershed of Squaw Creek, a tributary of the Deschutes River, \n     Oregon.\n       (2) Method of expenditure.--The supervisor of the Deschutes \n     National Forest may expend funds deposited under subsection \n     (b) directly or may provide the funds in the form of grants \n     to local watershed councils, including the Working Group (as \n     defined in section 1025(a) of division I of the Omnibus Parks \n     and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 (110 Stat. \n     4226)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN:\n  S. 417. A bill to amend title 28 of the United States Code to bar any \ncivil trial involving the President until after the President vacates \noffice, but to allow for sealed discovery during the time the President \nis in office; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n  LEGISLATION TO LIMIT FUTURE PRESIDENTS' EXPOSURE TO CIVIL LAWSUITS \n                          WHILE HOLDING OFFICE\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill \nthat is aimed at averting much of what has happened over nearly two \nmonths of this year and all of the last by amending Title 28 of the \nUnited States Code. Modeled on our existing Soldiers and Sailors Civil \nRelief Act of 1940 that forbids civil lawsuits being filed by or \nagainst our men and women while they are in uniform, my bill seeks to \nprotect future sitting Presidents from the ravages of civil litigation \narising from acts taken or deeds done before they assumed office.\n  I do not do this to insulate our current President but to accept an \ninvitation Justice Stevens and his colleagues extended to us nearly two \nyears ago in the case of Jones versus Clinton when the Supreme Court \nheld that a sitting President could be sued civilly for acts he \nallegedly committed before assuming office. In that opinion, Justice \nStevens wrote that it was up to Congress,\n\n[[Page S1444]]\n\nnot the Supreme Court, to afford a sitting President more protection \nfrom civil lawsuits.\n  But this bill is not about President Clinton. For as Edmund Burke \nobserved when analyzing the causes of the political discontents of the \n1760s in England ``this system has not arisen soley from the ambitions \nof Lord Butte . . . we should have been tried with it if the Earl of \nButte had never existed.''\n  As Justice Robert Jackson pointed out over forty years ago, the \nPresidency concentrates this nation's Executive authority in a single \nperson whose choice the entire nation has a part, making him the force \nof public hope and expectations and whose decisions so far overshadow \nany other that ``almost alone he fills the public eye and ear.'' The \nFounders fashioned this kind of Presidency because they wanted to \nfocus, not spread, executive responsibility in the hands of a single, \nconstitutionally indispensable, individual. They realized that any \ninterference with a President's ability to carry out his public \nresponsibilities is constitutionally equal to interfering with the \nability of the entire Congress or the whole Judiciary to carry out \ntheir public obligations.\n  Moreover, the Presidency is the only office that the Constitution \nrequires to be always functioning. It knows no recesses or terms. \nBecause of this and the singular import of a President's duties, the \ndiversion of his energies by litigation raises unique risks to the \neffective functioning of our government.\n  As Thomas Jefferson warned in a June 20, 1807, letter to George Hay \nin the midst of Aaron Burr's trial in Richmond, unfettered litigation \ncan pull a sitting President from pillar to post and keep him \nconstantly trudging from north to south and east to west, withdrawing \nhim from his constitutional duties.\n  On the other hand, I do not believe in the ancient prerogatives of \nthe monarchs who asserted ``the King can do no wrong.'' We rejected \nthis when we formed our republic over 200 years ago. Under my bill, a \nlitigant can still file his or her claim and exercise his or her \ndiscovery rights. This will preserve the litigant's claims and evidence \nbut stay his or her ability to conduct a full-blown trial. This can be \ndone after a sitting President leaves office. Then, like any other \ncitizen, he will be subject to the full sway of our courts and their \nprocesses.\n  I do not want to truncate anyone's legal rights or privileges, and my \nbill does not do so. Rather, it aims to balance these rights with our \ncountry's vital need for a focused Chief Executive not being dragged \nfrom pillar to post.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 418. A bill for the relief of Nancy B. Wilson; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                          private relief bill\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the \ndistinguished senior Senator from the State of Maine, Senator Snowe, in \nintroducing private relief legislation for Nancy B. Wilson.\n  By way of background, Al Wilson worked for Liberty Mutual Insurance \nCompany, and he and his wife Edna had two children. In 1945, tragedy \nstuck the family when Edna suffered a severe mental breakdown and was \npermanently placed in a mental institution, leaving Al to care for the \nchildren.\n  Five years later, Al met Nancy Butler, who immediately began caring \nfor Al's two young children, as well as her son. Nancy took residence \nwith Al and soon began to raise the children as her own. The eldest \nchild has written that Nancy ``is the person who brought me up in place \nof my biological mother, who was institutionalized. I think of Nancy as \nmy real mother.''\n  Al and Nancy wanted to get married, but Al was prohibited from \ndivorcing Edna by a Massachusetts state law. The law barred a divorce \nfor reasons of insanity or institutionalization for insanity. The \nCongressional Research Service confirmed that a ``divorce could not \nhave been granted under Massachusetts law during the 1960's and 1970's \nsolely because one spouse was insane.''\n  On April 12, 1969, Edna Wilson died. Twenty days later, on May 2, \n1969, Nancy and Al were married. Al died of cancer seven months later \non December 5, 1969. Nancy had lived with Al for 19 years.\n  Upon turning sixty-four years old on March 21, 1991, Nancy applied to \nthe Social Security Administration for survivor insurance benefits from \nAl's wage earnings. She was refused benefits based upon the limited \nterm of her legal marriage. According to Social Security regulations, a \ncouple must be married for at least nine months for a spouse to collect \nsurvivor benefits.\n  Nancy has exhausted the available legal remedies, taking full \nadvantage of the administrative appeals process. Nancy filed a request \nfor reconsideration and appeared at a hearing before an administrative \nlaw judge. On January 28, 1992, the Social Security Administration \nissued its final decision denying her claim for benefits.\n  The private relief bill we are introducing would allow Nancy to \nreceive widow's benefits from her husband's earnings. Nancy Wilson was, \nfor all practical purposes, married to Al Wilson. She cohabited with \nhim for nineteen years prior to their marriage. She raised his \nchildren, allowing him to work and accumulate a Social Security \nbenefit. Nancy and Al were legally prevented from marrying by \nMassachusetts state law, even though his marriage with his first wife \nhad essentially ended.\n  Mr. President, the unique circumstances of Mrs. Wilson epitomize why \nCongress has the power to enact private relief legislation. Her \nsituation fulfills the intent of the Social Security Act. Al and Nancy \nwere prohibited from marrying; clearly they would have if the law \nallowed them to do so. This unique situation is an exception that will \nnot be repeated. Since their marriage, a no-fault divorce statute has \nbeen enacted in Massachusetts, which prevents this situation from \noccurring again. Mrs. Wilson's case is a compelling one which we \nbelieve the Senate should alleviate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 420. A bill to provide a mandatory minimum sentence for State \ncrimes involving the use of a firearm, impose work requirements for \nprisoners, and prohibit the provision of luxury items to prisoners; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n Legislation to establish mandatory minimum sentences for State crimes \n                    involving the use of a firearm.\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nwhich will establish a mandatory minimum sentence for State crimes \ninvolving the use of a firearm. This bill also imposes work \nrequirements for prisoners and prohibits the government from providing \nsuch amenities as televisions, stereos, or other amenities in the cell \nof any inmate.\n  As a staunch supporter of the 2nd Amendment, I believe laws are \nneeded to punish criminals, without imposing on a law-abiding person's \nright to own a firearm. This legislation would not apply to individuals \nwho use a firearm in self-defense. It applies only to criminals who are \nconvicted of committing a crime of violence which is punishable for a \nyear in jail. Because it is not illegal to defend oneself, individuals \nwho use firearms in self-defense are not subject to the provisions of \nthis bill, nor would they be incarcerated for a year or more for \nproperly defending themselves. This bill states clearly that the \nsentences apply only after a criminal is convicted of a crime. As such, \nthis bill poses absolutely no threat to individuals who use firearms \nlegally, including as a means to defend themselves.\n  The most important domestic function of the Federal government is the \nprotection of the personal security of individual Americans through the \nenactment and enforcement of laws against criminal behavior. Tough \nFederal laws, such as mandatory minimum prison sentences for violent \ncrimes committed with a firearm and truth-in-sentencing, would serve as \ndeterrents to persons who might be disposed to commit violent crimes.\n  It is also important to keep in mind, the penalties of this bill \napply only after a criminal has been convicted, they are not available \nto a prosecutor until after the state investigation has been completed \nand the case is closed. Therefore, federal law enforcement agencies are \ngiven no role in the state's investigation and no authority in state \njurisdictions. This prevents Federal\n\n[[Page S1445]]\n\nAgencies from imposing itself on the jurisdictions of the states. In \naddition, my bill clearly states that the bill is not intended to \nsupplant the efforts of states to curtail violent crime and that the \nAttorney General must given ``due deference'' to state and local \nprosecutors in their work.\n  This legislation is also needed to ensure prisons remain punitive and \ndo not digress further into vacation locations. With passage of this \nlegislation, the Attorney General will implement and enforce \nregulations mandating prison work for all able-bodied inmates in \nFederal correctional institutions. These regulations will also prohibit \nthe Federal Government from providing televisions, radios, stereos, and \nother similar amenities in the cell of any inmate.\n  I would encourage my colleagues, who are serious about combating \ncrime, to join me as a co-sponsor of this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (by request):\n  S. 421. A bill to approve a mutual settlement of the Water Rights of \nthe Gila River Indian Community and the United States, on behalf of the \nCommunity and the Allottees, and Phelps Dodge Corporation, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\nThe Gila River Indian Community--Phelps Dodge Corporation Water Rights \n                         Settlement Act of 1999\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nauthorize an Indian water rights settlement agreement that was entered \ninto on May 4, 1998 by the Gila River Indian Community of Arizona and \nthe Phelps Dodge Corporation.\n  This bill is identical to the legislation I introduced in the last \nsession of Congress. As I said upon introduction last year, this \nparticular settlement is part of a much larger, comprehensive \nsettlement process that will eventually settle all claims of the Gila \nRiver Indian Community. I strongly endorse the settlement process and \nwant to encourage all parties to continue their negotiations. Although \nI am introducing this measure today as free-standing legislation, it is \ninextricably linked to the outcome of the rest of the negotiations. So \nwhile I am encouraged by the settlement process, I am not yet \ncomfortable with pieces of it moving independently.\n  As I did last session, I put this bill on the table so that all \ninterested parties may have a document around which to gather and \ncontinue their conversations. While this particular piece of the \nsettlement may be further along than others, I do not want to see \npieces move separately.

A bill to provide for Alaska state jurisdiction over small \nhydroelectric projects; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                           Energy Legislation\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am today introducing \nlegislation to allow the State of Alaska to take responsibility for \nregulating small (5 megawatts or less) hydroelectric projects located \nin Alaska. This legislation is identical to section 1 of S. 439 in the \n105th Congress, which was reported unanimously by the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources and was passed unanimously by the Senate. \nUnfortunately, because the Senate passed the legislation late in the \nsession, the House did not have time to act before Congress adjourned.\n  Let me describe why this legislation is needed. Simply put, FERC's \nlicensing process is too expensive and too cumbersome for many small \nhydroelectric projects in Alaska. For a large project costing tens or \nhundreds of millions of dollars the burden of obtaining a FERC license \nis large, but relatively small as compared to the total cost. However, \nfor a small project located in a remote region of Alaska, FERC's \nlicensing process is a major problem. All\n\n[[Page S1447]]\n\ntoo often, the burden of the licensing process alone dooms an otherwise \neconomically viable and environmentally beneficial project. And those \nsmall hydro projects it does not doom, FERC's process increases \nsignificantly their cost--which is just passed on to consumers in terms \nof higher electricity rates.\n  For other States this may not be very significant, but it is for \nAlaska. Alaska already has the most expensive electricity in the United \nStates. Alaska's average residential price of electricity is 36 percent \nhigher than the U.S. average, and in some parts of Alaska the \nresidential price reaches a stunning 43 cents per kilowatt hour--5 \ntimes the U.S. average. Why so expensive? Primarily because it is \nproduced by diesel generators, which are both relatively inefficient \nand use expensive fuel. Compared to diesel generators, hydroelectric \npower is much less expensive.\n  It is important to note that hydroelectric power is much more \nenvironmentally benign as compared to diesel-fired generation: \nHydroelectric generation produces no air emissions as does diesel-fired \ngeneration. Thus, anything we can do to promote the construction of \nhydroelectric projects will also help the environment of Alaska.\n  In this connection, it is also important to note that this \nlegislation does not exempt Alaska's small hydro projects from \nregulation. Instead, it allows the State of Alaska to regulate in lieu \nof FERC. I ask: Who is more interested in the environment of Alaska--\nAlaskans or a distant FERC? Moreover, the legislation allows Alaska to \nregulate only after FERC has determined that the State has in place a \nregulatory program which ``protects the public interest . . . and the \nenvironment to the same extent provided by . . . [the FERC].'' Finally, \nthe legislation specifically requires the full application of all \n``Federal environmental, natural resources, or cultural resources \nprotection laws. . . . '' Thus, enactment of this legislation will \nfully protect the environment and the public interest.\n  In summary, if enacted this legislation will benefit both Alaska's \nenvironment and its economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 423. A bill to prohibit certain Federal payments for certain \nmethadone maintenance programs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on finance.\n\n\n                      addiction free treatment act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nAddiction Free Treatment Act which reforms our nation's drug policy \nregarding the treatment of heroin addiction.\n  This bill would restrict Medicaid reimbursements and funding through \nthe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration for \nmethadone and LAM maintenance programs. Maintenance programs would be \nlimited to six months. The bill requires that such programs conduct \nregular drug testing, report all results, and terminate methadone \ntreatment to any patient testing positive for any illegal drugs. The \nlegislation directs the National Institute of Drug Abuse to study the \nmethods and effectiveness of nonpharmacological, and methadone-to-\nabstinence heroin rehabilitation programs, and requires the Center for \nSubstance Abuse Treatment to provide an annual report to Congress on \nthe relative effectiveness of heroin treatment programs in achieving \nfreedom from chemical dependency.\n  Mr. President, few crises represent a more fundamental threat to the \nbasic institutions of our society then substance abuse and addiction, \nand there are few drugs that do more harm than heroin. Heroin use in \nthe United States continues to rise. Drug use among teenagers is \nincreasing and the number of teenagers using heroin for the first time \nis higher than at any other point in our history. Between 1992 and \n1996, heroin use among college-age students increased an estimated 10 \npercent. Currently, there are an estimated 810,000 chronic heroin \naddicts living in the United States with over 115,000 heroin addicts \nparticipating in methadone programs.\n  Drug addiction undermines family, work, friendships, and communities. \nThe drug trade, which feeds the addict, undermines the security and \nstability of our neighborhoods through violence and other crime-related \nphenomena.\n  At its core, drug addiction does violence to the basic humanity of \nthe addict, robbing him or her of the most fundamental element of their \nexistence--their freedom. The addict is enslaved by the need to get a \nfix; all other needs become secondary to the physical and psychological \ndrive to feed the hunger of addiction. This enslavement goes to the \ncore of the debate surrounding the use of methadone maintenance as a \nsolution to heroin addiction: What have we done to restore the human \ncondition if we have not freed the addict of chemical dependency?\n\n  Methadone maintenance programs simply transfer addiction from one \nnarcotic to another. The methadone patient is every bit as dependent on \nmethadone as he or she was with heroin. Patients who attempt to free \nthemselves from their addiction to methadone experience withdrawal \nsymptoms that are as violent, if not more than, those they would \nexperience coming off of heroin. What is more, even the promise of \nfreedom from illegal drug use is an illusion. For many methadone \npatients regularly test positive for other illegal drugs. And yet, for \nsome 30 years, the only hope that U.S. policy has offered to our \ncitizens addicted to heroin is an Orwellian addiction swap.\n  In the 105th Congress, I, along with Senator Coats and Senator \nCoverdell, introduced a Senate Resolution addressing the topic of \nmethadone treatment. The resolution was a response to an emerging \nClinton Administration policy designed to dramatically increase the \nfederal government's activities in the area of methadone treatment. \nBarry McCaffrey, the so-called Drug Czar, proposed that ONDCP would \ndouble the number of heroin addicts in methadone treatment. Mr. \nPresident, this sounds less like the policy of a Drug Czar, and more \nlike the policy of a drug bazaar--a bazaar where the federal government \ntrades places with the street dealer, swapping heroin for methadone and \nfeeding the addiction with taxpayer dollars.\n  This is disgusting and it is immoral. It does serious harm to the \nhumanity of those people who have mustered the courage to walk into a \nclinic seeking help to free themselves from addiction. It is the \nultimate in cruel irony that our government's first response should be \nto trade the shackles of heroin for the shackles of methadone.\n  The fundamental flaw of methadone treatment as a national anti-drug \npolicy is that it is not an anti-drug policy at all. As I have said, \nmethadone simply transfers addiction from one drug to another. To say \nthat this is effective, because the symptoms of methadone addiction are \nmore tolerable to society and less dramatic for the addict, is to miss \nthe most fundamental point--that is that addiction enslaves the \nindividual. That slavery is no less onerous to the basic humanity, to \nthe dignity of the addict simply because the drug has been endorsed by \nthe FDA, prescribed by a physician and paid for with taxpayer dollars.\n  After 30 years of methadone, is there nothing better to offer to the \nheroin addict? The answer is an emphatic yes. Drug addiction is a \ncomplicated condition. It has behavioral, social/environmental, and \nphysical characteristics. If we are to free individuals from heroin \naddiction, we must adopt policies supporting programs that address, in \nan intensive and comprehensive way, each of these areas of concern.\n  Throughout society, in our homes, neighborhoods, communities, and in \npublic policy fora, there has been much debate surrounding the decay of \nour civil society. A certain consensus has emerged regarding how best \nto address this crisis. That consensus centers around the need to \nrebuild the mediating structures of our society--family, neighborhood, \nchurch, and volunteer associations.\n  If we are to free the addict from the slavery of drug addiction--be \nit heroin or methadone--rebuilding or, in many cases, introducing for \nthe first time these same mediating structures into the life of the \naddict must play a central role.\n  There are models for success. Just ask Rev. Sam McPherson. Rev. \nMcPherson has spent his life tending to the needs of drug addicts. He \nnow runs a Ready, Willing, and Able rehabilitation center on Florida \nAvenue here in Washington. It is an extraordinary and inspiring place.\n\n[[Page S1448]]\n\n  Founded on a drug-free principle, Ready, Willing, and Able embraces \nthe addict, first demanding detoxification, and then dealing in a \nsustained and comprehensive way with the bundle of needs that \ncontributed to the participant's drug use and addiction, and that \nresult in recidivism if left unresolved.\n\n  Dr. Robert Woodson, in his recent book ``The Triumphs of Joseph'', \ndescribes the many examples of community-based organizations that have \nsucceeded in healing the scourge of drug addiction, lifting people up \nfrom the slavery of dependency--people like Freddie and Nina Garcia, \nwho run the Victory Fellowship, based out of San Antonio.\n  Some thirty years ago, Freddie Garcia and his wife began their \noperation in a tiny one-bedroom house, at one point moving all their \nfurniture under a make-shift awning outside the house to make room for \neleven recovering addicts who slept on their living room floor. Today, \nthe Victory Fellowship has freed more than 13,000 men and women from \ntheir addictions and has spread to 65 satellite centers in California, \nTexas, New Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Columbia and Venezuela.\n  Dr. Woodson pus it this way: ``In contrast with psychiatric therapy \nand treatment that relies on medication, the goal of grassroots \nprograms is not rehabilitation but transformation. Their end is not to \nmodify behavior but to engender a change in the values and vision of \nthe people they work with which will, in turn affect behavior . . . \nthey do not simply curb deviant behavior but offer something more--a \nfulfilling life that eclipses the power of temptation.''\n  These community-based institutions possess certain common \ncharacteristics that can serve as a model for all who seek to address \nthe challenges of addiction:\n  (1) Their programs are open to all comers. Often, these programs take \nthe worst cases, the long-term, homeless addicts that the ``system'' \nhas abandoned as hopeless.\n  (2) They have the same zip code as the people they serve. They do \ntheir work in the same neighborhoods, on the same streets as the \naddicts they serve. Reverend McPherson points out one of the pleasant \nbenefits of Ready, Willing and Able: When they come into a \nneighborhood, the drug dealers go away. They leave because there is an \nunwritten code. If these guys are trying to get off of heroin, the \ndealers go somewhere else, taking their trade out of sight of the very \naddicts they have enslaved.\n\n  (3) Their approach is flexible to the needs of the individual. The \nmany behavioral, social/environmental, and physical challenges that \ncontribute to drug addiction are unique to each individual. These \norganizations develop individualized programs for each individual.\n  (4) They contain a central element of reciprocity. As Dr. Woodson \nsays: ``They do not practice blind charity but require something in \nreturn from the individuals they serve.''\n  (5) Clear behavioral guidelines and discipline are critical.\n  (6) These healers fulfill the role of parent, providing authority and \nstructure, but also love and support.\n  (7) They are committed for the long haul, not just for the duration \nof funding.\n  (8) They are on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for as long as the \nparticipant needs them.\n  (9) The healing offers immersion in an environment of care and mutual \nsupport with a community of individuals who are trying to accomplish \nthe same changes in their lives.\n  (10) They are united in their cause, providing mutual support in \ntheir struggles, and celebration in their accomplishments.\n  These concepts are not new. But combined and sustained, they offer \nhope and success in freeing the addict from a life of chemical \ndependency. That freedom should be the policy of the United States \nGovernment, and the relentlessly pursued goal of everyone concerned \nwith the scourge of heroin addiction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Smith of New \n        Hampshire, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 424. A bill to preserve and protect the free choice of individuals \nand employees to form, join, or assist labor organizations, or to \nrefrain from such activities; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                 THE NATIONAL RIGHT TO WORK ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce along \nwith my distinguished colleagues Senators Thurmond, Smith of New \nHampshire, Grassley, and Helms the National Right to Work Act of 1999.\n  This bill does not add a single word to Federal law. Rather, it \nrepeals those sections of the National Labor Relations Act and Railway \nLabor Act that authorize the imposition of forced-dues contracts on \nworking Americans. I believe that every worker must have the right to \njoin or support a labor union. This bill protects that right. But no \nworker should ever be forced to join a union.\n  I am happy to say that my own state of Georgia is among the 21 states \nthat is a ``Right to Work'' state and has been since 1947. According to \nU.S. News and World Report, 7 of the strongest 10 state economies in \nthe nation have Right-to-Work laws. Workers who have the freedom to \nchoose whether or not to join a union have a higher standard of living \nthan their counterparts in non Right-to-Work states. According to Dr. \nJames Bennet, a prominent economist at George Mason University's highly \nrespected economic program, urban families in Right-to-Work states have \napproximately $2,852 more annual purchasing power than urban families \nin non-Right to Work states; particularly when the lower taxes, housing \nand food costs are taken into consideration.\n  According to a poll by the respected Marketing Research Institute, 77 \npercent of Americans support Right to Work, and over 50 percent of \nunion households believe that workers should have the right to choose \nwhether or not to join or pay dues to a labor union. That should be no \nsurprise. This is about freedom. The Right to Work expands every \nworking American's personal freedom.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It \nexpands the freedom of hard working Americans and ensures them the \nchoice of whether to accept or reject union representation and union \ndues without coercion, violence or work-place harassment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. \n        Kerrey):\n  S. 425. A bill to require the approval of Congress for the imposition \nof any new unilateral agricultural sanction, or any new unilateral \nsanction with respect to medicine, medical supplies, or medical \nequipment, against a foreign country; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n              Food and Medicine for the World Act of 1999\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today, I am introducing, with \nSenators Brownback, Baucus, and Kerrey, the Food and Medicine for the \nWorld Act of 1999. It's a bill that will help America's farmers, \nranchers, and related industries, keep on selling their food and \nmedicine to the world.\n  For over 200 years, farmers and ranchers have been vital to the \ngrowth and economic prosperity of the United States--always responding \nto the challenges of our competitive free-market system with efficient \nproduction methods. The agricultural industry is one of the nation's \nlargest employers. Missouri is the nation's second leading state in its \nnumber of farms. Clearly, the agricultural industry is a backbone to \nMissouri's economy, accounting for more than $4 billion annually.\n  The United States has the best farmers in the world--first class in \ntheir production, storage, transportation, processing, and marketing. \nWe can produce more food than any other country, yet the United States \nonly accounts for five percent of the world's consuming population. \nThat leaves 95 percent of the world's consumers outside of our borders. \nAnd because of our farmers' efficiency and ability to meet U.S. \ndomestic demand, they rely increasingly on their ability to sell \nproducts in foreign markets.\n  Exports now account for 30 percent of gross cash receipts for \nAmerica's farmers, and nearly 40 percent of all U.S. agricultural \nproduction is exported. Therefore, it is imperative that we ensure that \nour farmers have ample export opportunities.\n  Our farmers and ranchers need our help in opening markets abroad and\n\n[[Page S1449]]\n\nkeeping those markets open. Once farmers jump through all the hoops of \nforeign trade barriers and red tape to establish trusted relationships \nwith foreign buyers, the U.S. government should be extremely cautious \nabout sanctioning their sales and forcing them to lose their markets. \nMany farmers' livelihood depends on sales overseas. In 1997, more than \none-fourth of Missouri's farm marketing came from sales overseas.\n  We know that sanctions hurt America's farmers and ranchers. And we \nknow that sanctions against agriculture and medicine are detrimental to \nthe world's poor that have to live under the rule of tyrants. That is \nwhy I am introducing the Food and Medicine for the World Act. This bill \ntries to ensure that farmers don't get sanctioned for the bad acts of \nforeign governments, and the health and welfare of the world's poor are \nnot damaged further by their leader's indiscretions.\n  Under the Food and Medicine for the World Act, whenever any new \nunilateral sanction is announced by the President, the sanctions he \nimposes will not affect agriculture or medicine unless he tells \nCongress why it is necessary to sanction these products and unless \nCongress approves the sanction. If the Food and Medicine for the World \nAct is passed, there will not be any more sanctions against U.S. \nagricultural exports without agreement between the Administration and \nCongress and without serious deliberation about the effects on \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers. Our farms should not be sanctioned \nwithout the consent of Congress.\n  The Food and Medicine for the World Act sends a message to customers \noverseas that U.S. farmers and ranchers will be reliable. People around \nthe world depend on our farm products and on U.S. produced medical \nsupplies. When tyrants challenge U.S. foreign policy, we must not \nrespond by cutting off the supply of food and medicine to their poor. \nThe health and welfare needs of those abroad will be best served if we \nensure that our farmers and producers are a continuous source of food \nand medical supplies.\n  The Food and Medicine for the World Act also sends a message to U.S. \nfarmers and ranchers that their livelihood will not be used as a \nforeign policy tool without due deliberation and involvement of both \nthe President and Congress.\n  Farmers and ranchers are twice as reliant on foreign trade as the \nU.S. economy as a whole. It is time for us to enact policy that \nreflects our support for their efforts to reach their competitive \npotential internationally.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                 S. 425\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Food and Medicine for the \n     World Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

or\n       (D) any export financing (including credits or credit \n     guarantees) for agricultural commodities or agricultural \n     products.\n       (3) New unilateral agricultural sanction.--The term ``new \n     unilateral agricultural sanction'' means any prohibition, \n     restriction, or condition on carrying out an agricultural \n     program with respect to a foreign country or foreign entity \n     that is imposed by the United States on or after the date of \n     enactment of this Act for reasons of foreign policy or \n     national security, except in a case in which the United \n     States imposes the measure pursuant to a multilateral regime \n     and the other member countries of that regime have agreed to \n     impose substantially equivalent measures.\n       (4) New unilateral sanction with respect to medicine, \n     medical supplies, or medical equipment.--The term ``new \n     unilateral sanction with respect to medicine, medical \n     supplies, or medical equipment'' means any prohibition, \n     restriction, or condition on trade in, or the provision of \n     assistance consisting of, medicine, medical supplies, or \n     medical equipment with respect to a foreign country or \n     foreign entity that is imposed by the United States on or \n     after the date of enactment of this Act for reasons of \n     foreign policy or national security, except in a case in \n     which the United States imposes the measure pursuant to a \n     multilateral regime and the other member countries of that \n     regime have agreed to impose substantially equivalent \n     measures.\n       (5) Session day of Congress.--The term ``session day of \n     Congress'' means any day on which a House of Congress is in \n     session.\n       (b) Restriction.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law and subject to subsection (c), the President may not \n     impose a new unilateral agricultural sanction against a \n     foreign country, or a new unilateral sanction with respect to \n     medicine, medical supplies, or medical equipment against a \n     foreign country, unless--\n       (1) not less than 60 days before the sanction is proposed \n     to be imposed, the President submits a report to Congress \n     that--\n       (A) describes the activity proposed to be prohibited, \n     restricted, or conditioned; and\n       (B) describes the actions by the foreign country that \n     justify the sanction; and\n       (2) Congress enacts a joint resolution stating the approval \n     of Congress for the report submitted under paragraph (1).\n       (c) Exception.--Notwithstanding subsection (b), the \n     President may impose a sanction described in that \n     subsection--\n       (1) against a foreign country with respect to which--\n       (A) Congress has enacted a declaration of war; or\n       (B) the President has proclaimed a state of national \n     emergency; or\n       (2) to the extent that the sanction would prohibit, \n     restrict, or condition the provision or use of any commodity, \n     product, medicine, supply, or equipment that is controlled on \n     the United States Munitions List under section 38 of the Arms \n     Export Control Act or the Commerce Control List under the \n     Export Administration Act of 1979.\n       (d) Congressional Priority Procedures.--\n       (1) Joint resolution defined.--For the purpose of \n     subsection (b)(2), ``joint resolution'' means only a joint \n     resolution introduced within 10 session days of Congress \n     after the date on which the report of the President under \n     subsection (b)(1) is received by Congress, the matter after \n     the resolving clause of which is as follows: ``That Congress \n     approves the report of the President pursuant to section \n     2(b)(1) of the Food and Medicine for the World Act of 1999, \n     transmitted on ______________.'', with the blank completed \n     with the appropriate date.''.\n       (2) Referral of report.--The report described in subsection \n     (b)(1) shall be referred to the appropriate committee or \n     committees of the House of Representatives and to the \n     appropriate committee or committees of the Senate.\n       (3) Referral of joint resolution to committee.--A joint \n     resolution introduced in the House of Representatives shall \n     be referred to the Committee on International Relations of \n     the House of Representatives. A joint resolution introduced \n     in the Senate shall be referred to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate. Such a joint resolution may not be \n     reported before the eighth session day of Congress after its \n     introduction.\n       (4) Discharge from committee.--If the committee of either \n     House to which a joint resolution is referred has not \n     reported the joint resolution (or an identical joint \n     resolution) at the end of 30 session days of Congress after \n     its introduction, the committee shall be discharged from \n     further consideration of the joint resolution and the joint \n     resolution shall be placed on the appropriate calendar of the \n     House in which it was introduced.\n       (5) Floor consideration.--\n       (A) Motion to proceed.--When the committee to which a joint \n     resolution is referred has reported, or has been deemed to be \n     discharged (under paragraph (4)) from further consideration \n     of, a joint resolution, notwithstanding any rule or precedent \n     of the Senate, including Rule 22, it is at any time \n     thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the \n     same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the \n     respective House to move to proceed to the consideration of \n     the joint resolution, and all points of order against the \n     joint resolution (and against consideration of the joint \n     resolution) are waived. The motion is highly privileged in \n     the House of Representatives and is privileged in the Senate \n     and is not debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, \n     or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of other business. A motion to reconsider the \n     vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall \n     not be in order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration \n     of the joint resolution is agreed to, the joint resolution \n     shall remain the unfinished business of the respective House \n     until disposed of.\n       (B) Debate on the joint resolution.--Debate on the joint \n     resolution, and on all debatable motions and appeals in \n     connection therewith, shall be limited to not more than ten \n     hours, which shall be divided equally between those favoring \n     and those opposing the joint resolution. A motion further to \n     limit debate is in order and not debatable. An amendment to, \n     or a motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of other business, or a motion to recommit the \n     joint resolution is not in order. A motion to\n\n[[Page S1450]]\n\n     reconsider the vote by which the joint resolution is agreed \n     to or disagreed to is not in order.\n       (C) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n     conclusion of the debate on a joint resolution, and a single \n     quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if requested in \n     accordance with the rules of the appropriate House, the vote \n     on final passage of the joint resolution shall occur.\n       (D) Appeals of rulings.--Appeals from the decisions of the \n     Chair relating to the application of the rules of the Senate \n     or the House of Representatives, as the case may be, to the \n     procedure relating to a joint resolution described in \n     paragraph (1) shall be decided without debate.\n       (6) Treatment of other house's joint resolution.--If, \n     before the passage by one House of Congress of a joint \n     resolution of that House, that House receives from the other \n     House a joint resolution, then the following procedures shall \n     apply:\n       (A) Referral of joint resolutions of sending house.--The \n     joint resolution of the sending House shall not be referred \n     to a committee in the receiving House.\n       (B) Procedures in receiving house.--With respect to a joint \n     resolution of the House receiving the joint resolution--\n       (i) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no \n     joint resolution had been received from the sending House; \n     but\n       (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on the joint \n     resolution of the sending House.\n       (C) Disposition of joint resolutions of receiving house.--\n     Upon disposition of the joint resolution received from the \n     other House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the \n     joint resolution originated in the receiving House.\n       (7) Procedures after action by both the house and senate.--\n     If the House receiving a joint resolution from the other \n     House after the receiving House has disposed of a joint \n     resolution originated in that House, the action of the \n     receiving House with regard to the disposition of the joint \n     resolution originated in that House shall be deemed to be the \n     action of the receiving House with regard to the joint \n     resolution originated in the other House.\n       (8) Status of procedures.--This subsection is enacted by \n     Congress--\n       (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is \n     deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a joint resolution described in \n     paragraph (1), and it supersedes other rules only to the \n     extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n     procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner and \n     to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n     House.\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues \nin introducing the Food and Medicine for the World Act.\n  For years the United States has enacted economic sanctions to punish \nforeign governments, often without regard for the effects of those \nsanctions back home. Under a bill that I am introducing jointly with \nSenators Ashcroft, Brownback and Kerrey, we can make more sense of our \nconfusing sanctions policy. We can put an end to the practice of making \nour agricultural producers shoulder most of the blame when we impose \nsanctions.\n  The exchange of goods and ideas worldwide has never been freer; it is \nnow axiomatic to say that we live in a global economy. It follows that \nas the rules governing economics have changed, so too should those \nrelated to economic sanctions. Unilateral economic action is less \neffective than it used to be, simply because it's rarely possible for \none country or company to corner the market on a good or service.\n  Moreover, we often hurt ourselves with unilateral actions that \ndisproportionately affect one sector of our economy over another. Our \nagricultural producers, for example, have long borne the brunt of \nAmerican unilateral action. It is estimated that 10% of the world wheat \nmarket is put out of reach of U.S. producers by economic sanctions.\n  That's why I became a member of the Senate Sanctions Task Force last \nyear, and it's why I am joining my colleagues in introducing the Food \nand Medicine for the World Act. Under this legislation, when any new \nunilateral sanction is announced by the President, the sanctions he \nimposes will not affect agriculture or medicine unless: the President \nsubmits a report to Congress asking that the sanction include \nagriculture; and Congress approves of his request. The process must be \ncomplete within 60 days before the sanctions against agriculture are \nsupposed to go into effect. This bill would not take effect in the \nevent that Congress has declared war or in the case of national \nemergency.\n  Mr. President, while I believe sanctions can be a legitimate tool of \nforeign policy, I don't think that American producers should be \npunished for the actions of unscrupulous foreign governments. Nor do I \nthink it is fair to put an abrupt end to the supply of medicine based \non the behavior of a dictator. We must send a message to the world that \nour producers are reliable and that those abroad who rely on U.S. \nproducts will not be put at risk by a sanction on U.S. food and \nmedicine.\n  The Food and Medicine for the World Act sends that message, and I \nurge my colleagues to lend their support to the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

CYPRUS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Mikulski) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 9\n\n       Whereas respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights \n     is a cornerstone of United States foreign policy;\n       Whereas the enclaved people of Cyprus, those Greek-Cypriots \n     and Maronites living in the Karpas peninsula, are subject to \n     restrictions of freedom and human rights;\n       Whereas the representatives of the two communities in \n     Cyprus, who met in Vienna in August, 1975, under the auspices \n     of the United Nations Secretary General, reached an agreement \n     known as the Vienna three agreement, which, inter-alia, \n     states that, ``Greek-Cypriots in the North of the island (of \n     Cyprus) are free to stay and they will be given every help to \n     lead a normal life, including facilities for education and \n     for the practice of their religion, as well as medical care \n     by their own doctors and freedom of movement in the North . . \n     . (and) the United Nations will have free and normal access \n     to Greek-Cypriot villages and habitations in the North'';\n       Whereas the key elements of this agreement have not been \n     implemented and, in fact, severe restrictions have been \n     placed on the daily lives of the enclaved people of Cyprus;\n       Whereas the United Nations Secretary General in his \n     December 10, 1995 report on the U.N. operations in Cyprus \n     sets out the recommendations contained in UNFICYP's (the \n     United Nations Forces in Cyprus) humanitarian review, as \n     endorsed by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1032(95), \n     regarding the restrictions on the freedoms and human rights \n     of the enclaved people of Cyprus, that:\n       (1) ``The constant presence of the Turkish-Cypriot police \n     in the daily lives of the Karpas Greek-Cypriots should be \n     ended'';\n       (2) ``Karpas Greek-Cypriots and their visitors should be \n     allowed to travel between the Karpas and the buffer zone \n     crossing point in their own vehicles or in regular public \n     transportation without police escort'';\n       (3) ``All restrictions on land travel within the northern \n     part of Cyprus should be lifted'';\n       (4) ``Unrestricted availability of private telephones \n     should be permitted when they become generally available and \n     the Karpas Greek-Cypriots should be permitted to make private \n     telephone calls from locations in the Karpas other than \n     police stations without the presence of any official or other \n     person'';\n       (5) ``Restrictions on hand-carried mail and newspapers \n     should be lifted'';\n       (6) ``Secondary schooling for Greek-Cypriots should be \n     facilitated in the Karpas, and teachers and school supplies \n     for the Greek-Cypriots should be allowed to be provided from \n     the south without hinderance'';\n       (7) ``All Karpas Greek-Cypriot students attending secondary \n     schools or third-level institutions in the south should be \n     allowed to return to their homes on weekends and holidays'';\n       (8) ``Access to and religious use of the monastery at \n     Apostolos Andreas and the church there by the Greek-Cypriots \n     of the Karpas peninsula and their clergy should be \n     unrestricted'';\n       (9) ``Provision of funds from outside the northern area \n     should be permitted for the renovation and maintenance of \n     Greek-Cypriot schools and churches in the Karpas area'';\n       (10) ``Karpas Greek-Cypriots should be permitted visits by \n     Greek-Cypriot doctors and medical staff'';\n       (11) ``There should be no hindrance at any time to children \n     of Karpas Greek-Cypriots returning to their family homes \n     without formality'';\n       (12) ``Karpas Greek-Cypriots should be allowed visits from \n     close relatives who normally reside outside the northern part \n     of Cyprus'';\n       (13) ``Karpas Greek-Cypriots should be allowed to bequeath \n     fixed property in Karpas to their next of kin and in the \n     event that such beneficiaries normally reside outside the \n     northern part of the island, they should be allowed to visit \n     bequeathed properties without hinderance or formality'';\n       (14) ``Restrictions on UNFICYP's freedom of movement to and \n     from as well as within the Karpas area should be lifted'';\n       (15) ``Restrictions on the discharge by UNFICYP of its \n     humanitarian and other functions with regard to Karpas Greek-\n     Cypriots should be lifted and liaison posts should be \n     established where the greatest number of Greek-Cypriots live \n     in the north at the villages of Rizokarpaso and Ayias Trias. \n     (The sole remaining permanent UNFICYP presence in the Karpas, \n     a small liaison post, remains confined, with no freedom of \n     movement, in the village of Leonarisso, where only 9 Greek-\n     Cypriots still reside.)''; and\n       (16) ``All restrictions preventing offshore fishing by the \n     Greek-Cypriots of the Karpas should be lifted'';\n       Whereas other restrictions on the freedom and human rights \n     of the enclaved include:\n       (1) A requirement that enclaved males aged 18 to 50 report \n     once a week to those in control;\n       (2) Harassment, beating, rape, and murder without \n     investigation; and\n       (3) Lack of compensation for work performed;\n       Whereas U.N.

Mr. President, today I am submitting a concurrent \nresolution which calls for a United States effort to end the \nrestrictions on the freedoms and violations of the human rights of the \nenclaved people in the occupied portion of Cyprus. I have introduced \nthis legislation in the past, and I regret that these concerns are \nstill with us.\n  Mr. President, I am aware that developments on Cyprus are not known \nto most Americans. Yet if I were to tell them that a small nation has \nhad part of its land illegally occupied by a neighboring state for over \n23 years, I know they would be both shocked and outraged.\n  The 23 years since the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus have seen the \nend of the cold war, the collapse of the USSR, free elections in South \nAfrica and a reunited Germany. Yet while the line through the heart of \nBerlin is gone, the line through the heart of Cyprus remains.\n  Over two decades ago, Turkey's brutal invasion drove more than \n200,000 Cypriots from their homes. Turkey still controls about one-\nthird of the island of Cyprus and maintains about 30,000 troops there. \nHowever, there remains, in northern Cyprus, a small remnant of 497 \nenclaved Greek-Cypriots. The reason they are referred to as the \nenclaved of Cyprus is that during the fighting in 1974 they mostly \nresided in remote enclaves and therefore were not able to flee the \nfighting and thus were not immediately expelled.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this resolution is important in serving \nto bring to the attention of the American people and the world \ncommunity, the hardships and restrictions endured by these enclaved \nindividuals.\n  In 1975, representatives of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities \nagreed that the Greek-Cypriots in the northern part of the island were \nto be given every help to lead a normal life. Twenty-two years later \nthis is still not the case.\n  The presence of the Turkish-Cypriot police in the lives of the \nenclaved Greek-Cypriots is constant, and there are restrictions on land \ntravel. Other human rights restrictions and deprivations include: \nRestrictions on private telephones; Restrictions on hand-carried mail \nand newspapers; Difficulties in receiving full educational \nopportunities; Restricted access to and religious use of the monastery \nat Apostolos Andreas; A requirement that enclaved males aged 18-50 must \nreport once a week to those in control; and A lack of investigation \nwith regard to harassment, beating, rape and murder.\n  Mr. President, this situation calls out for justice. By bringing \nthese human rights violations to the attention of the American people, \nit is my hope, that we can bring the plight of these people to the \nWorld's attention. My resolution urges the President to undertake \nefforts to end the restrictions on the freedoms and human rights of the \nenclaved people. I will remain actively involved in this issue\n\n[[Page S1452]]\n\nuntil their rights and freedoms are restored.\n  This is the least we can do for these people. While this resolution \naddresses the plight of the enclaved people of Cyprus, work must not \ncease on efforts to bring about a withdrawal of Turkish forces and a \nrestoration of Cyprus' sovereignty over the entire island with the full \nrespect of the rights of all Cypriots.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/11/senate-section/article/S1451-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 34--DESIGNATING NATIONAL YOUTH FITNESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Durbin, and \nMr. Reid) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nin support of veterans suffering from Alzheimer's disease.\n  When I first came to Congress 20 years ago, not a single piece of \nlegislation devoted to Alzheimer's disease had even been introduced. We \nhave come a long way since then, as today Alzheimer's is a household \nword. It is also the most expensive uninsured illness in America. That \nis why I recently introduced legislation to allow families to deduct \nthe cost of home care and adult day and respite care provided to a \nfamily member suffering from Alzheimer's disease.\n  The resolution I am submitting today is targeted to the challenges \nfaced by veterans suffering from Alzheimer's disease and their \nfamilies. I worked closely with the Maine Department of the Veterans of \nForeign Wars [VFW] of the United States on this approach, after \nlearning of the prevalence of this disorder in the veterans population \nin Maine and nationwide, and the need to improve treatment regimes.\n  The resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that in authorizing \nveterans medical facility projects, such as nursing homes, Congress \nshould authorize projects for facilities in urban and rural areas \nspecifically designed to treat veterans with Alzheimer's disease and \nconducting research into the disorder.\n  The resolution also expresses support for innovation in the methods \nused by VA personnel in treating veterans with Alzheimer's disease, and \nencourages the sharing of information on Alzheimer's disease among VA \nfacilities and health care personnel.\n  Facilities authorized under this bill would provide a model for \nexisting VA nursing homes that treat Alzheimer's disease and future \nhomes dedicated exclusively to the treatment of Alzheimer's. These \nspecially designed homes will formulate new protocols for the treatment \nof this devastating condition.\n  Currently, veterans homes have an average of 30 percent Alzheimer's \npatients. Serious questions have been raised concerning whether it is \nappropriate to treat this disorder in the traditional nursing home \nsetting. Yet, the VA does not operate any facilities exclusively \ntargeted at Alzheimer's disease, and the VA budget for construction \nfunds for veterans nursing homes does not authorize construction of any \nunique long-term care projects. Authorizing the VA to explore new ways \nof treating Alzheimer's disease will enable the Department, which \nadministers one of the largest health care networks in the country, to \nprepare for the future, when the aging of the veterans population is \nexpected to hinder the ability of traditional veterans homes to care \nfor Alzheimer's patients.\n  One of the most important components of this resolution is that a \ndemonstration facility authorized by Congress will give the VA the \nfreedom to design new and more effective protocols for treating \nAlzheimer's patients--including new approaches to care, administration, \nstaffing, quality assurance, and other issues. Facilities are currently \nforced to comply with existing long-term care regulations, laws, \nbuilding codes, and traditional medical models, which are often not \ncompatible with the unique needs of patients suffering from Alzheimer's \ndisease.\n  Advances made by facilities designed specifically to treat veterans \nwith Alzheimer's will ultimately benefit all those who suffer with this \ndisorder. Therefore, Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/11/senate-section/article/S1452-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1452-S1453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 36--AUTHORIZING TAKING OF PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE CHAMBER \n                      OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. McConnell, and Mr. Dodd) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, the Congress has an important \nopportunity to provide the youth of America with knowledge and \nexperience that will benefit their future and therefore the future of \nthis country. The Troops-to-Teachers program in the Department of \nDefense brings the technical talents and experience of retiring \nmilitary personnel directly to American classrooms to benefit our young \npeople. Former military personnel who enroll in Troops-to-Teachers \nbring essential mathematical, scientific, and technological expertise \nthat our schools need in order to provide the nation with the technical \ntalent we will need to face the future. This is a ``win-win'' program \nthat brings together age and experience with youth and energy. This \nprogram rewards those in uniform who have served the nation by \nproviding them with valuable training assistance needed for the \ntransition to a classroom, and it rewards our young people with service \nprofessionals' knowledge and information gained while developing and \nusing the latest technologies.\n  Congress established Troops-to-Teachers in 1993. Since then, over \n3,000 men and women retiring from the military have received training \nto enable them to enter classrooms as qualified teachers. These men and \nwomen bring some very important fresh perspectives to American \nclassrooms. About three quarters of the ``Troops'' are males, compared \nwith about 25 percent male teachers in the nation's public school \nsystems. Almost a third of them have science, engineering, and \ntechnology backgrounds which are sorely needed in our schools at all \nlevels. About a third of the ``Troops'' are minorities, compared to \nless than 10 percent minority instructors in our public schools. Many \nminority retirees and half of the ``Troops'' overall elect to teach in \ninner city or rural schools--the schools that are often most in need of \nadditional teaching expertise.\n  This bipartisan bill introduced by my esteemed colleague, Senator \nMcCain, would provide the critical financial support retiring service \npersonnel need to gain teacher skills and would assist them in \nobtaining employment as teachers. I am honored to be an original \ncosponsor of S. 389, the Troops to Teachers Program Improvement Act of \n1999. If enacted, this bill will provide a $2,000 stipend to help \noffset the cost of earning teacher certification. It would also provide \ngrants to school districts for each new teacher they hire, and would \nset up Troops-to-Teacher Centers to manage the program in various \nstates. Major grants up to $825,000 would be awarded to Institutions of \nHigher Education located near military installations to establish \nteacher certification programs tailored to meet the needs of retiring \nmilitary personnel. Placement and referral assistance would also be \navailable to personnel who enroll in the program.\n  Mr. President, in 1993 Troops-to-Teachers was an important initiative \nto help meet the needs of military personnel leaving the military \nservices during the drawdown of our military forces. The drawdown has \nbeen completed, but that no longer matters. During the past five years, \nI believe we now know how valuable this program is regardless of \nwhether our military forces shrink or grow. Retiring military personnel \nwho, by definition, are ``public servants'' have a valuable combination \nof skills and commitment to apply their public service in another \nvenue--America's classrooms. America's youth and the nation's future \nwill be the beneficiaries. I urge my colleagues to vote to enact the \nTroops-to-Teachers Improvement Act of 1999 and to extend the authority \nof this program for five more years. It's a great dividend from \nAmerica's past and an important investment in America's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/11/senate-section/article/S1453-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO THE FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH OF GULFPORT, MISSISSIPPI\n\n Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this month is the centennial \nanniversary of the First Presbyterian Church of Gulfport, Mississippi.\n  The First Presbyterian Church of Gulfport has a rich history serving \nthe Lord and the Gulfport community. It was organized on February 17, \n1899 by the New Orleans Presbytery. On January 30, 1904, the original \nframe church building was dedicated and a year later, Reverend F.L. \nMcFadden was installed as the church's first Pastor. Reverend H.A. \nJones was installed in December 1909 and served until his death in \nJanuary 1915. Reverend A.C. Armond ministered to the church until World \nWar I. Dr. Charles Newman followed, faithfully conducting worship for \nfourteen years. Reverend J.N. Brown served the Presbyterian Church \nduring the Great Depression, World War II, and the Korean Conflict.\n  Installed in 1954, Dr. Richard L. Summers led the ministry until \nSeptember 1986. It was during Dr. Summer's thirty-two year tenure that \nthe present church at 1214 24th Avenue was dedicated and a number of \nimportant programs were instituted such as a week-day kindergarten.\n  The congregation joined the Presbyterian Church of America in 1982 \nand was received in May 1983 by Grace Presbytery, P.C.A, at the First \nPresbyterian Church of Hattiesburg.\n  In July 1987, Reverend Danny Levi was installed, serving through \nDecember 1991. Reverend William R. Lyle was ordained in January 1991 \nand served as an Assistant Pastor until December 1992.\n  The First Presbyterian Church of Gulfport is now blessed to have \nReverend Marshall D. Connor, a graduate of the University of South \nCarolina and the Reformed Theological Seminary, as its current Pastor. \nThe father of seven children and the grandfather of two, Reverend \nConner and his wife Linda have served the church since March 1993.\n  As the First Presbyterian Church reaches this significant milestone, \nit is appropriate to look back and reflect on the many lives touched by \nthis institution. The thousands of worshipers who have achieved \nspiritual fulfilment. The children who received a strong religious \neducation based on devotion to faith, family, and freedom and the \nbiblical principles of integrity, conviction, and moral fiber. The sons \nand daughters who entered into the sacred bond of matrimony. The many \ndevoted followers who regularly attended Sunday service, and who, in \nthe Christian tradition, sought and received redemption. And the \nfriends and family members who prayed for their loved ones and those in \nneed.\n  The First Presbyterian Church has remained a center for community \nlife and spiritual well-being for a century. This history will serve as \na beacon for Gulfport as our nation moves forward into the next \nmillennium.\n  For one hundred years, and with nine ministers, this congregation has \nstood as a strong testament to its glorious teachings. I am proud and \nhonored to commemorate this historic achievement.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the First Presbyterian \nChurch of Gulfport, Mississippi, and to wish the church and its many \nfollowers a joyous centennial anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/11/senate-section/article/S1453-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1453-S1454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. PAUL PHILLIPS\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nDr. Paul Phillips for his eight years of service representing Upper \nProvidence Township on the Spring-Ford Area School Board in \nCollegeville, PA.\n  Dr. Phillips has been active in educational activities for more than \n50 years. His extensive experience includes serving as former \nsuperintendent in the Morrisville School District in Bucks County and \nformer principal in the Haverford and Lower Merion school districts. \nRecently, he has served as a president of the Spring-Ford school board \nand as School Director.\n  While School Director, Dr. Phillips' goal was to raise Spring-Ford \nHigh School SAT scores by 100 points. Not\n\n[[Page S1454]]\n\nonly did Dr. Phillips attain that goal, he exceeded it. During his \ntenure, Dr. Phillips also saw the construction of two elementary \nschools and a high school, as well as renovations to the middle school.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in commending Dr. \nPhillips for his outstanding service on the Spring-Ford School Board, \nas well as his years of active involvement in educational activities in \nPennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/11/senate-section/article/S1453-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            IMANI ART MUSEUM\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \ngoals of the proposed IMANI Art Museum in Americus, Georgia. I would \nalso like to note the work of Dr. Ron Maxwell for working to make the \nmuseum a reality.\n  The IMANI Art Museum will be dedicated to encouraging diversity and \neducating the community about contemporary forms of African art and \nAfrican American art. Such a museum will help preserve the culture and \nhistory of African Americans so that future generations may fully \nappreciate their accomplishments.\n  Furthering the museum's goals of education, the museum will feature a \nChildren's Center, W.J. Robinson Center for Art Teaching and Learning, \nand a research library. The Children's Center will strive to increase \nyouth self esteem and self respect through the recognition and \nacquisition of art skills and historical knowledge. The W.J. Robinson \nCenter will serve as a valuable resource and training tool for the \ncommunity's teachers in all aspects of diversity issues and educational \ncurriculum. The research library will serve as a valuable resource to \nstudents and the community with regards to the African American history \nand culture.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I commend the goals of the proposed IMANI \nArt Museum and the diligent work of Dr. Ron Maxwell. The museum will \nprovide history and cultural richness for the citizens of Southwest \nGeorgia as well as prove to be important to the economic development \nand tourism industry which is sorely needed in this region. As we \ncontinue to look for ways at bringing people together, let us look to \nintentions of the proposed IMANI Art Museum as a leader in this \neffort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/11/senate-section/article/S1454-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CALVIN COLLEGE NATIONAL TITLE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nWalter Adams of East Lansing, Michigan. In the 76 years before his \npassing, Mr. Adams touched the lives of his family, his students, and \nhis fellow community members with his passion for learning. Mr. Adams \nis best known for his longtime dedication to Michigan State University \nas a forty-six-year faculty member, including one year as president of \nthe university.\n  As a lifelong promoter of education, Mr. Adams touched the lives of \nstudents and colleagues alike. He never lost his interest, his \nenthusiasm, and his total commitment to the ideals of education. His \nstudents were fortunate to be under the tutelage of an instructor who \nwas knowledgeable, experienced, and committed to improving the \nknowledge of those he taught. Even after his retirement in 1993, Mr. \nAdams remained steadfastly loyal to the university.\n  As Americans, we owe a great deal to those individuals who choose to \nprepare future generations to lead this country. Mr. Adams was not only \npart of this group, he was one of its finest members. He will be \nremembered fondly by all those he guided and inspired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/11/senate-section/article/S1454-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO FAYANNE KAUFMAN\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in remembrance of \nFayanne Kaufman of Farmington Hills, Michigan. In the 72 years before \nher passing, Mrs. Kaufman touched the lives of her family, her \nstudents, and her fellow community members with her passion for life \nand learning.\n  Mrs. Kaufman responded to life's challenges with strength and \noptimism. After her husband's untimely death in 1965, she joined the \nranks of older Americans pursuing higher education and attained her \nteaching degree at Wayne State University. In 1968, she began a 30-year \ncareer in the Farmington Public Schools, teaching at both the middle \nand high school levels. A renowned artist in the fields of ceramics and \njewelry making, Mrs. Kaufman encouraged her students to develop their \ntalents and helped them receive scholarships at various art and design \ninstitutions throughout the United States. In addition, she inspired \nand worked with troubled students to turn their lives around. Mrs. \nKaufman remained active with her alma mater over the years as an \nalumnus and was honored by the university with the Woman of Wayne State \nAward. In the past decade, she strengthened her commitment to public \nservice with three bids for the Michigan Board of Education.\n  Most importantly, Mrs. Kaufman was a devoted mother to her three \nsons. She raised her children to appreciate the importance of education \nand community service. As her son Jerry said, ``She was amazing and had \nsuch a warm sweet spirit.'' Mrs. Kaufman inspired us all to serve our \ncommunity to the best of our ability and reassured us that we all can \nhave a positive impact on the world around us. I wish to extend best \nwishes to the entire Kaufman family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/11/senate-section/article/S1454-4", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF MR. WOODROW DAWSON, JR.\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. \nWoodrow Dawson, Jr. of Southfield, Michigan. On December 31, 1998, \nafter 25 years of service, Mr. Dawson retired from Ford Motor Company, \nDearborn Glass. His dedication to an industry that is historically and \neconomically significant to our state is highly commendable. It is \npeople like Mr. Dawson who contribute to the great productivity of our \nnation.\n  In addition to his hard work with Ford, Mr. Dawson is a committed \nmember of his community. He is an elder at St. Paul Church of God in \nChrist in Detroit, which he has attended for 50 years. Even more \nimportantly, he is a devoted husband to his wife of 31 years and father \nto four children. I extend my warmest wishes and the best of luck for \nthe future to Mr. Dawson and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/11/senate-section/article/S1454-5", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1454-S1455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           APPOINTING A COMMITTEE TO ESCORT THE CHIEF JUSTICE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
