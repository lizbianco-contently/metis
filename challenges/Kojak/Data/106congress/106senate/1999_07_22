Mr. President, the F-22 has become a matter of great \ninterest and controversy over the last several days because the House \nAppropriations Defense Subcommittee voted to bring a pause to the \nprogram; it took $1.8 billion out of it and redistributed it to other \npriorities. The problem is, if I might just take a moment to \ncharacterize it, nobody had any knowledge of the potential of this \nact--not the Defense Department, not the Air Force, not the \ncontractors, not any parties who have been involved in development of \nthe aircraft.\n  To step back for a moment, the decision as to this highly advanced \nweapons system and the decision to commit the Nation to its development \nis well over a decade old. The actual development of the aircraft began \nin 1991. We have now as a nation invested $20 billion in the \ndevelopment of this system; two of these unbelievable instruments of \nwarfare are being tested in the air, and there is movement now to \nproduction of the first fighters.\n  My point is that after responsible commitments are made through three \nadministrations and we have invested everything in its preparation and \nnow\n\n[[Page S8976]]\n\nwe are ready to harvest that decision, the only words that come to mind \nare, it is bizarre that out of the blue, with no hearings, no \nreflection, this decision just drops like a lead brick into the middle \nof all these circumstances.\n  I am going to read the letter written by Secretary Cohen on July 15 \nto Congressman Bill Young, chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I \nthink it begins to encapsulate the shock of what has happened. He says:\n\n       I was dismayed to learn about House Appropriations Defense \n     Subcommittee's mark last Monday that cut $1.8 billion in \n     procurement funding for the F-22 aircraft. The Department \n     of Defense cannot accept this decision. This decision, if \n     enacted, would for all practical purposes kill the F-22 \n     program, the cornerstone of our nation's global air power \n     in the 21st century.\n       For fifty years, every American soldier has gone to war \n     confident that the United States had air superiority. \n     Canceling the F-22 means we cannot guarantee air superiority \n     in future conflicts. It would also have a significant impact \n     on the viability of the Joint Strike Fighter Program. The F-\n     22 will enable the Joint Strike Fighter to carry out its \n     primary strike mission. The Joint Strike Fighter was not \n     designed for the air superiority mission, and redesigning it \n     to do so will dramatically increase the cost. An upgraded F-\n     15 will not provide this dominance and will cost essentially \n     the same as the F-22 program.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       I know the difficult budget environment the Congress has to \n     deal with these days. I support your efforts to give our \n     nation the best possible defense at an affordable cost. \n     However, I believe the nation's defense requires the F-22. \n     The proposed cut jeopardizes our future warfighting \n     capability and will place our forces at higher risk.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Secretary \nCohen be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 1999.\n     Hon. C.W. Bill Young,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I was dismayed to learn about the House \n     Appropriations Defense Subcommittee's mark last Monday that \n     cut $1.8 billion in procurement funding for the F-22 \n     aircraft. The Department of Defense cannot accept this \n     decision. This decision, if enacted would for all practical \n     purposes kill the F-22 program, the cornerstone of our \n     nation's global air power in the 21st century.\n       For fifty years every American soldier has gone to war \n     confident that the Unties States had air superiority. \n     Canceling the F-22 means we cannot guarantee air superiority \n     in future conflicts. It would also have a significant impact \n     on the viability of the Joint Strike Fighter program The F-22 \n     will enable the Joint Strike Fighter to carry out its primary \n     strike mission.

An upgraded F-15 will not \n     provide this dominance and will cost essentially the same as \n     the F-22 program.\n       I know the difficult budget environment the Congress has to \n     deal with these days. I support your efforts to give our \n     nation the best possible defense at an affordable cost. \n     However, I believe the nation's defense requires the F-22. \n     The proposed cut jeopardizes our future warfighting \n     capability and will place our forces at higher risk.\n       I pledge my strongest effort to ensure the program will be \n     delivered within the cost caps that we've agreed to with the \n     Congress. I am confident the Department has the proper \n     management controls to ensure the success of the F-22 \n     program. As always, I would be pleased to discuss these \n     matters with you at any time. But I must tell you that I \n     cannot accept a defense bill that kills this cornerstone \n     program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bill Cohen.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, an article appeared on July 21 in the \nMarietta Daily Journal which further illuminates the nature of the \nSecretary's letter. It says:\n\n       Defense Secretary William Cohen criticized a House panel \n     Tuesday--\n\n  This is the point I want to make--\n\n     for not consulting with the Pentagon before voting to suspend \n     development of the Air Force's F-22 stealth fighter jet.\n       ``Neither I nor anyone in this building--or anyone in the \n     Air Force--was aware of the effort underway on the part of \n     the committee,'' Cohen told reporters during a photo-taking \n     session [at the Department of Defense].\n\n  This underscores the point I was making that something of this \nmagnitude, something of the sophistication of this system, something \nthat we have invested $20 billion in, something that we have spent \nalmost two decades getting ready to launch, is not managed in this \nmanner. It is bizarre that you would find yourself at this point, and \nsuddenly a subcommittee decides to overturn almost two decades of \nthought and preparation and planning.\n  As I said a moment ago, we have invested about $20 billion in this \nsystem up to this point. If you were to carry out and carry through to \nthe end what the subcommittee has done--and it reappropriated $1.8 \nbillion--we would lose another $6.5 billion. This House Appropriations \nCommittee action would deteriorate and jeopardize the program and \nviolate current contractual agreements between the Air Force and the \ncontractor.\n  One Pentagon source told Defense Daily yesterday:\n\n       The $1.8 billion cut would result in $6.5 billion in total \n     growth, $5.3 billion in production costs and $1.2 billion in \n     engineering and manufacturing development costs.\n\n  In other words, you would not be saving $1.8 billion; you would have \nto bleed out another $6.5 billion. So by this time we would have $26, \n$27 billion in this weapons system--almost two decades--but no \nfighters.\n  Anytime you develop a system of that magnitude, there have been \nissues that surround it. But they have all been managed. Extensive \ncongressional oversight has been very significant over the development \nof the aircraft. Its problems have been dealt with and managed. As I \nsaid, we are at the point of actually inheriting this unique fighter.\n  There was an article in the Washington Post this morning by Richard \nHallion. I will read a couple paragraphs.\n\n       There was some irony in the House Appropriations \n     Committee's canceling production funding last week for the \n     Air Force's next generation fighter--the Lockheed-Martin F-22 \n     Raptor. The action came only weeks after America's military \n     forces proved--for the third time since 1990--that exploiting \n     dominant aerospace power is the irreplaceable keystone of our \n     post-Cold War strategy for successful quick-response crisis \n     intervention.\n\n  I believe everybody at this point, after the Persian Gulf, after Iraq \nand Kosovo, is looking anew at traditional war strategy. Who would have \never thought you could have flown the thousands of sorties that were \ninvolved in Kosovo with no combat casualties?\n\n       No issue has been more misunderstood than the F-22. The \n     plane links radar-evading stealth with the ability to cruise \n     at supersonic speeds and to exploit and display data from \n     various sources to better inform the pilot about threats and \n     opportunities.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I think the other Senators are here for \ntheir prearranged time, so I will not go on. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield myself such time as I consume under the 30 \nminutes allocated to this side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/22/senate-section/article/S8976-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8976-S8980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we now turn to another agenda in the \nSenate. By direction of the majority party, we turn to the subject of \ntax cuts. It is a corner that we have navigated before in this \nCongress. I was thinking that it might be useful to have had Daniel \nWebster in this Chamber to say to Members, as he said many years ago: \n``Necessity compels me to speak the truth rather than pleasing things. \nI should indeed like to please you, but I prefer to save you, whatever \nbe your attitude toward me.''\n  It certainly must be pleasing to say to constituents that we would \nlike to give tax breaks as far as the eye can see, upwards of a half a \ntrillion, three-quarters of a trillion, and some say $1 trillion. What \na wonderful thing.\n  This country is doing quite well. Its economy is moving ahead with \nsignificant health. Unemployment is way down. Inflation is way down. \nThere are a lot of things in this country to be thankful for.\n  Part of the reason to be thankful for that is, in 1993, some of us in \nCongress had the vision to steer this country to a different course. If \nwe remember, in 1993, we were facing a $290 billion Federal deficit--\n$290 billion. The economists told us that for the rest of the decade we \nwould have anemic economic growth and deficits.\n  We passed a piece of legislation in this Congress. I voted for it. I \nwas proud to do so. When people said: We're\n\n[[Page S8977]]\n\ngoing to blame you for voting for that, I said: Don't blame me. Please \ngive me credit for it. I won't run away from that vote.\n  It was a tough, hard vote. It increased some taxes, mostly on those \nin top 1 or 2 percent, and it cut some spending. It was tough economic \nmedicine, but it signaled to the country we were going to put this \ncountry back on track with a responsible fiscal policy that would lead \nsomeday to a balanced budget.\n  We passed that by one vote in the House and one vote in the Senate--\none vote. We did not get one vote from the majority side--not one. We \nprovided all of the votes to pass that legislation at that point. We \nwere widely criticized for it. In fact, we had Members on the other \nside predict that it would lead to a depression; it would lead to \nmassive unemployment; it would collapse our economy; it would be awful \nfor our country.\n  This country has had unprecedented economic growth, declining \nunemployment and low inflation. There are more people working and there \nis more home ownership. And now we find, instead of a $290 billion \nbudget deficit, budget surpluses ahead.\n  What happens at the first sign of surplus from this bridge on the \nship of state? At the first sign of surplus, the majority party decides \nit is time to abandon the bridge and go down and get the champagne, pop \nthe corks and pass out money to everybody--well, not to everybody--pass \nout money to all the friends from the ship's crew.\n  Let's talk about what all this means.\n  They rely on some vision for the next 10 and 20 years that we will \nhave surpluses forever. Of course, this comes from economists that \ncannot remember their home phone number--telling us what is going to \nhappen 3, 5, and 10 years from now. Those in the majority party say: \nBecause we have all of this good economic news, although we didn't \nparticipate in helping make that happen--we voted against that economic \nplan in 1993--we are now deciding we are going to offer tax breaks of \nunprecedented size.\n  This is what is proposed. The tax breaks that will come to the floor \nof the Senate and will be on the floor of the other body today have as \ntheir priorities that we will not provide any money to make Medicare \nsolvent. We won't provide any money for our domestic priorities: \neducation, health care, defense, and other key investments. We will \nprovide no money for debt reduction. One would expect when times are \ngood, we ought to be able to begin reducing the indebtedness we incur \nwhen times are bad, but there is no money for debt reduction and no \nmoney for Social Security solvency. We are going to have a tax cut of \n$792 billion.\n\n  That is the GOP priority. That is not new. That has always been their \npriority. It is full speed ahead on our priority, and everything else \ncan wait.\n  If you have a pie and you show who get the tax breaks, here is how \nthe pie gets cut. If you are in the top 1 percent of the income earners \nof this country, you get this large piece. If you are in the next 4 \npercent, between 95 and 99, you also get a large piece of the pie. But \nthe lowest 20 percent of the income earners of this country get this \nlittle sliver, just a crumb off the corner. It is always the same, and \nit never changes. The big tax breaks go to the upper-income folks, and \nthe rest are left with tiny crumbs, if any at all.\n  This chart shows the same thing. The top 1 percent get a $23,000-a-\nyear average tax cut. The bottom 60 percent of the wage earners in this \ncountry get a $139 a year tax cut. This chart shows what is going to \nhappen over the next 20 years. The period of time 2000-2004, 2005-2009, \nthe cost of the GOP tax grows substantially. In the second decade, it \nliterally explodes. It will head us right back to the same circumstance \nwe had before of huge Federal deficits.\n  This chart shows the same thing in a different style. These are back \nloaded, exploding tax breaks that benefit the upper-income folks and \nwill, in my judgment, lead to very significant risks for this country.\n  I will ask this question over and over again: If this is your \npriority, just tax cuts above everything else, and tax cuts that go \nlargely to the upper-income folks in this country, do you decide, then, \nthat Head Start, for example, is not important because the domestic \ndiscretionary portion of this budget is fixing to be shrunk like a \nprune? You look at the kind of cuts that are necessary in all of the \nprograms that make this a good country, the investment in our children, \nthe investment in nutrition, the investment in health care, you will \nfind massive cuts in all of those programs in order to pay for tax \nbreaks that say to the folks in this country: We believe if you are in \nthe top 1 percent, you ought to get $22,900 back in tax refunds each \nyear because we think you contribute the most to this country. And if \nyou happen to be in the lowest 20 percent of the income earners of this \ncountry, we have designed a plan that says you are going to get about a \n$1.59 a month.\n  Is that surprising? No. It is the GOP plan from the beginning of \npolitical time. It is what they have always proposed. It is what they \nalways fight for. It is always at the expense of every other priority.\n  We are going to have a big debate about this and should have a big \ndebate. I believe some tax cuts are appropriate, if they are fashioned \nthe right way and they don't put this country's economy at risk. But I \nbelieve they ought not come at the expense of Head Start, education, \nhealth care and so many other key priorities, and especially paying \ndown the debt during good economic times and making sure we extend the \nlife and solvency of Medicare and Social Security. That ought to be \npart of the priority that comes out of this Chamber as well. That is \nwhat we will try to force in this debate on tax breaks in the coming \ndays.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, on the floor of the other body today and \ncoming to the floor of the Senate this coming week is going to be \nlegislation having to do with taxation, having to do with tax cuts. \nJust when we think we have seen just about everything in terms of \nirresponsibility and foolishness, we see something literally taking the \ncake. We are seeing some pandering irresponsibility of record \nproportions that would be so serious and so injurious to this Nation's \neconomic future and to the priorities of this country that we simply \nhave to begin to speak about this issue today.\n  What does this issue revolve around? It revolves around the \nCongressional Budget Office's projections that we will have about a \n$964 billion budget surplus over the coming 10 years, over and above \nwhat is needed for Social Security. Those are projections 10 years out, \nincredibly tenuous given the fact that in the past we haven't been able \nto make projections for a year out that have been accurate, much less \nfor 10 years. But nonetheless, that is the baseline for this debate.\n  Given the economic prosperity this administration has brought us, \nparticularly the 1993 Budget Act, passed without a single Republican \nvote in either body, we do have a unique opportunity now to do some \nextraordinary things for ourselves and for the coming generation of \nAmericans in terms of eliminating the accumulated Federal debt, make \nsome key investments and, yes, assisting with some targeted tax relief \nto those families who need it most.\n  But what do we see coming to us from the other body? What do we see \ncoming on this floor this coming week? We see a tax plan from our \nRepublican majority friends suggesting that with this $964 billion, if \nyou even believe it is going to happen, first of all, nothing be set \naside for the preservation and the strengthening of Medicare, nothing.\n  Second, in order to give essentially this entire amount of money back \nas\n\n[[Page S8978]]\n\ntax relief--primarily to the most wealthy people who are making the \npolitical contributions in this body; the typical American family gets \nabout a buck a week tax relief--we will have to then reduce over the \ncoming 10 years defense spending buying power by about 17 percent, at a \ntime when we are having a hard time trying to figure out how to \nmaintain our security responsibilities around the world as it is. This \ntax package would assume, then, that we will have a 23-percent \nreduction in domestic spending buying power over the coming 10 years.\n  If you buy into this tax package, that means you close veterans \nhospitals. That means you have significant reductions in Head Start \nprograms, education programs. That means you give up on the idea we \nwill have some sort of partnership for rebuilding our schools and \nbringing new technology into our schools. It means gutting education \nand agricultural programs. It means severe cuts in parks, law \nenforcement, in medical research, all the things most Americans think \nare crucial to our Federal, State and local, public and private \npartnerships that make this the great country it is.\n  On top of that, if you think that is not bad enough, there is zero \nset aside for the reduction of the accumulated Federal national debt we \nhave accumulated over the 200-year history of this country but which \nprimarily came about during the 1980s, during the Reagan and Bush years \nand now stands at $5.6 trillion. It does nothing to buy down that \nexisting debt.\n  And if the decision is made down the road we are not going to knock \ndefense spending down by 17 percent, then the consequence of that, \nunder this plan, would be that we would have to reduce domestic \nspending--Head Start, education, parks, law enforcement, medical \nresearch, VA hospitals, agriculture, all that range of initiatives, by \n38 percent.\n  This is a radical, extremist agenda for the Nation. The American \npeople deserve better than this.\n  Just when you think that is as bad as things can get, you look at the \nway this tax package is constructed, with the tax reductions, \nespecially back loaded for the very wealthy, and then what do you find \non the next page? Not only have you given up your entire domestic \nagenda, not only have you done nothing to reduce the accumulated \nFederal deficit, not only have you done nothing for Medicare, but the \ncost of this recipe explodes to double the cost in the next 10 years. \nWhat a radical agenda. It would be foolish, were it not so serious and \nso injurious to our Nation.\n  Then one last thought: The Federal Reserve has recently raised \ninterest rates by about a quarter percent. Some are attempting in this \ntax package to put one foot on the gas while the other foot is on the \nbrake. If we were to do this, the obvious next consequence would be a \nsignificant increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. There is \nalready a rise in interest rates now, without any tax cut whatever. \nThat is a silent tax on every American.\n  On every parent who wants to send a child to college or a vocational \nschool, and on everyone who wants to buy a house, or buy a car, or a \nfarmer who wants to finance his operation, or a businessperson who \nwants to expand his business and create new jobs, that is a killing \ntax. It is a higher interest rate as a consequence of this incredible \nirresponsibility that we see going on in the House today and coming to \nthe Senate this coming week.\n  Thank goodness for the future of America President Clinton has \nindicated he will veto this nonsense. But wouldn't it be better if we \ncould work together in a bipartisan fashion on a constructive, positive \nagenda that, yes, would provide some tax relief to working class \npeople, working families, the families who struggle to make a car \npayment, a house payment, and to keep jeans and tennis shoes on the \nkids, the people who make the economy go. Let's provide tax relief \nthere, but let's pay down some of the national debt, which is probably \nthe single-best thing we can do in any kind of budget plan. We should \nmake sure we make key investments in education, in Head Start, in \nmedical research, and keep the VA hospitals open. We can do all of \nthese things with thoughtful balance and moderation. But moderation \nseems to be the last thing in the world our Republican friends want to \nbring to either the other body or this floor in terms of tax and budget \nagendas.\n  I think where you put your money says a great deal about the \ncharacter of any government because rhetoric is cheap. Everybody is for \neverything around here, until it is time to put some money where your \nmouth is and do the balancing that needs to be done. That is what we \nsee not happening on the other side. What we are seeing is pandering \nand irresponsibility and radical agendas that may make a statement for \nthe coming elections. Who knows? It seems to me it makes a very \nnegative statement.\n\n  But we deserve better than that. This Nation deserves better, and \nthis Nation needs better than that. We need to come up with a budget \nand tax reduction package that is moderate, thoughtful, and deals with \nsome of the tax relief that is needed but makes investments that are \nneeded and pays down the accumulated Federal debt. That will keep the \ncost of money down and make it easier to send a kid to college or \nvocational school, buy a house, buy a car, or keep a farming or \nranching operation going, all of those things, if we make the right \ndecisions.\n  But this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Many of us thought, in \nthe years we have had the opportunity to serve in Congress, several \nthings would never happen in our lifetime: The fall of the Berlin Wall, \nthe collapse of the Soviet Union, and the possibility that we would \never be on the floor arguing about what to do about budget surpluses. \nWe have that opportunity. Let's not waste that opportunity.\n  Let's take a thoughtful, constructive, positive approach to how to \nuse those dollars as we embark on this next millennium and revisit this \ntax package so we emerge from this debate with a package that, in fact, \ndoes address the priorities that I think the American people want us to \naddress, and that does it, hopefully, in a bipartisan fashion and in a \nway that will leave our economy stronger and leave our families \nstronger going into the coming century than we are now and, certainly, \nfar stronger than what would happen if we tragically actually passed \nand enacted the tax agenda that we see occurring on the House floor \ntoday and is coming to this body next week.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Democratic \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator \nfrom South Dakota.\n  Yogi Berra, one of the greatest ``political philosophers'' of all \ntime, may have said, ``This is deja vu all over again.'' If he didn't \nsay it, he should have because this debate that you are hearing on the \nfloor of the Senate is almost a carbon copy of the debate of 1981. \nThink about that for a moment. We were in the first year of the Reagan \nPresidency. We had accumulated, in the entire history of the United \nStates of America, $1 trillion in debt, and the Republican Party came \nto the floor and said now is the time for a massive tax cut. Their \nsupporters cheered, they enacted their massive tax cut, and what \nhappened? Two significant things:\n  First, we saw a dramatic increase in the national debt. A $1 trillion \naccumulated debt in the entire history of the United States grew into \nmore than $4 trillion over the span of the Reagan and Bush Presidencies \nbecause of that 1981 decision.\n  Second, it was such a bad decision that the American economy \nstruggled from recession to recession. That is what happened the last \ntime the Republican Party brought their vision of America to the floor \nof the Congress.\n  In 1992, the American voters said: Enough; this isn't working. We \nwant a change. And they elected the Clinton-Gore administration, which, \nin 1993, came to Congress and said: Let us try to get back on the right \ntrack; let us try to reduce the deficits on an annual basis, and let us \ntry to get the economy moving again.\n  You should have heard the Republican Senators who came to the floor--\nthe same ones who begged for a tax cut when the Clinton plan was \ndebated.\n\n[[Page S8979]]\n\n  Remember, not a single Republican Senator or House Member voted for \nthat plan. Some of the things they said are absolutely classic. The \nSenator from Texas, Phil Gramm, who is very outspoken in favor of this \ntax cut, said of the Clinton plan:\n\n       I want to predict tonight that if we adopt this bill, the \n     American economy is going to get weaker and not stronger, the \n     deficit 4 years from today will be higher than it is today.\n\n  That was Phil Gramm of Texas, August 5, 1993. Completely wrong. \nCompletely wrong.\n  The Clinton plan passed, and two things happened. Annual deficits \nstarted to come down, and, in addition to that, the economy started \nmoving forward. Just look at the news. You don't have to believe a \npolitician. Unemployment is down. Housing starts are up. Business \nstarts are up. Inflation is under control. America is moving forward, \nand we can feel it. Consumer confidence and business confidence is at \nan all-time high.\n  Two years ago, if you would have come to this Senate Chamber, the \nRepublican Members were so despondent over the deficits that they \nwanted to amend the Constitution. That isn't done very often in \nAmerica, but they said: We need to pass a balanced budget amendment. \nWhy? So the Federal courts can force Congress not to overspend. A \nconstitutional amendment to give a Federal judge the power to stop \nCongress from spending because deficits were out of control. That was \nonly 2 years ago.\n  Now what debate do we hear on the floor? It isn't about deficits and \nconstitutional amendments; it is about the surplus and tax cuts. And I \nhave to tell you, quite honestly, the Republican agenda is out of \ncontrol. What they are suggesting now is a $1 trillion tax cut that, \nfrankly, will not only imperil the state of our economy but also could \ndrive us right back into deficits again. How will we pay for that?\n  I would like to yield to the Senator from California because she made \nan observation that I think should be part of the record of this \ndebate. I yield to her for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague very much for his \nvery fine summation of where we are.\n  It is amazing to me to see how far we have come in this economy, from \nthe worst of all days when people were despondent. I remember when \nPresident George Bush went to Japan and he became ill, and it became \nkind of a symbol of what was wrong with this country. We went to Japan \nto find out how they were doing it and what was wrong with our country. \nWhy could we not get our economy under control? Now we finally have it \nunder control. It is in the best place it has been for generations, as \nmy friend has shown us, in terms of employment, in terms of job \ncreation, in terms of no more deficit, in terms of being able to \nfinally pay down the debt, in terms of housing starts and business \nstarts--you name it--inflation. It is all going right.\n\n  What do our friends say? Whoops. Let's change course. We finally have \nit right, but let's turn around and go back to the bad old days.\n  It is amazing to me. I want to ask my friend a question about the so-\ncalled surplus. I was rather stunned to see my chairman, Senator \nDomenici, of the Budget Committee, for whom I have great respect, hold \na press conference yesterday and tell the press that there is a $3 \ntrillion surplus. I sort of thought maybe I misheard it. He repeated it \nfour times, at least. He said there is a $3 trillion surplus. \nTherefore, all we are giving is a $1 trillion tax cut. It is a very \nsmall part of the overall surplus. Don't the American people deserve a \nrefund?\n  I want to ask my friend a couple of questions. Is it not true that $2 \ntrillion of that $3 trillion so-called surplus is Social Security? It \nisn't anyone else's; it belongs to Social Security. Is my friend in \nagreement with me on that point?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from California is right because we are not \ndealing with a real surplus. We are dealing with a surplus in the \nSocial Security trust fund which the Republican Party now wants to give \naway as a tax cut. Does that make sense? Does it make sense to any of \nus paying into Social Security, or those who hope to derive some \nbenefit from it, at this point in time to decide to spend Social \nSecurity funds to give a tax cut?\n  I might say to the Senator from California: Look at the tax cut. \nThere they go again. The Republicans cannot leave well enough alone. \nThe economy is moving forward. Annual deficits are coming down. They \nwant to put a tax cut package in place.\n  And look carefully at the winners under the Republican tax cut plan. \nFor Mr. Bill Gates, good news. If you are in the top 1 percent, for the \nRepublican tax, a cut of $22,000 a year--not bad. Will he notice?\n  But, look, if you are in the lowest 20 percent of average wage \nearners in America, under the Republican tax cut plan, listen to this, \n$22 a year--not bad--$22 a year for the average working family in \nAmerica, and $22,000 for Mr. Trump and Mr. Gates.\n  There they go again.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield? I want him to know something. That \n$22,000 a year, back to the top 1 percent, is an average, I say to my \nfriend. I can assure you that Mr. Trump and Mr. Gates will get far more \nthan that in a refund.\n  As we discussed yesterday on this floor, when you think of people who \nwork at the minimum wage and get dirt under their nails, and work hard \nand sometimes have two jobs, that average refund to the top 1 percent \nis twice as much as they earn in 1 year. There they go again. It is \nright on target.\n  I want to ask another question of my friend. We don't have a $3 \ntrillion surplus because we already agreed that $2 trillion belongs to \nSocial Security. That leaves $1 trillion. We know Medicare is in \ntrouble. We know Social Security and Medicare are the twin pillars of \nthe safety net. What good does it do someone on Social Security if they \nknow they get that but their Medicare premium is going to go up so high \nthat they can't afford to buy their food or pay their rent? So we need \nto take care of Medicare. How much is in the Republican plan to save \nMedicare?\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The answer is clear. Zero. Medicare is a word about which \nthe Republicans don't want to talk. They don't want to use it. Yet we \nall know that, unless we do something significant for the Medicare \nprogram, by the year 2015 this program will be bankrupt and 40 million \nAmericans, elderly and disabled, who rely on Medicare for their health \ninsurance have a time of reckoning that is just over the horizon.\n  We on the Democratic side believe that if there is going to be any \nsurplus, as the President has suggested, we should dedicate it, first, \nto any surplus we realize to Social Security; second, to Medicare; and, \nthird, to reducing the national debt.\n  I ask you: Which is the party of fiscal conservatism?\n  Listen to this debate: $1 trillion taken out of funds such as the \nSocial Security trust fund to give away to the wealthiest of Americans, \nwhich is the Republican plan, or the Democratic plan, which says to \ntake care of priorities--reducing our debt, reducing our need to \nappropriate money each year for interest on the debt, and making sure \nthat Medicare and Social Security are strong enough to survive.\n  I think our position is not only fiscally conservative but I think it \nis fiscally sane. Others will characterize an alternative.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wanted to ask the Senator from Illinois if it is not \nthe case that the proposal by the Republicans for very significant tax \ncuts, much of which will go to the upper income folks, would mean that \nthey have nothing for debt reduction? Isn't it the case that in tough \neconomic times--for example, when we passed the Deficit Reduction Act \nin 1993, with no help from the other side and not one vote even--in \ntough economic times your debt increases? During good economic times, \nyou ought to reduce the debt. Isn't it the case that this fiscal policy \nplan of theirs provides nothing for debt reduction during good economic \ntimes? Is that fiscal conservatism?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is fiscal insanity. I would say to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota that we hope this economy will continue to progress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the distinguished Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.\n\n[[Page S8980]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from North Dakota that if we are \ngoing to prepare ourselves for the future, we have to prepare for the \npossibility of a reduction. I don't think that is wild-eyed thinking.\n  The Republican plan makes no contingency plan that suggests we might \nhave a downturn in the economy. We should be reducing the debt and \npledging our surplus, whatever it may be, to reducing that debt and \nmaking certain Social Security and Medicare are there for years to \ncome.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, like so many of my fellow Senators, I just \ncame from the memorial service that took place in Statuary Hall for the \ntwo police officers, Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut, who gave \ntheir lives 1 year ago defending the Capitol and those of us who work \nin these hallowed Halls.\n  I just got to thinking, when I was there watching all of the \nuniformed police officers standing so gallantly up on the platform, \nwhat a tough job these policemen have, what a terribly tough job they \nhave.\n  On the one hand, because of the very nature of our jobs, we have to \nbe accessible; we have to expose ourselves to the public on a daily \nbasis, whether it is out in the front of the Capitol or over in the \ngrass or walking between offices. We have to be available and \naccessible to the public. The police officers have to let us be \naccessible. We cannot put a shield around us.\n  On the other hand, it is the police officers' sworn duty to protect \nus and to keep us safe from harm.\n  All police officers have a tough job in this country. I think, above \nall, the police officers who work in and around the Capitol have the \ntoughest job of all because they have these two conflicting \nresponsibilities--to make us accessible, to not put shields around us, \nto keep this an open, public place, to be the shrine of freedom, and, \non the other hand, to protect us and defend us from harm.\n  I just must say, I am as guilty as anyone; I never take the time to \nthank the police officers who protect us. We pass by them every day. We \ngo in and out of the doors. We see them on the subway. We exchange \npleasantries.\n  I am going to make an extra special effort from now on just to say \nthank you to these police officers, the men and women who protect us \ndaily in the Capitol and who, as Officers Chestnut and Gibson showed a \nyear ago, are willing to lay down their lives for us. We should thank \nthem every day. I do so now and will make a special effort to do so in \nthe future.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Harkin pertaining to the introduction of \nlegislation is located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/22/senate-section/article/S8980-4", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8980-S8982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO JOHN F. KENNEDY, JR., CAROLYN BESSETTE KENNEDY, AND LAUREN \n                                BESSETTE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise with great sadness today to pay \ntribute to the lives of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his wife Carolyn, and her \nsister, Lauren Bessette. My thoughts and prayers are with these \nfamilies, for at this very moment, as we know, they are at sea to bring \nthese wonderful, outstanding young Americans to a final rest.\n  We in the Senate, of course, feel very close to this tragedy because \nof our affection for our own colleague, Senator Ted Kennedy. We in \nMaryland feel very close to this family because we are the home to \nEunice and Sarge Shriver, to Mark Shriver, who has taken his place in \nthe House of Delegates, and our own Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, \nwho lost a brother just a few months ago. As the eldest of\n\n[[Page S8981]]\n\nthe Kennedy cousins, she has endured much. She is living a life of \nservice that certainly would make her father as proud as those of us in \nMaryland.\n  The entire Kennedy family has suffered so much. They have also given \nso much. It is a family of war heroes, Senators, Congressmen, and a \nPresident of the United States. They are also defenders of the poor, \nenvironmentalists, educators, and artists. They fight to give every \nAmerican an opportunity to build better lives for themselves and to \nbuild stronger communities.\n  Many of us in this Senate were inspired to lives of public service \nbecause of John F. Kennedy. As a young social worker, I thought he was \ntalking to me when he called our generation to service. When he said, \n``Ask not what your country can do for you--but what you can do for \nyour country,'' I believed it. I wanted to do something. That is why I \ncommitted myself even more forcefully to my own career in social work.\n  He practiced passionate, active idealism that was different from \nanything we had seen before in politics. That is why we hoped his son \nwould continue that legacy. In many ways he had already begun to do \nthat.\n  John Kennedy, Jr., could have lived the life of the idle rich, but he \ndid not. He worked several years as a D.A. in New York, and recently he \ncreated a magazine to bring young people into politics who were \nindifferent to it. He endured intense press interest with grace and \ngood humor. It seemed as if he understood his family was a part of the \nlives of all Americans.\n  While we all know the Kennedys, we cannot forget the Bessette family. \nThey are suffering unimaginable pain with the death of two of their \ndaughters. Carolyn Bessette Kennedy also lived in the spotlight. She, \ntoo, handled the attention with grace and charm. She had the same \npassion for life as her husband. Her sister Lauren was also making her \nown career in investment banking.\n  Wherever we turn, the Kennedys have touched America. We have been \nthere for their hopes, their dreams, and their good days. We want our \ndear friend, Senator Kennedy, the entire Kennedy family, and the \nBessettes to know they are not alone today. We mourn with them, and we \nthank them for their contributions to America and for their own call to \nduty and to public service.\n  God bless them and God bless America that we have in our midst a \ngreat legacy.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nexpressing grief over the passing of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his wife \nCarolyn Bessette Kennedy, and Lauren Bessette; as well as extending \ncondolences to the Kennedy and Bessette families over their losses.\n  It is difficult to express the sense of tragedy and loss that all of \nus feel over the passing of these three young, dynamic, and charismatic \nindividuals. Clearly, John F. Kennedy, Jr. captured the hearts and \nimagination of millions of Americans, and his untimely and violent end \nhas saddened all those who felt some sort of connection to this \npromising and handsome young man. Certainly the tremendous outpouring \nof sympathetic gestures we are witnessing in Massachusetts, New York, \nand here in Washington stand as testament to the high regard in which \nhe was held.\n  To be frank, I did not know John F. Kennedy, Jr. all that well, \nthough I have certainly been well acquainted with his family through \nthe years. Here in the United States Senate, I have had the distinct \npleasure and honor of serving with his father and both his uncles; and \nin years past, I worked closely with Representative Joe Kennedy on an \nissue of great mutual concern. Clearly this is a family that values \npublic service and has sought to make a contribution to the nation \nthrough policy, politics, and activism. The passion and intensity which \nthe Kennedys--particularly John, Bobby, and Ted--brought to Washington \nand directed toward their policy goals are commendable and enviable. \nFew people have approached their careers in government with the same \nvigor and enthusiasm than have the members of the Kennedy family.\n  Though John F. Kennedy, Jr. had not entered politics, he was someone \nwho shared his family's desire to make a difference. He was involved in \nany number of philanthropic and charitable undertakings, and typical of \na family that seeks to help others, he was personally involved in these \nendeavors. His reputation was of a sincere, kind, and high minded man. \nThere is little doubt that had John F. Kennedy, Jr. decided to follow \nthe path that his father, uncle, and cousins had taken and sought \nelected office, he would have had a bright political future and would \nhave made an even greater mark on society and history.\n  There is great sadness in the fact that this tragedy not only snuffed \nout the promising light of John F. Kennedy, Jr., but took the lives of \nhis wife and sister-in-law as well. It is impossible to comprehend how \nfate could be so cruel to these families, for these young individuals \ndeserved to enjoy long and rich lives. Certainly, this tragedy is only \nintensified for the Bessettes who lost two daughters suddenly and \nunexpectedly, and it is impossible for any of us to truly know the \ngrief they are feeling. Hopefully with time, they will come to some \nsort of peace and understanding with this inexplicable event.\n  Earlier today, the ashes of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his wife, and \nsister-in-law were committed to the sea and a sad chapter of American \nhistory is drawn to a close. To our friend and colleague, Senator Ted \nKennedy, we extend our deepest condolences on the loss of your nephew \nand we commend you on your stoicism in exercising your responsibilities \nas the patriarch of your family. This was an unenviable task, yet one \nyou carried out with dignity, strength, and reserve.\n  Coming to terms with death is never an easy or pleasant task, but I \nhave always found that it is best to remember a person for the things \nhe or she did during their life, keep that person in your heart and \nmind, and to try and honor their memory in your actions. If people \nfollow this course with John F. Kennedy, Jr., I think that they will \nremember a man who tried to make a difference with his life, and \nhopefully they will be inspired to emulate his commitment to public \nservice.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for several days, we have waited anxiously \nfor evidence of news I did not want to believe. I did not want to \nbelieve that tragedy could come again to the Kennedy family. I did not \nwant to believe that the Bessette family could lose two beautiful \ndaughters in one tragic accident. But as of yesterday afternoon, I was \nconfronted with reality. I am profoundly saddened by the tragic death \nof John F. Kennedy, Jr. and his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her \nsister, Lauren.\n  My relationship with President Kennedy goes back almost 40 years. In \n1960, I formed the first Young Democrats organization at Utah State \nUniversity and worked hard as a young college student for the election \nof President John F. Kennedy. On the wall in my Senate office, I have a \nletter from Senator Kennedy written a few weeks written a few weeks \nbefore his inauguration as President in 1961. That letter is a \nthoughtful and considerate note thanking me for my efforts as a campus \norganizer.\n  As a young law student in Washington, I worked at night as a Capitol \nPolice Officer. On more than one occasion, I remember President \nKennedy's visit to the Capitol. In fact, in my capacity as a police \nofficer, I walked past President Kennedy's casket while it laid in \nstate in the Capitol Rotunda.\n  For three generations, the Kennedy family has contributed much to the \npolitical and cultural life of our Nation. Three members of the Kennedy \nfamily have served the Nation as U.S. Senators, and other members have \nserved in the U.S. House of Representatives, the Ambassadorial Corp and \nother important positions of state. They also serve as leaders, in \nbusiness and in the world of cultural affairs.\n  Historians will one day write that the Kennedy family is the most \nremarkable family in our Nation's history. They have endured tragedy \nafter tragedy. But despite adversity, this family has persevered and \nfound the will and strength to make our nation a better place. Since \nthe presidency of John F. Kennedy, the Kennedy family has become part \nof the American family. For us in government, the Kennedy family is \nsynonymous with the finest in American politics. They inspire us to \ndream; they teach use to enjoy life; they make us feel noble.\n\n[[Page S8982]]\n\n  John F. Kennedy, Jr. had large shoes to fill as the son of a great \nPresident and a beautiful, elegant and strong mother. While John F. \nKennedy, Jr. was born into the privilege and the fame of his family, he \nhandled it better than anyone I know. His dignity, his sense of style, \nhis connection to ordinary people was unsurpassed.\n  Finally, I admire the strength and courage of my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Ted Kennedy. Senator Kennedy is the patriarch of \nthis great family. He has served the Nation and the people of \nMassachusetts with distinction in the U.S. Senate for almost four \ndecades and the people of Massachusetts have repeatedly shown their \ngratitude for his service. Senator Kennedy has given much to this \ncountry and yet he has never forgotten the legacy of his distinguished \nfamily. To Senator Kennedy, to the entire Kennedy family, and to the \nBessette family, I extend my condolences.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, our State of New York has lost three of \nits finest citizens. I want to add my voice to the condolences to John \nKennedy's sister Caroline, to his entire family, and to his wife's \nfamily, as well, for their double loss. Anyone who knew these three \npeople knew they were the finest of New Yorkers and the finest of \nAmericans. They were decent people; they were concerned people; they \nwere people who cared about average folks.\n  As was noted, John, in particular, would never go by somebody and \nmake them feel they were less significant than he was, despite his \nenormous wealth, attractiveness, good looks, his grace, and everything \nelse about him. He and his wife were a man and woman of grace. I am \ntold that her sister was as well, although I did not know her.\n  So we in New York particularly mourn our loss. John had become a real \nNew Yorker, and the Bessette girls always were. There is nothing we can \ndo but pray that they have met their final reward, and that the wounds \nthat are so deep in their families, with God's help, heal quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/22/senate-section/article/S8982-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8982-S8985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY AND RELATED \n              AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1217\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. What is the business of the Senate now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the Gregg amendment No. \n1217.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I understand I have a few minutes to speak, \nand I will take only a few minutes right now and reserve the remainder \nof the time when I have completed.\n  I want to be very brief at this point. Mr. President, I want to \nseparate out two aspects of the Gregg amendment: One I wish to \ncompliment him on, and one I am going to remain silent on. The one part \nI want to compliment him on is that I think the reauthorization of the \nviolent crime trust fund for another 5 years is the single-most \nsignificant thing we could do to continue the war on crime.\n  In 1994, when we introduced the Biden crime bill, which eventually \nbecame the crime bill of 1994 which had the 100,000 cops in it, the \nViolence Against Women Act, and many other things, toward the end of \nthat debate, with the significant help of the senior Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Gramm, who didn't like many aspects of my bill, and the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, who did like the bill, we \nall agreed on what was viewed as sort of a revolutionary idea--that \ncrime control was the single-most undisputable responsibility of the \nFederal Government domestically. We can argue about whether there \nshould be welfare. We can argue about whether we should be involved in \neducation. But no one can argue about the requirement of the Government \nof the United States to make the streets safe. That is the starting \npoint for all ordered society.\n  So we had an idea, and the three of us joined together to set up a \nviolent crime trust fund. The way we did that was not to raise taxes \nfor America because everybody kept saying: Biden, your bill, over the \nnext 5 years, is going to cost over $30 billion. They were right. \nPutting 100,000 cops on the street costs a lot. Building thousands of \nnew prison cells costs a lot. Spending money on prevention costs a lot. \nThe total of the Biden crime bill was about $30 billion over 5 years in \n1994 when I introduced it.\n  They said: How are we going to pay for it? None of us likes telling \nthe citizens the truth. We all like lying to you, telling you we are \ngoing to find a magic way to do this that is not going to cost you any \nmoney. The American public wants safer streets, and they have gotten \nthem, I might add. Crime has gone down significantly every year since \nthe crime bill was introduced. I am not claiming it is only because of \nthat, but it is in large part because of that.\n  So the way we reached this accord was Senator Gramm, who wanted to \nsee the size of the Federal Government cut even more urgently than--I \nwill speak for myself--even more urgently than I did--we codified, as \npart of this deal, the agreement that we would let 250,000 Federal \nemployees go. We would shrink the size of the Federal Government. And \nwe did.\n  The second part of the agreement I wanted was that the paycheck we \nused to pay the person working in the Justice Department or in the \nDefense Department or at IRS, who was not going to be rehired, we take \nJohn Jones' paycheck and put it into a trust fund to do nothing but \ndeal with violent crime in America. Not an innovative notion--that \nconcept of a trust fund--but it is fairly radical in terms of applying \na Social Security-type trust fund--only this does have a lockbox--a \ntrust fund of dedicated revenues to deal with nothing but crime.\n  The good news about that and the reason I felt so strongly about that \nat the time I wrote the bill was it is the one place no one can \ncompete. If it is in general funds--and to people who don't share my \nview about the single-most important responsibility of Government is to \nmaintain order--it is in competition. If it is general revenues, the \nCOPS Program or the prevention programs or building prisons is in \ncompetition with money for education, money for the space program, \nmoney for the Defense Department, and money for every other function of \nthe Government. By having this trust fund, though, it is not in \ncompetition with anything. It is there. It is set aside. It is similar \nto a savings account to fight crime.\n\n  I respectfully suggest that it worked. Now, under the Biden crime \nbill, which is due to expire this year, the trust fund will end. This \nspecial, dedicated pot of money that nobody can compete for, which is \nnot paid for by raising taxes, is paid for by not lowering taxes \nbecause it is legitimate to say: Biden, if you eliminate the trust \nfunds, you can take John Jones' paycheck, the guy who left the Treasury \nDepartment in 1997, and you can give it back to the taxpayers as a tax \ncut.\n  That is true. But I choose safe streets over tax cuts. The tax cut \nwould be minuscule, I might add.\n  So when I heard that my friend from New Hampshire was taking language \nessentially the same as the Hatch-Biden bill that passed out of here in \njuvenile justice, the same as the language I have been reintroducing \neverywhere I can and in every bill I can in the last 4 years, I thought \nnot only is he an enlightened fellow but there has been a bit of an \nepiphany, that, my Lord, the powerful chairman of the subcommittee of \nthe Appropriations Committee has seen the Lord, has seen the light, and \nI was overjoyed.\n  So I said to my staff: I am going to go up there and compliment him. \nLiterally, I said this this morning. They said: Don't be so quick. I \nsaid: Why? They said: There is a little kicker here. The kicker is once \nthis amendment that you, Biden, have fought so hard for over the last \n12 years, even before the crime bill was passed--once it is adopted, \nthere will be a little amendment attached to it that has to do with the \nway this place functions procedurally, affecting how we can move \nsubstantively.\n  I will not speak to that. I will only say and plead with my friend \nfrom New Hampshire, if and when the second issue is resolved, however \nit is resolved, that he not walk away from the substantive beauty of \nhis amendment as it relates to the trust fund. I don't want to get into \na fight with him about\n\n[[Page S8983]]\n\nlegislating on appropriations and second amendments and the rest. I \nwant to say to him publicly that I truly appreciate the practical \nimpact of reestablishing the violent crime trust fund, if we can do it.\n  I hope in this procedural fight that is above my pay grade right now, \nwhich is about to take place, that a casualty of this fight will not \nend up being us committing for another 5 years to do what we did in the \nlast 5 years--bringing crime in America down. The way to do that is to \nguarantee that the law enforcement agencies of the United States for 5 \nyears do not have to compete with anybody, and we don't have to raise \nanybody's taxes. We are taking those old paychecks, and we are going to \ncontinue to make a deposit, similar to a trust fund in a family, for \ncops, for prisons, and for prevention.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield, I appreciate the kind words of \nthe Senator, and I am duly thankful for those words. As a result, I can \ntell the Senator I am committed to trying to get this authorization, in \nsome manner, in this bill when it returns to Congress--should this bill \never make it to conference, which is very much an issue at this time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I truly appreciate that because I, quite frankly, think--\nand this is presumptuous of me to say because you know as much about \nthese issues as I do, clearly--this is the single-most significant \nthing we can do to continue the successful fight against crime. I \nauthored it, so you might say there is pride of authorship here. But I \ndidn't do this alone. The distinguished Senator from Texas and the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia were really the ones who made \nit happen. I hope, in a bipartisan way, we can continue the funding \nmechanism. I thank him for his comments. If I have any time, I reserve \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \ncontinue to run on this amendment equally divided, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time is left on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at the end of that 5 minutes, I understand \nthere will be 20 minutes, 10 minutes for the Senator from South \nCarolina and 10 minutes for myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dan Alpert, \nwho is a fellow in my office, be granted privileges of the floor during \nthe consideration of S. 1217.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak about \nwhat I see as a funding shortfall for the 2000 census.\n  First, I compliment Chairman Gregg and Senator Hollings for their \nwork on this bill. I fully appreciate the very tight budget constraints \nunder which they have been working. However, I want to make sure all \nSenators also know that, even though we will soon pass this \nappropriations bill, our work is not yet finished.\n  Census day, which is April 1 of the year 2000, is less than 9 months \naway. Still today, at this late date, this bill lacks sufficient \nfunding to adequately conduct the 2000 census.\n  The Founding Fathers recognized the importance of a fair and accurate \ncount of the population. Article I, section 2 of the Constitution \nprovides that Congress is to conduct a decennial census ``in such \nManner as they shall by Law direct.'' In fact, the census is one of the \nfew actions that is mandated by the Constitution.\n\n  Let me take a few minutes to discuss the importance of a full and \naccurate census for all Americans.\n  Data from the 2000 census will be used to apportion House seats among \nthe States for the 108th through the 112th Congresses. The States also \nuse census data to draw legislative districts for congressional seats \nas well as for State and local representatives. In addition, Federal, \nState, and local governments use census information to guide annual \ndistribution of the $180 billion of Federal funds for critical services \nsuch as child care, Social Security, Medicare, education, and job \ntraining.\n  By now, we have all heard details of the serious shortcomings of the \n1990 census. In fact, at the time of the 1990 census, many of us spent \nmany days and hours trying to ensure that a fair census was taken. Mr. \nPresident, 8.4 million people were missed in that census, and 4.4 \nmillion were counted twice.\n  In my State of New Mexico, we suffered the highest undercount of any \nsingle State. There were nearly 50,000 New Mexicans left out of the \ncensus in 1990 and 20,000 of them were children. The worst undercounts \nwere among our Native American and Hispanic communities. A recent \nGeneral Accounting Office estimate found that the 1990 census \nshortchanged my State of New Mexico at least $86 million in much-needed \nFederal grants.\n  The Census Bureau has made substantial efforts to avoid a repetition \nof the undercounts that have hurt my State in the past decade. I \napplaud the Bureau's efforts to reach out to every resident in New \nMexico, particularly the extra efforts they have made to count everyone \nin the Hispanic and the Native American communities. In Spanish, the \nmotto is: ``Hagarse Contar!''--``make yourself count.'' For Native \nAmerican communities, I cannot give you the Navajo or Taos version of \nthat, but clearly the slogan is ``generations are counting on this; \ndon't leave it blank.''\n  So I think everyone agrees that a full and fair census must be our \ngoal. Congress must appropriate all of the funds necessary to produce \nthat full and fair census. The census is not a place where we should be \ncutting corners. It is time to put partisan politics aside to give the \nprofessionals in the Census Bureau the resources they need to get the \njob done.\n  Indeed, the appropriations bill on the floor today does provide \nnearly $2.8 billion for the 2000 census. This is the full amount in the \nPresident's original budget. I thank the chairman for providing the \nCensus Bureau's full initial request.\n  However, as all Senators know, the Supreme Court ruled that under \ncurrent statutes only a traditional head count may be used for \napportionment of House seats among the States. In response to the \nruling, the Census Bureau requested an additional $1.7 billion to \nprovide the best census possible using only the traditional method.\n  The additional funds were requested to cover the Bureau's additional \nworkload, advertising, staffing, and data processing required to \nperform this actual head count which the Supreme Court has interpreted \nthe Constitution to require.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a detailed list of the \nadditional costs for a head count be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, at this point this appropriations bill \ndoes not provide any of the additional funding that the Census Bureau \nhas requested in response to the Supreme Court's January ruling. In \nfairness to the chairman and the ranking member, and the members of the \ncommittee, the Census Bureau's revised request did not arrive until \nvery late in the process. Consequently, the subcommittee may\n\n[[Page S8984]]\n\nnot have had sufficient time to review the supplemental request and \nconduct the normal oversight hearings. I understand the subcommittee \nintends to consider the Census Bureau's supplemental funding request in \nthe near future. I thank the chairman for moving forward promptly and \nfor working on this issue in a spirit of bipartisanship.\n  What worries me is that even with the additional funds required for a \nhead count, in all likelihood we will still fall well short of counting \neveryone and, as in the 1990 census, the undercount will hurt certain \npopulation groups the most. However, I have not come to the floor today \nto debate which enumeration method the Census Bureau should use. Except \nfor apportionment, the Bureau will alleviate the undercount problem by \nusing modern scientific methods. This is the only way to assure that \nStates such as New Mexico will not be shortchanged again.\n  The Supreme Court ruled the 2000 census must include a full head \ncount. I believe Congress has an obligation to provide all the funds \nrequired.\n  I appreciate the very tight budget situation in which we find \nourselves. Time is getting short. Again, I thank the chairman and the \nranking member for their continued bipartisan work on this \nappropriations bill, and I hope that they can move quickly to provide \nthe supplemental funds required for the 2000 census.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n               Additional Costs for a Non-sampling Census\n\n       On January 25, 1999, the Supreme Court ruled that the \n     Census Act bars the use of statistical sampling for purposes \n     of apportionment. Additional funds are therefore needed to \n     cover the increased workload of a non-sampling census, \n     principally follow-up visits to an additional 16 million \n     households (50 percent more than under the sampling design).\n       The President's Budget requests $2.8 billion in FY 2000 to \n     conduct a sampling-based decennial census. The budget \n     amendment will request $1,723 million. Major elements of the \n     $1,723 million are discussed below:\n       $954M for non-response follow-up.--To get responses from \n     all households that do not answer the mail survey, Census \n     will hire more enumerators and will expand non-response \n     follow-up to ten weeks, four weeks more than expected in the \n     previous census design. Training will be increased by half a \n     day to sustain quality with a larger workforce, and each of \n     the 520 Local Census Offices will be provided additional \n     staff. For purposes of quality control, Census will randomly \n     re-interview addresses to verify the data gathered during \n     non-response follow-up.\n       $268M for data collection infrastructure.--The larger \n     workforce also requires that Local Census Office have \n     additional space, phone lines, information technology \n     support, supplies, recruiting materials and advertisements, \n     and related items.\n       $229M for coverage improvement efforts.--The Census Bureau \n     will conduct coverage interviews where forms appear to have \n     deficiencies (e.g., forms lacking complete information on all \n     household members reported) as well as a program to recheck \n     approximately 7.6 million vacant housing units initially \n     classified as vacant or nonexistent and new construction.\n       $219M for a variety of data collection operations, \n     including:\n       $96M in rural areas without street addresses (where surveys \n     are delivered to households by Census rather than the Postal \n     Service) for quality checks before the census date and \n     related activities. Census has learned through its address \n     listing program that this workload will be five million \n     household units larger than originally estimated.\n       $56M for activities including special enumeration methods \n     in remote areas and field verification for the ``Be Counted'' \n     program (which distributes census forms in post offices and \n     other public places) to reduce duplicate and erroneous \n     responses.\n       $42M for enumerating soup kitchens, shelters, and similar \n     facilities. This work will require advance visits as well as \n     two enumerators per facility at census time.\n       $25M to redeliver questionnaires where the Postal Service \n     designated forms as undeliverable (e.g., areas where zip code \n     boundaries have changed recently). The Census Bureau \n     anticipates a workload of five million addresses.\n       $14M to keep all the data processing centers open longer.--\n     The four data processing centers will remain open through \n     September 30, 2000, and process a higher volume of data.\n       $89M for advertising and promotion efforts.--Additional \n     advertising and promotion, including more materials for \n     schools, non-profits, and Sate and local governments, are \n     intended to increase the speed and rate of response and \n     public cooperation.\n       Offsets from reduced sample size.--Because the sampling \n     portion of the census will now be based on larger geographic \n     units, the sample size for the Accuracy and Coverage \n     Evaluation (A.C.E.) program (i.e., sampling) can be reduced \n     without compromising accuracy. Reducing the sampling size for \n     A.C.E. will save $214M relative to the request in the \n     President's Budget.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my concerns \nabout appropriations for the census--an issue that is critical for the \nState of California and for the Nation.\n  The Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations bill for FY 2000 \nallocates $2.8 billion for census operations. It does not include the \nadditional $1.7 billion that the Administration requested to pay for \nits revised census plan. This funding shortfall will certainly result \nin an undercount in the 2000 Census.\n  In the 1990 Census, California lost $2.2 billion because not everyone \nwas counted, and that's not fair. Although the Administration's request \nwas submitted late in the appropriations process, it is crucial that we \nequip the Census Bureau with the funds necessary to make the Census \n2000 as accurate as possible. How can the Census Bureau do its best to \ncarry out an accurate census in 2000, if they do not have the \nappropriate resources? We can be sure that the Census 2000 will fail if \nthe Census Bureau does not have the extra $1.7 billion it needs for \nthis operation.\n  The census has real impact on the lives of people across the Nation. \nInformation gathered from the census count determines how nearly $200 \nbillion of federal funds are allocated. In addition, census information \nis used by states and local governments to plan schools and highways, \nand by businesses in making their economic plans.\n  The 1990 Census undercounted the U.S. population by more than eight \nmillion Americans (mostly children, the poor, and communities of \ncolor), and more than four million Americans were counted twice. In \nCalifornia alone, the 1990 Census missed more than 834,000 people. A \ndisproportionate number of those undercounted in California were \nminorities: Nearly half the net undercount--47 percent--were Hispanic-\nAmerican. Twenty-two percent were African-American and eight percent \nwere Asian Pacific-American. Such differences in census coverage \nintroduce inequities in political representation and in the \ndistribution of funds. Communities from these undercounted ethnic \nminority populations have been disadvantaged by not receiving the \nresources they need for various government programs.\n  A recent study by the General Accounting Office estimates that the \neconomic consequences of the undercount in California caused my state \nto lose over $2.2 billion in federal funds, more than any other state \nand more than the additional appropriations requested by the \nAdministration. As a result, the state did not get its fair share of \nfunds for Medicaid, Child Care and Development, Rehabilitation \nServices, Adoption Assistance, and Foster Care, to mention only a few \nof the federal grant programs affected. Each person missed in the \ncensus cost California $2,660 in Federal funds over the decade.\n  Some of the top 10 undercounted cities in the 1990 census, two of \nwhich are from my state, include:\n  Los Angeles (138,808); San Diego (32,483); Chicago (68,315); Houston \n(66,748); Dallas (37,070); Detroit (28,206); and Philadelphia (23,365).\n  Unless the Census Bureau is allowed to carry out its plan to produce \na more accurate count than that which was produced in 1990, California \nand other states will again lose billions of dollars in federal \nassistance and will again have to subsidize federal programs with state \nand local tax dollars.\n  Since the flawed 1990 population count, the Census Bureau has worked \nwith experts from across the country to design a more accurate census \nfor 2000. The National Academy of Sciences, in three separate reports, \nconcluded that the key to improving accuracy in the census is the use \nof sound statistical methods. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court \nruled that the Census Bureau could not use statistical sampling for \napportionment purposes.\n  Because the Census Bureau cannot use sampling, it has revised its \ncensus plan and requested additional appropriations to carry out a full \nenumeration census, using mail-back census forms and employing an army \nof bureau workers to personally and repeatedly visit those who do not \nrespond. The Census Bureau's operational plan for carrying out the 2000 \nCensus will be the largest peacetime effort in our nation's history, \nand will employ more than 860,000 temporary workers.\n\n[[Page S8985]]\n\n  Mr. President, Congress must make every effort to support the Census \nBureau's plan to count all Americans in 2000. The census should not be \nabout politics. This is an issue of fairness, that impacts Americans \nnationwide. I urge my colleagues to support the additional $1.7 billion \nappropriation that the Census Bureau needs to carry out an accurate \ncensus in 2000. We must do everything we can to ensure that everyone is \nincluded in the count, and that our communities are provided with the \nresources we need.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/22/senate-section/article/S8985-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8985-S8988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                RULE XVI\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in order to explain what is not happening \nnow, I will use some leader time to advise Senators what our hopes are \nand why we are having a quorum at this time.\n  First of all, we are respecting the request of the Democratic leader \nto not go forward to the conclusion of the statements and any action or \nvotes on the pending resolution so they can have a conference to \ndiscuss how to proceed.\n  What is involved here is my continuing effort to have the Senate \ncorrect a mistake that was made a few years ago with regard to rule \nXVI. Rule XVI prohibited legislation on an appropriations bill. A \nprecedent was set, and I confess I helped set that precedent. I \nmistakenly voted to overrule the ruling of the Chair, and so did \nothers, because we were so committed to the issue. It has certainly \nbeen a problem for the Senate ever since.\n  Both sides of the aisle use appropriations bills for every \nlegislative amendment or bill that they might be sponsoring or \nsomething they may be harboring to get a vote on. It has really gotten \nto be a problem in moving appropriations bills forward. The right thing \nto do for the institution, the right thing to do in terms of \nlegislative sanity, and the right thing to do for the people of this \ncountry is to have that precedent established again which would say \nthat Senators cannot offer legislation on appropriations bills without \na point of order being in order. Keep in mind, if you get 51 votes, \nthat could be overturned, but I think it will add additional pressure \non Senators not to abuse that process.\n  The matter pending is the Commerce, State and Justice appropriations \nbill, a very important bill. It provides the funds, obviously, for the \nDepartments of Commerce, State, and Justice. A major portion of law \nenforcement money is in this appropriations bill. We need to move it \nforward.\n\n  The Senate does not always move with dispatch, but sometimes we do. \nOn an appropriations bill, obviously, involving billions of dollars, \nSenators want to have a chance to review it carefully and amendments \nwill be in order. Amendments would be in order after the vote that we \nare about to have or could have reestablishing rule XVI. Senators could \noffer amendments that relate to the bill, that take money out or put \nmoney in, or strike out sections. All of that would still be in order.\n  Senator Daschle and I have basically agreed--in fact, we have \nexchanged pleasantries on this rule XVI issue several times over the \npast few years--that this is a precedent we need to go back and \ncorrect. We had a colloquy a month or so ago in which we said, yes, \nthis needs to be done, and we need to work together to get it done.\n  There is concern that the way this was done, the minority had not \nbeen given notice. But earlier this summer, the minority was aware we \nwere going to try to reverse this precedent, and 2 or 3 days were spent \ntrying to block us from getting an opportunity.\n  I don't necessarily feel we have to do it this way or do it on this \nbill or do it right now, but my question is, if not now, when? If not \nin this way, in what way?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield, when I complete the point. I am \nwilling to work with both sides to try to find a way we can get this \ndone. If there are suggestions by the Senator from South Carolina or \nthe leader, I certainly am very interested in that.\n  I am not interested in any kind of a surprise action, but I am \ninterested in trying to get some results on this which would help \nSenators on both sides of the aisle get the appropriations bills done. \nThat is my only intent.\n  I yield to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the distinguished leader will yield, the truth is, \non the contrary, we were given notice. We were told this particular \nviolent crime trust authorization was just a place setter, a \ngatekeeper, so to speak, in the first degree, and we were going to \nvoice vote it.\n  We were given notice that it was going to be voice voted and not use \nthis particular maneuver to have a time agreement and, thereby, not be \nable to debate the rule change. So we were given notice in the other \ndirection. We were totally misled. We were totally misled. I resent it.\n  Let me go back--there is no use in getting all excited. I am going \nback to Mississippi with the Governor, Ross Barnett. He was the first \nfellow to take the door off the capitol on Wednesday afternoon, and he \nlined them all up. Any and every citizen could come in and express his \ngrief. And one day the trustee who cleaned up the capitol stood in \nline, and he said: I have to go to a funeral; my aunt just died.\n  And Governor Barnett said: When is that?\n  He said: Saturday.\n  I am hastening it along.\n  He said: All right. You can go Saturday; be back here on Monday.\n  And the trustee, Phillips, said: Yes, that is the truth. I will be \nback.\n\n  And so 2 months had passed. Phillips hadn't come back, and the press \nall agreed, let's just jump on Ross and get him this time. And so they \nsaid: Governor, wait a minute; where is the trustee and everything \nelse? And old Ross just laid back and said: If you can't trust the \ntrustee, who can you trust?\n  If I can't trust the chairman and the chairman can't trust the \nranking member, then who can I trust? We were given notice wrongly.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could reclaim my time, I don't know exactly what was \nsaid between the two Members, but I know there is no desire on either \nside to mislead. I want to make it clear that I have suggested to the \nchairmen of our subcommittees that we need to find a time and have a \nway to address this rule XVI issue. It is in the interest of the \nSenate. It is in the interest of both parties. But I am told that you \nhave to get a time agreement to set up this process.\n  If we don't do it here, then, unless we get cooperation on both \nsides, we may never get an opportunity to reinstate rule XVI. I will \nbet the Senator from South Carolina would like to see us do that. I \nwill bet he would like to have the appropriations bills be \nappropriations bills. If we are going to do all of our legislating on \nappropriations bills, let's just get rid of the legislative committees. \nLet's just all get on appropriations. I would like to be on the \nSenator's committee. He is on Commerce, and I would enjoy serving \nthere. I would like to be on the Commerce, State, Justice \nappropriations bill. That would work nicely.\n  I don't think we need to do that, though. We don't want to do it.\n  I want to make it clear, my instructions to our chairmen have been: \nFind a way, find a time for us to get this rule XVI reconsidered and \ncorrected. A mistake was made.\n  I say to the Senator from South Dakota, who is here now, the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, I am using leader time. I was trying \nto explain why we haven't been having votes, what is going on. I was \nreviewing the bidding of why we need to make this change, and I had not \nattributed any quotes or impugned anybody's integrity in their absence. \nI was trying to get this process going forward.\n  That is what is involved. I have been trying to find a way to get \nthis done. I believe the Democratic leader wants to join me in getting \nthis done. We have talked about it privately and publicly. If this is \nnot the time, this is not the way to do it, then I am open to other \ntimes or other ways to do it. But this needs to be done so we can get \nour\n\n[[Page S8986]]\n\nwork done and not have everything in the world offered to every \nappropriations bill, whether it is Commerce, Transportation, Interior, \nor Defense. It is not something that is abused just on the Democratic \nside. As long as this mistake is not corrected, Senators will come in, \nas they are entitled to, from both sides and offer amendments involving \nwho knows what on transportation--it could be an energy issue on \ntransportation or on energy it could be a defense issue. We need to \ncorrect that.\n\n  So that is my intent, my goal. And where we have other issues, I know \nmy colleagues on both sides are interested in other issues. I want to \nsay publicly what I said to Senator Daschle last night. I am going \nthrough the process to appoint conferees to juvenile justice. I am \ngoing to ask consent. If it is objected to, I will file cloture today, \nand we will come back and vote Monday on that issue.\n  With regard to an amendment--or amendments, I think--with regard to \nagriculture and the pending problems across the Nation for our farmers, \nwe need to address that. I will work with all Senators to find a way to \ndo that. I think we ought to do it on the agriculture bill. I don't \nthink we ought to do it on Commerce-State-Justice. It will mess up the \nCommerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. It will delay it. Let's do \nit on agriculture.\n  I am willing to work with Senators on both sides of the aisle to call \nup the agriculture appropriations bill and have this issue addressed. \nIf there is a problem with it procedurally, we will work to overcome \nthat. I don't think we ought to duck that issue; it is too important. \nIt is important to South Dakota, it is important to Mississippi, and to \npeople all over America.\n  I am not interested at all in trying to duck issues. I think we ought \nto do them in the proper way. I have made those commitments to Senator \nDaschle, and I plan to keep them. It will take cooperation on both \nsides because we never know, as leaders, when one of our worthy Members \nwill come swooping in with an objection. We had a unanimous consent \nagreement locked up and ready to sign off; in fact, it was done \nactually on the campaign finance issue. A Senator had not had a chance \nto look at it and he objected. That is his right. Basically, we had it \nall done.\n  So we have to work with Senators on both sides who have particular \nproblems. If we have one Senator who objects that we had not \nanticipated, that presents a problem. If we work together, we can get \nit done. That is what I am trying to do. I would like to get the \nCommerce-State-Justice appropriations bill done. The chairman and \nranking member overcame a lot of things and got agreements on a lot of \nproblems in that bill. But their problem is all the extraneous, \nnongermane legislative stuff we are going to see drift in here to be \nthrown up on their bill. Every appropriations bill has somewhere \nbetween 40 and 100 amendments, and half of them are legislating on an \nappropriations bill. Let's correct this problem.\n  Senator Daschle has been kind enough to wait while I went through \nthose things. I think it answers some of the questions he and his \nMembers have. I thought it would be better to go ahead and address \nthem.\n  Mr. President, parliamentarily, how can we proceed at this time? I \nhave a limit on my leader time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would be prepared to use my leader time \nif the Senator is finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nexplanation and the discussion we have had this morning. I think it is \nfair to say there is no question we were misled about the situation we \nare in today. That is undeniable. I had the opportunity to discuss \nmatters yesterday with regard to the legislative schedule with our \nmajority leader, and this did not come up. We were misled with regard \nto what the intent of the procedure would be. So, clearly, there is a \nbitter taste in the mouths of the minority as we find ourselves in this \nsituation this morning.\n\n  The problem is not legislating on appropriations; the problem is \nlegislating. We are not able to legislate in large measure because on \nvirtually every bill cloture is filed prior to the time amendments are \noffered. Every bill. And so what has happened is the minority is \nrelegated to a set of circumstances that requires us to use whatever \nvehicle becomes available. That isn't the way it used to be, but that \nis the way it has been for the last few years.\n  So I am sympathetic, as I have noted to the majority leader, with \nthis institutional concept of going back to the time when we respected \nappropriations as appropriations bills and also respected the \nauthorization process. But the Senate virtually has eliminated the \nauthorization process, in part, because we don't have the opportunity \nto offer amendments once authorization bills come to the floor. So we \nhave been forced to use the appropriations bills as authorizing, \nappropriating, legislating, the whole gamut, the whole array, the \nuniverse of legislative actions that come with our responsibility. So I \nhave indicated to the majority leader that I would like to find a way \nto overturn the mistake made by Republicans 4 years ago. I am glad they \nhave acknowledged it was a mistake, but I must say, since that mistake \nwas made, we have been driven into a new set of legislative \ncircumstances that make it very difficult to do the people's business.\n  Senator Byrd noted in our caucus that it isn't just this particular \nissue that is troubling. Frankly, there are a number of other issues. \nOne I will mention is the scope of conferences. The majority overruled \nthe Chair on the scope of conference issue. The majority now has the \nability in a conference committee to put anything in a bill, whether or \nnot it was added on the floor of the House or Senate. Anything. It is \nwide open. That, too, is something we ought to be looking at. There is \na huge array of problems, procedurally, I think we ought to address. \nThis is one of them. It seems to me in that context we ought to be \nlooking at whether or not overturning the Chair now is what we need to \ndo.\n  I will say the majority leader has indicated a willingness to work \nwith us in addressing these problems. I am personally concerned about \nthe agriculture appropriations emergency supplemental we have to pass. \nOnce a point of order is reestablished, we are completely locked out. \nThere is no other way to do it. So from both a practical, as well as a \nprocedural, and, frankly, a personal point of view, I am troubled by \nhow we got here this afternoon.\n  I will also note that one of our colleagues who uses the rules as \nsuccessfully as anybody ever has in all 220 years of our history, the \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts, is not here. How ironic it would be \nthat while he is tending to family matters, we took away his rights. So \nI suggest to the majority leader that we schedule another time for a \ngood debate about all the things we should do.\n  I will work with my caucus to find the time, and we will need to have \nthe votes. We know how the votes--I am quite sure I know--will turn \nout.\n  I am prepared to work with the majority leader to schedule a day, but \nnot this afternoon. This is not the moment, for all the reasons I have \noutlined. I think we deserve an opportunity to debate this and all of \nits ramifications, and why it is that we find ourselves here in the \nfirst place, and how we might work--as the majority leader has noted, \ncooperatively. Cooperation is a two-way street. I want to cooperate \nwith him. And I will in every way that I can. But I hope the majority \nwill cooperate with the minority in giving us an opportunity to offer \namendments and not fill the tree and not play the parliamentary game \nout to the extreme so that we are forced to do things we would rather \nnot do.\n  I guess that would be my suggestion--that we find the time, perhaps \nearly next week, to vote. We would agree to a timeframe within which \nthis could be debated and a vote set.\n  I would be happy to discuss either on or off the floor a refinement \nof that recommendation with the majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Or, Mr. President, I \nwill reclaim any leader time I might have so that I can respond and \npick up on what the Senator said.\n  We are somewhat on the horns of a dilemma. If we take extended time \nto\n\n[[Page S8987]]\n\ndebate those issues, then it further delays our ability to get \nappropriations bills done. Conversely, if we don't do it soon, all of \nthe appropriations bills will hopefully be done, and we still will not \nhave addressed this issue.\n  So I would like to pick up on what Senator Daschle said.\n  The suggestion was made that we not do this here but that we do it \nearly next week.\n  I would like to discuss the possibility of having this debate on \nMonday or Tuesday morning and having a vote on this issue.\n  Is that something that would be acceptable to the Senator from South \nDakota?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would want to consult first with the \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts to be sure he could be back that \nearly. I assume he might be back by then. I would want to consult, as \nwell, with my caucus. But that is in keeping with the recommendation \nthat I made.\n  I am not averse necessarily to doing it on Monday or Tuesday, and to \nsetting, as I noted earlier, a timeframe within which we could debate \nit and vote.\n  But, again, this is a matter which I think may require a little more \nconsultation than the time we have this afternoon.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could respond to that and make an observation, if we \ndon't do it Monday or Tuesday, we will be under the rule that we passed \nfor the budget reconciliation provisions. Wednesday, Thursday, and \nFriday will be on the reconciliation-tax cut bill. If we don't do it \nMonday or Tuesday, then it is not done next week.\n  We agreed that we wanted to get this done, but we have not had the \ntime to get together and decide how we were going to get it done.\n  So I am in the position that if I give the Democratic leader notice \nthat we want to get this done, he blocks it, or if we set it up to get \nit done without advance notice, the Democratic leader says, well, that \nis not fair.\n  We need to get it done. Everybody knows we need to get it done.\n  I would propose publicly that we do this Monday and vote Tuesday, and \nI will work with the Democratic leader on the specifics of getting that \ndone early next week so that we will not go through this on the \nagriculture bill, on the transportation bill, on the Interior bill, on \nthe HUD, and the Veterans Administration bill, and bill after bill.\n  I think that would be timely. I would be willing to go forward with \nthe CJS without forcing the vote on overruling the Chair at this point \nbut with the understanding that we are going to find the time so we can \nget this done.\n\n  Can I get that commitment from the Democratic leader?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the leader can get that commitment in \nspirit.\n  Let met give the leader three qualifications, and I am sure the \nleader will accommodate me on all three qualifications.\n  First, if Senator Kennedy has to be away for family business or \npersonal family matters--the tragedy that he is facing--certainly the \nmajority leader would understand that, and I hope he would accommodate \nSenator Kennedy's needs as we schedule.\n  Second, he noted on more than one occasion, privately and publicly, \nthat he is willing to work with us to ensure that, even if the Chair is \noverturned, we will find a way--and there are no misgivings about \nfinding a way on either side, I hope--to pass an emergency agriculture \nappropriations measure. Clearly we will be denied that once this vote \noccurs. So I know--he told me privately and again alluded to it this \nmorning--that he will work with us to do that.\n  Third, it would seem to me we would have to have a period of time--no \nless, at least, than 5 or 6 hours, 3 hours equally divided--to discuss \nthis matter and then have the vote.\n  If he is willing to accommodate this Senator on those three matters, \nI would certainly, for the record right now, indicate my willingness to \nwork with him to set a time certain for the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I don't think we need 6 hours, 3 hours \nequally divided on each side, to discuss this.\n  What that guarantees is that we wipe out another day next week and we \nfurther delay doing the people's business on the appropriations bills.\n  But if that is what is insisted on, if this is an effort--again, that \nappears to me to be eating up time so we don't get our work done, but \nif that is what it takes, I am prepared to consider that.\n  Let me go back to a couple of things.\n  No. 1, every Senator in this body knows I am very meticulous about \ntrying to be sympathetic to Senators' needs when they have family \nproblems or deaths or religious holidays. Nobody can take that away \nfrom me. I would never do anything to take away any Senator's rights \nwhile he is attending to a very sad, personal family problem.\n  Having said that, I don't view this as having taken something away \nfrom Senator Kennedy or anybody else. I think this is giving something \nback to the Senate, and that is the ability to get our work done.\n  But if that is what is taking place here, if you believe you don't \nwant to do this while he is involved obviously in a very necessary \nfamily responsibility, I will honor that.\n  Also, I must say everybody in this Chamber knows I work very hard to \nkeep my word. It is used against me sometimes on both sides. I try to \nget Senators to vote on Mondays and Fridays. You wouldn't believe the \neffort that is put underway by Senators on both sides for that not to \nhappen.\n  If we don't get our work done, you are going to say, well, why didn't \nwe get our work done? While I am trying to get the work done, sometimes \nwith the Democratic leader's help, Senators try to find a way not to \nvote on Mondays and Fridays.\n  I don't know how in the world you get your work done if you do not do \nanything on Mondays and Fridays, and you have people show up and say: \nGosh, I want to vote in the middle of the day Wednesday. How do you get \nthis thing done?\n  In terms of keeping my word and how it has been used against me, for \ninstance, being able to offer amendments, I said, yes, we will go to \njuvenile justice. And I said we are doing it on a particular date with \nthe clear impression that we would get it done within that week in 4 \ndays. It took 2 weeks. After a lot of going back and forth, we worked \nout an agreement on Patients' Bill of Rights, but we kept our word. We \ngot it done. We had the debate, and it worked out fine, I thought.\n\n  But those 2 weeks took away 2 weeks that should have been spent on \nappropriations bills. But I kept my word. I really believe my word was \nused against me.\n  I have to try to force action on these things because we agreed we \nwere going to deal with rule XVI. We have to find time to do that.\n  We agreed we would work out something where we would have a Social \nSecurity lockbox. We haven't done it. We have to find a way to do that. \nThe American people want a Social Security lockbox. Everybody agreed \nthat we need it. Let's get it done. I don't think we need to do it with \n75 amendments in 45 hours. It is a little procedural fix that we can \nagree on with regard to Social Security being protected.\n  I filed cloture on those bills because every bill which we ought to \nbring up, somebody is threatening to filibuster it. Sometimes it is on \nour side. Sometimes it is on the other side.\n  Intelligence authorization: We wanted to try to get that up, and get \nthe Department of Energy issue considered. We had a heck of a time \ngetting it up to get it completed. Yet when we got through it, it \npassed 96-1.\n  Transportation appropriations bill: I want to get the transportation \nbill up. I am told in advance now that we are going to filibuster that.\n  What option do you have but to file cloture?\n  They don't want to bring it up because there is a provision in there \nthat a couple or half dozen Senators do not like, or four Senators.\n  Let's get it up. Let's debate it. Let's have a vote on it and then \nmove forward.\n  In fact, then, at that point, if Senators do not like the result, \nthey have the option to filibuster. But when I am told if you try to \nbring up the transportation appropriations bill we are going to \nfilibuster the motion to proceed, what option do you have?\n  There are explanations for these things.\n  I am interested in legislating. But I also have responsibilities as \nmajority\n\n[[Page S8988]]\n\nleader to legislate on issues the majority is interested in. I also \nhave a responsibility--I think both leaders have a responsibility, all \nleaders--to get our work done.\n  Included right up front on that list of getting our work done is \npassing the appropriations bills.\n  I am doing my job. Most of these appropriations bills I don't \nparticularly like, to tell you the truth. It doesn't necessarily make \nme feel real good to be worrying about all the appropriations bills, \nbut it is part of the job, part of the process.\n\n  There is not a single bill that comes through here where a single \nSenator likes everything in it, but we move the process along. I can \nthink of a whole bunch of things in State, Justice, and Commerce I \nwould like to knock out, and a lot of things I would like to add, but I \nwill not do that because the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator \nfrom South Carolina put their work in there, it was passed by the \ncommittee, probably unanimously, and we ought to move it forward.\n  I will be glad to work with the Senator to try to lock in a time next \nweek to get this issue debated. I am glad to debate it. I don't know \nhow many times we will hear: You Republicans caused this problem. I am \nsaying: All right, OK, we acknowledge it. Let's fix it.\n  I bet when the vote comes, it will be overwhelming. Both sides know \nthis needs to be corrected. Let's get on with it. I don't know what the \nfinal vote will be, but I will be surprised if it is not 80-20. It will \nprobably be more than that, 90-10. Why not do it? It is the right thing \nto do. It is good for the institution.\n  I thank Members for their patience while I responded. If we are \nready, we can go forward and set up a time to have this issue debated \nand voted on. Hopefully, it will be within a reasonable timeframe.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have to respond to a couple of points \nmade by my friend, the distinguished majority leader.\n  First, with regard to the Social Security lockbox, if ever our point \nwas made on a particular bill, it is this one. This is exactly why we \nare here. I am amused and completely appreciate what it is Senator Lott \nhas just said once more: Why do we need so many amendments? This is a \nsimple little idea--Social Security lockbox. Why do we need so many \namendments? This is just a simple idea.\n  Mr. President, a simple idea can have profound consequences. There \nmay be one or there may be more than one way to enact a simple idea.\n  Senator Lautenberg offered on the Senate floor an agreement that said \nwe will limit ourselves--and here we are again, the minority--we will \nlimit ourselves to 12 amendments. Our Republican colleagues objected. \nThat wasn't good enough. Twelve amendments was too many.\n  We find ourselves, time and time and time again, not filibustering a \nbill. I do not remember the last time the minority filibustered a bill \nbecause we didn't want it to pass. The only time I can recall we have \nfilibustered--and fortunately we have never lost--is on our procedural \nright to offer amendments. That is the only time, that I am aware of, \nwe have fought, because our rights need to be protected. I am compelled \nto set the record straight, and I am compelled again to respond. This \nis why we are in this box.\n  Ideally, what will happen is, a bill could get laid down, Democrats \nand Republicans could offer amendments; if it got out of line, Senator \nLott and I could say: People, we have to get this bill done. We have to \nget this bill done. Will you limit yourself? Let's develop a finite \nlist of amendments.\n  Often that works. I have some of the best lieutenants I could hope to \nhave, and when I sic them on the caucus, it is amazing how responsive \nthe caucus is. It works. I come back and report to the majority leader, \nwe can do this in 15 amendments, and we can do this tonight, and it \nworks. That is one model.\n  The other model is, we are presented with a confrontation. A bill is \nfiled, the tree is filled, a cloture vote is taken. That is the other \nmodel. That model doesn't work, and it will never work. I don't care \nwhether it is an appropriations bill or an authorization bill, we will \nnot allow that to work.\n  We can continue to play that out until we die of old age. It is not \ngoing to work, not as long as we are here. If we are going to get \ncooperation, then I am willing to look at that Social Security lockbox \nagain. Twelve amendments doesn't seem too many to me. Yes, there may be \nsome irrelevant amendments--not irrelevant, but nongermane amendments. \nThey are certainly relevant to us.\n  I think the Republicans demonstrated last week, with the Patients' \nBill of Rights, they can deal with it if we offer amendments. They can \ndeal with it. They are in the majority. They have the votes to defeat \nour proposals. I am not sure I know what they are afraid of.\n  In any case, I have spoken long enough. As the majority leader has \nnoted, the time has come to move on. I am willing to work with him to \nmake the most of the time remaining this week and certainly next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, briefly, I note that in the presence of the \nPresident I was led to believe that, on the Social Security issue, two \nor three amendments would be enough on the lockbox. Then I am told \nlater, well, we need 12 or 15. That is what I have to deal with all the \ntime.\n  We can go back and forth as to what happened. We need a Social \nSecurity lockbox. We need to find a way to do it. The Senate is the \nonly impediment to having that done.\n  What I propose to do with regard to rule XVI is ask consent --I am \nnot doing it now--that when the Senate convenes on Monday, the 26th, we \nproceed to the original resolution to be placed on the calendar by the \nmajority leader, immediately following the asserting of this agreement, \nand the resolution be considered under the following time constraints--\nthis is the resolution; obviously, it is very short and very simple--\nthat the resolution be limited to 3 hours for each leader or his \ndesignee, no amendments or resolutions be in order, and final adoption \nbe in order prior to recess or adjournment of the Senate on Monday. We \ncould have that vote at the same time we have the vote on the juvenile \njustice conferees cloture, if necessary.\n  I ask the Democratic leader to consider that. If the Senator can \ncheck to see when Senator Kennedy will be back--I talked to him myself \nearly this week, and I had the impression he would be back early next \nweek, but I didn't press him in terms of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, \nwhenever.\n  That is, I think, a fair way to do this. That is how it was outlined \nto me. I think we ought to do it. Hopefully, we can make some progress \nnow on the underlying commerce bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/22/senate-section/article/S8988-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8988-S9014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY AND RELATED \n              AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--Continued\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, while the two \nleaders are on the floor, the original point of order was made by me, \nso I believe I have a right to talk about this.\n  I am not going to talk about the substance of the amendment but talk \nabout our two leaders. Speaking for Democrats and Republicans, we are \nvery proud of our leadership. The majority leader and the minority \nleader, I think, do an outstanding job of representing their respective \ninterests. The legislative branch of government depends on these two \nmen leading their respective caucuses.\n  We should be doing less procedural battling and more substantive \nbattling. I hope the majority leader hears what the Democrats are \nsaying. We want to legislate. We are not trying to stop anything from \ngoing through. We want our rights to be protected. We want the ability \nto offer amendments. That is all we are saying.\n  This was proven in the very good debate we had. We were allowed to \nhave the debate as a result of the work done by our minority leader. I \nthink it is important we have more issues debated here. I hope during \nthis weekend the two leaders realize, as I know they do,\n\n[[Page S8989]]\n\nthe importance of having the Senate act as the Senate and that we start \ndebating substantive issues.\n  I think this colloquy between the two leaders was very substantive \nand informative. I hope it will lead to a much better and more \nproductive Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the chairman of \nthe subcommittee and the ranking member. This is a bit unusual. I am \nviolating what the Senator from South Carolina would recognize as the \nRussell Long rule.\n  When I first came to the Senate, Russell Long, the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana, was chairman of the Finance Committee. One day \nI walked up to him because I had an amendment to a finance bill. He \nsaid: I will accept it. I said: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Then \nI got back to my seat in the back row, and a staff person who had \nworked here longer than I had--I had only been here about 3 months--\nsaid: Senator, you really want a rollcall vote on that.\n  So I went ahead and I did my little spiel. Then I asked for the yeas \nand nays. The roll was called, and Russell Long voted against the \namendment and encouraged others to vote against it. It was defeated. I \nwalked up to him and said: Mr. Chairman, my Lord, you told me just 15 \nminutes ago you would accept my amendment. He said: Yes, I would accept \nyour amendment. But I did not say anything about a rollcall vote.\n  We are not going to have, I hope, a rollcall vote on this amendment. \nI want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee for accepting the \namendment. I apologize to him for speaking on something that is going \nto be accepted. But I think this is of such consequence that it is \nimportant to remind our colleagues of what we are about to redo.\n  A few weeks ago, the Appropriations Committee zeroed out all funding \nfor the COPS Program, nearly closing the doors of what I believe to be \nthe most successful Federal-State cooperative law enforcement program \nof our time.\n  This amendment corrects the committee's elimination of the funding \nfor the COPS office in the fiscal year 2000. It restores funding for \nthe COPS office to perform many of the significant functions in support \nof law enforcement--particularly in getting more cops out on the \nstreet.\n  In doing so, it supersedes--or, basically, makes void--the language \nin the committee report on pages 62 and 63 that would have directed the \nJustice Department to take steps to dismantle the COPS office. Under \nthis amendment, the COPS office will remain alive and well for fiscal \nyear 2000.\n  I am pleased today we have put aside partisan politics in support of \nthis effective law enforcement program. Let me make it clear, although \nsome of my colleagues on the Republican side worry a little bit about \nthis being a Democratic program, it is not a Democratic program. It is \na bipartisan program. It is a program where even this amendment has \ngarnered the cosponsorship of four Republicans and the commitment of \nanother several to vote for it. I predict there will be more \nRepublicans to vote for it as well.\n  I am glad that we have listened to the police officers on the street, \nthe police chiefs, the prosecutors, the mayors, the citizens of our \ncommunities, and our constituents about why they think the COPS Program \nhas worked so well.\n  As I said, today, joined by 42 of my colleagues, including four \nRepublicans, I offer this amendment to restore the COPS Program for \nfiscal year 2000. This amendment restores $495 million in funding for \nthe COPS Program for the year 2000.\n  This is just one-third of the $1.43 billion that was appropriated in \n1999. But it preserves this vitally important program that has thus far \nfunded over 100,000 cops in communities across the country.\n  Here is how it will work: $170 million will come from unobligated \nbalances for this fiscal year for the COPS office; $5 million in \nunobligated funds from the Bureau of Prisons; $140 million are shifted \nback to the COPS office for programs that it already has successfully \nadministered in the past.\n  These include the Cops Connect Program, which provides equipment and \nupgrades so that officers from different jurisdictions can talk to each \nother and share vital information; it also includes targeted funding \nfor equipment that protects police officers, such as bulletproof vests; \nand for training to identify and take down methamphetamine and other \ndrug laboratories.\n  And $180 million are put back into the COPS Program to fund the \nhiring of up to an additional 2,400 officers in our public school \nsystem.\n  Most importantly, this amendment restores to the COPS office its \nprimary function: putting more cops on the street. Under this \namendment, there\n\n[[Page S8990]]\n\nwill be funding sufficient to put 1,500 additional local law \nenforcement officers out on the streets in our communities.\n  I think we can all agree that this is a small price to pay for lower \ncrime rates, safer communities, safer schools, more advanced law \nenforcement equipment, and more responsive police departments.\n  I am thrilled to be joined by so many of my colleagues. As I said, \nthere are 42 cosponsors. I ask unanimous consent that a list of the \ncosponsors be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               Sponsoring\n\n       Joe Biden (DE) (sponsor).\n\n\n                               Cosponsors\n\n       (1) Daniel Akaka (HI).\n       (2) Jeff Bingaman (NM).\n       (3) Tom Daschle (SD).\n       (4) Dick Durbin (IL).\n       (5) Bob Graham (FL).\n       (6) Tom Harkin (IA).\n       (7) Ernest Hollings (SC).\n       (8) Tim Johnson (SD).\n       (9) Edward Kennedy (MA).\n       (10) Robert Kerrey (NE).\n       (11) Herb Khol (WI).\n       (12) Frank Lautenberg (NJ).\n       (13) Patrick Leahy (VT).\n       (14) Carl Levin (MI).\n       (15) Blanche Lincoln (AR).\n       (16) Patty Murray (WA).\n       (17) Jack Reed (RI).\n       (18) Harry Reid (NV).\n       (19) Charles Robb (VA).\n       (20) Charles Schumer (NY).\n       (21) Paul Wellstone (MN).\n       (22) John Breaux (LA).\n       (23) Patrick Moynihan (NY).\n       (24) Evan Bayh (IN).\n       (25) Byron Dorgan (ND).\n       (26) Richard Bryan (NV).\n       (27) John Kerry (MA).\n       (28) Max Cleland (GA).\n       (29) Paul Sarbanes (MD).\n       (30) John Rockefeller (WV).\n       (31) Christopher Dodd (CT).\n       (32) Barbara Boxer (CA).\n       (33) Mary Landrieu (LA).\n       (34) Barbara Mikulski (MD).\n       (35) Joseph Lieberman (CT).\n       (36) Russell Feingold (WI).\n       (37) Robert Byrd (WV).\n       (38) Arlen Specter (PA).\n       (39) Susan Collins (ME).\n       (40) Olympia Snowe (ME).\n       (41) Robert Torricelli (NJ).\n       (42) James Jeffords (VT).\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. It is a challenge for us to apply the lessons we have \nlearned over the past years. More cops on the street means crime goes \ndown. Law enforcement knows this. The American public knows this. We \nknow this. And we must act now.\n  We all recognize the importance to communities across our country of \nensuring the continued success of lowering crime rates.\n  Look at this chart. Since the COPS Program began as part of the 1994 \ncrime bill, arrests have gone way up.\n  This is total arrests. Look at all the support we have on this. All \nthe law enforcement organizations endorse this program. The mayors \nendorse this program. I thank, by the way, these organizations for \ntheir continued support of the COPS Program and for their extraordinary \nhelp with this amendment in particular.\n  To the law enforcement community, I say thank you. We should all say \nthank you. We could not have done this without your hard work and \nsupport, your phone calls, your letters. Your personal appearances have \nresonated with all of us. You are always on the frontline on this, and \nyou have always taken a stand against crime. You should be proud.\n  I am proud of them. In a recent survey done for the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations, 85 percent of those surveyed think \nwe should extend the COPS Program. The American people don't want the \nprogram to end. Although we do not extend the COPS Program beyond its \nauthorized period through this fiscal year, my friend from New \nHampshire and my friend from South Carolina know that I have \ncontinually attempted to extend the program. I will be back in another \nfora trying to extend the COPS Program so that we continue this beyond \nthe year 2000.\n  For years, when I first wrote this crime bill, back in the early \n1980s, we would debate this, and we would debate it and debate it. The \neditorial writers in this country, primarily from the most established \nnewspapers, were very critical of my notion that we should vastly \nincrease the number of cops. They would write editorials. One--I think \nit was one of the major papers, the New York Times, Washington Post, LA \nTimes, but I don't recall which--said: Been there, done that.\n  Well, the truth is, we were never there. The truth is, for the \nprevious 20 years, before the Biden crime bill, we did not add \nappreciably to the number of cops in America. If my memory serves me, \nin the 20 largest cities in America over the previous 20 years, \nalthough crime had grown significantly, we only added about 1 percent \nmore cops than existed 20 years earlier. We had never done this before.\n  After all the hearings I held as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nbeing exposed over all those years to the leading criminologists in the \ncountry, the psychologists, psychiatrists, law enforcement officers, \nsocial workers, all the experts, I came away convinced of only a few \nthings.\n  One is, if there is a cop on one corner of the street and no cop on \nthe other corner and a crime is going to be committed on a corner, it \nis going to be committed where the cop is not. Sounds pretty basic. It \nis basic. This single most important reason why, beyond the sheer \nnumbers, this COPS Program has worked, in my view, is because in order \nto get Federal money to hire local cops under this program, local law \nenforcement departments had to decide, as my friend from Virginia \nknows, to set up community policing. When he was Governor, he talked \nabout this. When he was Governor, a lot of the Governors and mayors \nknew about this.\n  It was hard to do. Cops didn't want to get out of their cars and walk \non the beat, figuratively and literally. There was resistance. So we \nsaid: Look, if you want another cop paid for in part by the Federal \nGovernment, your whole department has to be a community policing \ndepartment. You have to go back and interface with the community. You \nhave to know who owns the corner store. You have to know who lives in \nthe house in the middle of the block. You have to know where the drug \ntrafficking takes place. You have to know where the gymnasium is where \nthe kids hang out. You have to know where the swimming pool is. You \nhave to know the people.\n\n  And so one of the reasons, I argue, for the extraordinary success of \nthe program is not merely the added numbers of cops but because of the \nway in which they are required to utilize their existing police forces \nin order to get any new cops.\n  Now, granted, in one sense this is a small victory in that it only \ncontinues the program through the time it was intended to continue it.\n  I hope we can reach some bipartisan consensus before we get to fiscal \nyear 2001 to extend, as my friend from New Hampshire has proposed in an \namendment we will vote on later today, the violent crime trust fund \nthat pays for these cops, the Federal share. I hope we can get some \nbipartisan support on extending the program that continues to put more \nlocal law enforcement on the ground with the help of Federal dollars.\n  I will reserve the remainder of my time in a moment, but I want to \nmake it clear that I truly appreciate the willingness of the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire to reinstate, at least in part, the funding for this \nprogram which would allow the office to continue through the year 2000. \nI see my friend has risen, and I am happy to yield to him at this time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Delaware. I appreciate his fine \ncomments. We are going to accept his amendment at the point when all \nthe folks who want to speak on it have had an opportunity.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 10 minutes to my friend from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ben Lawsky, \na detailee from the Judiciary Committee, be granted full floor \nprivileges during the remainder of consideration of S. 1217.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues, the \nSenator from Delaware and the Senator\n\n[[Page S8991]]\n\nfrom Virginia, in offering this amendment to preserve the COPS Program \nfor fiscal year 2000.\n  Three days ago, we received the latest news on crime in America, and \nthe news is good. According to the latest National Crime Victimization \nSurvey, nonfatal, violent crime fell 7 percent from 1997. Other figures \nrecently released by the FBI indicate that murders dropped about 8 \npercent between 1997 and 1998. Overall, the Nation's crime rate has \nfallen more than 21 percent since 1993 and now is at its lowest level \nsince 1973.\n  My home State of New York has been a shining example of crime \nreduction. Crime is down from one end of New York State to the other. \nIn Buffalo, it has fallen by more than 30 percent; in Albany, it is \ndown 24 percent; in Nassau County, it is down 24 percent; in New York \nCity, overall crime declined 44 percent and murder dropped more than 60 \npercent.\n  Why the continued good news on crime? Well, I would be happy to \nconcede to those on the left that a strong economy has something to do \nwith it. I would be happy to concede to those on the right that tougher \npunishment for violent offenders and aggressive crime fighting by both \nRepublican and Democratic mayors have played a significant role. But \njust as clearly, enhanced community policing and the COPS Program \ndeserve their share of the credit.\n  I say to anyone in America, ask your local police about the drop in \ncrime in the neighborhoods they patrol. Ask the local neighborhood and \ncivic associations. They will tell you, inevitably, about new \npartnerships between police and neighborhood residents. They will tell \nyou about successful efforts to deter vandalism, loitering, and \ndisorderly conduct--the seeds of more serious neighborhood \ndeterioration.\n  As pleased as we all should be about the crime fighting successes of \nthe past years, now is no time to stand pat. Old and new law \nenforcement challenges require us to maintain our vigilance and our \nefforts. Indeed, the war on crime is sadly a war that never ends. The \nsurest way to prevent a return to the bad old days of untamed streets \nand unsafe schools is to do what works: Yes, lock up violent offenders; \nyes, invest in prevention programs; and yes, hire and retain community \npolicing officers.\n  When I authored the COPS Program in the House of Representatives and \nworked with the Senator from Delaware--we worked in tandem then because \nI was a House Member and he a Senator--I knew that not only the \nincreased number of police, but the change in the type of policing, to \ncommunity policing, was going to work. And work it did.\n  There is almost unanimous agreement from law enforcement, from people \non both sides of the criminal justice argument, on the left and on the \nright, that the COPS Program has been a shining success. So when I read \nthe words in the committee report, ``The Committee directs that from \nwithin available funds the COPS office close by the end of the fiscal \nyear 2000,'' I was distressed, perturbed, and I was shocked because \nthis is a Government program that works. This is not an ideological \nprogram, and it has such broad support.\n  The police agencies, the mayors, and town councils that have put COPS \nfunds to such good use over the past 6 years felt the same way. I have \nreceived many letters from New York police chiefs and mayors over the \npast few weeks about this appropriations bill, and every one contains a \nsimilar refrain: Please keep the COPS Program in business.\n  As the Senator from Delaware knows, we made special efforts when we \nwrote the law to make sure small towns, villages, and counties were \nincluded. There was a special set-aside so that not all the money would \ngo to the big cities. I was then a city representative--and, of course, \nI represent the whole State--representing the people who were most \nfervently for the program, the small town mayors and local county \npeople, who could not have afforded these police but for the COPS \nProgram.\n  It also has let us accomplish so much. In addition to hiring \nofficers, it purchased new technology and implemented innovative \nprograms to stop domestic violence, all because we created in this \nprogram the flexibility that if you could take cops off the desks and \nput them on the streets, patrolling the streets, it would work.\n  Well, 10,505 newly funded officers later, even the most skeptical New \nYorkers--and we have many skeptics in our State--are converts to the \ncause of the COPS Program.\n  I am proud of this amendment which would keep the COPS Program in \nbusiness for this fiscal year, negating the report language to the \ncontrary. That is certainly an improvement over the committee's bill, \nwhich didn't provide any funding of the program. At the same time, I \nbelieve the COPS Program deserves even greater funding for fiscal year \n2000 than provided in this amendment because fighting crime is a key to \nbuilding strong communities. In my State, many of the communities have \nrebounded, including New York City, because it is much safer.\n  So I believe it should be a top priority for this Congress to \nreauthorize the COPS Program. Senator Biden and I already tried to do \nit as an amendment to the juvenile justice bill. We will soon \nintroduce, along with the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Robb, a \nfreestanding bill to reauthorize the program, and we will not rest \nuntil we get the job done.\n  But this is an important step forward. I congratulate my friends from \nDelaware and Virginia for their hard work on the issue. I also thank my \nfriend, the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Hollings, for his \ninvaluable assistance with this amendment. Again, we will not rest \nuntil we get the job done.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to my friend from \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, first let me thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Delaware, as well as my friend and colleague from New York, for \ntheir support.\n  As a cosponsor of the Biden amendment, I would like to express my \nstrong support for the effort to preserve and restore funding for the \nCOPS Program.\n  I believe many of our colleagues share my view that protecting our \nNation's citizens from all enemies, foreign and domestic, is a critical \nobligation of the Federal Government. We are committed to try to make \nall of our communities safer from the threat of crime. Today, by \nsupporting this amendment and the COPS Program, all of us can make good \non this commitment.\n  The Biden amendment will prevent the COPS Program from expiring as \nthe underlying bill provides. Over the next year, the $495 million in \nfunding provided by the amendment will put 1,500 new officers on the \nbeat, hire 2,400 school resource officers to reduce violence in \nschools, keep hundreds more officers out in their communities rather \nthan behind their desks, purchase bulletproof vests, and provide better \ncommunications equipment and technology. In short, this amendment will \nmake a difference to the safety of our communities.\n  I am particularly gratified to see the resources devoted to school \nsafety. Even before the tragic killings in schools across the Nation, I \nworked to amend the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill in 1997 \nto permit the use of COPS funding for school safety grants. The \nfollowing year, with the help of Senators Gregg and Hollings, we \nexpanded that program. As a result, this year more than $167 million in \nschool safety grants, including funding to hire school resource \nofficers, is going to communities across the Nation.\n  More generally, the Community-Oriented Policing Services program, or \nCOPS, is one of our best strategies for fighting the war on crime. The \nrationale is straightforward, and the results are impressive. In the \nsimplest terms, COPS funding means more police on the beat, which means \nless crime.\n  The dynamics of COPS in community policing are, of course, more \ncomplex. The goal is not simply more bodies but better neighborhoods. \nBy giving law enforcement the resources to actively engage their \ncommunities, we develop trust and better communications; we allow \nofficers to be proactive and prevent crime before it occurs.\n  The bottom line is that the COPS program works. This Nation has the\n\n[[Page S8992]]\n\nlowest crime rate in 25 years. The murder rate is at the lowest point \nin 30 years.\n  In my home State of Virginia, we provided funding to put nearly 2,000 \nadditional officers on the streets. As we have added those officers, we \nhave seen a drop in crime. Between 1992 and 1997, murders declined by \n17 percent in Virginia Beach, by 30 percent in Norfolk, and by 48 \npercent in Newport News.\n  With these statistics, it is not surprising how many are urging the \nSenate to step up to the plate again. My colleagues have already \nmentioned the many organizations asking us to continue COPS funding, \nincluding the Fraternal Order of Police and the United Conference of \nMayors.\n  In a letter to Majority Leader Lott, Sheriff Dan Smith, president of \nthe National Sheriffs Association, stated:\n\n       It is imperative to effective crime control that the COPS \n     program survive. It is a program that is vital to effective \n     law enforcement, and to sheriffs in both rural and urban \n     jurisdictions.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Biden amendment. We should not be \nsatisfied with the lowest crime rate in 25 years. We should work for \nthe lowest crime rate ever. This important amendment will help us to \nachieve that goal.\n  I again thank my distinguished colleague from Delaware for his \ncontinued leadership in this important area. I am delighted to work \nwith him and with others, and I look forward to the continuation of \nthis vital program.\n  I yield any time I may have remaining to the principal sponsor of the \namendment, the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the \nSenator from Delaware, for yielding me this time.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important amendment to restore \nfunding for the successful COPS Program. We know it works and it should \nbe continued. Later on, I will also be offering an amendment to restore \nfunding for the Edward Byrne Memorial Grant Program--another vital \nresource for local law enforcement.\n  I voted against this bill in committee for one main reason: it drains \nthe critical funding needed by our local and state law enforcement to \nhelp them do their jobs--to fight the drug problems in our communities \nand to keep our streets safe. The bill before us cuts the Byrne grants \nby more than 18 percent. The local law enforcement block grant is cut \nby 24 percent. Neither of these cuts makes sense.\n  Our communities need them to beef up their drug and violent crime \ntask forces. These grants go straight to the state and local agencies. \nWhy would they be cut? Violent crime has gone down, but does that mean \nwe should give up the fight? Drugs and crime are a continuous battle \nand now is not the time to let up.\n  I've received dozens of letters from Iowa police chiefs and sheriffs \ndescribing the kind of setbacks that they would suffer if these cuts go \nthrough.\n  This amendment which restores just about a third of the fiscal year \n1999 level funding for Community Oriented Policing Services Program, \nwould be a good first step to giving our local communities the support \nthey need to do their jobs. Police chiefs and sheriffs from across the \ncountry have told us loud and clear--the COPS Program is one of the \n1994 Crime Act's most effective programs.\n  Consider this: Serious crime is retreating all across the United \nStates. Since the COPS Program began, violent crime across the nation \nhas dropped 21 percent--in part because local law enforcement used \nthese federal grants to hire more officers to keep our streets safe, \nand to upgrade their operations with new technology. In Iowa, the \nmurder rate has plummeted 34 percent from last year. Now is not the \ntime to cut back on our efforts to fight illegal drugs and violent \ncrime.\n  Rural America will pay the heaviest price if this amendment is not \nadopted. The COPS Program made a special commitment to include small \ntowns and rural areas. Half of all COPS funding goes to agencies \nserving jurisdictions of under 150,000 in population. And its making a \ndifference. I hear it all the time from sheriffs and police chiefs \nthroughout Iowa.\n  I got a letter just the other day from Police Chief Douglas Book of \nForest City, Iowa--a town of 4,500 people. He said zero-funding COPS \nwould be detrimental to his operation. He wrote:\n\n       * * * COPS, by the addition of one officer, has allowed us \n     to provide a school resource officer for 20 hours per week. \n     Something that was non-existent before COPS. Through the \n     addition of the COPS funded officer we were able to be \n     proactive in various areas of our community. One very \n     successful operation resulted in a 75 percent drop in \n     juvenile assaults * * * This funding literally deals with the \n     quality of life in America. Results, not politics, must be \n     the guiding factor * * * COPS works. Fund it. [Douglas Book, \n     Forest Hill Police Chief, 6/23/99]\n\n  Here's another letter I received from Coralville, Iowa Police Chief \nBarry Bedford:\n\n       Without the COPS Program, we would not have been able to \n     keep up with the tremendous increase in the calls for service \n     and crime-related activities, nor would we be able to obtain \n     the vitally needed mobile data computers. This is a program \n     that needs to continue if we are going to keep our \n     communities safe.\n\n  The chiefs are right. Community policing works. It's a flexible \nprogram that is responsive to law enforcement needs. More cops on the \nbeat have an undeniable effect on crime and a community's sense of \nsecurity.\n  Funds to hire more than 100,000 officers have been awarded since 1994 \nby the COPS to more than 11,300 state and local law enforcement \nagencies across the nation. That's more than half the policing agencies \nin the country. As a result, these officers are joining agencies that \nserve more than 87 percent of the American public.\n  Iowa alone has received over $37 million to hire 544 officers. COPS \nfunds have also been used to put computers in police cars in Dubuque, \nhelp officers in Grundy Center deal with vandalism and help Waterloo \npolice fight drugs. COPS grants have helped community and county police \ndepartments hire civilians to do paperwork so more officers can be out \non the streets. In short, COPS has made our streets and communities \nsafer.\n  It makes no sense to block such a successful program that directly \nbenefits our communities and makes them safer for our families. While \ncrime is down--this is not the time to claim victory and retreat. So I \nurge my colleagues to support our amendment that restores this crucial \nlaw enforcement funding and I also urge that any language in this bill \nthat mentions closing down the COPS office this year be deleted.\n  I compliment my colleague from Delaware for being a great leader on \nthis program. This amendment should be supported and adopted if we \ntruly want to support our police officers and our sheriffs' departments \nthroughout this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Iowa, and I \ncompliment him for his continued support and early support for this \nprogram.\n  I now yield 5 minutes to my friend from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware. I am \ndelighted to join with him as an original cosponsor of the amendment. I \nam pleased to work with him with respect to this question of the \nfunding of the COPS Program nationally.\n  As the Senator from Delaware knows well, back in 1994 I brought the \noriginal amendment to the floor for the 100,000 police officers at a \ntime when people said we weren't going to be able to find the money.\n  We managed to reach an agreement through the ingenuity of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, and an agreement \nwith Senator Gramm back then to split some money with respect to \nprisons, which ultimately became the foundation of a rather remarkable \nincrease in funding for police officers on a national basis.\n  The Senator from Delaware, then chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nhad spent many long years working and fighting to recognize the need to \nhave police officers in the streets of America. My own experience as a \nformer prosecutor brought me to the\n\n[[Page S8993]]\n\nSenate with a long-term understanding of and commitment to the notion \nthat crimes usually aren't committed right in front of a police \nofficer. On too many streets in America, and too many corners of our \ncommunities, we were literally, only a few years ago, abandoning those \nstreets to criminals. The ratio of police officer to a felony was \ndiminishing. Felonies were going up; the police officers were going \ndown. And there was a direct correlation to the disorder, even the \nchaos in some places, that we were inheriting as a result of the lack \nof capacity for enforcement.\n  Having run one of the largest district attorney offices in America, \none of the 10 largest counties in the country, Middlesex County in \nMassachusetts, I learned firsthand it is not just a police officer on a \nstreet at a particular moment of time who is going to intercept a crime \nor break up a fight or provide order; those police officers who make \narrests have to go to court. They have to be able to testify in cases. \nThey have to have time to investigate cases. It takes an enormous \namount of street work, of nonvisible work, to be able to adequately \nstaff and supply the police force of the country, the investigative \ncapacity of the country, in order to bring cases.\n  We too often were losing cases because we couldn't bring the officer \nto court. The officer needed to be out on the streets because of the \nshifts. Judges would dismiss cases because prosecutors were failing to \nput them together in time to meet the swift and speedy prosecution \nstandards.\n  Finally, we got people to understand that it makes a difference to \nhave a police officer walking a beat. That is another problem that \noccurred in America for a long period of time. We put police officers \nin a car; they drove around; criminals could pretty well predict when \nthe car was going to come through. The car created a barrier between \nthe officer and the street, so to speak. People didn't build \nrelationships. They didn't build relationships with good citizens in \nthe community, and they also didn't build relationships with bad \ncitizens from whom they often learned who may have done one thing or \nanother against the law.\n  Through awareness of that in 1994, we began an effort to put police \nofficers back on the streets of America, to build those relationships, \nand to provide our departments with the indispensable foundation on \nwhich the life and economic development of a community exists. That is \ncalled the opposite of chaos. It is peace. That is why they are called \npeace officers.\n  The fact is, we have been on a wonderful trend line, an extraordinary \ntrend line, where crime has been going down. Most violent crime has \nbeen going down, although not all; there are a couple areas that have \ngone up in the last year. The fact is, the kind of threat the average \ncitizen felt in their community has diminished. In community after \ncommunity after community, all across this country, police chiefs, \npolice officers, mayors, everybody involved in the effort to provide \norder, will share stories of the remarkable ways in which the community \npolicing program has made a difference in the lives of our fellow \ncitizens.\n  It is extraordinary to me that plans were laid in the original \nRepublican budget to eliminate funding for this, one of the most \nsuccessful programs that we have had.\n  If you look at the city of Boston in the 1990s, we had a gang \nepidemic. There was a surge in youth violence. The Boston Police \nDepartment responded by developing a very innovative youth violence \ntask force, an aggressive intervention strategy, and a program to \ncontrol trafficking of firearms. However, much depended on the $750,000 \nCOPS anti-gang initiative grant. That has become a model program in the \ncountry. Countless police chiefs and others have used that program as a \nway of instituting a similar effort in their own cities.\n  Every year since 1993, the number of juveniles killed by guns has \ndecreased, a 60-percent decrease from 1990 to 1998. From July 1995 to \nDecember 1997 not one youth was killed with a firearm.\n  The rate of violent crime involving a firearm has decreased 43 \npercent since 1995. Property crime has dropped to its lowest levels \nsince the 1960s and has been cut in half since 1990. House break-ins \nand car thefts have also hit a 35-year low.\n  The federal assistance through the COPS program has given local \ncommunities like Boston the tools to fight crime effectively. This \nmakes our streets and schools safer, our homes more secure and improves \nthe quality of life for everyone. In 1997, a Boston Public Safety \nSurvey found that more than three-quarters of the residents feel \nsomewhat to very safe alone in their neighborhoods at night, an \nincrease of close to 20 percent just since 1995. Feeling save to walk \nthe streets is a right, not a privilege for those who can afford it. \nEvery community deserves the type of security that Boston residents \ncurrently enjoy. The COPS program has played an important role in \nfostering that security.\n  Listen to what Paul Evans, Commissioner of the Boston Police \nDepartment, has had to say. In a letter to me, which I will now read, \nPaul reminds us that\n\n       Over the past five years, the COPS office has been a strong \n     and effective partner in our efforts in Boston, and in cities \n     across the country. COPS funds have supported the hiring of \n     109 new officers like Jamie Kenneally, who has quickly become \n     a community fixture, walking his beat and serving as a one-\n     man-anti-crime unit on Centre Street in Jamaica Plain.\n\n  Mr. President, other COPS initiatives have supported Boston's \ninternationally recognized youth violence strategy, which yielded a 75-\npercent decrease in youth homicides. Also, COPS supported the citywide \nStrategic Planning and Community Mobilization Project that brought \ntogether more than 400 police and community stakeholders to create \npartnerships for public safety that have been replicated in communities \nacross the country.\n  The effects of the COPS programs in Boston have been replicated \nacross Massachusetts and across the nation. Here is a letter from \nEdward Davis, Superintendent of Police in Lowell, Massachusetts. In the \nletter, Superintendent Davis says the Lowell Police Department has seen \na dramatic decrease in crime and the fear of crime over the past six \nyears. Violent crimes have decreased more than 60 percent as a result \nof the hard work of police officers, citizens, and the support of the \nFederal Government.\n  Paula Meara, Chief of Police of Springfield, Massachusetts believes \nthat COPS funding has unquestionably improved the quality of life for \nSpringfield residents. In 1997 and 1998, Homicides in Springfield have \ndeclined by 40 percent and serious crime has dropped by 12 percent. \nChief Meara believes that any reduction in funding for the COPS program \nwill have catastrophic results and will be detrimental to the quality \nof life for every resident in Springfield.\n  The COPS program has been a demonstrated success in Massachusetts and \nacross the nation. It deserves continued federal support. Adopting the \nBiden amendment is a good first step toward continuing federal \nassistance for local communities. However, there is much more that we \nneed to do. First, we must find additional funds for the COPS program \nin conference to insure that communities that are currently plagued \nwith crime and violence can fight back with a cop on the beat. Second, \nwe must continue to work with local police departments to develop \ninnovative community-based approaches to fighting crime. This approach \nwill help allow evey community free itself of the crime and violence \nthat lowers the quality of life and limits economic development. Mr. \nPresident, it is time we end the debate of whether to fund the COPS \nprogram, and move onto the far more important question of how to \nenlarge and expand this successsful program for the challenges before \nus today.\n  I ask unanimous consent a series of letters from police chiefs with \nrespect to that program be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Boston Police Department,\n\n                                        Boston, MA, July 14, 1999.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: I am writing to express my urgent \n     opposition to efforts in the Senate to eliminate funding for \n     the COPS Office. Like you, I strongly support Senator Biden's \n     amendment to restore that funding.\n       Over the past five years, the COPS Office has been a strong \n     and effective partner in\n\n[[Page S8994]]\n\n     our efforts in Boston, and in cities across the country. COPS \n     funds have supported the hiring of 109 new officers whom we \n     could not otherwise have put to work in Boston's \n     neighorhoods, officers like Jamie Kenneally, who has quickly \n     become a community fixture, walking his beat and serving as a \n     one-man anti-crime unit on Centre Street in Jamaica Plain.\n       Other COPS initiatives have supported Boston's \n     internationally-recognized youth violence strategy, which \n     yielded a 75 percent decrease in youth homicides. Also, COPS \n     supported the New England Regional Community Policing \n     Institute, which is a training consortium led by the Boston \n     Police Department and that delivers state-of-the-art \n     community policing training across the region. As one of its \n     first initiatives in Boston, COPS supported our citywide \n     Strategic Planning and Community Mobilization Project, that \n     brought together over 400 police and community stakeholders \n     to create the partnerships for public safety that have been \n     replicated in communities across the country. COPS supports \n     our initiatives in reducing domestic violence and other key \n     areas of our mission.\n       The COPS Office is a major success story from the 1994 \n     Crime Act, which you were so pivotal in enacting. I add my \n     voice to what I know is a chorus of police executives who \n     want this important work to continue.\n       Please let me know if there are other ways I can support \n     Senator Biden and you in your fight to save COPS.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Paul F. Evans,\n     Police Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Lowell Police Department,\n\n                                        Lowell, MD, July 15, 1999.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Boston, MA.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: The Lowell Police Department (LPD) has \n     seen a dramatic decrease in crime and the fear of crime over \n     the past six years. Part I Crimes have decreased by over 60% \n     as a result of the hard work of police officers, citizens, \n     and the support of government officials. This support is most \n     evident by the resources provided by the U.S. Department of \n     Justice Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office.\n       Since 1993, the COPS Office has provided well over 4 \n     million dollars to the LPD for the hiring of sworn and \n     civilian personnel, as well as the implementation of \n     innovative problem-solving initiatives. Through the Universal \n     Hiring Program, Lowell has been able to hire 37 additional \n     police officers, and COPS More allowed for the redeployment \n     of over 30 officers into the community. The Advancing \n     Community Policing Initiative allowed for the development and \n     implementation of innovative training and management \n     initiatives. The Problem-Solving Partnerships grants support \n     youth and neighborhood challenges. Furthermore, the Community \n     Policing to Combat Domestic Violence grant supported efforts \n     targeted and addressing domestic violence citywide.\n       Equally important is the impact that COPS Office resources \n     have had on law enforcement across the country. The COPS \n     Office has been instrumental in enhancing the profession of \n     policing, and challenging law enforcement to think and act in \n     a more strategic manner. Embedded in all of the COPS grant \n     programs, is an underlying theme of building and \n     strengthening community partnerships with public and private \n     organizations.\n       It is without reservation that I support the continuing \n     efforts of the U.S. Department of Justice COPS Office and \n     their state and local law enforcement partners. I would be \n     happy to provide further information from my agency as well \n     as from the citizens of Lowell, Massachusetts if necessary.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                             Edward F. Davis, III,\n     Superintendent of Police.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  The City of Springfield, MA,\n\n                                                    July 15, 1999.\n     Senator John Kerry,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: The Springfield Police Department is a \n     community oriented, full service, municipal Police \n     Department. Community Policing was initiated in a pilot area \n     of Springfield in 1993 and was expanded citywide thanks to \n     the assistance provided through funding by the Department of \n     Justice COPS Universal Hiring Grant Initiative. One hundred \n     twenty-eight (128) officers have been hired thanks to the \n     assistance of the Department of Justice and Federal Funding. \n     Nationwide studies proved that traditional law enforcement \n     strategies were insufficient and outdated when applied to \n     today's complex law enforcement issues. After initiating \n     community policing in 1993, the police department recognized \n     immediate positive results. It became clear that when \n     community police officers spent more time and focused more \n     attention on the issues, calls for return service diminished \n     substantially.\n       Community Policing was implemented ``city-wide'' in 1995 \n     after a successful trial period, which included several pilot \n     areas. The city was receiving high praise from residents for \n     Community Policing efforts but expansion was hampered due to \n     manpower constraints. The city was still recovering from \n     economic depression and officer lay-offs in 1988. Community \n     Policing in Springfield is both a philosophy and an \n     organizational strategy that promoted new partnerships \n     between people and their police. It is based on the premise \n     that both the police and the community must work together to \n     identify, prioritize and solve contemporary problems such as \n     drugs, fear of crime, social/physical disorder and overall \n     decay with the goal of improving the quality of life in our \n     city. Without sufficient officer staffing Springfield was \n     struggling to answer the constant need for immediate officer \n     response to critical incidents while at the same time \n     allowing officers the time necessary to commit to working \n     with the community. Federal COPS funding provided the funds \n     vital to hiring the essential additional officers to move \n     forward and expand Community Policing in Springfield.\n       The City is organized into nine Community Policing Sectors. \n     Management and services have been decentralized by \n     transferring Captains out of headquarters into the sectors, \n     assisted by Lieutenants, Sergeants and Officers--all assigned \n     on a long term basis. Investigations have been organized to \n     maximize sector responsibility with investigators from all of \n     the Department's Bureaus assigned by Community Policing \n     Sector. Neighborhood based beat management teams and regular \n     community meetings comprise an essential component of this \n     department's policing initiatives. The Springfield Police \n     Department has worked continually toward enhancing its \n     services to the residents of our city through collaborations \n     with other services providers with the goal of meeting and \n     exceeding citizen expectations. The Department of Social \n     Services, Department of Youth Services, School Department, \n     Springfield Health and Human Services, Department of Code \n     Enforcement, District Attorney's Office, Hampden County \n     Sheriff's Department (Corrections), Juvenile and Adult \n     Probation Divisions, and Parole Department all work with our \n     Community Policing Officers and have representatives assigned \n     to Community Policing Sectors. Springfield is particularly \n     proud of its Youth Assessment Center--named after Captain \n     Joseph A. Budd, who commanded the Youth Aid Bureau and \n     championed youth causes for many years. The Center became \n     operational in 1997 and is among the first of its type in the \n     nation. Funding supplied through the COPS Universal Award \n     made this center possible. Any reduction in funding this \n     center, which has become a national model, would jeopardize \n     the health and welfare of our city's youth. It represents a \n     collaboration of police and other major agencies, working \n     together to better serve our city's children. Its primary \n     focuses are: Early Intervention, Youth Diversion, and \n     Prevention. Among the agencies that work with Youth Aid \n     personnel at the Center on a daily basis are: Springfield \n     School Department, District Attorney's Office, Department of \n     Youth Services, Department of Social Services, Department of \n     Youth Services, and the Center for Human Development (Project \n     Rebound). Children in need of services, or youths that \n     surface with law Enforcement Programs are brought to the \n     center and not to the police station. At the center, trained \n     investigators gather data relative to health, school and home \n     issues--relating to drugs, sexual abuse, and domestic \n     violence. If necessary, immediate and direct referral to the \n     appropriate agency for assistance is provided.\n       COPS funding has provided officer staffing levels vital to \n     proactively target the issue of school violence. Springfield \n     has nineteen (19) officers and one Sergeant assigned full-\n     time to patrol our Springfield's fifty-five (55) schools. \n     These officers work with school officials, and numerous other \n     service agencies to prevent incidents of violence. Student \n     Support Officers are specially trained in mediation \n     techniques and are a resource to school officials and \n     students.\n       COPS funding has allowed us to develop many diverse \n     programs to improve the quality of life in our Community.\n       Citizens Police Academy--Since 1996 we have held seven \n     academies with approximately 175 residents attending twelve \n     week interactive training sessions.\n       COP SHOP--Based on the Citizen Police Academy but directed \n     at high school age youths who have shown an interest in Law \n     Enforcement.\n       COPS AND KIDS--An after school program meeting three times \n     a week at our Mounted Patrol facility targeting youths at \n     risk, 12 to 14 years of age.\n       COPS IN SHOPS--Undercover officers posing as liquor store \n     employees to target underage alcohol violations.\n       Community Chaplains on Call Program--A multi denominational \n     volunteer group of clergy that respond to critical incidents \n     within the City of Springfield and surrounding communities.\n       S.A.R.A Problem Solving Initiatives--Collaborative efforts \n     by police and other stakeholders to prioritize and combat \n     quality old life issues such as Open Drug Dealing, Auto \n     Theft, Vandalism, Graffiti, and Youth Violence.\n       COPS Funding has unquestionably improved the quality of \n     life for Springfield residents. Statistics show hard evidence \n     that the Community Policing Initiatives financed by COPS \n     Funding continues to be our most successful efforts to date.\n       From the period including 1995 to 1996 Springfield \n     experienced 33 homicides. From the period including 1997 to \n     1998 as Community Policing expanded Springfield experienced a \n     drastic reduction of homicides, with a total of 20. This is a \n     40% reduction over these two-year periods.\n       For the first six months of 1999 Springfield experienced \n     one (1) homicide.\n\n[[Page S8995]]\n\n       From the period 1997 to 1998 Springfield experienced an \n     11.98% reduction in UCR Part 1 Index Crimes. This category \n     includes Rape, Robbery, Burglary, Aggravated Assault and Auto \n     Theft.\n       For the same period Springfield experienced an 8% reduction \n     in all other crimes not categorized in UCR Part 1 Index \n     Crimes.\n       COPS funding is essential to the continued success of the \n     Springfield Police Department's efforts to improve the \n     quality of life for our citizens. Community Policing has \n     become a way of life in the City of Springfield. Any \n     reduction in funding will have catastrophic results and will \n     directly effect public confidence in their Police Department \n     and will be detrimental to the quality of life for the \n     citizens of Springfield.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                   Paula C. Meara.\n                                                  Chief of Police.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator from Delaware for his leadership as \nwell as for his courtesy.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 5 minutes to my friend from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Biden for his great \nleadership on this issue. I hope I am an original cosponsor, and, if \nnot, I certainly ask unanimous consent to be named a cosponsor.\n  I want to talk about a program that is extraordinarily important to \nthe safety of communities. That's the COPS Program. In 1994, Congress \nenacted the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. This act \nestablished a program known today as the COPS Program. This program has \nhad unparalleled success.\n  The authority to hire officers under the COPS Program expires in \nfiscal year 2000. Although the President's Budget provided for an \ninitiative that would allow a continuation of support for hiring \npolice, the Senate Appropriations Committee markup does not include \nsuch funding.\n  This is not the time to cut back on funding police programs for our \ncommunities. The COPS Program authorized the hiring of 100,000 police \nofficers and allowed states and localities to concentrate those \nofficers on community policing. Funds were used for purposes such as: \nTraining law enforcement officers in crime prevention and community \npolicing techniques; development of technologies that emphasize crime \nprevention; linking community organizations and residents with police; \nand developing innovative programs.\n  In 1998, the COPS Program initiated the Safe Schools and Indian \nCountry law enforcement improvements initiatives. The Safe Schools \nInitiative included $167.5 million for partnerships between law \nenforcement agencies and schools to improve safety in elementary and \nsecondary schools and to hire school resource officers.\n  Under the Indian country law enforcement improvement initiative \nfunding was available for hiring uniformed officers and assisting with \nother law enforcement improvements on tribal lands.\n  Under the COPS Program, the Youth Firearms Violence Initiative was \ndeveloped to assist police departments in combating the rise of youth \nfirearms violence.\n  As a result of the additional police officers in the community and \nthe innovative programs funded by the COPS programs, we have seen \nhistoric crime reductions over the last few years. Crime is at its \nlowest rate in 25 years and has declined for 6\\1/2\\ consecutive years.\n  The COPS Program is strongly supported by every major law enforcement \ngroup. Why? Because it responds directly to their needs.\n  I want to share with you a number of examples of how different \ncommunities in my home State of Minnesota have successful used COPS \nfunding and how their communities have benefited. The Anoka Police \nDepartment has refined its junvenile conferencing program--a program \nwhich essentially brings together youthful offenders with the victims \nof their offenses. The basic idea is that this confrontation will cause \nthe young person to see the consequences of his/her actions and make it \nless likely to occur again. It also has eased the pressure on the court \nsystem.\n  In short, Police Accountability Conferencing is a non-traditional way \nof dealing with juvenile offenders. Modeled after a program in \nAustralia, it brings the victim, the offender and their relatives \ntogether with an officer, who serves as a mediator, to discuss the \nramifications of the offender's actions and decide on a mutually \nagreeable form of punishment.\n  This commitment to young people is a classic example of how COPS \ngrants can be utilized effectively.\n  In addition, Anoka has a COPS officer who is also used as a school \nliaison officer. During the summer, this officer works with the \nlandlords association in dealing with landlord-tenant issues.\n  Anoka Police Chief Ed Wilberg views the COPS Program as a very \nsuccessful one--one which really does help to meet the needs of his \ncommunity.\n  In both the St. Paul and Minneapolis, the Police Departments have \nbeen able to free up more officers so that they can do proactive work. \nBecause of the COPS Program their work is not limited to responding \nsolely to 911 calls.\n  For instance, Chief Robert Olson of the Minneapolis Police Department \ntalks about being able to commit ``significant additional resources in \nboth police officers and equipment'' to address the core cause of crime \nin Minneapolis. He reports that ``The catalyst for helping the city \ncommit to those resources was the Federal COPS program.''\n  Chief Olson further states that\n\n       There is still a significant need for federal support of \n     community-oriented policing services . . . . Law enforcement \n     needs that federal support . . . and I hope that when these \n     issues are presented that you will consider a continuation of \n     the mission of the COPS Office in whatever form seems \n     appropriate.\n\n  In St. Paul, this is what the Chief's office had to say:\n\n       The COPS grants have allowed us to hire police officers, \n     increase efficiency through the use of technology, put \n     greater emphasis on our problem solving efforts and enhance \n     the linkage we have with our community. The COPS program is \n     one of the best things President Clinton and Congress has \n     done for law enforcement. We would like to see more funds for \n     technology and support to further enhance our efforts.\n\n  In White Bear Lake, a rural community, COPS funding has enabled \nrestructuring so that more officers are in the community. White Bear \nLake has divided its community in 19 subcommunities with at least one \nofficer assigned to each community. Quite simply, White Bear Lake \njumped light years ahead because of the technology that the COPS grants \nallowed them to purchase--which has the direct result of police \nofficers being in the community.\n  In the Shakopee Police Department, the COPS Program has been a \ngodsend to an agency its size. It has allowed the department to hire \nadditional officers in a diverse community that is growing every \nrapidly.\n  Within the last few months they were able to hire community service \nofficers to provide services that ordinarily would have to have been \nperformed by sworn officers. This means that additional sworn officers \nare freed up to do work in the community. Currently the Police \nDepartment is working to hire school resource officers. The school \ndistrict has agreed to help with the cost. This would not be possible \nwithout COPS.\n  Here, I say to Senator Biden, is the quote I have been saving for \nyou.\n  Police Chief Ken Froschheiser of Thief River Falls said that COPS \n``has been so successful that if the citizens heard that it was going \nto be pulled, we would be hung.'' He also said that he jokes with the \nschool district that he really doesn't have two officers, that the \nschool district has two employees.\n  His school liaison officers are in the school 12 months of the year. \nThey do things like bike patrols and help create block programs which \nallows his officers to be closer to the community, neighborhood by \nneighborhood. The COPS Program provided the resources to do the school \nwork that he wanted to do. He also has noticed an increased \ncollaboration with other city and county agencies, for example, the \nschool district, social services and the court system.\n  The point is simple: under a community policing philsophy, law \nenforcement agencies recognize the need for cooperation with the \ncommunities they serve. Each community has numerous resources that can \nbe used with law enforcement to solve problems.\n  The Upper Midwest Community Policing Institute, which is funded in \npart by COPS, is working in partnership with the Minneapolis Police \nDepartment to provide outreach and training to the large Somalian \ncommunity in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood and the officers who \nserve them.\n\n[[Page S8996]]\n\n  In the near future, this Institute will be exploring community \npolicing applications to the problem of domestic violence. Importantly, \nthe Institute is working closely with a large number of Tribal Law \nEnforcement agencies to provide training and technical assistance. This \nwork has included helping to facilitate the white Earth Tribe and \nMahnomen County agreement to resolve jurisdictional issues. COPS \nallowed this to happen. This Institute is an important piece of the \nCOPS picture. It exemplifies the success of a law enforcement approach \nthat is tailored to community needs.\n  The success of the COPS story goes on and on. COPS provided resources \nwhich allowed departments throughout Minnesota to upgrade technology \nand to redevelop the whole notion of community policing.\n  At the national level: The United States Conference of Mayors states \nthat the COPS Program has been critical in the significant reduction in \ncrime and that the nation's mayors always cite the COPS Program ``as a \nworking example of what can be accomplished when red-tape is reduced to \na minimum in favor of results-oriented programming''. The nation's \nmayors urge reauthorization of the program.\n  The COPS Program also is supported by the National Sheriffs' \nAssociation, The International Brotherhood of Police Officers, the \nNational Association of Police Organizations, The Police Executive \nResearch Forum, The National Troopers Coalition, The Major Cities \nChiefs, and the International Association of Chiefs of Police.\n  Mr. President, why would we eliminate such a successful program? This \nis a time to build on our successes. This country needs additional \nresources to enhance crime fighting efforts. We need better \ncommunications systems in more communities to deter criminals, and to \nimprove the ability of different jurisdictions to interact. We need to \nprovide more communities with state of the art investigative tools like \nDNA analysis. We need to be able to target crime hot spots by making \nresources such as crime mapping available to more jurisdictions. We \nneed new community based programs to ensure the safety of our school \nchildren.\n  The COPS amendment being offered today by Senators Biden and Schumer \nwill enable us to continue the COPS Program which will expire next \nyear. The amendment will support the hiring and training of up to \n50,000 more cops over 5 years. It will support new technology to fight \ncrime. It will provide funding for community prosecutors. The amendment \nputs cops in schools and supports partnerships between schools, law \nenforcement and the community. Communities and their students feel \nparticularly vulnerable in the aftermath of the Littleton tragedy. It \nis important to continue our support of the dialogue between schools, \nlaw enforcement and the community so that communities can continue to \nfashion solutions to the problem of school violence.\n  This program has been a success over the last 5 years. It has \nbenefited communities throughout this nation. It should be continued.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as we prepare to agree to this amendment \nreauthorizing the COPS Program for an additional year, I wish to take a \nmoment to recognize the work of the Senator from Delaware on this \nissue. The senior Senator from Delaware has offered an amendment that \nis very important to the country. He also, earlier this year, offered \nan amendment to the juvenile justice bill to reauthorize this program. \nThat effort, supported by everyone in the minority, was defeated.\n  Fortunately, though, for the people of the State of Nevada and this \ncountry, we had the support of the police officers from all over the \ncountry, the district attorneys from all over the country, the sheriffs \nfrom all over the country. Law enforcement officers, officials, \nliterally called upon us, their Senators, to express their overwhelming \nsupport for the reauthorization of this program. So I extend every bit \nof appreciation possible to the Senator from Delaware for his \npersistence and also for his ability to energize law enforcement \nofficials in this country. It is because of their interest and their \ntrust in the Senator from Delaware that we have reached this point.\n  I have in my hand four pieces of paper filled with the names of \ncities and towns, Indian tribes, universities from all over the State \nof Nevada, that have received help from this program, from Bolder City \nin the far southern tip of Nevada to the Yomba Shoshone Tribe in the \nnorthern part of the State. They received grants of money and police \nofficers to allow the State of Nevada to be a more peaceful place.\n  Hundreds of police officers are now patroling the streets all over \nthe State of Nevada as a result of the legislation that was previously \npassed. It is very important we move forward.\n  I speak as someone who has been a police officer, someone who has \nbeen a prosecutor, someone who has defended people charged with crime. \nI am convinced there are many important ways to cut back on crime, but \nthere is nothing more important than having a police officer seen on \nthe street. A police officer who is known to be in the area certainly \nwill deter crime.\n  This program is good. We are fortunate we are now having another \nopportunity to make sure this program goes forward.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am happy today to support continued \nfunding for the Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS program. \nDuring consideration of the Juvenile Justice Bill in May, I opposed \nSenator Biden's amendment which would have authorized the COPS Program \nfor 5 more years. I took that position because I felt that Senator \nBiden's proposal, which would have cost taxpayers $7 billion, needed to \nbe carefully scrutinized in the normal legislative process. His \nproposal would have more than doubled the current funding \nauthorization, and did not address the serious problems that exist with \nthe current program.\n  Today, however, I am happy to support continued funding of the COPS \nProgram for FY 2000. Local law enforcement officers from across \nTennessee have contacted me to let me know of their support for this \nprogram. Tennessee has benefitted from almost $120 million in Federal \nfunds since the COPS Program began. Police Chief Jamie Dotson of \nChattanooga told me that the COPS Program has assisted him in hiring an \nadditional 76 police officers. The police chiefs of Memphis, Nashville \nand Knoxville all support the program.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on reauthorization of \nthe COPS Program. I want to ensure that we build flexibility into the \nsystem, so that communities may use the Federal funds to best suit \ntheir needs, be they more policemen in schools, purchase of new \ntechnology, bullet proof vests, or overtime payments to keep policemen \non our streets fighting crime. Additionally, I want to ensure that we \ncarefully scrutinize the program to eliminate waste of scarce taxpayer \nresources. I am grateful that my colleagues have been able to work out \na compromise so we can continue to fund this program, and I am proud to \ncontinue my support.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud co-sponsor of \nthe amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from Delaware, \nSenator Biden. Despite the proven track record of the Community \nOriented Policing Services (COPS) Program and widespread support from \nthe law enforcement community, the current version of the Commerce-\nJustice-State appropriations bill almost completely eliminates this \nimportant program. Senator Biden's amendment, however, corrects this \nterrible flaw in the bill. It would preserve the Office of Community \nOriented Policing Services and fund the hiring of roughly 1,500 police \nofficers through FY 2000.\n  Since its inception in 1994, the COPS Program has provided an \nunprecedented level of resources to communities across the nation in \nthe fight against crime. The COPS Program has awarded $6 billion to \n11,300 communities to fund the hiring of more than 100,000 police \nofficers. The addition of 100,000 police officers represents a nearly \n20% increase in the number of officers on the streets. And more cops on \nthe streets means lower crime. Crime is at its lowest rate in 25 years \nand has declined for seven consecutive years. The COPS Program has a \nlot to do with that happy statistic.\n  What is community policing and how has it reduced crime? Community \npolicing is a law enforcement strategy\n\n[[Page S8997]]\n\nthat emphasizes establishing community partnerships, putting more \nofficers on the street, decentralizing command functions, and promoting \ninnovative, community-oriented strategies to prevent crime. With the \nrecent wave of schoolhouse shootings like those that occurred in \nLittleton, Colorado and Jonesboro, Arkansas, there is a growing sense \namong Americans that we are no longer safe in our homes, in our \nschools, in our communities. One sure way to reduce crime and restore \npeace of mind is through community oriented policing. The COPS Program \ndoes just that.\n  COPS has had a positive, and very tangible, impact on communities \nthroughout the country, including in my home state of Wisconsin, by \nputting more police officers on our streets and making our citizens \nsafer. In the state of Wisconsin alone, the COPS Program has funded the \nequivalent of over 1,100 new officers and contributed roughly $70 \nmillion to communities to make it happen. The COPS Program has \nsucceeded because it helps individual officers to be a friendly and \nfamiliar presence in their communities. They are building relationships \nwith people from house to house, block to block, school to school. This \ncommunity policing helps the police to do their job better, makes the \nneighborhoods and schools safer and, very importantly, gives residents \npeace of mind.\n  The current Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill, however, \nthreatens the progress in community policing and the reduction of crime \nour nation has seen in recent years. First, it eliminates the federal \nfunding for local law enforcement to hire additional, needed officers. \nSecond, it eliminates the COPS office and transfers the administration \nof technology and school resource officer grants to the Office of \nJustice Programs. This is absurd and ignores the success of the COPS \nProgram.\n  As I travel through Wisconsin and talk to sheriffs, police chiefs and \nother law enforcement officers, I hear the same refrain, time after \ntime: the COPS Program is vital to their work and has enabled them to \nget more officers out from behind their desks and onto the streets. I \nagree. The COPS Program has been a shining example of an effective \npartnership between local and Federal Governments. It provides federal \nassistance to meet local objectives. It does not interfere with local \nprerogatives. It does not impose mandates. The program provides funding \nto counties, towns and cities to enable communities to put more police \non the street. Individual police and sheriff's departments have \ndiscretion over how those funds are used, because they know what \nproblems their communities face and the places they need help most.\n  Mr. President, zero funding for hiring officers means fewer cops on \nthe streets. Shutting down the COPS office means local law enforcement \nwill lose the ability to participate closely in determining what funds \nthey receive and how they are used. Senator Biden's amendment, however, \nwould provide for continuing the much-lauded COPS Program to ensure \nthat we have an additional roughly 1,500 police officers in our \ncommunities in Wisconsin and throughout the nation. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this amendment and continuing our \ndrive to put more police officers on the streets and to reduce crime in \nour communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the Chairman, Senator \nGregg, and the Ranking Member, Senator Hollings, for accepting the one \nyear extension of the Community Oriented Policing Services Program. \nThis extension, being offered by Senator Biden, with my support, will \nallow communities in Maine and across the country, to continue \nreceiving assistance from this very successful program.\n  The COPS program was created in 1994, when President Clinton signed \ninto law the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. Not only \ndoes it provide grants that help communities hire additional police \nofficers to help with the war on crime, the COPS Program also provides \nfunds to acquire new technologies and equipment and provides police \nwith opportunities to work with schools to address persistent school-\nrelated crime problems. This program is so worthwhile that one of \nMaine's police chiefs said it is one of the most innovative programs he \nhas seen in his thirty-five years in police work.\n  Since its creation, COPS grants have been awarded to more than half \nthe policing agencies in the country. In Maine there are an additional \n258 police officers in 90 city and county police forces as a result of \nthe COPS Program. All across my state, from the Androscoggin County \nSheriff's Department to the Town of Ft. Kent and from the Kennebunk \nPolice Department to the Washington County Sheriff's Department, I am \nproud that the State of Maine has been able to utilize almost $18 \nmillion in COPS program funding to hire these new police officers. \nThese new police officers have helped reduce the amount of violent \ncrime in Maine and across the country. In fact, since 1994, violent \ncrime in America has fallen by 13%.\n  By restoring $495 million for Fiscal Year 2000, the Community \nOriented Policing Services program will be able to fund the deployment \nof almost 4,000 more police officers. These new additions to the front \nlines of the war on crime will allow our communities to continue to \nreduce violent crime in America.\n  Again, Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Gregg's willingness to \naccept this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will make a few brief comments, and I am \nprepared to yield the remainder of my time. I thank my friend from New \nHampshire for accepting the amendment.\n  This was part of an original bill called the Biden crime bill at the \ntime. At the time, when we introduced the notion of all these new cops \npartially being paid for by the Federal Government, I was told a couple \nof things. One, local authorities would not like it because they would \nhave to come up with part of the funding. Two, it would be cumbersome \nto administer. Three, we would find ourselves in the position where it \nreally wouldn't make much of an impact on the community.\n  I suggest the reason I wrote the bill the way I did originally was to \ntake into consideration all three of those concerns. First of all, \neveryone will know, from their home States, that there is no redtape in \nthis program. The day after we passed the crime bill in 1994 in my \noffice, I sat with the Attorney General of the United States and her \nstaff, and, to her chagrin, I said we must get this application down to \none single page. They looked at me as if to say: What do you mean, one \nsingle page? That is not possible for a Federal program which is going \nto cost $30 billion. But that is what it is. It is a page. That is the \nreason why there is an infinitesimally small portion of this COPS \nProgram and the crime bill program money being spent for \nadministration.\n  The second thing was, I remember my friend from South Carolina \ntelling me at the time: If you don't do this the right way, this is \ngoing to get hung up in every State. That is why we didn't send this \nmoney to Governors. The Presiding Officer is a former Governor. We love \nformer Governors. But this doesn't go through State legislatures. The \nlocal police chief in Columbus, OH, does not have to convince anybody \nin your State capital they need more cops. They can go directly to the \nsource.\n  From a little town in Massillon, OH, they can go straight to the \nsource. They do not have to go to the legislature; they can go straight \ndowntown after their city council in Dover, DE, Smyrna, DE, Wilmington \nDE. It enabled local law enforcement agencies to determine their own \nneeds and thereby eliminate the waste. By the way, I got in trouble \nwith Governors for writing it that way, for not sending it through \nState legislative bodies.\n  The third thing it does, and there was criticism of this when it was \ndone, it says you do not get any money unless you have a certain kind \nof police department. What do you have to do? If you have 10 cops in \nyour police department, you cannot fire two and apply for Federal money \nto hire them back. That is what was done under the\n\n[[Page S8998]]\n\nLEAA, the Law Enforcement Assistance Act, when I first got here. This \nprogram said there was a maintenance of effort. We would help you get \nthe 11th cop, but you couldn't cut it to 9 to go back to 10.\n  We said: By the way, you have to have a community policing operation. \nWhy is that important? Mayors and Governors do not want community \npolicing. It is harder to do. It costs more money. The cops \norganizations--I love them all--didn't want it. It costs more money. If \nI am a cop in a tough district, I would rather be riding in a patrol \ncar with another guy than I would be walking through by myself. So they \ndid not want it. We said: No money unless this gets leveraged. If you \nhave 10 cops and you want one of ours to raise your force to 11, all 11 \nhave to be community cops. That is the key.\n\n  Why do I say this? If the Federal Government gets out of the business \nof helping here, it will not only be the loss of the money; I predict \nit will be the loss of the willingness to maintain community policing \neven though it works, even though every mayor knows it works and every \ncounty official knows it works. It is expensive and it is hard. Mark my \nwords: The day the COPS Program ends, initially 5 percent, 10 percent \nof the communities in America will go away from community policing, and \n10 years from now we will be back to where we were.\n  That leads to my second concluding point. People said back when the \noriginal bill was written: Biden, why are you only doing it for 5 \nyears? I said, one of two things are going to happen. Maybe at the end \nof the 5 years those of us who support this concept are going to be \nright; it is going to be proven, as in the old expression, the proof of \nthe pudding is in the eating. At the end of the 5 years, the pudding \neither tastes good or it tastes bad. If it tastes bad, all the king's \nhorses and all the king's men will not keep the COPS Program going \nbecause it will be branded for what it is, a waste of time and money. \nBut if the pudding tastes good, all the king's horses and all the \nkings's men cannot stop it from being reauthorized for another 5 years.\n  So far, the king's horses and king's men have stopped it from being \nauthorized for another 5 years. It is a different issue. It is \ndifferent than continuing it for this next year. But I want to say, I \nthink the proof is in the eating. Our streets are safer. Go out and ask \nany of your mayors, any of your county executives, any of your town \ncouncils, any of your police departments. You come back and tell me \nanyone who said: Eliminate this program. They may have suggestions to \nmake it better, and we should listen to them but not eliminate it.\n  This leads me to my exact last point. I am a Democrat. I take great \npride in the fact that I wrote this bill. Originally, it was the Biden \nbill. When it passed and became law, I remember saying to President \nClinton: Let's call it the Clinton bill.\n  We lost the Congress that year, and he thought we lost the Congress \nin part because of the gun amendments. He said: Keep it the Biden bill.\n  It started working really well, and now it is the Clinton bill. It is \ngood it is the Clinton bill, but I want to make this the Republican \nbill, and I mean this sincerely. I want COPS to become like Social \nSecurity has become. Initially, Republicans hated Social Security and \nthey were against it. Roosevelt came along, and Democrats supported it. \nOver the years, they have not only become politically committed, they \nare as committed as we are. They really understand how important it is, \nbut for a long time it was not invented here.\n  This COPS bill was bipartisan in its inception. When the first so-\ncalled Biden crime bill that had this in it originally passed out of \nthe Senate, it was called the Biden-Hatch crime bill until it got to \nthe other side. Gingrich did not like the look of it politically, and \neven though it passed in the Senate with 97 votes originally--what \npassed the Senate originally was the same thing that ended up becoming \nlaw. It had 97 votes originally. It went over to the House of \nRepresentatives, and when it came back, I had to get seven Republicans \nto pass it. Only seven Republicans voted for it.\n  From that point on, the bad news about the crime bill has been: We \nDemocrats beat our chests about how we did it, and the Republicans did \nnot, which is literally true. And the Republicans have said: My Lord, \nwe can't continue to support a program from which the Democrats are \ngetting such benefit. Let's end this.\n\n  Let's go back and pretend this was part of the crime bill that passed \nout of here, which it did, with 97 votes. This is a bipartisan idea, \nand my plea is let continuing the program through its authorization \nperiod of the fiscal year 2000 be the first step, and the second step, \nthat Republicans and Democrats join together and reauthorize for \nanother 5 years this program and reauthorize for another 5 years, as my \nfriend from New Hampshire has suggested, the trust fund.\n  It is time--and I know this sounds ridiculous in this atmosphere--to \ntake the politics out of this. This is working. There is enough room \nfor all of us to claim credit. There is enough room for everybody to \nsay, look, listen to what Ronald Reagan used to say when he first \nbecame President: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. This ain't broke.\n  Now let's put a Republican stamp on it and a Democratic stamp on it--\nan American stamp--just as we do on Social Security. We will be doing \nthe Nation a great favor, and maybe, just maybe, we will get back in \nthe habit a little bit of cooperating as Democrats and Republicans.\n  I thank my friend from New Hampshire for being willing to accept the \namendment. I appreciate his accommodation in allowing us to speak to it \nin spite of that, and I truly look forward to the possibility that in \nthe coming months we will be able to move beyond this and have a \nbipartisan--a Republican amendment. I will sign on to a Republican \namendment reauthorizing this and call it the Republican crime bill. I \ndo not care what we call it. I sincerely mean that. But let's keep a \ngood thing going.\n  I thank my friend, again, very much. I thank my friend from South \nCarolina who, when this bill was being written 5 years ago, was the \nmajor engine behind it. He was the one who allowed it to get through \nthe committee in the first place.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may take on \nthis. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Delaware and his \ncommitment to this program.\n  The committee's decision to end this program was based on a number of \nfactors. The first factor was our allocation, which was so low. We had \nto simply apply resources where we thought they were most needed.\n  The second factor was basically, in our opinion, the administration \nhad taken the money to fund the COPS Program from some other very \nimportant law enforcement initiatives. For example, the administration \ndid not fund the additional 1,000 Border Patrol which we think is \ncritical. They did not fund the expansion of strike team efforts by the \nDEA. They did not fund the Boys and Girls Clubs initiatives. They did \nnot fund the juvenile block grants. They did not fund the local law \nenforcement block grants. They did not fund the interagency drug \nenforcement grants. The money which came out of those accounts was \nessentially used to expand the COPS Program.\n  The funding which this committee has made to the COPS Program has \nbeen extraordinary, and it has been strong over the years. In fact, the \noriginal program called for 100,000 cops. This committee has funded \n105,000 cops over the years and with our final funding we had in place.\n  We also as a committee, with the support of the Senator from South \nCarolina, initiated aggressive programs of mentoring in schools using \npolice officers. We think this is an important effort, and in our bill \nwe expanded that amount. That is how we arrived at the number we did.\n  I am willing to look at the extension of the COPS Program, but I \nthink we have to look at it in the context of the resources available \nto us. When the administration sent up a budget as they sent up and \nessentially played games with the other law enforcement accounts, \nthings which have to be done, which we knew had to be done and they \nknew had to be done, and then they underfunded those accounts, that is \nwhat created the basic problem in the initial bill.\n\n[[Page S8999]]\n\n  Working with the Senator from Delaware, we have been able to work out \nthis resolution, which I think is a reasonable one and one with which I \nknow the Senator from South Carolina agrees.\n  If there is no further debate, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware has made an \noutstanding presentation. I join in the comments of my distinguished \nchairman. We are ready to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1285) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, before we take up the next amendment, let \nme just comment briefly on the amendment already agreed to, offered by \nthe Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this amendment. I am very pleased \nwith the action taken this afternoon by the Senate. The amendment \ncertainly signals our continuing strong commitment to this innovative \napproach to crimefighting; that is, the COPS Program.\n  The crime rate in the United States has gone down for 6 consecutive \nyears--the longest period of decline in 25 years. And we received even \nmore good news recently. This year's National Crime Victimization \nSurvey reports that the number of Americans who were victims of violent \ncrimes dropped 7 percent between 1997 and 1998.\n  That is great news. Of course, no one claims we have won the war \nagainst crime, but we are certainly winning some important battles. The \n100,000 officers placed on the beat since the COPS Program began in \n1994 have been on the front lines of this vital effort.\n  Why would we jeopardize that success? The additional officers put on \nthe beat since 1994 have revolutionized community policing, and the \nCOPS Program has helped foster an unprecedented crime-fighting \npartnership between communities and Federal, State and local law \nenforcement. Why should we let something that has proven to be so \neffective wither on the vine?\n  We should instead build on the success of this program, which has \nbeen endorsed time and again by every major law enforcement \norganization.\n  I have seen firsthand how valuable the COPS Program has been in \ncommunities in my home State. South Dakota's law enforcement officials \nare among the most well-trained and capable public servants in the \ncountry.\n  South Dakota's crime rate is low, and its streets are safe, but, just \nas in more populated States, South Dakota families still worry about \nthe safety of their streets and neighborhoods.\n  In my State, and in rural America in general, the COPS Program can \ndouble the size of some police or sheriff's departments by providing \nfunding to hire just one or two additional officers. Many of the small \ntowns and counties in my State are faced with tight budgets, limiting \nthe amount of resources they can devote to law enforcement personnel. \nBy providing those resources, the COPS Program has had a profound \nimpact on these communities.\n  Law enforcement officers in South Dakota have described that impact \nto me.\n  They have testified about how the COPS Program has helped them.\n  Let me share just one of those stories, because I think that it \nprovides a vivid example of how this program can truly make a \ndifference.\n  In the days immediately following the Littleton, CO, tragedy, parents \nthroughout the Nation were terrified by a rash of bomb threats and a \nfear of ``copycat'' crimes. In South Dakota, we had to deal with over \n30 bomb scares.\n  One of those threats was called into Tri-Valley, a school in a rural \ncommunity outside of Sioux Falls, SD. Fortunately, Tri-Valley has a \npolice officer, called a ``school resource'' officer. His name is \nDeputy Preston Evans, and his position is funded by a COPS grant.\n  On the day of the bomb threat, as students were being evacuated from \nthe school, a number of students came up to Deputy Evans and told him \nthey knew who had made the threat. By the end of the day, two suspects \nhad been arrested.\n  Those students were able to confide in Deputy Evans for one reason \nthey trusted him. And they were able to trust him because they knew \nhim--they had a relationship with him. How many acts of violence or \nmischief are deterred in schools like Tri-Valley because the students \ncan confide in such a person, who might not be there without the COPS \nProgram?\n  In a video conference yesterday, I spoke with some of the law \nenforcement leaders in South Dakota--Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike \nMilstead and Sioux Falls Police Chief Clark Quiring, and many others. \nThey told me how the COPS Program has provided them the flexibility to \nincrease their presence in schools.\n  They mentioned how important it is for students to feel secure. As \nSheriff Milstead so eloquently noted, ``there is not a bigger barrier \nto learning--than fear.''\n  For his generation, the greatest fear was going home that afternoon \nwith a bloody nose, he told us.\n  Littleton reminds us that kids today have a lot more to worry about \nthan just a fist-fight with a school-yard bully.\n  But thanks to the COPS Program, children today have someone they can \nturn to.\n  Dr. Bill Smith, the Instructional Support Services Director for the \nSioux Falls School District, joined the law enforcement leaders in \nyesterday's video conference and told me that we now have evidence that \nofficers in schools are welcome and helpful.\n  When students throughout the Sioux Falls district were asked in a \nyear-end survey whom they would go to if they had a problem, 44 percent \nsaid they would confide in their school resource officer before anyone \nelse.\n  That is a remarkable statistic:\n  44 percent of the students said they would go to their school \nresource officer before they would turn to their teacher or principal. \nI can think of no more compelling evidence of how this program can make \na real difference than that.\n  Today, the Senate will help ensure that the COPS Program, and \nofficers like Deputy Evans, will continue to make a difference--in our \nschools, on our streets, and in our neighborhoods.\n  The action taken by the Senate just now is a tribute to the men and \nwomen across the country who risk their lives every day to make our \ncommunities safer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one of the important items contained in \nthe Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill is the appropriation for \nthe Census Bureau.\n  I think we all agree, a fair and accurate census is a fundamental \npart of our representative democracy and good government. As required \nby the Constitution, census results will determine how many members of \nthe House of Representatives will come from each of the states. Those \nresults will also determine how many federal dollars, funding a wide \narray of important programs, will return back to the state. We're \ntalking about over $180 billion that will go to state and local \ngovernments and the distribution of additional billions in state funds. \nThis same data is a vital component in determining where to build \nroads, hospitals, schools; even your local Wal-Mart or McDonald's \nlocation is based on this same information.\n  The Census Bureau projects that the U.S. population will near 266 \nmillion in\n\n[[Page S9000]]\n\n2000. Cost estimates for administering Census 2000 were projected to be \nanywhere between $4 and $4.8 billion. Those projections were based on \nthe assumption that ``sampling'' would be used to provide the fairest \nand most accurate count to date.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court, however, this last year ruled by a narrow 5-4 \nmajority that the use of sampling was prohibited by law for the purpose \nof apportioning seats in the House of Representatives. Since the Court \ndecided the case on statutory grounds, it found no need to decide \nwhether the Constitution also barred the use of modern statistical \nmethods for purposes of congressional apportionment. The Court went on \nto affirm that the law requires the Secretary of Commerce to use modern \nstatistical methods, where feasible, for all other purposes.\n  As a result of the Court's decision, the Administration is required, \nif feasible, to release two sets of population figures in 2001: one set \nof adjusted, unsampled numbers to be used for apportioning seats to the \nStates, and a second set of adjusted or sampled, numbers to be used for \nall other purposes. The Court's decision has added the potential of \n$1.7 billion to the cost of the census. These funds will be used to \nhire census takers to handle the 50% increase in the number of \nhouseholds that must be visited.\n  This includes $954 million for non-response follow-up. To get \nresponses from all households that don't answer the mail survey, the \nCensus Bureau will hire more enumerators and will expand follow-up to \nany unprecedented 10 weeks. Training will be increased to sustain \nquality with a larger workforce that will total over 800,000 employees.\n  The Census Bureau will need an additional $268 million for data \ncollection infrastructure, $229 million for coverage improvement \nefforts, and $219 million for a variety of data collection operations, \nthings like rural area data collection, the ``Be Counted Program,'' \nenumeration of soup kitchens, shelters, and redeliveries.\n  Every single dollar the Administration is asking for is necessary. \nWithout it, we will have a highly inaccurate census count. I believe \nwe're on the path to another census nightmare similar to the 1990 \nexperience. Nationwide, we missed 8.4 million people, mostly inner city \nand shanty town minorities; they double counted 4.4 million Americans, \nmost of whom were white college students. My home State of Illinois \nsuffered the eighth highest undercount in 1990; in the city of Chicago \nalone, they somehow didn't count 2.4 percent of the population. If you \nsaid they counted 97.6 percent of the population, it sounds good. But \nmissing 2.4 percent is crucial. That's an astonishing figure \nconsidering the national average for undercount hovers around 1.6 \npercent. That may not sound like a lot but that 0.8 percent \ndifferentiation equals almost 70,000 people. The city of Chicago \nestimates that the undercount was significantly higher: maybe as much \nas 250,000 people. The Census Bureau missed 114,000 folks for the whole \nstate.\n  What does that mean for my constituents back home in Illinois? The \ncity of Chicago did a study last year and, if you follow the premise \nthat the Bureau missed 68,000 people, estimated revenue loss for the \ncity of Chicago would have totaled just under $100 million. If you \nfollow the 250,000 undercount figure, the city of Chicago would have \nlost over $327 million. Let me give some figures that show why we're \ntrying to raise awareness about this topic.\n  Head Start in the city of Chicago, a program to provide early \neducation for kids, lost over $28 million because of the census \nundercount. The Older Americans Act for senior citizens lost over $5 \nmillion. WIC funds, nutrition funds for children, lost over $2.5 \nmillion. Child care funding, we lost over $3 million. This is no small \naffair. We have to remedy the situation.\n  I have a letter, dated May 7, 1997, from my colleagues Senator Lott, \nSenator Nickles, then-Speaker Gingrich, and House Majority Leader \nArmey. In this letter, the Republican leadership in both Houses state:\n\n       We are firmly committed to working with the House and \n     Senate Budget Committees and Appropriations Committees to \n     provide a level of funding sufficient to perform the entire \n     range of constitutional census activities, with a particular \n     emphasis on accurately enumerating all groups that had \n     historically been undercounted.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 1997.\n     Dr. Martha Farnsworth Riche,\n     Director, Bureau of the Census, Department of Commerce, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dr. Riche: We are writing about one of the most \n     critical constitutional functions our government performs: \n     the decennial census. Based on recent media reports, we are \n     concerned that a misunderstanding of congressional priorities \n     is driving the Census Bureau's plans for the 2000 census. \n     Consequently, we fear that the Bureau is on the verge of \n     formalizing plans that do not reflect the House and Senate's \n     goal to perform the most accurate census possible that is \n     consistent with the Constitution. We would like to take this \n     opportunity to clarify the three main principles that \n     comprise the congressional mandate for Census 2000 and which \n     should guide the actions of both Congress and the Bureau as \n     you finalize census preparations in coming months.\n\n\n                           increased accuracy\n\n       Accuracy and completeness are absolutely essential if the \n     census is to provide the reliable data necessary to support \n     the business of government. Despite criticism, the 1990 \n     census was the most accurate in history. Still, we expect to \n     improve on its success in 2000. To reach the level of \n     accuracy we expect, to ensure that communities that have been \n     undercounted in the past are fully and accurately counted in \n     the future, we must physically count each and every American.\n       We cannot rely on statistical schemes that compromise \n     accuracy for the sake of economy. Despite the Bureau's \n     insistence that statistical estimation is more accurate than \n     actually counting Americans, the fact remains that if \n     statistical adjustment had been allowed in 1990, Pennsylvania \n     would have erroneously lost a congressional seat to \n     California. Voters should not be disenfranchised through the \n     use of statistical guessing.\n       Census data must also be as valid at the census tract and \n     block level as they are at the state and national levels. \n     Under sampling, as the area gets smaller, the margin of error \n     grows wider. Individuals who rely on accurate census data for \n     reapportionment will receive census counts with a range of \n     possible numbers to choose from in drawing lines for \n     congressional, state and local elections. The result will be \n     chaos in government, uncertainty for voters, lawsuits lasting \n     for the better part of a decade, and worst of all, the \n     further erosion of our citizens' confidence in their \n     government's ability to do its job and do it right.\n\n\n                           constitutionality\n\n       Equally important is the constitutionality of Census \n     methodology. Taxpayers are investing a minimum of $4.2 \n     billion to conduct Census 2000. We must protect their \n     investment by using only methods that are clearly and \n     undisputably allowed by the Constitution. If the Census is \n     conducted with methods that are later ruled unconstitutional, \n     taxpayers will not only have lost their original investment \n     in Census 2000, but will likely be asked to spend an \n     additional $6 billion or $7 billion to do the entire census \n     over again.\n       Legal experts who testified recently before the Senate \n     Governmental Affairs Committee agreed that it would be \n     calamitous if the Supreme Court were to declare Census 2000 \n     unconstitutional. The Court has not addressed the \n     constitutionality of statistical sampling in the Census, \n     however the Constitution clearly states that the Census \n     should be an ``actual Enumeration'' of the population, and \n     Title 13 U.S.C., Section 195 states that sampling cannot be \n     used for purposes of the apportionment of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives. We strongly believe that the Bureau's \n     proposed use of statistical sampling exposes taxpayers to the \n     unacceptable risk of an invalid and unconstitutional census.\n\n\n     allocation of sufficient resources to conduct an accurate and \n                         constitutional census\n\n       Recent news reports have quoted you and other Census Bureau \n     officials as citing a congressional mandate to spend less \n     money in the 2000 Census. While we certainly seek to promote \n     economy and efficiency in all aspects of government, the \n     constitutional requirements governing the census leave us no \n     choice when it comes to cutting corners in order to save \n     money; we cannot do it. On the contrary, the census must be \n     funded at levels necessary to comply explicitly with the \n     Constitution.\n       We are firmly committed to working with the House and \n     Senate Budget Committees and Appropriations Committees to \n     provide a level of funding that is sufficient to perform the \n     entire range of constitutional census activities, with a \n     particular emphasis on accurately enumerating all groups that \n     have historically been undercounted. Towards this end we are \n     eager to see aggressive and innovative promotion and outreach \n     campaigns in hard-to-count communities, the hiring of \n     enumerators within those localities, and maximizing Census \n     employment opportunities for individuals seeking to make the \n     transition from welfare to work.\n       We look forward to working with you on these and other \n     issues to ensure that the 2000 decennial Census is the most \n     accurate and\n\n[[Page S9001]]\n\n     Constitutionally sound census ever conducted.\n           Sincerely,\n     Newt Gingrich,\n                                             Speaker of the House.\n     Richard K. Armey,\n       House Majority Leader.\n     Trent Lott,\n       Senate Majority Leader.\n     Don Nickles,\n       Senate Assistant Majority Leader.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me wrap up by saying that our goal is the most accurate census \npossible. The census has a real impact on the lives of real people. We \nhave to do everything for a fair, accurate, and complete count.\n  It is my understanding that my colleagues, Senators Gregg and \nHollings, the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nCommerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary, will hold a hearing in the \nvery near future on this issue of underfunding. I look forward to the \nresolution of this important issue.\n  I have spoken with the White House as well. They assure me that this \nissue will be resolved, and we won't repeat the disastrous census \nundercount of 1990 in the year 2000.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I was going to send an amendment to the \ndesk. Might I ask my colleague from Indiana--I would like to hold my \nposition on the floor, but I saw him--did he come to the floor with the \nintention of speaking or introducing an amendment?\n  Mr. LUGAR. If I may respond to my distinguished colleague, I came to \nthe floor to offer an amendment to the bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if Senator Lugar came with the \nintention of offering the amendment, I was just trying to help Senator \nGregg and Senator Hollings move this along.\n  So might I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to follow Senator \nLugar with the next amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I think that makes a great deal of sense \nsince we may be able to work something out on the Senator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1289\n\n(Purpose: To appropriate funds for the National Endowment for Democracy \n   and to offset such appropriations with a reduction in the Capital \n                            Investment Fund)\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for himself, Mr. \n     Graham, Mr. Mack, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Lieberman, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1289.\n       On page 78, between lines 8 and 0, inset the following:\n\n\n                    NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY\n\n       For grants by the Department of State to the National \n     Endowment for democracy as authorized by the National \n     Endowment for Democracy Act, $30,000,000, to remain available \n     until expended: Provided, That, in lieu of the dollar amount \n     specified under the heading ``CAPITAL INVESTMENT FUND'' in \n     this Act, the dollar amount under that heading shall be \n     considered to be $50,000,000.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish to state the purpose of my \namendment. The purpose of the amendment is to restore funding for the \nNational Endowment for Democracy. I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nGraham and Senator Mack, who serve with me as members of the Board of \nAdvisors for the National Endowment for Democracy. We are proposing \nfunding the NED at $30 million, which is $2 million below the \nPresident's request and $1 million less than this year's funding level. \nIt is also $1 million below the authorization level that has already \nbeen approved by the Senate.\n  Our amendment proposes to shift $30 million from the Capital \nInvestment Fund in the State Department title of the bill. I regret \nvery much having to propose this shift because I, like the chairman of \nthe subcommittee, believe the Capital Investment Fund is important to \nthe effective operation of the Department of State and that the account \nis underfunded. But if we are successful in making the offset, I will \nwork with the chairman and others to try to help find the moneys to \nhelp restore that funding to the Capital Investment Fund.\n  The problem the subcommittee faced was a serious problem. There is \nsimply inadequate funding in the 150 function of the International \nAffairs Account. That scarcity of funds forced difficult choices about \npriorities and required much give and take. In my judgment, the \nNational Endowment for Democracy must be a high priority. There is no \nfunding for the National Endowment in the bill before us. That is why \nwe are compelled to propose the amendment I have just introduced.\n  The reason for proposing the amendment is that the appropriations \nbill provided no funds--none at all--for the National Endowment. The \nEndowment did not even merit a mention in the bill; it is completely \nignored. This zero-funding decision was made even though the Senate \napproved a straight-line funding level of $31 million in the State \nDepartment authorization bill, which we considered earlier this year, \nand even though successive administrations and successive Congresses \nhave supported full, or near full, funding for the NED year after year.\n  It is a unique phenomenon perhaps that the NED has enjoyed strong \nbipartisan support since 1983 when it was created by the Reagan \nadministration. The NED has consistently gained the support of both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations since then and of every \nRepublican and Democratic Congress over the past 15 years. But not in \nthis bill.\n  The committee report accompanying the bill does recommend that funds \nfor the NED be found among other divergent State Department accounts. \nThis simply is not a good idea. Funding directly from the State \nDepartment would make the NED a grantee of the State Department and \nmake it an arm of the Department. This would eliminate NED's line item, \ndestroy its independence, and undermine its ability to gain access to \ngrassroots organizations fighting for freedom and democracy in other \ncountries all over this world--the very heart of NED's effectiveness.\n  For this reason, former Secretaries of State have written of the \nimportance of retaining the independence of the NED in a 1995 letter. \nThey wrote:\n\n       We consider the nongovernmental character of the NED even \n     more relevant today than it was at NED's founding twelve \n     years ago.\n\n  NED's effectiveness comes in good part because it has an independent \nstatus, functions as a nongovernmental organization, and has a board \nthat operates as an independent board of advisers. We have faced and \nconfronted challenges to the NED numerous times in the past. The Senate \nhas debated funding for the NED six times since 1993. Two years ago, we \nfaced a comparable effort to slice and dice the NED. I proposed an \namendment at that time to restore funding, and it was approved by the \nSenate by a vote of 73-27. A few weeks ago, in another challenge to \nNED, this time proposing a different manner by which NED allocates its \ninternal grant-making funds among the four core institutes; the \namendment was defeated by an almost identical vote of 73-26. That has \nbeen the pattern, fortunately, over the years.\n\n  Let me just say I am sympathetic to the extraordinary difficulty \nfacing the managers of the bill. There are so many critical issues in \nthe various titles of the appropriations measure, and the NED is a very \nsmall item by comparison. But this is just the point. The NED has been \na very cost-effective vehicle for promoting democracy, human rights, \nand civic society around the world. Given its presence in some 90 \ncountries, many on the threshold of democratic breakthroughs and others \nstruggling with the transition to a more open society, NED's relatively \nsmall funding level is a genuine bargain. It is an exceptional \ninvestment in security for the United States of America.\n  We often speak in broad generalities about promoting democracy, \nexpanding democratic values, and promoting human rights around the \nworld. The point that must be made is that doing\n\n[[Page S9002]]\n\nso is very much in our national interest. These are not whimsical \nideas. Securing strong democracies should be one of the most effective \nmeans of combating and deterring the spread of terrorism, coping with \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, promoting market \neconomic practices and principles and creating opportunities to expand \nour markets, supporting fair labor practices, and forestalling the \ndestabilizing effects stemming from refugee flows.\n  None of these goals comes easily, and, as a Nation, we have decided \nit is in our national interest to encourage and to assist those in \nother countries who share the same ideals as we do in the United \nStates. The NED is a key instrument in achieving these democratic goals \nand values.\n  Over the past 15 years, the NED and its four core institutes have \nworked openly with willing counterparts in other countries to spread \nthe ethos of democracy around the world. The four core institutes \nworking with the NED itself are each affiliated with domestic American \ninstitutions. They are: A, the International Republican Institute, the \nIRI, and B, the National Democratic Institute, the NDI, which help \nbuild political parties, help to ensure free and fair elections, and \nstrengthen governing institutions and civic society. They are loosely \naffiliated with the Republican and Democratic Parties. Then, C, the \nCenter for International Private Enterprise, CIPE, which promotes the \ngrowth of private enterprise in a democratic process, is affiliated \nwith the Chamber of Commerce, and (d) the American Center for \nInternational Labor Solidarity, which has links to AFL-CIO and supports \nthe development of independent trade unions. The Solidarity Movement in \nPoland was an early grantee, for example. The NED itself funds \ngrassroots organizations that promote independent media, human rights, \ncivic education and the rule of law in other countries.\n\n  Testimonials on behalf of the NED have poured in from former \nPresidents, former Secretaries of State and former national security \nadvisors, from grantees and non-grantees alike. These testimonials \nrepresent a veritable Who's Who in the world movements for democracy \nand human rights. These names include His Holiness the Dalai Lama; \nHarry Wu, the Human Rights Activist; Elena Bonner, Russia civil rights \nadvocate; Clement Nwankwo, Chairman of the Transition Monitoring Group \nin Nigeria; Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic; Lech Walesa, \nleader of the Solidarity movement in Poland; and countless others from \nsome 80 to 90 countries in every region of the world.\n  Mr. President, I had hoped to avoid a debate on this issue this year. \nI had hoped that some agreement or arrangement could be made so that we \ncould move ahead without delaying this appropriation bill. That \ncertainly has been my intent. I regret that this has not been possible.\n  The amendment is now before the Senate.\n  I simply say that in the early 1980's when clearly it was the intent \nof the United States to push for democracy and human rights that the \nmeans of doing that were not at all clear to President Reagan and our \nSecretary of State. As a matter of fact, many felt it was inappropriate \nthat the President and the Secretary of State sought to intervene in \nthe affairs of other countries around the world suggesting changes of \ngovernment, although this is clearly what we wanted to see.\n  The changes in Eastern Europe could not have occurred without Lech \nWalesa, and Lech Walesa's movement which were heartily adopted by the \nAFL-CIO of this country. Through informal but very effective means of \nfinance and organization, that fledgling labor movement in Poland was \ngiven not only strength but legitimacy throughout the world as a \ndemocratic movement of change, an alternative to a government which at \nthe time seemed very solid.\n  At the same time, from my own recollection and experience, I recall \nthe efforts of the Roman Catholic Church in Central America and in the \nPhilippines, and of American businesses who were farsighted and who \nunderstood the interests of our country laying freedom for people and \ndemocracy in contract law and the rule of law--the same principles we \ndebate now with regard to Russia, as we have worked with Russians.\n  How do you establish these situations, and do so without violation of \ndiplomatic principles? Because our Nation, our President, our Secretary \nof State, must deal with leaders as they are constituted now and with \ntheir foreign ministers and defense ministers.\n  But a very unique organization came from these considerations. It was \ncalled the National Endowment for Democracy.\n  It included Republicans, Democrats, labor officials, Chamber of \nCommerce people, and a check and balance so that our own American view \nhad four dimensions. This was not ideological, not official, but arose \nfrom the best grassroots leadership of this country. And it was \neffective.\n  The changes in the world we now take for granted--the celebration we \nhad at the 50th anniversary of NATO, the accession of Poland, Hungary \nand the Czech Republic into NATO--we take for granted that democracy \nthere came forward.\n  The point I am making is that it did not come forward because our \nState Department advocated that and brought it about, although clearly \nthey support the shift to democratic systems. There was no official \ngovernmental way of bringing about those responses, which require \nmoney, fledgling newspapers, grassroots organizations, a how you print \nballots, and how you register voters. All the nitty-gritty of politics \nwe take for granted, but which could not be taken for granted in those \ncountries which had not enjoyed those options.\n  The issue before the Senate, very frankly, is that some Members I \nsuspect may have become weary of the democracy business. They may think \nthat was important then and this is now.\n  I would just suggest that at the NED board meetings which I attend \nregularly there are routinely 80 to 100 proposals in which the National \nEndowment for Democracy and its core groups debate on these principles. \nWe take seriously the idea of democracy and human rights. We think that \nis still a very important subject in this world. This is not routine. \nIt is not freely dismissed as something that was lost in the budget. It \nwas not mentioned, but the State Department might find if it came to \ntheir attention.\n  We believe that the statement by the Senate ought to be clear--that \nwe stand for democracy and the National Endowment for Democracy is a \nvery good way to achieve democracy, and to do so year by year in a \nsystematic and effective way.\n  I point out that it is important, I suppose, to have this debate each \nyear as a wake-up call. There may come a time when we become so blase \nand so routine about our functions that we forget human rights. But I \nhope that will never be the case.\n  I suspect that those who are still struggling in parts of \nsoutheastern Europe--certainly in many Asian countries--those who are \nconsidering democracy in China, those in Latin America and Africa and \nthose who are still trying to make it work out in various provinces of \nRussia welcome our help. They welcome labor leaders and business \nleaders from this country. They welcome Senators like John McCain, who \nheads up the Republican Institute; or Orrin Hatch, who was there at the \nbeginning of the National Endowment.\n  Senator Connie Mack of Florida, one of our board members now, and \nSenator Bob Graham of Florida, one of our board members now, have both \nbeen so effective in Latin America and Central America, and not just in \nthe 1980's when we were all going down for inspection of elections, \ntrying to help people find out how to campaign, and how to count votes \nsuccessfully.\n  A lot of that heavy lifting still needs to be done.\n  Although this is a debate that I wish did not occur annually, but so \nbe it. It is a time really for Senators to stand up and be counted on \nwhether they feel passionately, as I do, and I think many of us do, \nabout democracy and human rights and what we can do about it \neffectively.\n  I am simply making the point that the State Department cannot do that \nby force. We as American citizens working through grassroots \norganizations and through informal means can\n\n[[Page S9003]]\n\nget the money and the organization to make a difference, which \nultimately our President can recognize and our Secretary of State can \nbless.\n  I point out, parenthetically, that the incumbent Secretary of State, \nMadeleine Albright, has served on the Board of the National Endowment \nfor a number of years as has Zbigniew Brzezinski, as distinguished \nmembers of the Democratic Party. We now have Paul Wolfowitz, a \ndistinguished American diplomat and scholar, as one of the Republicans, \nserving on the board.\n  This has been a case of people giving of their time and their \nsubstance in private life even as they go back and forth into the \npublic sector and serve our country in that way.\n  I finally make the point that we are indebted to excellent editorials \nthat appear in major newspapers in the last few days.\n  I simply quote a sentence from the New York Times editorial of \nyesterday in which they call for a vote for democracy abroad, a leading \neditorial. They say:\n\n       It is hard to think of a dictatorship whose opponents have \n     not benefited from the endowment.\n\n  That I think is an important point.\n  As you name the dictatorships of this world, they knew what hit them. \nIn most cases it was the Endowment for Democracy and its advocates, and \nits supporters that made the difference.\n  There may be all sorts of theories why these governments rose and \nfell. But I suggest that those of us who suggest it through the ballot \nbox initiative really had to have a horse to ride on, and the means at \nleast of making those alternatives effective.\n  I cite, for example, the current discussion in Serbia where many \npersons believe--starting with our President--that President Milosevic \nwould not be a suitable candidate for reelection or for a continuation. \nBut the press keeps pointing out, What are the alternatives? How do \nhabits change, if it is to occur in a democratic way?\n  Where are the fair procedures? In fact, where has the United States \nbeen in terms of actively boosting those who wanted freedom, who wanted \na different kind of Serbia, who espouse those values in this country \nbut had no effective vehicle?\n  Those are the missions that lie ahead. I hope we will be worthy of \nthe task. I advocate the adoption of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to support restoring \nfunding for the National Endowment for Democracy and commend Senator \nLugar for offering this amendment. As reported from the Appropriations \nCommittee, the National Endowment would receive zero funding for fiscal \nyear 2000 with the assumption that the Department of State would \nprovide money from its democracy and human rights accounts.\n  Since its inception in 1983, NED has sought to maintain an \nideological balance, with a bipartisan, multisectoral core structure, \nas well as a bipartisan board. Its status of being simultaneously \npublic and private has provided insulation from shifts and tides in \nchanging administrations, allowing NED to focus on long-term democracy \ndevelopment. This independent role would be compromised if NED were \nsubjected to State Department control.\n  For almost 16 years, NED has been instrumental in building the \nfoundations of democracy in over 80 countries, including peaceful \ntransitions in Poland, Chile, and South Africa. Today NED continues to \nsupport a diverse portfolio of democracy building initiatives. In the \nSudan, NED funds support human rights monitoring and reporting. In the \nNewly Independent States (NIS) and in Russia, NED has been supporting \nanti-corruption efforts, market-based reforms, independent media, and \ncivic education. These programs lie in the long term interest of the \nU.S. because they will help to promote stability in a region plagued by \ninstability. They will help these countries to emerge from the mire of \ncommunism.\n  NED programs are also important in the People's Republic of China. \nMr. President, I think we are all aware of the egregious human rights \nabuses perpetrated by the authoritarian government in China. The \ninsecure government controls pastors and church members through state \napparatus, imprisons prodemocracy advocates for their activities, and \nsuppresses the truth through propaganda instead of allowing open media. \nThousands of political prisoners languish in prison, many sentenced \nafter unfair trials, others without any trial whatsoever.\n  Under the totalitarian regime in China, the political system is a \nsealed door with no clear signs of opening. Many in the United States \nhave placed their faith in economic progress to produce some sort of \neventual political change in China. I do not believe that we can afford \nto make such a dangerous assumption. Even as the Chinese people suffer, \nso too will the advocates of ``trade at all costs'' under the current \npolitical system, because of the absence of the rule of law. When \ntrying to conduct business in China, American companies must deal with \nbureaucrats rather than regulations, evasions rather than enforcement, \nand convolution rather than competition--because there is no judicious \nrule of law.\n  We all want to see democracy in China. But we cannot assume that it \nwill happen by itself. Instead, we must take steps to foster democracy. \nThat is exactly what NED is about. NED funds over twenty programs to \npromote human rights and democracy in China.\n\n  With money from NED, the International Republican Institute supports \nelectoral and legal reform.\n  The National Democratic Institute monitors civil and political \nliberties in Hong Kong following its transfer to China.\n  The Laogai Research Foundation, run by former dissident and prisoner \nHarry Wu, conducts in-depth research into China's forced labor prison \ncamps.\n  Another NED grantee is run by chairman Lie Qing, who spent eleven \nyears in prison for his involvement in the Democracy Wall movement. \nThis organization has been invaluable in monitoring human rights \nconditions in China and has been helping victims' families bring \ncriminal charges against Chinese leaders responsible for the 1989 \nTiananmen killings.\n  NED also supports VIP Reference, an organization that has taken \nadvantage of the Internet to promote the free flow of information in \nChina--news that has not been filtered or altered by the Chinese \ngovernment. Besides opening this conduit to freedom, NED also supports \nresearch and publications on democracy and constitutionalism, symposia \non private enterprise and market economics, and publications relevant \nto Tibet.\n  Mr. President, these organizations are not rich by any means. In many \ncases, their staff works on a volunteer basis, out of their conviction \nto see freedom in China. They rely on funding from NED to stay in \noperation because other sources of funding from Hong Kong and Taiwan \nare scarce. Those potential sources fear offending China. Private \nbusinesses often will not fund these groups because they consider it \ntoo great a risk in light of their business interests in China. Only \nCongress has remained committed to funding these advocates of \ndemocracy. Without NED funding, we will cripple these programs and \nremove a key fulcrum in the push for democracy in China.\n  Democracy building is not a quick fix for totalitarianism, nor will \nit produce instant change. But in the long run, these programs will \nproduce a result worth far more than they cost today.\n  I commend Senator Lugar for taking this leadership role, for offering \nthis amendment. I believe it is critically important we support and \npass this amendment, not just for China but for advocates of democracy \nall over this world.\n  I urge my colleagues to support a restoration in the National \nEndowment for Democracy's funding for fiscal year 2000.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we have all heard the expression stand \nand be counted for democracy.\n  Come on, give me a break. No one really thinks a Senator obviously \nelected to office is against democracy. No one in his right mind could \nthink that the Department of State is against democracy and is \nincapable.\n  What we have is a deficit. The Congressional Budget Office estimates \nat this particular moment we are spending over $100 billion more than \nwe are\n\n[[Page S9004]]\n\ntaking in this year. I didn't know this was coming up, but since I get \nquestioned about there being no surplus for the year 1999, the \nCongressional Budget Office, as of June 30, estimated that we will \nspend this fiscal year, which ends at the end of September, $103 \nbillion more than we take in.\n  The President's own document, the OMB projection, not only states we \nwill have a deficit for the next 5 years, but the deficit and the debt \nwill continue for a 15-year period, the debt going up from $5.6 \ntrillion to $7.7 trillion. It is going up to 2.1 trillion bucks and \neveryone is running around talking about surplus, and we are getting \n602(b) allocations at the Subcommittee on State, Justice, Commerce, of \n$1.3 billion less than we have this year. We are spending more than we \nare taking in, and otherwise trying to find $1.7 billion in the census.\n  Faced with those constrictions, I wonder where in the world do you \nfind money for the Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO, the Democratic \nParty and Republican Party--how do you justify it?\n\n  Back in the eighties we had Lech Walesa and they did have a wonderful \nlabor movement and they did bring democracy there in Poland. But I \ndon't know of the labor movement that is going on in the People's \nRepublic of China. I have been there three times now and I have yet to \nmeet a labor leader, much less the likes or ilk of Lech Walesa.\n  So, yes, we stand up to be counted for democracy. We are hoping to \nsustain the economic credibility of this particular republic by saying \nwe have to make choices. I tried to pay for these programs. I have even \nintroduced a value-added tax allocated to reducing the deficit and the \ndebt and taking care of Social Security. But these friends who come to \nthe floor and talk in fanciful terms about they are for democracy and \nindependent movements for democracy--the inference being, of course, \nthe State Department is not--on the contrary.\n  I hear about taking it from the Capital Investment Fund. I remember \nworking some 4 years ago with Under Secretary Moose, Dick Moose, who \nused to be the director of our Foreign Relations Committee who the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana would remember well. Everybody is \ntalking about security of the Embassies and facilities in the \nDepartment of State. The communications computerization of the \nDepartment of State and the Embassies overseas and around the world is \nin terrible shape. It is similar to the Pony Express. So 4 years ago we \ninstituted the Capital Investment Fund to get Y2K compliance. The \nChamber of Commerce, that crowd that was running all over the floor \nfixing the votes for Y2K--a problem that could not possibly happen for \n6 months and everybody is beginning to comply and they wanted to upset \n200 years of tort law back at the State level where they know how to \nadminister it best--they came in to do that. And now they want to make \ndarn sure the Department of State is not Y2K compliant.\n  Tell the Chamber of Commerce to look for democracy somewhere else and \nmoney somewhere else. The same for all these other entities that want \nto get NED, the National Endowment for Democracy. It is a political \nsop. It has been that for several years and everybody knows it.\n  We would like to give it all to desirable things. There have been \nsome good things that happened under the National Endowment for \nDemocracy years back, but they continue to embellish and run around \nwith responsibilities they try to find, makeshift and otherwise, so \nthey know it is going to be in trouble when they come to the floor. \nThey get distinguished leadership to bring these amendments. I take it \nI will be in a minority, but I have gotten used to being a minority of \nthe minority.\n  With that said, I hope we can save this amount of money somehow, the \n$30 million. It is not easy to get the moneys we need all over for the \nDepartment of State. I can tell you now, we are on course. To take $30 \nmillion from the telecommunications upgrades and computerization \nupgrades we are now about doing, and start cutting that back for the \nChamber of Commerce of the United States, is out of the whole cloth for \nthis Senator who stands here in the well for democracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join with the Senator from South Carolina \nin his views on this issue. I recognize we will lose this vote, but we \nhave had our brief day in the Sun at least. The fact is NED's time has \ngone by. For all the arguments that have been made by the Senators who \nhave spoken on this, the bottom line is this is a relic of the cold \nwar. In a time when we have very limited resources, it is very hard to \njustify funding the Democratic National Committee, the Republican \nNational Committee, AFL-CIO, and the Chamber of Commerce, all of whom \nhave significantly more resources to put into this than we have \navailable for us out of these very limited accounts.\n  Many of the things NED has done during the time of the cold war were \nwonderful. But now we have moved on 10 years from the fall of the \nBerlin Wall and it is time for us to say enough is enough. \nUnfortunately, in my opinion, some of the things NED is doing now are \nnot. They end up being a substitute for initiatives which are both \ninappropriate and sometimes just simply junkets.\n  That being said, I am concerned, as is the Senator from South \nCarolina, this will take funds out of the capital budget of the State \nDepartment. We have worked hard on this budget. We have taken the State \nDepartment from getting a ``D'' in the area of Y2K compliance to now, \njust 2 years later, it is one of the agencies getting an ``A.'' Two \nyears ago when we started capital budget expansion, which we initiated \nin this committee--it did not come from the State Department; although \nthey were very supportive of it, they could not find resources for it--\na majority of the Embassies around the world were using rotary \ntelephones. They were using Wang computers. They had no decent \nfacsimile machines. We have radically upgraded the electronic \ncapabilities of the State Department. But we have a long, long, long \nway to go. It all ties into the need to protect our citizens who are \nworking for us out there and their families.\n  So when you hit this fund for $30 million, which represents about 30 \npercent of the money--and this fund was not increased this year; \nalthough I wanted to increase it, we simply could not find the money--\nyou are going to do significant damage, I think, to the State \nDepartment's accounts. The State Department, for that reason, is very \nconcerned about this amendment.\n  That being said, the Senator from South Carolina, being one of the \nbest vote counters in the Senate, and I, being a marginal vote counter \nas chief whip, we recognize we are not going to win this one. I think \nwe should vote on it and move on. If the Senator from Indiana is \nagreeable to that, I suggest we urge adoption.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I appreciate very much the words of the Senator and I \nappreciate the desire to move on with the bill. I want to recognize the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida has arrived. He, likewise, shares \nour enthusiasm for passing the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am sure.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, on this occasion of the almost annual debate \non NED, the National Endowment for Democracy, we can and we must \ndeclare our commitment to promoting freedom in the world.\n  Freedom often exacts a price--it indeed is not free. Ronald Reagan \nunderstood this when he created NED, as have successive Presidents and \nCongresses who have consistently funded NED.\n  Freedom is sacred. It is to be honored, protected, and shared with \nthe world. It is the core of all human progress, and therefore, the \nspread of freedom enriches us all.\n  But let us not forget, the price of freedom can be great. Just as we \nfocus in this body these days on our abundance we must not forget those \nwho have come before us; we must not forget in whose shoes we are \nwalking. How many Americans have died; have put their lives on the line \nin the glorious pursuit of that sweetest of goals--emancipation from \noppression and tyranny. We are the direct benefactors of the \ndedication, selflessness, and even the spilled blood, of countless \npeople.\n\n[[Page S9005]]\n\n  Should we be proud of those achievements? Of course, but we must also \naccept the weight--the responsibility--of this gift. The awesome \nresponsibility which we have inherited. Because, when I said that \nfreedom is not free, I was not only speaking of the cost to those \ncurrently suffering in the world to throw off the yoke of tyranny, but \nalso the price to us, the benefactors of past actions.\n  We are once again on the floor of the Senate to defend the National \nEndowment for Democracy. The last time we fought this battle, 2 years \nago, 72 Senators voted to restore the funding to NED after the \nsubcommittee zeroed the account. We are here today facing the same \ncircumstances. The good news with the regularity of this debate, if we \nlook for the bright side, is that we know very well of the strong \nsupport in the Senate for NED. And let me explain why.\n  The history is important. In 1983, Ronald Reagan outlined an \ninitiative for the United States to publicly lead the struggle for \nfreedom around the world. A policy which I remember well as a young \nHouse Member and in many ways continues to influence my thinking about \nAmerican foreign policy. A fundamental pillar of that policy was the \nNational Endowment for Democracy.\n  Let me read to you from a letter by President Reagan, from July 4, \n1993.\n\n       On this 217th anniversary of our nation's independence, I \n     am reminded that America's greatness lies not only in our \n     success at home, but in the example of leadership that we \n     provide the entire world.\n       Our work, however, is not complete. As I look abroad, I see \n     that the struggle between freedom and tyranny continues to be \n     wages. Disappointly, in some places, it is autocracy, not \n     freedom, that is winning the day. That is why I strongly \n     support continued Congressional funding for the National \n     Endowment for Democracy (NED). Ten years ago, at Westminster, \n     you will recall that I outlined a new, bold initiative for \n     our country to publicly lead the struggle for freedom abroad. \n     As past of this effort, at my request, the National Endowment \n     for Democracy was created.\n\n  Mr. President, let me point out a few fundamental things. First, NED \nis not a ``cold war relic,'' as some critics argue. You will note that \nPresident Reagan did not say that the purpose was to defeat communism, \nto defeat the Soviet Union, or to contain any particular ideology. He \nsaid that the mission of NED was to support America's efforts to ``lead \nthe struggle for freedom.'' You should also note that the letter from \nwhich I read is dated July 4, 1993--2 years after the fall of the \nSoviet Union. So let me be clear: NED is not about the cold war and has \nnever been exclusively about fighting communism or the Soviet Union. \nThe National Endowment for Democracy is about freedom.\n  My second point is that the need for NED is as great today as it has \never been.\n  We opposed communism because the flawed ideology oppresses people and \nempowers tyrants. Communism has almost disappeared as a threat today; \nbut tyranny has not--oppression has not. Indeed, tyranny and oppression \ncontinue to rule in far too many places around the globe. If you accept \nthat we were right in the past to oppose freedom's foes, then we have \nthe same task today, perhaps even more complicated than in the past.\n  This vote, therefore, comes down to a simple issue: does the struggle \nfor freedom continue in the world and does the United States continue \nto have a role in the struggle for freedom abroad? Does tyranny still \nreign in far too many places on earth? The answer is quite obviously, \n``yes.''\n  Let me address some critical questions others have raised.\n  Does NED work? NED works extremely well by providing resources to the \nfreedom-activists throughout the world. NED identifies people \nstruggling for economic, political, labor, press, and other reforms and \ngets them the resources necessary to fight against local oppression.\n  His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet says the following about NED:\n\n       The National Endowment for Democracy furthers the goals of \n     your great nation and has provided moral and substantive \n     support for oppressed peoples everywhere. Its unique \n     independent mission has brought information and hope to \n     people committed to peace and freedom, including the \n     Tibetans. I sincerely hope that this institution will \n     continue to receive support, because America's real strength \n     comes not from its status as a `superpower' but from the \n     ideals and principles on which it was founded.\n\n  So the final question which someone may rightly put to this debate: \nwhy not the State Department? Isn't NED redundant?\n  To answer this question, I defer to some experts who understand the \nexecutive branch and State Department well. I turn to a bipartisan \ngroup of former Secretaries of State and National Security Advisors.\n  In a 1995 letter, former National Security Advisors Allen, Carlucci, \nBrzezinski, and Scowcroft state that NED:\n\n       . . . operates in situations where direct government \n     involvement is not appropriate. It is an exceptionally \n     effective instrument in today's climate for reaching \n     dedicated groups seeking to counter extreme nationalist and \n     autocratic forces that are responsible for so much \n     conflict and instability.\n\n  Let me emphasize that these National Security Advisors state that NED \nis operating where the U.S. government cannot.\n  I also have a letter from former Secretaries of State, including \nSecretaries Baker, Muskie, Eagleburger, Shultz, Haig, Vance, and \nKissinger. This distinguished group states the following:\n\n       During this period of international change and uncertainty, \n     the work of NED continues to be an important bipartisan but \n     non-governmental contributor to democratic reform and \n     freedom. We consider the non-governmental character of the \n     NED even more relevant today than it was at NED's founding.\n\n  Let me review the main arguments. First, NED's necessity did not end \nwith the cold war, but remains an integral part of America's opposition \nto the enemies of freedom. Second, the world continues to need \nAmerica's invaluable work in promoting freedom--perhaps even now more \nthan ever. And finally, NED makes a unique contribution to America's \ninitiative to ``lead the struggle for freedom abroad.''\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Lugar \nAmendment to restore funding to the National Endowment for Democracy.\n  One of the noblest characteristics of the American people is their \ndesire to spread the promise of freedom and democracy throughout the \nworld. In fact, the history of our nation is replete with examples of \nmen and women who have put their own lives on the line in defense of \nother people's freedom.\n  The 9,386 U.S. soldiers buried at the Normandy American Cemetery in \nFrance are more than heroes. They are a testimony to the American \nwillingness to defend democracy. Yet, they are just a few of the \nliterally hundreds of thousands of Americans who have sacrificed their \nlives to secure democracy both at home and abroad.\n  However, the fight for freedom need not always be waged on the \nbattlefield. Indeed, some of the greatest democratic victories have \ncome, not as a result of our military might, but rather from the power \nof our ideas.\n  If you doubt this, ask Vaclav Havel how the irresistible pull of \ndemocratic values helped liberate the Czech people. Ask Nelson Mandela \nabout how the persuasive power of American democracy helped encourage \nthe struggle for freedom in South Africa's townships. Ask Kim Dae Jung \nabout the decades of American sacrifice and the difference between life \nin a free South Korea and a totalitarian North Korea. Mr. President, \neach of these men have come before Congress to say that their freedom \nis due in no small part to the willingness of the American people to \noppose despotism and to support nascent democratic movements in their \ncountry.\n  The transformation from totalitarianism to democracy that has swept \nmuch of the world in the last decade is nothing short of remarkable. \nMuch of the success of this movement can be attributed to U.S. support \nfor democratic movements, including the on-the-ground programs of the \nNational Endowment for Democracy. This is a legacy of which we should \nbe proud. It's a success story we should do a better job of explaining \nto the American people.\n  NED was established by Congress in 1983 as a non-profit, bi-partisan \norganization. It promotes democratic values by encouraging the \ndevelopment of democracy in a manner consistent with U.S. interests, \nassisting pro-democracy groups abroad, and strengthening electoral \nprocesses and democratic institutions. NED accomplishes these goals by \nproviding funding to a wide variety of grantees that operate programs \nin\n\n[[Page S9006]]\n\nmore than 80 countries throughout the world.\n  Mr. President, for over 15 years the National Endowment for Democracy \nhas been at the center of our global democracy efforts. Critics have \nargued it is a relic of the Cold War. They insist NED's usefulness as \nan organization disappeared with the Soviet Union. This simply is not \nthe case. As long as there are people still struggling to be free, \nthere will be a need to support democratic reforms. The truth is, \nalmost two-fifths of the world's population still live in un-democratic \ncountries. In these countries, people are not given the ability to \nspeak their minds, to practice their religious beliefs, or to unleash \nthe power of their own enterprise.\n  NED grantees are in these countries and are working with pro-\ndemocracy groups. In Cuba, NED grantees are helping local dissidents \nuse the world wide web to interconnect and to spread independent news. \nNED sponsors radio broadcasts into Burma in support of the democracy \nmovement led by Aung San Suu Kyi. And in Iraq, NED provides support for \nthe Free Iraq Foundation to disseminate human rights information from \nwithin Saddam Hussein's brutal regime.\n  Beyond extending the power of democracy to those people still toiling \nunder despotic governments, NED is also actively engaged in the effort \nto solidify democratic progress. Democracy does not exist simply after \nthe first free and fair election--democracy cannot be established \nsolely by the ballot box. Instead, a true democratic society is based \non the foundations of the rule of law, respect for the rights of all \npeople, a free press, and civilian control of the military.\n  In countries around the world, NED grantees are involved in helping \ndevelop this broader concept of democracy. For example, in Russia NED \ngrantees are supporting efforts to promote the rule of law and to \nestablish legal guarantees for the ownership of land. In Nigeria, they \nhave supported local pro-democracy groups who were instrumental in \nfacilitating this year's historic elections. These are examples of the \nhundreds of programs NED and its grantees have been involved with in \nsupport of democratic reform.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to argue that the fight for \ndemocracy is as important to U.S. national security today as it was at \nthe height of the Cold War. It is for this reason that I will vote in \nfavor of the Lugar amendment to restore funding for the National \nEndowment for Democracy. I recognize the tight discretionary spending \nlimits the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee were forced \nto work under. I understand very difficult decisions had to be made in \npreparing the piece of legislation. However, there are few priorities \nas great, and few programs as cost-effective, as our global democracy \nefforts.\n  I urge my colleagues to support freedom around the world by \nsupporting the National Endowment for Democracy and the Lugar \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment will restore $30 million in \nfunding for the National Endowment for Democracy.\n  I understand that the State Department accounts are severely \nunderfunded and there is no easy way to fund these programs, and I will \nwork to ensure that all the State Department accounts are funded by the \ntime this bill emerges from conference.\n  In spite of the unfortunate position we now find ourselves, it is \nnevertheless critical that we restore the funding for the National \nEndowment for Democracy.\n  Today we will debate the merits of the NED and the importance of its \nmission. This will be the seventh time in the last seven years that the \nSenate debates NED funding.\n  The last time this debate took place, in 1997, an effort to eliminate \nNED funding was reversed by a vote of 72-27.\n  I am hopeful that this current debate will reach a similar \nconclusion.\n  But this debate is really about much more than the National Endowment \nfor Democracy.\n  What we are debating here today goes to the very fundamental nature \nof our democracy.\n  Are we to continue to be the beacon of freedom to which oppressed \npeoples around the world look to for guidance and support in their \nstruggles to attain the same liberties and freedoms that we hold so \ndear?\n  Or are we going to shrink from that responsibility and abandon those \nwho seek to change the fundamental character of their nations so that \ntheir people may enjoy the benefits of freedom?\n  Around the world, the NED is a vibrant and effective advocate for the \nideals for which our fore fathers risked their lives and sacred honors.\n  It is our ambassador to the oppressed people of the world who are \nfighting and risking their lives for freedom.\n  But you don't need to take my word for this. Let me tell you about \nsome others who believe that the NED is as important as I do.\n  In 1995, seven former Secretaries of State sent a letter to the \ncongressional leadership that stated:\n\n       During this period of international change and uncertainty, \n     the work of the NED continues to be an important bi-partisan \n     but non-governmental contributor to democratic reform and \n     freedom.\n\n  Four Former National Security Advisors, Allen, Brzezinski, Carlucci, \nand Scowcroft, wrote that ``the endowment remains a critical and cost-\neffective investment in a more secure America, and we support its \nwork.''\n  Just this week, the New York Times editorialized on the importance of \nthe NED, and the Wall Street Journal printed a piece by former \nPresident Carter and Paul Wolfowitz, an official in the Reagan and Bush \nadministrations, that did the same.\n  So many as champions of democracy have recognized the important \ncontribution of NED to their own work.\n  These include Harry Wu, the Chinese human rights activist, His \nHoliness the Dalai Lama, Elena Bonner, the chairman of the Andrei \nSakharov Foundation, and Vaclav Havel.\n  To some here in Congress, the NED is a target to undermine and \ndefund.\n  But to those struggling to overcome oppression in some 80 or 90 \ncountries around the world, NED is a helping hand in their fight for \ndemocracy.\n  I ask my colleagues to stand with freedom and democracy, to stand \nwith those who have led democratic transitions, and to stand with those \nwho continue to pursue the dream of democracy around the world.\n  I ask my colleagues to stand with the NED.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Lugar \namendment, which will restore funding for the National Endowment for \nDemocracy (NED). Since its inception in 1983, NED has been a cost-\neffective means of ensuring that American democratic principles have \nthe opportunity to flourish around the world. NED works on a bipartisan \nbasis in over 80 countries in every region of the world to help build \nstable, peaceful democracies. This, in turn, furthers America's \nnational security interests, since working to support secure, strong \ndemocracies is one of the most effective means of combating the spread \nof weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and destabilizing refugee \nproblems.\n  NED enjoys strong, bipartisan support, receiving the support of each \nadministration and the bipartisan congressional leadership since its \ninception. In a recent editorial in the Wall Street Journal, former \nPresident Jimmy Carter and Ambassador Paul Wolfowitz, President Bush's \nUnder Secretary of Defense, wrote: ``The creation of the NED in the \n1980s reflected a bipartisan belief that the promotion of freedom is an \nenduring American interest and that nongovernmental representatives \nwould best be able to help their counterparts build democracy in other \ncountries.''\n  NED has a strong track record, developed through involvement in \nvirtually every critical struggle for democracy of the past decade-and-\na-half. NED provided vital support to the movements that brought about \npeaceful transitions to democracy in Poland, Chile, and South Africa. \nIndeed, as a recent New York Times editorial noted: ``It is hard to \nthink of a dictatorship whose opponents have not benefited from the \nendowment.''\n  NED uses its funds efficiently and effectively. A recent audit \nconducted by the U.S. Information Agency's Inspector General looked at \nfiscal years 1994-1999 and did not question a single cost related to \nthe management of NED's grants.\n\n[[Page S9007]]\n\n  NED's independence is the key to its success. Without the restoration \nof NED's funding as a separate, congressionally mandated line item, NED \nwill have to be funded through the State Department's foreign aid \nprocess. This would undermine NED's independence, and therefore its \neffectiveness.\n  If NED were to be too closely associated with the Department of \nState, then NED might be seen as merely a mouthpiece for whatever \nadministration currently occupies the White House. This would dilute \nits effectiveness.\n  NED must be allowed to continue to make decisions about where to \nprovide its vital assistance without having first to clear those \ndecisions through the State Department bureaucracy, which may not \nalways share NED's agenda. The United States carries out high-level \ndiplomatic relations with a number of nondemocratic regimes, such as \nChina. The State Department might be tempted to scale back NED's \ndemocracy-building activities in such countries if the Department \nviewed those activities as interfering with the Department's diplomatic \nagenda. This must not be allowed to happen, and keeping NED independent \nis the only way to ensure that it does not.\n  The Lugar amendment restores funding for this vital organization \nwhile ensuring its independence. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \namendment of the Senator from Indiana and am confident that it will be \napproved by a majority of my colleagues.\n  This is the second time in 3 years that funding for the National \nEndowment for Democracy has been eliminated in the Senate Commerce-\nJustice-State appropriations bill. And this is the second time this \nyear that we are debating the NED issue on the floor of the Senate \ndespite consistently overwhelming votes in favor of the NED.\n  I find it difficult to understand why we keep returning to this \nmatter when the record is clear--there is a consensus of support for \nthe endowment in the Senate. As my colleagues are aware, last month \nthere was an effort on a different measure (State Department \nauthorization bill) to seriously undermine and weaken the National \nEndowment for Democracy and the work of its core institutes. That \namendment was soundly defeated on a vote of 76-23. In 1997, NED funding \nwas restored by the Senate on a vote of 72-27.\n  Over the years, the NED and its core institutes have done some \nextremely effective work around the world in strengthening and \nassisting in the development of democratic institutions, and protecting \nindividual rights and freedoms.\n  The relationship between NED and its core institutes has worked \nrather well. These four core entities, including the National \nDemocratic Institute (NDI) and the International Republican Institute \n(IRI), represent key sectors of our democratic society: business and \nlabor, and the two political parties which have formed a major part of \nthe American democratic system.\n  Each sector offers a special expertise in helping develop fledgling \ndemocratic systems and has assisted grassroots and indigenous \norganizations, civic groups, and individuals across the globe in more \nthan 90 countries.\n  Indeed, many individuals and groups, recognized in the Congress for \nhaving fought for human rights, freedom, and democracy, have received \nvital support from the NED family. They, in turn, have praised the NED \nbecause of the critical assistance which made it possible for them to \npursue valuable efforts in their own countries.\n  I should note that the NED has provided support to Chinese dissidents \nsince its establishment in 1983. In fact, the endowment's first grant \nin 1984 was for a Chinese-language journal edited in the United States \nand circulated in China.\n  The NED serves an important role because of the fact that it can \noperate as an entity independent from any government. And it can \nsupport nongovernmental groups which provide opportunities that would \nnot otherwise be available if these activities were undertaken by a \ngovernment, or governmental agency.\n  In fact, NED grants have been helpful in leveraging resources from \nthe private sector and encouraging other international institutions to \nparticipate as well. And in-kind contributions, for example, come in \nthe form of experts who offer their free time and efforts on a probono \nbasis to conduct training seminars and to monitor elections worldwide.\n  The National Endowment for Democracy has enjoyed broad bipartisan \nsupport since it was established in 1983 under President Ronald Reagan. \nFormer Secretaries of State, including Henry Kissinger, Cy Vance, Ed \nMuskie, George Shultz, and Jim Baker all have been very supportive of \nNED's work and its ``strong track record in assisting  . . . \nsignificant democratic movements over the past decade.''\n  In a letter this week to my colleague from Florida, national security \nadviser Sandy Berger reaffirmed the President's and his \nadministration's strong support for the NED. As he indicates, ``from \nsupporting election monitoring in Indonesia, to promoting independent \nmedia in the Balkans, the NED represents and promotes the most \nfundamental of American values throughout the world. . . . The \nPresident remains one of the strongest champions of the endowment''.\n  The sweeping and profound changes resulting from the end of the cold \nwar provide ample reason as to why we continue to need institutions \nlike the NED which can operate in a cost-effective manner and, at the \nsame time, promote our interests and values. Many of the new \ndemocratics which have emerged from the implosion of the Soviet Union, \nand the collapse of the Iron Curtain, have benefited from the \nassistance NED and its grantees have provided.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues will see the wisdom of continuing \nsupport for the NED.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Lugar-\nGraham-Mack amendment to restore funding to the National Endowment for \nDemocracy. I rise as an unwavering supporter of the Endowment since \nthat day in 1982, when President Ronald Reagan announced his intent to \ncreate an institution to promote abroad the most fundamental of \nAmerican political values --democracy.\n  Since the Endowment was instituted the following year, it has \nreceived overwhelming bipartisan support. On six occasions the Senate \nhas debated funding for the NED; on all six occasions the Senate has \nreaffirmed its commitment. We most recently debated funding the \nEndowment in 1997 and reaffirmed our support for it in a vote of 72-27. \nI expect that today the Senate will once again go on record \ndemonstrating support for this venerable institution.\n  Support for the NED goes beyond bipartisan politics. Rarely is there \nsuch near-unanimity in the so-called ``foreign policy establishment.'' \nBut, in recent years, we have seen seven former Secretaries of State \nfrom both Republican and Democratic presidents--Secretaries \nEagleburger, Baker, Haig, Kissinger, Muskie, Shultz and Vance--co-sign \na letter in support of the National Endowment for Democracy.\n  But the NED's support extends well beyond the Beltway into American \nsociety at large. For example, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly \nsupports the Endowment, recognizing that the promotion of democracy \nrequires the rule of law, on which all fundamental, productive \ncommercial activity rests. The AFL-CIO is also a principal supporter of \nthe NED, recognizing the inseparable bond between the advancement of \ndemocracy and the protection of independent labor's right to organize.\n  Both of these organizations, along with the Republican and Democrat \nparties, form the core groups through which the NED coordinates \nprograms currently active in over 80 countries of the world.\n  Further, support for the NED is widespread among our nation's media, \neditorialists and academics. How often, Mr. President, do we see \neditorials in support of an institution on the pages of liberal and \nconservative media? There has recently been editorial support for NED \nexpressed by The Washington Post, New York Times, Wall Street Journal \nand The Washington Times. I ask unanimous consent that the editorials \nbe added at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9008]]\n\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I often detect confusion in foreign policy \ndebate between the concepts of ``interest'' and ``values.'' For \nexample, the President, at the end of Operation Allied Force over \nYugoslavia, declared it an operation in support of our values. I \ndisagree: The NATO actions in Kosovo, which I supported, protected \nAmerican interests, specifically our interests in a stable southeastern \nEurope.\n  The fact is that defining America's national interest is more \nfundamental than the promotion of democracy. But the reality is, Mr. \nPresident, that where we find democracy we are more likely to find it \neasier to protect our interests.\n  For this reason, the advancement of democracy as a foreign policy \ngoal has by no means been diminished by the end of the Cold War. I \nsupported the actions of the NED during the Cold War, along with \nmembers of both parties. I worked with the NED and International Labor \nOrganization supporting the nascent Solidarity movement in the early \n1980s and am deeply proud of the work done by NED's early grantees.\n  But the world is more complicated, with more challenges to U.S. \ninterests, in the post-Cold War era. We need the NED more than ever. \nAnd if we look around this complicated globe, we see that NED's \nactivities are complementing our foreign policy.\n  China is perhaps the most vexing challenge this country faces. We \ncannot determine the direction political evolution in China will take. \nWe hope for the day when democracy spreads to the mainland.\n  Our dear friends in Taiwan, after all, have demonstrated that Chinese \npolitical culture is by no means alien to democracy. But on the \nmainland, the goals of political reform are murky. We don't know what \nthe outcome will be in the next century--it may be democracy, it may be \nfascism, it may be something else.\n  There is evidence to be optimistic, as we see the increasing \nmanifestations of grassroots democracy and openness. Unfortunately, \nthere is also evidence to be skeptical, given official actions that \nimprison democratic activists, outlaw non-political organizations, and \nthreaten aggression against us and our friends. My attitude has always \nbeen to plan for the worst, but work for the best possible outcome.\n  One of those ways to work for the best possible outcome is to support \nthe NED, which has promoted democracy in China since its inception. A \nbrief and incomplete list of NED's activities in China would include:\n  Supporting, as one of its first grants, a Chinese-language journal \nthat circulated in China in the mid-1980s;\n  Supporting a New York-based human rights group, Human Rights in \nChina, which assembled basic data on conditions in China;\n  Assisting Harry Wu's Laogai Research Foundation, which exposed the \nabhorrent abuses in China's prison labor system; and,\n  Contributing to the Tibetan Human Rights Foundation.\n\n  In addition, my colleagues who have read the fascinating reports by \nthe International Republican Institute on their work advising on and \nmonitoring village level elections in China will recognize a practical \nand profoundly significant activity funded by the Endowment. These are \namong many, many other programs supported by the NED in China.\n  The skeptics can say that NED's activities are small in comparison to \nBeijing's power to suppress. That is true. But my view is that it is \nalways better to light a candle than curse the darkness, and the NED \nhas been providing light and support to democrats in China, throughout \nAsia, and all around the world.\n  Indonesia just had its first free and open elections in over 40 \nyears. Indonesia is the fourth most populous nation in the world after \nChina, India and the United States.\n  As a result of this election, a country that has historically had \ngood relations with us, a country that remains of great geostrategic \nimportance, is now set to become the world's third largest democracy. \nIndonesia is a country with which we've had shared interests; those \ninterests are now advanced because we now have shared political values. \nThe ruling and opposition parties consulted with the NED throughout the \nperiod leading to these historic elections.\n  I could go on and on about NED's activities promoting democracy \naround the world. I will simply add one more example: Three weeks ago a \nremarkable conference on emerging democracies was held in Yemen. Yemen, \nmy colleagues will recall, was divided until 1990--South Yemen was one \nof the most radical countries in the Arab world.\n  Since reunification in 1990, the NED has worked through its core \ninstitutes, the International Republican Institute and the National \nDemocratic Institute, to support that country's transition to \ndemocracy. Yemen has had two parliamentary elections and is today one \nof the few Arab nations that has universal suffrage.\n  The government of Yemen deserves the credit for this remarkable \npolitical evolution and deserves the support of the United States. But \nwe should be proud, very proud, of the efforts that the NED has \nexpounded in assisting this political reform. And, three weeks ago, \nwhen representatives from around the world convened in Yemen to see \nthat this nation of 18 million can enhance its culture and empower its \npeople through democracy, it was appropriate that they saw the NED as a \nsupporter of democracy there, and everywhere.\n  In recognition of these and other activities, brave democracy \nproponents around the world--individuals that Congress regularly lauds, \nthat we regularly bring to the Hill for their perspectives on their \nparts of the world--these individuals have spoken of the need to \npreserve the NED.\n  Hong Kong's Martin Lee, Chinese human rights activist Harry Wu, \nVietnamese human rights activist Vo Van Ai, his Eminence the Dalai Lama \nhave all declared the fundamental and irreplaceable importance of the \nNED in trying to advance democratic values in China, in Asia, around \nthe world.\n  I urge my colleagues to think of these individuals as they determine \nwhether the Senate should continue to support funding for the National \nEndowment for Democracy.\n  In every region of the world where the U.S. has interests or is \nchallenged--in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq--there are people striving and \nrisking their lives for democratic expression. They see the United \nStates as a role model.\n  The NED is actively working with all of these people, and in doing \nso, demonstrates America's--and Congress's--commitment to their causes. \nI urge my colleagues to continue their support for this important \ninstitution.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 21, 1999]\n\n                      A Vote for Democracy Abroad\n\n       In most repressive countries today, civic activists such as \n     election monitors, labor organizers, independent journalists \n     and human rights groups look to Washington for support. But \n     the Senate may vote any day to end one of their most \n     important lifelines. Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, \n     has persuaded the Appropriations Committee to recommend that \n     the National Endowment for Democracy's funding drop from $31 \n     million to zero. The Senate should defy him and vote to \n     preserve an organization whose mission is more vital than \n     ever.\n       The endowment finances four international affairs \n     institutes, run by the Republican and Democratic parties, the \n     Chamber of Commerce and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. The endowment also \n     gives money directly to organizations abroad that promote the \n     rule of law and democracy. One of its strengths is that its \n     budget is independent of the State Department.\n       It is hard to think of a dictatorship whose opponents have \n     not benefited from the endowment. Among hundreds of other \n     projects, it has provided money and advice for village \n     elections and exposure of prison labor camps in China, human \n     rights groups in Sudan, independent broadcasting in Serbia, \n     families of political prisoners in Cuba and the underground \n     labor movement in Myanmar. Augusto Pinochet might still be \n     ruling Chile if the National Democratic Institute had not \n     helped the opposition set up a parallel vote count during the \n     1988 plebiscite on his rule, which caught Mr. Pinochet's \n     attempt to rig the outcome. The endowment has earned the \n     right to remain healthy and independent.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 21, 1999]\n\n                    Don't Take Democracy for Granted\n\n                  (By Jimmy Carter and Paul Wolfowitz)\n\n       Last month Indonesia held its first free elections in more \n     than 40 years. The balloting was overseen by a wide array of \n     international observers, including an American delegation \n     organized by the National Democratic Institute and the \n     International Republican Institute. Their efforts have laid \n     the groundwork for Indonesia to become the\n\n[[Page S9009]]\n\n     world's third-largest democracy (after India and the U.S.) \n     and a beacon of freedom for Asians and Muslims everywhere.\n       This is only the latest good work done by the two groups, \n     loosely affiliated with the major U.S. political parties, \n     which monitored an election in Nigeria earlier this year. \n     Both groups are funded by a modest grant ($4 million each) \n     provided by the National Endowment for Democracy.\n       Fifteen years ago President Reagan and Congress established \n     the NED to spearhead America's nongovernmental efforts at \n     assisting democratic movements around the world. The NED, \n     which today has a budget of just $31 million, has been one of \n     the most cost-effective investments our country has made to \n     foster peace and democracy.\n       But last month a Senate subcommittee voted to discontinue \n     funding for this vital program. The senators said they expect \n     the State Department to fund the NED out of foreign-aid \n     spending. This is an unlikely prospect, because the State \n     Department hasn't made any provisions for the endowment.\n       Even if it did, that would undermine the NED's \n     independence. The creation of the NED in the 1980s reflected \n     a bipartisan belief that the promotion of freedom is an \n     enduring American interest and that nongovernmental \n     representatives would best be able to help their counterparts \n     build democracy in other countries.\n       Today the full Senate is expected to consider an amendment \n     sponsored by Sen. Richard Lugar (R., Ind.) to restore funding \n     for the NED. It would be a tragic mistake if we took for \n     granted the current democratic trend in world affairs and \n     decided to reduce our support for these efforts.\n       Like Indonesia, many important countries that have \n     conducted elections--among them Russia, Mexico and Nigeria--\n     need the support of free nations in order to consolidate \n     democratic gains. We must also help movements in Asia and the \n     Middle East striving peacefully to democratize authoritarian \n     countries. And we need to encourage free and fair elections \n     as part of the reconstruction effort in the Balkans. \n     Defunding the NED would undermine this important mission.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 25, 1999]\n\n                          Exporting Democracy\n\n       The National Endowment for Democracy is one of the less \n     known but, in the foreign policy universe, one of the more \n     appreciated aspects of the Ronald Reagan legacy. \n     Congressionally funded but largely independent in its \n     operations, it mainly gives grants to the two political \n     parties and leading business and labor groups to spread the \n     word of civil societies, party development and election \n     procedures, and democratic and human rights advocacy. \n     Recognized abroad, it is scrutinized closely at home, which \n     is fine but a bit unnerving to its supporters all the same.\n       This week, for instance, Sen. Russell Feingold (D-Wis), in \n     an authorization bill, sought to strip the endowment of its \n     favor for and reliance on the four ``core'' groups and to put \n     the whole of the institution's $30 million budget up for \n     competitive political bidding. It sounded like a reasonable, \n     even democratic proposal, but three-quarters of the Senate \n     wisely accepted the response that the endowment, with its \n     support for the two parties and the AFL-CIO and Chamber of \n     Commerce, already builds in a wholesome set of checks and \n     balances true to the spirit of American democracy.\n       A lingering difficulty arises from Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH). \n     Making use of the deference enjoyed by Appropriations \n     subcommittee chairmen, he has held up all funds sought for \n     the endowment. He would prefer that the administration take \n     the money out of the State Department, which, he points out, \n     funds democracy promotion under its own budget.\n       Mr. Gregg is right that the Cold War is over. But \n     considerations of strategy as well as sentiment require that \n     the effort to sustain fledging democratic societies and \n     initiatives ought to be a permanent part of American policy. \n     To tuck the endowment into the State Department, moreover, \n     would deprive it of precisely the independence wherein its \n     chief value lies. Can you imagine, for instance, the \n     ``engagement''-minded State Department sponsoring Chinese \n     nongovernmental organizations?\n       In sum, the endowment is an experiment to exporting \n     democracy that has been working openly, for 15 years. It has \n     been tested in heavy political weather, some of it churned up \n     by its own early misuses. There is reason to believe the \n     Senate would support the appropriation if Sen. Gregg were to \n     let it register its judgment. That would be the democratic \n     thing for him to do.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 24, 1999]\n\n                            Let the NED Live\n\n       At a time when the United States and its allies are engaged \n     in what could be a prolonged war of words with Serbian leader \n     Slabodan Milosevic, it is nothing less than astounding that \n     the U.S. Senate should see fit to zero out funding for one of \n     the most important tools in the nation's ideological arsenal, \n     the National Endowment for Democracy. Mr. Milosevic may have \n     acknowledged military defeat, but he still clings to power \n     with the tenacity of a badger. A major problem in removing \n     Mr. Milosevic is the regrettable fact that he was in fact \n     democratically elected by the Serbs, who therefore also carry \n     responsibility for what happened to them. It will take some \n     effort to persuade them to remove their leader again by \n     democratic means.\n       This is where the National Endowment for Democracy comes \n     in, and also the other U.S. services and international \n     broadcasters devoted to spreading free and unfettered \n     information and building democratic institutions. To dwell on \n     Serbia for a moment, the state television channel is run by \n     none other than Mr. Milosevic's daughter, a filial \n     relationship replayed throughout the states of the former \n     Soviet Union, where assorted family members routinely are \n     placed in charge of the post-communist ``free'' media.\n       If we are concerned about spreading democracy, and we \n     should be, institutions like the National Endowment for \n     Democracy remains vital. What is also vital is that the NED \n     be kept at arm's length from State Department interference, \n     that it not be seen as simply a tool of American foreign \n     policy, but an institution whose basic mission remains fixed.\n       This year, the Clinton administration has requested $32 \n     million in funding for the NED for fiscal year 2000, hardly \n     an exorbitant sum given that the NED has programs in 80 \n     countries around the world. Though there is broad bipartisan \n     support in the Senate for the NED, its funding has been \n     zeroed out by the Appropriations subcommittee on Commerce, \n     Justice, State, chaired by Sen. Judd Gregg. It has been \n     suggested that funding ought to come out of the State \n     Department's democracy fund, a bad idea both in principle and \n     in practice--seeing that no such funding has been allocated. \n     Last time the NED survived a frontal assault, it was two \n     years ago when funding was restored on the Senate floor with \n     overwhelming support. Another line of assault was blocked by \n     the Senate yesterday by a 76-23 vote, as Sen. Russ Feingold \n     tried to introduce an amendment to micromanage NED grants \n     through State.\n       One might get the idea that the U.S. Senate does not \n     consider the promotion of democracy a worthy cause in and of \n     itself. No, it does not produce instant results, but the \n     world's greatest democracy should be in this for the long \n     haul.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered 1291.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment that I offer, with the \nsupport of Senator Murray, is an amendment which is really based upon a \npiece of legislation we have introduced titled ``Children Who Witness \nDomestic Violence Protection Act.''\n  We have come to the floor, Democrats and Republicans alike, and we \nhave talked about the destructive effect of some of the violence that \nchildren see on television or children see at\n\n[[Page S9010]]\n\nthe movies. Unfortunately, an awful lot of children see the most \ngraphic violence in their homes, and they are affected by it.\n  It depends upon, really, whose study you put the most emphasis on, \nbut somewhere between 3 million and 5 million children in our country \nall too often are essentially victims of violence in their homes. In \nabout 50 percent of the cases, when a man batters a woman, the children \nare also battered. Just imagine, colleagues, what it would be like over \nand over and over again to see your mother beaten up, battered. Just \nthink of the effect it would have on you.\n  Actually, this is an area in which I have tried to do a lot of work. \nI would say my wife Sheila has really been my teacher. She knows more \nthan I do, and her education comes from what lots of people around the \ncountry who have worked in this area for a very long time have taught \nher.\n  But one of the missing pieces, which in no way, shape, or form takes \naway the emphasis on the effect of this violence on women--sometimes \nmen; most all the time women--one of the missing pieces has been the \neffect of this violence in homes on the children. Let me give you some \nexamples.\n  Julie is a 4-year-old girl. She was the only witness to her divorced \nmother's fatal stabbing. Several months earlier, at the time of the \ndivorce, Julie's father had publicly threatened to kill his ex-wife. \nAlthough the father lacked an alibi for the night of the crime, there \nwas no physical evidence linking him to the homicide.\n  In describing the event, Julie consistently placed her father at the \nscene and recounted her father's efforts to clean up prior to leaving. \nOnly after the district attorney saw Julie stabbing a pillow, crying, \n``Daddy pushed mommy down,'' did he become convinced that the father, \nindeed, was the murderer.\n  This is from the work of Jeff Edelson, who actually is a Minnesotan \nand does some of the most important work in the country. There is no \nmore graphic example of: What do you think the effect on the child is \nfrom seeing this?\n\n  Dr. Okin and Alicia Lieberman at San Francisco General Hospital are \ncurrently treating a 6-year-old boy who observed his father fatally \nsever his mother's neck. At the beginning of the treatment, he was \nunable to speak.\n  Jason, who did not visually witness his parents fighting, described \nhearing fights this way: ``I really thought somebody got hurt. It \nsounded like it. And I almost started to cry. It felt really, I was \nthinking of calling, calling the cops or something because it was \nreally getting, really big banging and stuff like that.''\n  These are voices of children in the country.\n  A lot of the work for this amendment comes from some people who have \ndone very distinguished work in this country.\n  Betsy McAlster Groves at Boston Hospital is treating a 3-year-old \ngirl, Sarah, who was brought in by her maternal grandmother. Sarah was \nhaving nightmares and was clinging and anxious during the day. Her \nmother had been fatally shot while Sarah was in the same room in their \nhome.\n  A home is supposed to be a safe place for our children.\n  Betsy is also treating two boys, ages 5 and 7, whose mother brought \nthem in after they witnessed their father's assault on her. The father \nwas arrested over the weekend and was in jail. The mother was unable to \ntell the sons the truth, instead claiming that their father had taken a \ntrip to Virginia.\n  What I am saying to you is that these children do not need to turn on \nthe evening news. They do not need to see the violence in the movies or \non television. It occurs right in their own homes.\n  What I am also saying is that this has a very destructive effect on \nmany children, a profound effect, placing them at high risk for \nanxiety, depression, and, potentially, suicide. Furthermore, these \nchildren themselves may become more violent as they become older. \nExposure to family violence, a good number of the experts in the \ncountry suggest, is the strongest predictor of violent, delinquent \nbehavior among adolescents. It is estimated somewhere between 20 and 40 \npercent of chronically violent adolescents have witnessed extreme \nparental conflict.\n  It is an important point. When you talk to your judges, and they talk \nabout some of the kids they are dealing with, they will tell you that \nin a very high percentage of the cases these children have come from \nhomes where either they themselves have been beaten up or battered or \nthey have seen it, they have witnessed it. Usually it is their mother \nthey have seen beaten up.\n  Let me tell you about Tony and Sara from Minnesota. Tony is 10 years \nold and his sister Sara is 8. Tony and Sara were severely traumatized \nafter seeing their father brutally attack their mother. They were \nforced to watch their father drag their mother out to the driveway, \ndouse her with gasoline, and hold a flaming match inches from her.\n  Tony and Sara are not the only children in our country who are \nterrified by violence that they see on almost a daily basis.\n  This amendment, which is based upon work with Senator Murray, is a \ncomprehensive first step toward confronting the impact of domestic \nviolence on children. I just want to summarize it because it is my hope \nthat there will be strong support for this on both sides of the aisle.\n  First of all, what we want to do, based upon, again, work we have \nseen in Minnesota, we have seen in Boston, we have seen in San \nFrancisco, seen around the country, is we want to make sure we develop \npartnerships between the courts and the schools, the health care \nproviders, the child protective services, and the battered women's \nprograms.\n  When communities apply for funding, the first thing we are going to \nsay is, yes, make this happen at the community level, but do not have \ndifferent agencies with different mandates. You guys have to show us \nthat you are focusing on these children and you are getting the support \nservices to these children.\n  I say to my colleague from South Carolina, I have talked to many \neducators. They say one of the problems they have is that quite often \nthey may have a child in school who is not doing well and they do not \nknow what is going on with that child. And what they find out--and this \nis the second part of this amendment, training for school officials \nabout domestic violence and its impact on children, making sure they \nhave the training and the support services for the teachers and the \ncounselors--many times these kids haven't slept at night. Many times \nthese kids come to school terrified. Many times these kids act out \nthemselves. Many times these kids are in trouble, and many times we \ndon't know what is going on in their lives.\n  We have finally started to focus on this violence in homes, too much \nof it directed toward women. But if you talk to people around the \ncountry who are down in the trenches doing the best work, from the \nacademics to the community activists, they will tell you the missing \npiece is we have not focused enough on the effects on the children. \nThat is what this amendment does.\n  The third piece of this amendment addresses domestic violence and the \npeople who work to protect our children from abuse and neglect. There \nis a significant overlap, obviously, between domestic violence and \nchild abuse. In families where one form of family violence exists, \nthere is a likelihood that the other does. In about 50 percent of the \ncases, if the mother is being battered, the child is being battered. So \nthe problem is these child protective services and domestic violence \norganizations set up their own separate programs, yet few of them work \ntogether to see what is happening within families.\n  This amendment creates incentives for local governments to \ncollaborate with domestic violence agencies in administering their \nchild welfare programs. The funds will be awarded to States and local \ngovernments to work collaboratively with community-based domestic \nviolence programs to provide training, to do screening, to assist child \nwelfare service agencies in recognizing the overlap between domestic \nviolence and child abuse, to develop protocols for screening, intake, \nassessment and investigation, and to increase the safety and well-being \nof the child witnesses of domestic violence.\n  I could go on for hours about this because, honest to God, it is a \nhuge issue in our country. I wish it wasn't.\n\n[[Page S9011]]\n\n  The second piece of this--and I will be through in 5 minutes--is \nsupervised visitation centers. I have to explain this. Part of the \nproblem is, even if you have a woman who has said: I am getting out of \nthis home, or I am getting my husband out of this home; he is a \nbatterer, and she finally is able to do it--it is not easy--and you \nhave small children, the other parent, the noncustodial parent, usually \nthe man, wants to see the children and should be able to under most \ncircumstances. The problem is, at the time in which he comes to the \nhome to pick up the children or drop the children off, the violence can \noccur again. There is no safety there. Or the problem is in some cases \nyou are worried about what the father will do to the children. But a \njudge doesn't want to say: You can never see your children. And \nsometimes, as a result of that, the children are in real jeopardy. So \nthe second part of this authorizes funding for supervised visitation \ncenters.\n  These are visitation centers where there can be a safe exchange.\n  At the risk of being melodramatic, let me dedicate this amendment to \n5-year-old Brandon and 4-year-old Alex, who were murdered by their \nfather during an unsupervised visit in Minnesota. They were beautiful \nchildren. Their mother Angela was separated from Kurt Frank, the \nchildren's father. During her marriage, Angela was physically and \nemotionally abused by Frank, and Frank had hit Brandon and split open \nhis lip when once he had stepped between the father and the mother to \nprotect the mother. She had an order of protection--Shiela and I both \nknow Angela; she is very courageous--against Kurt Frank, but during the \ncustody hearings, her request for the husband to only receive \nsupervised visits was rejected. Kurt Frank murdered his two sons, these \ntwo children, during an unsupervised visit, and then he killed himself.\n\n  Honest to God, when there is some question about the safety of these \nchildren, we can do better. These safe visitation centers work. It \nmakes all the sense in the world. These children's lives could have \nbeen saved. The father could have seen them, but it would have been \nunder some supervision. That is the second part.\n  Third, the amendment recognizes the importance of police officers. \nThis amendment comes from input from the law enforcement community \naround the country. What they are saying is: Quite often we are the \nones who find the traumatized children behind the doors, beneath the \nfurniture, in the closets, when we go to the homes. We want to know \nwhat we can do for these children. We would like to have the training. \nThat is what this amendment provides for.\n  Then, finally, for crisis nurseries, it is important. A family is in \ncrisis. The mother has two children dealing with an abusive \nrelationship, trying to end the relationship. There is lots of tension \nin the home. There is the potential for violence. She wants to be able \nto take her child somewhere or her two children somewhere where they \ncan be safe for one night or 2 days or 3 days. That is what these \ncrisis nurseries do. They work well.\n  We have talked about the violence in the media. We have talked about \nthe violence in the video games. But we rarely have dealt with the \nmillions of children each year who are witnessing real-life violence in \ntheir homes. I believe we have to figure out ways to get the funding to \nthe communities that will provide the support.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate and the Nation are fortunate, \nindeed, to have the Senator from Minnesota. He continues to redirect \nour attention to the life and death struggles that families go through \nevery single day. Oftentimes he is a lonely voice on the Senate floor, \nbut he is a person of principle and value. If it meets with his \npermission, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to this \nimportant amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Minnesota a question. I listened \ncarefully to his presentation and asked for a copy of the amendment to \nread it more closely.\n  One of the things I have found in working with law enforcement \nofficials--I think the Senator from Minnesota has highlighted it--is \nthey come upon a scene where a violent crime, maybe a very serious \nviolent crime has been committed, and among all of their concerns, \npreserving evidence, making certain, if possible, to save any victim \nwho might be battered or injured, there is that tiny little person who \nhas just witnessed this scene.\n  When I spoke to the International Association of Chiefs of Police, \none of the things which we discussed was to put on each investigative \nreport from a violent crime a section that would indicate that the \npolice know that minor children witnessed the violent crime and perhaps \na method, then, of providing confidential information to counselors or \nsocial workers who would know. Then there is a heads-up, there is a red \nflag, that there has been a child involved. That child may be so young \nas to be overlooked as part of the investigation report, and they have \nsuggested--and I think it is valuable, and perhaps at some point we can \nmake it part of this effort--that law enforcement officials would be \nlooking for this because, as the Senator from Minnesota has so \neloquently given to the Senate today in his presentation, these kids \nwitnessing violence can have their lives changed dramatically. An \nintervention at that point could not only make things better for them \nbut could ultimately save their lives.\n  I ask the Senator from Minnesota if he would be kind enough to \nconsider that either as a suggestion as part of this legislation or in \nseparate correspondence with those who would administer the programs he \nhas suggested.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder if we could do a modification \nright now--I will work it up in the next couple of minutes--where, as \nSenator Durbin is saying, the police would automatically check off the \nobservation that a child or the children are at home as a part of the \nform. Then, again, if you had it at the community level, that is where \nthis has to happen--the real interface and cooperation with school \nofficials, with child protective services, with health care, with law \nenforcement, with counselors in the school--the focus would be on the \nchild. These children are falling between the cracks.\n  Mr. President, that would be an excellent idea. I will try to maybe \nwork on a modification. I am sure my colleagues will allow me to do a \ntechnical correction later.\n  Altogether, this is an authorization for an appropriation, but it is \nauthorization for $153 million a year for 3 years, which I think is not \nmuch to spend for what we can do. Later on, I know this gets resolved \nin the appropriations battle. I ask my colleagues whether they have a \nresponse. I can talk about this in more detail. I can go through the \nbudget. I can talk about each specific program. But if you want to move \nalong and you think this is something you can support, I would be very \nproud. I think it would be important.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator from Minnesota will yield, this is a fairly \nextensive piece of legislation. It may take us a little while to take a \nlook at it. I suggest we lay it aside for a moment and move on to \nwhatever comes next and then come back to it, if the Senator doesn't \nmind.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague I am pleased to \ndo that. That will give us a chance to add the suggestion of Senator \nDurbin, and if we need to debate later on, I can give lots of examples \nand debate the need for this. If my colleagues support it, that will be \ngreat. Let's wait and see what you think. We will temporarily lay this \namendment aside.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1292\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify that nothing in the Act shall be construed to \n  prevent the use of funds to recover Federal tobacco-related health \n                 costs from responsible third parties)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S9012]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Reed, Mr. \n     Wellstone, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Feingold, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1292.\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . AUTHORITY TO RECOVER TOBACCO-RELATED COSTS.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit the \n     Department of Justice from expending amounts made available \n     under this title for tobacco-related litigation or for the \n     payment of expert witnesses called to provide testimony in \n     such litigation.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Durbin, and others, as a means of raising our strong \nobjection to a provision that appeared in the report accompanying the \nSenate Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. That provision was \non two pages.\n  On page 15 of the report, the last sentence in the first paragraph \nreads:\n\n       No funds are provided for tobacco litigation or the Joint \n     Center for Strategic Environmental Enforcement.\n\n  Then on page 25, in the lower half of the page, this sentence \nappears:\n\n       No funds are provided for expert witnesses called to \n     provide testimony in tobacco litigation.\n\n  My objection is that those two sentences have with them a clear \ninference that it is the policy of the Senate that the Department of \nJustice, in a rare instance, should be denied the investigative and \nprosecutorial discretion to determine whether it is in the interest of \nthe United States and its people for the Federal Government to bring \nlitigation against the tobacco industry and pursue that litigation in \nan effective manner.\n  Even more troubling is the sweeping nature of this language, which I \nbelieve could be reasonably interpreted to amount to a grant of \nimmunity to the tobacco industry from Federal prosecution.\n  Further, if the Senate fails to strike this offending report language \nwhich grants immunity to the tobacco industry, we will be reversing the \nintent of a sense-of-the-Senate amendment we adopted less than 4 months \nago by a unanimous vote, on March 25. The Senate clearly articulated \nnot only that it was supportive of the Federal litigation but \ndetermined that the use of settlement dollars should be primarily to \nadd to the strength of the Medicare trust fund on the basis that it is \nthe Medicare trust fund that has been primarily affected by these \nexcessive health care costs. I will discuss that in a moment.\n  While preparing a litigation strategy and while allowing the \nDepartment of Justice to exercise its traditional range of discretion, \nit is by no means a guarantee of success. Denying funds to the \nDepartment of Justice, tying their hands at the outset, precluding them \nfrom the ability to hire expert witnesses will only assure the failure \nof this important legal initiative.\n  We all know the tobacco industry is responsible for tens of billions \nof dollars of tobacco-related illnesses that the Federal Government \nspends to care for and treat individuals with lung cancer, emphysema, \nheart disease, and every other illness associated with tobacco use.\n  The most recent estimate for the costs incurred by the Federal \nGovernment for the treatment of tobacco-related illnesses totals $22.2 \nbillion each year. This includes Medicare, $14.1 billion; Veterans' \nAdministration, $4 billion; Federal Employees Health Benefit Program, \n$2.2 billion; Department of Defense, $1.6 billion; Indian Health \nServices, $300 million.\n  Put simply, a vote that retains this restrictive report language \nwould, in essence, grant the tobacco industry immunity against Federal \nlitigation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of an editorial from the \nWashington Post be printed in the Record immediately after my remarks.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Post editorial describes the stark implications of \nrejecting the amendment. The Post states:\n\n       It would be an amnesty for decades of misconduct and a \n     retroactive taxpayer subsidy for that misconduct as well.\n\n  My second main objection to this language is that on May 20 of this \nyear, the Congress, through a conference committee on the emergency \nsupplemental bill, enacted a provision that denied the Federal \nGovernment access to some $250 billion which the States have secured \nthrough their tobacco settlement.\n  The original amendment, which was introduced by Senator Hutchison of \nTexas and myself, as well as Senator Bayh, Senator Voinovich, and other \nMembers of the Senate, passed this Senate by a vote of 71-29. This body \ncould not have spoken with more clarity: Uncle Sam, keep your hands off \nthe States' money.\n  But in taking that vote, while we said to the Federal Government, \n``Hands off,'' I and many of my colleagues, including Senator Hollings \nand others, had argued that if the Federal Government wants its own \nmoney, then it should sue the tobacco industry for the recovery of \nfunds spent for the treatment of tobacco-related illnesses in Federal \nprograms, such as Medicare. If that sentiment was true just a few weeks \nago, it is certainly true today.\n  My third objection is that this report language would be an \nabdication of our Federal responsibility to deny the Justice Department \nits most fundamental responsibility. What is that responsibility? It is \nthe responsibility to locate and to investigate areas where \nindividuals, organizations, entire industries, may in fact be liable \nand responsible for harming the people of the United States of America.\n  Evidence uncovered by the States in their successful legal efforts \nagainst the tobacco industry clearly implicates the tobacco industry in \ntheir complicity to cover up evidence of addiction and illness related \nto the product they produce and market. To allow the tobacco industry \nto escape responsibility for these practices and to not investigate it \nfully to determine whether the Federal Government can recoup funds--\nfunds that come from the taxpayers of America, funds that have been \npaid out to treat tobacco-related illnesses--would be totally \nirresponsible and a surrender of our fiduciary responsibility to the \ntaxpayers.\n  Finally, there are some parties to this litigation who have no \nalternative but to have the Federal Government litigate on their \nbehalf.\n  In this instance, I am speaking about Native Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this letter be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 4 \nadditional minutes to conclude my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate must now \nreturn to the Gregg amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent for 4 minutes to complete my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the letter from the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians signed by its president, Mr. W. Ron Allen, states:\n\n       There are many Indian Nations, however, who do not possess \n     the resources to bring individual suits and will, therefore, \n     rely upon the DOJ to bring suit on their behalf.\n\n  I do not believe we should tolerate a situation in which a large \nnumber of our Native Americans are precluded from having their legal \nrights represented.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to strike the offending report language. \nI urge my colleagues to allow the Justice Department to do its job, and \nto use its best professional judgment on how to proceed with its legal \nstrategy against the tobacco industry.\n  Rather than giving the Marlboro Man and rather than giving Joe Camel \nanother victim, let us vote to hold the tobacco companies accountable \nby the simple action of allowing the Department of Justice to do its \nresponsible job as the Nation's investigator and litigator.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Leadership Council of \nAging Organizations, which represents organizations such as the AARP, \nthe Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Families USA, \nNational Senior Citizens Law Center, National Council on the Aging, the \nNational Council of Senior Citizens, and many\n\n[[Page S9013]]\n\nother organizations representing older Americans which also support \nthis language--support it particularly because they recognize the \npossibility of strengthening the Medicare program through funds derived \nfrom a successful prosecution of this litigation--be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Leadership Council of Aging Organizations\n\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned members of the Leadership \n     Council of Aging Organizations (LCAO) are writing because we \n     are concerned about the Department of Justice (DOJ) \n     appropriations bill (S. 1217) that will soon be taken up on \n     the Senate floor. As you know, DOJ intends to sue the \n     nation's tobacco companies to recover the billions of dollars \n     Medicare, VA and other federal health care programs have \n     spent on health care costs caused by tobacco use.\n       We have learned that the DOJ appropriations bill not only \n     denies requested funding for this important, effort, but also \n     includes language that may actually block the lawsuit. The \n     states took action to hold the industry accountable for the \n     related costs imposed on their state health programs. Given \n     the success of the state suits, the federal government has an \n     obligation to undertake similar action to protect Medicare \n     and other federal health programs. We cannot understand why a \n     successful course of action that was appropriate for 50 \n     states and resulted in tobacco payments of over $240 billion \n     could be considered inappropriate for the federal government \n     to pursue. In addition, blocking the lawsuit would violate an \n     agreement reached in the Budget Resolution.\n       The costs to Medicare and other federal health programs due \n     to tobacco are even greater than costs imposed on state \n     programs. Tobacco-caused health care costs in the United \n     States exceed $70 billion each year and the federal \n     government pays a large portion of those costs, including \n     over $14 billion per year on tobacco-caused Medicare \n     expenditures. Given this drain on Medicare and other federal \n     health programs, the Senate should support the DOJ's efforts \n     to recover these funds.\n       We expect Senator Bob Graham and others to offer an \n     amendment when S. 1217 is considered on the floor to clarify \n     that DOJ should be permitted to move forward with litigation \n     against the tobacco industry. We urge you to support the \n     Graham amendment.\n       At a time when Congress is wrestling with how to strengthen \n     and preserve the future of Medicare and prepare it for the \n     retirement of the baby boom generation, Congress should take \n     every opportunity to protect this essential program. \n     Defending Medicare is more important than defending tobacco \n     companies.\n\n                               Exhibit I,\n\n                       A New Kind of Tobacco Tax\n\n       As it now stands, the Senate version of the Justice \n     Department's appropriation would restrict the department's \n     authority to file suit against the tobacco companies. Unless \n     the matter is resolved in last-minute negotiations, an \n     amendment to fix this problem will be put forward on the \n     Senate floor by Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) when the bill is \n     taken up. Whether by amendment or negotiation, the current \n     restriction has to go.\n       The department contends that the tobacco industry has \n     engaged in intentional wrongdoing over the past 50 years in \n     order to cover up the addictive qualities of its product. \n     Industry misconduct, the argument goes, has resulted in huge \n     federal health care bills. Normally, when a company \n     fraudulently exacts such a toll on the taxpayer, the Justice \n     Department seeks to recover some of that money. And that is \n     what the department plans. It has asked Congress for $20 \n     million for a planned suit. But the Senate appropriations \n     subcommittee chairman, Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), seems to have \n     other ideas. He inserted language into a committee report \n     specifying that no money may be used for such a suit. The \n     language would at least complicate the Justice Department's \n     efforts, and it could be read to forbid a federal suit \n     altogether.\n       The decision on whom to sue is a quintessentially executive \n     branch power in which Congress has no legitimate role. If \n     senators want to protect the tobacco industry's ill-gotten \n     gains, they are free to change the laws under which Janet \n     Reno is contemplating action. But it is the attorney \n     general's job to decide whose violations of the law merit \n     federal action. Moreover, when the attorney general plans a \n     civil action against companies she claims have bilked the \n     taxpayers of billions of dollars, it is not the place of any \n     senator to seek to prevent the recovery of money that, in the \n     judgment of the executive branch, lawfully belongs to the \n     American people.\n       The amendment would not give the department the $20 million \n     it has requested, but it would clarify that other money can \n     be used for the suit. There can be no misunderstanding a vote \n     to reject such a change. It would be an amnesty for decades \n     of misconduct and a retroactive taxpayer subsidy for that \n     misconduct as well.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                 National Congress\n\n\n                                          of American Indians,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 1999.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: The National Congress of American \n     Indians (NCAI), the oldest and largest Indian advocacy \n     organization is pleased to support your amendment to strike \n     language in the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill \n     (S. 1217) that would deny federal funds to be expended by the \n     Department of Justice (DOJ) for Tobacco litigation, including \n     expenses related to expert witnesses.\n       Indian Nations have been affected profoundly by the tobacco \n     industry. To that end, NCAI acknowledges and respects the \n     rights of Indian Nations to file individual suits against the \n     tobacco industry to recover for tobacco related illnesses and \n     believes that Indian Nations should be the beneficiaries of \n     any funds recovered. There are many Indian Nations however, \n     who do not possess the resources to bring individual suits \n     and will therefore, rely upon the DOJ to bring suit on their \n     behalf. NCAI would not want to foreclose that option to \n     Indian Nations. Moreover, there are many unanswered questions \n     regarding any suits that may be filed by the DOJ on behalf of \n     Indian Nations. Until more questions have been answered, NCAI \n     cannot support any language that would foreclose any options \n     to Indian Nations.\n       Senator Graham, NCAI believes your floor amendment to \n     strike said appropriation language will benefit a number of \n     Indian Nations throughout Indian Country and we thank you for \n     your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          W.

Mr. President, I understand we are back on the pending \nunderlying Gregg amendment, and that the Senator from South Carolina \nhas time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator is correct. The \nregular order now is the Gregg amendment with 10 minutes on each side.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1292, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask that the amendment I had offered \nrelative to prohibition on tobacco litigation be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to address a question to the chairman of the \nSubcommittee, the Senator from New Hampshire, regarding funding for the \nCivil Division of the Justice Department.\n  In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton announced that \nthe Federal Government intended to sue the nation's tobacco companies \nto recover billions of dollars in smoking-related health care costs \nreimbursed by federal health care programs. The administration's FY \n2000 budget requested $15 million in new resources for the Civil \nDivision of the Justice Department and $5 million for the Fees and \nExpenses of Witnesses account support this litigation effort.\n  Unfortunately, we were unable to provide the additional resources \nrequested by the administration for the\n\n[[Page S9014]]\n\nCivil Division to carry out this task. While I regret that the \ncommittee was unable to provide the new funds, it is my understanding \nthat if the Justice Department deems this activity to be a high \npriority, base funding, including funds from the Fees and Expenses of \nWitnesses account, can be used for this purpose.\n  I ask the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee if my \nunderstanding of the bill and the report language is correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree with the Senator from Iowa. While the committee \nwas unable to provide new funding as the administration requested, \nnothing in the bill or the report language prohibits the Department \nfrom using generally appropriated funds, including funds from the Fees \nand Expenses of Witnesses Account, to pursue this litigation if the \nDepartment concludes such litigation has merit under existing law.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I also agree with Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. GRAHAM: I would like to address the chairman of the subcommittee. \nDoes the chairman also agree to strike the language or page 15 and or \npage 25 of Senate Report 106-76 relating to funding for tobacco \nlitigation.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague and cosponsor of the \namendment, the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida, and also \nSenator Gregg, Senator Hollings, Senator Harkin, and others who have \nbeen party to the establishment of this colloquy. I think the Record is \neminently clear that the Department of Justice has the authority to \nmove forward on tobacco litigation without any limitation whatsoever \nfrom this legislation.\n  I am glad we achieved that and did it in a bipartisan fashion. I \nthank Senator Graham for his leadership. I was happy to join him on the \namendment and to be part of this colloquy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 111, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n       Sec. 620 (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) When telephone area codes were first introduced in \n     1947, 86 area codes covered all of North America. There are \n     now more than 215 area codes, and an additional 70 area codes \n     may be required in the next 2 years.\n       (2) The current system for allocating numbers to \n     telecommunications carriers is woefully inefficient, leading \n     to the exhaustion of a telephone area code long before all \n     the telephone numbers covered by the area code are actually \n     in use.\n       (3) The proliferation of new telephone area codes causes \n     economic dislocation for businesses and unnecessary cost, \n     confusion, and inconvenience for households.\n       (4) Principles and approaches exist that would increase the \n     efficiency with which telecommunications carriers use \n     telephone numbering resources.\n       (5) The May 27, l999, rulemaking proceeding of the Federal \n     Communications Commission\n\n[[Page S9015]]\n\n     relating to numbering resource optimization seeks to address \n     the growing problem of the exhaustion of telephone area \n     codes.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Federal Communications Commission shall release its \n     report and order on numbering resource optimization not later \n     than December 31, 1999;\n       (2) such report and order should minimize any disruptions \n     and costs to consumers and businesses associated with the \n     implementation of such report and order; and\n       (3) such report and order should apply not only to large \n     metropolitan areas but to all areas of the United States that \n     are facing the problem of exhaustion of telephone numbers.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment to address a growing problem in this country, and that \nis the needless proliferation of area codes.\n  As many of my colleagues have witnessed in their own States, new area \ncodes are being imposed upon consumers and businesses at a dizzying \npace. While the modern technology of faxes, cell phones, pagers, and \ncomputer modems has played a role in creating this problem, area code \nexhaustion stems largely from the woefully inefficient system for \nallocating numbers to local telephone companies. This leads to the \nexhaustion of an area code long before all of the telephone numbers \ncovered by that code actually have been used.\n  My own home State of Maine dramatically illustrates this problem. We \nhave a population in Maine of approximately 1.2 million people. Within \nour ``207'' area code, there are roughly 8 million usable numbers and \nsome 5.7 million of these numbers are still unused. Incredibly enough, \nhowever, Maine has been notified that it will be forced to add a new \narea code by the year 2001.\n  This paradigm of inefficiency in the midst of America's \ntelecommunications revolution might almost be amusing were it not for \nthe fact that it causes real hardships for many small businesses, \nparticularly small businesses in the tourism industry. Businesspeople \nthroughout my State, particularly in the coastal communities, have \ncontacted me to express their concern. I have heard from a gallery \nowner in Rockport, an innkeeper in Bar Harbor, and a schooner captain \nin Rockland, who have expressed to me their concern about the costs \ninvolved in updating brochures, business cards, and other promotional \nliterature, all of which will be necessitated by the creation of a new \narea code--the needless creation of a new area code. As one innkeeper \ntold me, it takes as long as 2 years to revise certain guidebooks, \nwhich are the principal means by which he communicates with potential \ncustomers.\n  Changing the area code could lead to a significant loss in business \nfor many small tourism businesses as well as unneeded expense for these \nsmall companies. Moreover, along with the economic costs, a new area \ncode creates tremendous disruption and confusion for consumers.\n  The Federal Communications Commission has initiated a rulemaking \nprocedure to address this growing problem. But since time is of the \nessence in ensuring that Maine and many other States not be forced to \nadd another unnecessary area code, my amendment requires that the FCC \nrelease its final report and order no later than March 31 of next year.\n  It also specifies that the order shall minimize costs and disruptions \nto consumers and businesses located in all areas of the country, not \njust in major cities. The FCC right now appears to be focusing mainly \non the larger markets and ignoring the implications for rural areas.\n  It is my understanding that this amendment is acceptable to the \ndistinguished chairman of the subcommittee as well as the distinguished \nranking minority member. I thank them very much for their cooperation \nand assistance in drafting this amendment, as well as for their \ncosponsorship of it.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMaine. It is very important. We agree with it. We appreciate her \nleadership on this.\n  Mr. GREGG. I also commend the Senator from Maine. This is a serious \nproblem, not only in Maine but across the border in New Hampshire where \nwe have the same concern about area codes. So I congratulate her on \nthis sense-of-the-Senate amendment and strongly support it. I believe \nwe can accept it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1296) was agreed to.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank both Senators for their cooperation and \nassistance in this matter.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, to introduce an amendment regarding the issue \nof area code conservation. The rapid proliferation of area codes is a \nproblem facing the citizens of New Jersey, as well as the rest of the \nnation.\n  The extraordinary growth of the telecommunications industry in recent \nyears has created a unique new problem. In just the last four years, \nthe number of area codes in the United States has increased almost 60 \npercent. Continued growth will require that even the newest area codes \nbe split and replaced again in the near future.\n  This problem has been particularly acute in New Jersey. Prior to \n1991, the state went almost thirty years without a new area code. But \nin the last eight years, four new area codes have been added in the \nstate and more are on the way.\n  While this is not the most pressing problem this country faces; it is \na serious one. The costs and inconvenience of introducing new area \ncodes are real. Small businesses must pay to reprint stationery, \nadvertising, and signs, and to inform customers of new numbers. \nCommunities throughout New Jersey, such as Willingboro, Medford, and \nMonroe, have faced the possibility of being split between two area \ncodes, requiring many residents to dial an area code just to call a \nneighbor across the street. These costs get even higher when new area \ncodes are introduced repeatedly in the same area after only a few \nyears, forcing residents and businesses to make the same adjustments \nall over again.\n  Many people blame the demand for new phone numbers as the sole cause \nof so many new area codes. But there is another cause. Each area code \nhas 7.9 million potential phone numbers. Today, less than half of the \npotential phone numbers in existing area codes are being used, leaving \na total of 1.3 billion unused phone numbers in the United States. The \nreal problem is that new area codes are being created before old ones \nare exhausted.\n  The inefficient use of available phone numbers is a product of the \noutdated system by which numbers are distributed within each area code. \nPhone numbers are allotted to telecommunications companies in blocks of \n10,000, regardless of whether those companies have the capacity to use \nevery number. Undoubtedly, this system made sense when there was only \none telephone company because it would, eventually, use every number \navailable.\n  But, as we all know, the new era of telecommunications competition \nhas introduced dozens of smaller companies. Today, there are over 100 \nsuch companies in New Jersey alone. Under the current allocation \nsystem, these companies still receive phone numbers in blocks of \n10,000. Even if a company does not use its full allocation, unused \nnumbers remain dormant while new area codes are being created.\n  This unnecessary nuisance can be alleviated relatively easily. All it \nrequires is a little planning and foresight. Given the enormous demand \nfor new phone numbers and the growth of smaller phone companies, we \nshould overhaul the system for allocating phone numbers. The Federal \nCommunication Commission is currently reviewing ways to do just that. \nBut, while their efforts are encouraging, the process may not work fast \nenough to prevent the next round of needless new area codes in New \nJersey.\n  The Amendment I have introduced with Senator Collins expresses the \nsense of the Senate that the Federal Communications Commission should \ncomplete its ongoing rulemaking regarding number resource optimization \nby March 31, 2000. This action will help ensure that the FCC rapidly \nimplements practical number conservation measures.\n  New area codes are inevitable as the population and electronic \ncommunications continue to grow. But there are\n\n[[Page S9016]]\n\nreasonable, practical ways to soften the impact of these changes. \nEnsuring that new area codes are implemented only when current ones \nhave been exhausted will save time, energy, and money for countless \nresidents and businesses, in New Jersey and around the country.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment to offer two amendments that will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1297\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself, Mr. \n     Kyl, and Mr. Abraham, proposes an amendment numbered 1297.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 19, line 23, after the colon, insert the following: \n     ``Provided further, That any Border Patrol agent classified \n     in a GS-1896 position who completes a 1-year period of \n     service at a GS-9 grade and whose current rating of record is \n     fully successful or higher shall be classified at a GS-11 \n     grade and receive pay at the minimum rate of basic pay for a \n     GS-11 position.''\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is an amendment which would \nmandate to the Immigration and Naturalization Service that Border \nPatrol agents who are in the field, who have experience, not be capped \nat a GS-9 pay level, as they currently are but go to a GS-11 level \nafter they pass the test that the INS, of course, would have in their \nrating system.\n  I appreciate very much Senator Gregg's and Senator Hollings' support \nfor the efforts to increase the number of Border Patrol agents. But the \nproblem is that recruitment has not been successful. One of the reasons \nthe recruitment has not been successful is that we have capped the pay \nof Border Patrol agents at a lower level than Customs agents who are \nworking side by side with our Border Patrol agents on the border. So it \nis no wonder people are going to Customs and DEA and other very good \nGovernment agencies and not coming to the Border Patrol.\n  This amendment will require that we go to the GS-11 level so that we \ncan recruit and retain our best people for the Border Patrol and we can \nget on about the business of making sure the borders of our country are \nsecure.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge that this amendment be accepted. Both sides \nof the aisle have looked at it. I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is acceptable on both sides, and we \nurge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1297) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina. This will do more than anything we can \npossibly do to increase the retention and the recruitment of Border \nPatrol agents.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1300\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Kyl, Senator Abraham, Senator Hatch, and \nSenator Leahy and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself, Mr. \n     Kyl, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1300.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 19, line 23, after the colon, insert the following: \n     ``Provided further, That the Commissioner shall within 90 \n     days develop a plan for coordinating and linking all relevant \n     Immigration and Naturalization on Service databases with \n     those of the Justice Department and other federal law \n     enforcement agencies, to determine criminal history, \n     fingerprint identification and record of prior deportation \n     and, upon the approval of the Committees on the Judiciary and \n     the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Subcommittees, \n     shall implement the plan within FY 2000:''\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is an amendment that is meant to \nclose a gaping loophole we found in INS's sharing of information that \nallowed the serial killer, Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, whose real name is \nAngel Maturino Resendiz, to get through our borders, even though he \nalready had a criminal record, because there was not enough \ncommunication in the identification system between the INS and the \nother Justice Department agencies. So we didn't catch this serial \nkiller.\n  This is an amendment I have worked on with Senators Kyl, Abraham, \nHatch, and Leahy that would require the Commissioner of the INS, within \n90 days, to develop a plan for coordinating and linking all relevant \nINS databases with those of the Justice Department and other Federal \nlaw enforcement agencies to determine the criminal history and the \nrecord of prior deportation and, upon the approval of the Judiciary \nCommittee and Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations Subcommittee, \nwill implement a plan by fiscal year 2000.\n  I am counting on the committees to come through on this because if we \ncan get the plan in 90 days, we need to implement a plan that will \nidentify criminal aliens in our country so when they try to enter \nagain, they will be stopped.\n  I ask that the amendment be accepted and that we move forward to try \nto close this loophole that allowed this serial killer to fall through \nthe cracks or slip through our fingers, however one wants to say it, \nand cause havoc in our country for about a month.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, was that a unanimous consent request?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It was.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1300) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, if it is in order, I will speak on the bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator from Texas wouldn't mind suspending, I \nbelieve the majority leader has some points he wishes to raise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am sorry. It would be fine if the Senator \nfrom Texas wanted to speak on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair. If there comes a time when the \nSenator from New Hampshire needs to break in, I will be happy to yield.\n  I rise in support of the bill that is before us. It has been a tough \nbill. It is more than $888 million less than the appropriations bill \nthat we enacted in last year, but it does provide sufficient resources. \nI believe Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings and their staffs have \nworked very hard to make sure we address the priorities for the \nCommerce, State, and Justice Departments and the very important issues \nwith which they are dealing.\n  I have passed two amendments to the bill tonight. There will be \nanother amendment that has already been accepted that will allow the \nINS Commissioner to provide a language proficiency bonus for people who \nare proficient in Spanish to be hired in the Border Patrol. Of course, \nif people are already proficient in Spanish, it will save the money it \nwill take to train them in the second language. That amendment has been \ncleared on both sides. I appreciate it because I am looking for every \nway I can to increase the capability to recruit new Border Patrol \nagents who will be able to hit the ground running and help stop the \ninflux of drugs and illegal immigration into our country.\n  I cannot imagine that we have continued to tell the INS that we want \nthese Border Patrol agents to come on board, and we have not had the \ncooperation of the administration in either recruitment or retention. \nCertainly, I hope with this bill, which is\n\n[[Page S9017]]\n\nmuch more narrow in its requirements, the Border Patrol will do what \nthe Congress has mandated they do, and that is recruit and retain more \nBorder Patrol agents so we can stop the influx of drugs into this \ncountry. As a matter of fact, $10 billion in marijuana, heroin, \ncocaine, and methamphetamines crossed our border last year. How in the \nworld can we say that we have a handle on the sovereignty of our \nborders when we have $10 billion of illegal drugs flowing in in 1 year?\n  I am very pleased that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Stevens, went to the Arizona border with Mexico during the \nMemorial Day recess. He was stunned at what he saw. I hope more \nSenators will go to the border so they will see the problem we are \nfacing.\n  During the markup of the bill that is before us today, Senator \nStevens said: God forbid that the day comes when we have to have fences \nand walls between the United States and Mexico.\n  I share his view. Mexico is our neighbor. They are strong cultural \nand historic ties between our two nations. I seek a border that is as \nopen as possible, allowing people, goods, and services to move across \nthe 2,000-mile-shared border quickly and efficiently. I am committed to \nputting in place the infrastructure, the bridges, the facilities, and \nthe inspection personnel necessary for this to happen. I wish the \nPresident and this administration would work with us.\n  The realities are otherwise, however. In Texas and along the border, \nwe are witnessing a lawlessness that we have never seen since the days \nof the frontier. It is important to put the drug threat in its proper \ncontext and to understand its full dimensions.\n  On March 24, 1999, Administrator Thomas Constantine of the Drug \nEnforcement Administration testified before our subcommittee. He said:\n\n       Most Americans are unaware of the vast damage that has been \n     caused to their communities by international drug trafficking \n     syndicates, most recently by organized crime groups \n     headquartered in Mexico. At the current time, these \n     traffickers pose the greatest threat to communities around \n     the United States. Their impact is no longer limited to \n     cities and towns on the border. Traffickers from Mexico are \n     now routinely operating in the Midwest, the Southeast, the \n     Northwest, and increasingly in the Northeastern portion of \n     the United States.\n\n  Make no mistake: Drugs coming across the border are ending up on the \nstreets of Manchester, NH; Columbia, SC; Baltimore, MD; and Denver, CO, \nand they are coming across in record numbers. In fiscal year 1998, \nthere were 6,359 drug seizures along the Southwest border. The total \nvalue of these drug seizures was $1.28 billion, nearly $150 million \nmore than last year. Nearly $1 billion of the drugs seized last year \nwere on the Texas border, in the Border Patrol sectors there.\n  Drug-related violence along the Texas border continues to increase. \nRanchers in Maverick County, 150 miles southwest of San Antonio, \nreported that armed traffickers in black, wearing camouflage clothing, \npassed through their properties after walking across the Rio Grande \nRiver. The situation is no better on the immigration side. More than \n1.5 million illegal immigrants were apprehended along the Southwest \nborder just last year.\n  Conservative estimates suggest that only one in four illegal aliens \nis apprehended. But the numbers hide the dark, evil side of this issue \nof alien smuggling, violent assault against migrating women, and other \nsuffering.\n  I commend to my colleagues an article that appeared recently in the \nNew York Times. Rick Lyman reported on a disturbing development where \ninfants and young children, some possibly kidnapped and others who are \nrented, are used to trick border agents. INS has no facilities to house \nfamilies, especially babies. So illegal aliens are simply released and \nasked to report for a later court date. The borrowed children are then \nshuffled back and forth across the border to be placed in the hands of \nothers to make yet another treacherous, illegal crossing.\n  These examples highlight conditions along the border. They underscore \nthat we have a moral obligation to provide the necessary resources to \nsecure our border. That is why I find it incomprehensible that this \nadministration has requested no new Border Patrol agents, Drug \nEnforcement Administration agents, or Customs agents in its budget \nrecommendation to Congress this year. The 8,000 men and women serving \nin our Border Patrol are our Nation's first line of defense in the war \non drugs and illegal immigration. Understanding this, Congress \nrequired, under the Illegal Immigration Act of 1996, that the Attorney \nGeneral in each of the fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001, \nshall increase the Border Patrol by not less than 1,000 full-time \nactive duty Border Patrol agents within the INS. Unfortunately, our \nNation's top law enforcement officer, Janet Reno, and the President \nopted not to abide by the law and put these agents in their budget.\n  This is not the first time the administration has not complied with \nthis law. In 1997, the administration only requested 500 new agents \ninstead of a thousand. Thank heavens, Senator Gregg and Senator \nHollings have kept their commitment to secure our Nation's borders and \nprovide $83 million in this year's budget to hire 1,000 agents.\n  Mr. President, this is so very important to fund these agencies. \nAgain, Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings have gone a long way to \npushing INS toward getting the 1,000 new Border Patrol agents. I have \nheard from every Border Patrol chief along the Southwest border, and \nall have told me that, yes, they can use better equipment. Better \nequipment helps them and it gives them a range much longer than one of \nthem can cover. But what they need most, first and foremost, is \nmanpower. They cannot operate the equipment, they cannot get to the \nplaces they need to be if they don't have enough Border Patrol agents, \nand they are woefully short.\n  So after talking to our drug czar, General McCaffrey, it is clear \nthat we need more Border Patrol agents. He has said we need 20,000 \nBorder Patrol agents in order to stop the flow of drugs across our \nSouthwest border.\n  A University of Texas study done last year indicates that 16,000 \nagents are needed to do this job, and we only have 8,000.\n  With only 200 to 400 likely to be hired this year, we are not even \nmaking progress in the right correction.\n  I call on this administration to stop the excuses on why they can't \nrecruit more Border Patrol agents, to stop refusing to even put them in \ntheir budget, and to come forward and say our border is a priority.\n  That is what I am asking this administration to do--to say that our \nborder has to stop letting in illegal drugs that are preying on our \nchildren in Seattle, WA, in Chicago, IL, and in Augusta, ME. We have to \nstop this. The only way we are going to do it is to make it a priority.\n  I appreciate the leadership of Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings. \nThey are making this a priority. The administration must come through \nand help us stop the sieve on our borders that is allowing drugs to \ncome in.\n  I want to say in closing that Senator Kyl has worked very closely \nwith me on these issue. Senator Kyl and I cosponsored the bill that \nwould raise the pay of the Border Patrol agents so we could be in the \nrecruitment game. He cosponsored my amendment on the floor today that \nwould make this happen. He has been an important voice for effective \nlaw enforcement along the Southwest Border.\n  Mr. President, we cannot wait any longer. We must have action from \nthis administration to beef up the Border Patrol, to beef up the \nCustoms agents, to beef up the Drug Enforcement Agency, so that we can \nstop the influx of drugs into our country. We must get serious about \nit. That is what this bill does. But we must have the cooperation of \nthis administration to do it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \namendments be the only first-degree amendments in order to the pending \nappropriations bill, and that they be subject to relevant second-degree \namendments, and no motion to commit or recommit be in order. I submit \nthe list of amendments to the desk. It includes the Democratic list of \namendments and the Republican list of amendments as of 6:10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask the \nmajority\n\n[[Page S9018]]\n\nleader has this been circulated in the last 10 minutes or so?\n  Mr. LOTT. Over the past hour or so.\n  Mr. REID. We just got six more is the reason.\n  Mr. LOTT. Are they on the list?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Is there a copy we can look at?\n  Mr. LOTT. I have the list here. I believe the Senator from Minnesota \nis on here for four amendments--not one, not two, not three but four. \nWe have the list.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am an active legislator. I ask the majority leader \nor Senator Gregg, I assume these are in addition to the amendment that \nhas been laid aside.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator's amendment is already in the queue.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. If the majority leader would wait for just a brief minute, \nwe are seeing what we can do here.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the managers of this legislation have been \nworking diligently throughout the day and have made a lot of progress \nin dealing with a number of amendments, accommodating those amendments. \nSenator Daschle and I have been working with Senators to find ways for \nSenators to perhaps have their legislation considered on other bills. \nWe are trying to get a list of amendments outstanding so they will know \nexactly what they are dealing with.\n  Mr. REID. If the leader will yield, I have just spoken to the manager \nof the bill, Senator Hollings. I want to make sure the list that has \nbeen submitted includes Senator Torricelli's FTC on marketing scams; a \nrelevant Feinstein; a relevant one for Bob Kerrey; a relevant by Bob \nGraham dealing with NOAA; an additional one for Senator Durbin, another \nrelevant one; one for Senator Leahy on the Sentencing Commission; \nanother for Senator Torricelli; Senator Landrieu has three relevants.\n  Mr. LOTT.

With this agreement in place, it is my hope that the bill \ncan be completed yet this evening. I believe we have amendments that \nare in order, and Senator Lautenberg has one he may be able to go \nforward with.\n  Work is still being done on the rule XVI issue. Additional votes will \noccur during this evening's session of the Senate. We usually can \nexpect to go late into the evenings on Thursday. It looks as if that \nwill be the case.\n  If we can work with the managers and get this work done, this would \nbe a\n\n[[Page S9019]]\n\nvery important achievement. And that, coupled with the fact that we \nknow there is a memorial service tomorrow, we would not have to be in \nsession tomorrow.\n  I urge the managers to keep working and my colleagues to please work \nwith them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am going to propound two unanimous \nconsent requests. One deals with Senator Lautenberg's amendment and one \nwith Senator Enzi's amendment. The plan is as follows:\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for Senator Lautenberg to \noffer an amendment regarding alcohol and there be 30 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to the vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that no amendments be in order to the \namendment prior to the vote.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the previous consent relating to \nthe pending Gregg amendment remain status quo to recur immediately \nfollowing the Lautenberg vote.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that it be in order for Senator Enzi \nto offer an amendment regarding the FCC accounting principles and there \nbe 30 minutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote on or in \nrelation to the amendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that no amendments be in order prior \nto the vote.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the previous consent relating to \nthe pending Gregg amendment remain status quo to reoccur immediately \nfollowing the vote on the Enzi amendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the Enzi amendment and the \nLautenberg amendment be voted on en bloc at the end of the Enzi debate \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I apologize to the \nRepublican manager of the bill. I was not listening when the consent \nrequest was first issued. Would the Senator tell us what it is.\n  Mr. GREGG. It actually means that Senator Lautenberg has 30 minutes \non his amendment equally divided, Senator Enzi has 30 minutes on his \namendment equally divided, and we go to a vote on those two amendments.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, what happens, I ask the \nchairman, after that?\n  Mr. GREGG. At that point we are back to the regular order, which is \nthat Senator Hollings is recognized for 10 minutes and I am recognized \nfor 10 minutes. Then we have a vote on the majority leader's point of \norder. However, I expect that there will be further action on the bill \nat that point and we will get into an amendment process.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have an amendment that is on the list. If I may, I \nwould like to get a time line on that.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would like to talk to the Senator about his amendment. I \nam hopeful that we can work it out and that we won't have to have a \nvote on it. Maybe we can talk about it while this debate is going on \nand work something out.\n  Mr. HARKIN. All right. I will be back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the order, the Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1302\n\n       (Purpose: To fund a media campaign, from increases in the \n     Department of Justice budget, to prevent underage drinking.)\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I assume that the pending Gregg \namendment has been laid aside.\n  I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey (Mr. LAUTENBERG), for himself, \n     Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Dorgan, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1302.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 2, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       For carrying out a media campaign to prevent alcohol \n     consumption by individuals in the United States who have not \n     attained the age of 21, $25,000,000 which shall become \n     available on October 1, 2000 and remain available through \n     September 30, 2001\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to \nprovide the Justice Department $25 million in fiscal year 2001 to \ndevelop and begin to implement a media campaign to discourage children \nfrom engaging in underage alcohol consumption.\n  We already have an ad campaign on national television that espouses \nthe evils of drug use. But that campaign does not include alcohol. And \nwhen I tried to amend that ad campaign in the Treasury-Postal bill last \nmonth to include alcohol, some Senators said that they did not want to \ndilute the anti-drug message. But they did say that they would support \na separate anti-underage drinking campaign.\n  I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and Senators Harkin and \nDorgan, who the last time I offered a similar amendment voted against \nit, but now has agreed that it is the right thing to do.\n  Right now, by running anti-drugs ads without also running anti-\nunderage drinking ads, we are sending the wrong message to Ameria's \nchildren. It is the equivalent of telling kids: ``say 'no' to drugs. \nBut this Bud's for you!''\n  Mr. President, consuming alcohol is illegal in all 50 States if you \nare under the age of 21, and among America's youth, underage alcohol \nconsumption is just as big a problem as drug use.\n  The facts are daunting. If we look at this chart, we see that alcohol \nkills six times more children ages 12 to 20 than all the other ilegal \ndrugs combined. It was a surprise to me, as I suspect it is a surprise \nto millions of other Americans as well.\n  Let me point out some more facts. According to the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, the average age at which children start \ndrinking is 13.\n  What's even worse, Mr. President, is that research shows that \nchildren who drink at age 13 have a 47-percent chance of becoming \nalcohol-dependent.\n  But if they waited until they were 21 to drink, they would have only \na 10-percent chance of becoming dependent.\n  In all, Mr. President, there are nearly 4 million young people in \nthis country who suffer from alcohol dependence, and they account for \none-fifth of all alcohol-dependent Americans.\n  Not only is alcohol consumption widespread among children under the \nage of 21, but it is a ``gateway drug.'' And too often, it leads to the \nuse of marijuana, cocaine, and heroin.\n  The drug czar, Geneal McCaffrey, had some things to say about this. \nHe said, ``The most dangerous drug in America today is still alcohol.''\n  But for one reason or another, we don't get that message through.\n  He goes on to say that alcohol is ``the biggest drug abuse problem \nfor adolescents, and it's linked to the use of other, illegal drugs.''\n  Mr. President, statistics support what General McCaffrey has been \nsaying. According to the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at \nColumbia University, youth who drink alcohol are 7.5 times more likely \nto use any illegal drug and 50 times more likely to use cocaine, than \nyoung people who never drink alcohol.\n  General McCaffrey is not alone in his belief that attacking underage \ndrinking is a key component of the war on drugs. Surgeon General Davis \nSatcher recently wrote a letter to General McCaffrey expressing his \nsupport for ``a powerful media campaign that will effectively \ndeglamourize underage drinking.''\n  Surgeon General Satcher went on to say that he has established a \nStaff Working Group ``to create an effective campaign to curtail the \nincidence of underage and binge drinking.''\n  Finally, the Surgeon General\n\n       It is time to more effectively address the drug that \n     children and teens tell us is their great concern and the \n     drug we know is most likely to result in their injury or \n     death.\n\n  If experts like General McCaffrey and Surgeon General Satcher agree \nthat alcohol is a ``gateway drug,'' then it is clear that a well-\nplanned ad campaign that targets underage drinking would increase the \neffectiveness of our war against drugs.\n  My amendment provides the Justice Department with $25 million in \nfiscal year 2001 to develop and begin to implement a media campaign to \ndiscourage\n\n[[Page S9020]]\n\nchildren under the age of 21 from drinking. The amendment allows plenty \nof time to conduct the necessary research and develop and test sample \nradio and television ads in order to launch an effective media \ncampaign. Ad messages would be consistent with the antidrug messages in \nthe drug czar's media campaign. There would also be funds to begin \nbuying media time.\n  The Justice Department will coordinate the campaign with \nrepresentatives of the Centers for Disease Control, the Surgeon \nGeneral's office, and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and \nAlcoholism. With the help of these health institutions, the Justice \nDepartment also would put together a detailed 5-year funding plan for \nthe campaign and its media ``buys'' to help Congress in the \nappropriations process.\n  Editorials have been written across this country supporting the need \nfor an anti-underage drinking media campaign. Editorials have appeared \nin the Washington Post, New York Times, Christian Science Monitor, and \nLos Angeles Times. The concept of an anti-underage drinking media \ncampaign is further supported by more than 80 organizations, including \nMothers Against Drunk Driving, the American Medical Association, the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the American Public Health Association, \nand the Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n  I am proud to have been the author some years ago, in 1984, that made \n21 the drinking age in all 50 States. With the help of the National \nTransportation Safety Board, we have saved the lives of approximately \n15,000 young people in the 15 years since the law has been in place. It \nwas a real boon to those families who worried about their children \ndrinking and the problems that result.\n  In 1995, Senator Byrd led the charge on zero tolerance for underage \nalcohol consumption by writing a law that says if you are under age 21, \n.02 blood alcohol level is legally drunk. So, as in the past, we need \nto continue to send a strong message to America's youth that neither \nunderage alcohol consumption nor drug use is acceptable. And the only \nsuccessful path to winning the war on drugs is the one paved by \npreventing underage drinking.\n  We must not accept underage drinking as a so-called rite of passage. \nIt often is. It is a passage directly to illegal drugs such as \nmarijuana, cocaine, and heroin. It is a passage to a life of alcohol \ndependency.\n  The bottom line is this: This is a simple up-or-down vote on whether \nyou want to do something to prevent teen alcohol addiction. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment so that we can get a handle on \nthat drug which is acknowledged to be the most dangerous among all \ndrugs. And the fact that alcohol kills six times more children ages 12 \nto 20 than all other illegal drugs combined proves that.\n  I hope we get a positive vote on this. I understand this vote will be \nstacked with a vote of the Senator from Wyoming, is that correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct. We will have a vote on the amendment of \nthe Senator from New Jersey and then the Senator from Wyoming.\n  I rise in opposition to this amendment for a number of reasons. With \nforward funding of an initiative, the $25 million for advanced \nappropriations next year, it makes it extremely difficult for the \ncommittee to function.\n  When the President presented his budget, he had included a large \namount of funding which this committee did not accept because we did \nnot want to put ourselves in that sort of a bind.\n  Independent of the equities of the argument relative to the \ninitiative which was voted on once before in a form not exactly like \nthis but similar to this on the Treasury-Postal bill, I believe very \nstrongly this would set a very poor precedent if we began appropriating \nin the future on bills for this year.\n  It would avoid the entire budgetary process, which requires offsets. \nThat is our fiscal discipline. Without offsets, we will have no fiscal \ndiscipline. Arguably, we could appropriate all of next year's budget on \nalmost any subject that Members wish and create significant problems.\n  I don't support the amendment. I believe the amendment is \ninappropriate.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember for permitting me to offer this amendment.\n  But this is not a precedent-setting amendment. We have done \nsubstantial forward funding in those programs that need it. And it will \ntake a year to organize this program.\n  This is the time to get this program started by making certain that \nthe message is clear, that it is out there. It says: Listen, kids, \ndon't start drinking. It could lead you down a terrible path. It could \ncreate more dependence on alcohol, more introduction to other drugs. \nThat is a poor way to give a child a sendoff.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire talks about appropriating next year's \nmoney at this time as being somewhat unusual. Fortunately, or \nunfortunately, it is not unusual. I have a list of accounts that have \nbeen forward funded. I ask unanimous consent to have these accounts \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the information was ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                  DISCRETIONARY ADVANCE APPROPRIATIONS\n        [Budget authority by fiscal year, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 1998     1999     2000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMilitary pay and retirement..................        0        0    1,838\nDenali Commission............................        0        0        8\nPatent and Trademark Office..................        0       71      167\nLegal activities & U.S. Marshals.............        0       31        0\nSBA business loan program account............        4        4        0\nFederal Trade Commission.....................        0       14        0\nSecurities & Exchange Commission.............       27        0        0\nEmployment and Training Administration.......        0      290        0\nNIH, buildings and facilities................        0        0       40\nLow income home energy assistance program....    1,000    1,100    1,100\nChild care development block grant...........      937    1,000    1,183\nElementary & Secondary Ed (reading                   0      210        0\n excellence).................................\nEducation for the disadvantaged..............    1,298    1,448    6,204\nCorporation for Public Broadcasting..........      250      250      317\nPayment to Postal Service....................        0        0       71\nDefense vessel transfer program..............        0        0       31\nNASA.........................................      365        0        0\nVeterans, construction, major................       32        0        0\nHazardous substance superfund................        0      650      650\n                                              --------------------------\n      Total..................................    3,913    5,068   11,609\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: CBO, Scorekeeping Unit.\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], for himself, Mr. \n     Burns, and Mr. Fitzgerald, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1301.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC. --. PROHIBITION ON REQUIREMENT FOR USE OF ACCOUNTING \n                   METHOD NOT CONFORMING TO GENERALLY ACCEPTED \n                   ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--No part of any appropriations contained \n     in this Act shall be used by the Federal Communciations \n     Commission to require any person subject to its jurisdiction \n     under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. \n     151 et seq) to utilize for any purpose any form or method of \n     accounting that does not conform to Generally Accepted \n     Accounting Principles established by the Financial Accounting \n     Standards Board.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to remove an \nunnecessary burdensome recordkeeping requirement on local telephone \ncompanies.\n  In 1935, the Federal Communications Commission developed an \naccounting system known as a uniform system of accounts to ensure the \nCommission had access to financial data used by AT to set local phone \nrates. This system of accounting requires that companies maintain \ndetailed records and appreciate every asset they purchase, from paper \nclips to trucks. According to depreciation schedules that each company \nnegotiates with the FCC, no other entity in the Nation has to do that.\n\n[[Page S9021]]\n\n  I have seen some of these schedules. They require companies to \ndepreciate assets over longer periods of time than either the Internal \nRevenue Service or the Securities and Exchange Commission. They require \nthem to depreciate things that no other business has to depreciate. \nMany of these assets are high-technology items such as digital switches \nor fiber-optic cable that are often obsolete in a very short period of \ntime. However, the FCC requires them to be depreciated over a much \nlonger period of time.\n  This is not limited to depreciation. As an accountant, I happen to \nknow a bit about generally accepted accounting principles. Yet even \nsmall businesses under the IRS have a dollar threshold over which they \namortize assets--usually $25,000. For purchases under $25,000, the \ncompany would simply expense the item, meaning that they could charge \nthe cost of the asset against the current year's revenues.\n  Under the FCC system, local telephone companies are required to \namortize every asset they buy, from office supplies to digital \nswitching equipment. There is no dollar value threshold for local \ncompanies. They have to keep detailed records and record assets in \naccounts specified by the FCC; negotiated individually with the FCC. \nThese companies already maintain their records according to generally \naccepted accounting principles. Their standard is required by the IRS \nand FCC. Why should a third agency require companies to keep their \nbooks in a manner inconsistent with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples?\n  Now that AT has been broken up and competition is being allowed to \ntake place, it is time to remove regulatory burdens that do nothing \nmore than impose a requirement on one set of companies that their \ncompetitors do not have to comply with, information that is available \nto the competitors, information in detail available to the competitors, \nderived at great expense to the local telephone company?\n  The amendment I am proposing would prohibit the FCC from requiring \nany accounting system other than generally accepted accounting \nprinciples for 1 year. This would give companies time to transition to \nthe generally accepted accounting principles--one set of books--and \nmake provisions to take obsolete equipment out of service and change \ntheir internal accounting policies to conform with generally accepted \naccounting principles. This would also save the Government money, since \nthe FCC would not have to maintain as big an Accounting Policy Division \nto negotiate and enforce these antiquated, detailed depreciation and \nexpense rules.\n\n  According to the accounting firm of Arthur Anderson, this would save \nthe small local telephone exchange companies--we are talking about the \nsmall companies in every State in this Nation--between $200,000 and $1 \nmillion a year. This is money that could be spent on bringing advanced \nservices and technology to rural areas or reducing rates. I understand \nhow expensive it is to maintain one set of business records, and \nanybody in business out there understands that. That is one set of \nbusiness records according to the generally accepted accounting \nprinciples. Just imagine what it costs for two sets of books, and the \nsecond set of books has to be negotiated in detail, has to have far \nmore accounts than the other. My amendment would eliminate this \nexpensive requirement on local telephone companies and level the \nplaying field between competitors, particularly with the huge long \ndistance competitors.\n  My amendment is being supported by the United States Telephone \nAssociation and its members. The United States Telephone Association \nrepresents small rural telephone companies. They believe, as I do, that \ncompetition in the local phone market starts when all participants are \nbound by the same rules.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe United States Telephone Association that goes into a bit more \ndetail than I have time, in my allotted 15 minutes, to go into. \nCommissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth, who serves on the Federal \nCommunications Commission, made a statement on docket 99-253 that \nmentions:\n\n       In today's increasingly competitive telecommunications \n     marketplace, the Commission should be focusing its efforts on \n     transitioning to a more competitive environment. The amount \n     of detailed information and regulatory scrutiny required \n     under our accounting and ARMIS rules is inordinate and should \n     be reduced.\n\n  I ask that entire letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     United States\n\n\n                                        Telephone Association,\n\n                                                    July 19, 1999.\n     Hon. Michael Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell State Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: I am writing to commend you and thank \n     you for your efforts to streamline the FCC's accounting \n     requirements for local telephone companies. These \n     requirements are vestiges of past regulatory schemes. They \n     are burdensome, costly, and discriminatory, and they serve no \n     useful purpose in today's telecommunications market. The \n     1,200 local telephone companies that comprise the United \n     States Telephone Association appreciate your leadership on \n     this issue.\n       As you know, these accounting rules, also known as the \n     Uniform System of Accounts, were adopted more than a decade \n     ago, when the local telephone market was for the most part \n     closed, and local carriers were subject to cost-based, rate \n     of return regulations. Since that time, the large incumbent \n     local exchange companies have changed to price cap \n     regulations, and the local telephone market has opened to \n     competition. In short, the marketplace has changed, but these \n     accounting rules have not.\n       Arthur Anderson estimates that these regulations cost the \n     local phone industry up to $270 million every year. \n     Ultimately, consumers suffer from these wasted resources. The \n     capital the local phone companies spend meeting these \n     requirements could be redeployed in ways that benefit \n     consumers with lower prices, better services, more advanced \n     technologies and more robust competition. Further, in today's \n     telecommunications market, rapid advances in technology drive \n     the introduction of new products and services at a breakneck \n     pace. Costly and unnecessary regulations slow that pace and \n     skew the competitive balance toward companies that are not \n     subject to them.\n       Taxpayers suffer, as well. More than 70 people at the \n     Federal Communications Commission are needed to maintain and \n     audit these reports. These slots or their funding could be \n     saved, or put to better use either elsewhere at the \n     Commission, or elsewhere in government.\n       Senator Enzi, thank you again for your leadership on this \n     issue. If we may be of assistance in any way, please let us \n     know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Roy Noel,\n     President and CEO,\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n            statement of commissioner harold furchtgott-roth\n\n     Re: Comprehensive Review of the Accounting Requirements and \n     ARMIS Reporting Requirements for Incumbent Local Exchange \n     Carriers (CC Docket No. 99-253)\n\n       I support today's Order initiating ``Phase 1'' of a \n     comprehensive review of the Commissioner's accounting and \n     reporting requirements. While I believe that today's Order is \n     a step in the right direction, it is, to my regret, a very \n     small step down a very long road. I write separately because \n     I continue to be concerned about the Commission's micro-\n     management of all telecommunications carriers, including \n     LECs.\n       In today's increasingly competitive telecommunications \n     marketplace, the Commissioner should be focusing its efforts \n     on transitioning to this more competitive environment. The \n     amount of detailed information and regulatory scrutiny \n     required under our current accounting and ARMIS rules is \n     inordinate and should be reduced. I am becoming increasingly \n     convinced that the current regulatory mechanisms--and \n     certainly the level of detail--are no longer necessary in \n     today's increasingly competitive marketplace. I believe the \n     Commission must consider even further deregulation as these \n     cumbersome regulations become unnecessary.\n       I wait anxiously for the commencement of Phase 2 of this \n     review, which I hope follows today's small step with huge \n     strides toward true regulatory reform.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, what we have is an issue where we have a lot \nof local, small, rural telephone companies who are coming under \ninordinate additional accounting requirements, additional accounting \nbesides what is required by the other Federal agencies. This \ninformation has to be released to the competitors as well. Competitors, \nthe big phone companies, do not have to give the same information to \nthe little companies. So it is time we made this kind of change.\n  I ask for support on the amendment. I yield the floor and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the \ndistinguished Senator and realize he is far more steeped in this \nparticular discipline of accounting, of certified public accounting, \nthan I am.\n\n[[Page S9022]]\n\n  Yet having worked in the field and heard for the first time here in \nthe last half hour of this particular amendment, it goes right to the \nheart of what has been going on. Specifically, we want to change an \naccounting system that has been on the books, agreed to, conformed \nwith, never objected to, during the entire 4-year deliberation of the \nrewrite of the Telecommunications Act. I never heard anything about \nthis need for a different system of accounting. Now, having adopted it, \nI am asking immediately: Wait a minute, what is going on here? We never \nheard of this or anything else like it. Then the giveaway is when my \ndistinguished colleague says the United States Telephone Association, \nand so forth, little, little, little--little my eye. This is the Bell \ncrowd.\n  I find out by telephone call they have had a recent audit and the \nauditors found billions of dollars of unaccounted-for equipment. They \njust had it on the books. They put it into the rate structure. And then \nthey redeem those amounts into the rate-paying system. This, of course, \naffects the rates, it affects the amounts that go back to universal \nservice, and everything else of that kind. So all of a sudden we \nreally, rather than helping the little ones, are going to harm the \nlittle folks on a so-called accounting system change.\n  If anybody is intimately familiar with the rural telephone companies \nand the co-ops and everything else, this particular Senator is. The \nfinest rural system there is is in the State of South Carolina. In \nfact, they have put in the Internet connections and everything else at \nall the public schools and what have you. Really, it is one of the \nfinest rural groups. They never saw me about this or anything of this \nkind. This amendment definitely ought to be tabled.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Wyoming. I doubt I \nneed 3 minutes.\n  When this accounting system was adopted in the telecommunications \nindustry way back in 1935, and it evolved through the years, we did not \nforesee the advances of technology and the need to change equipment \nwould happen in that area as fast as it is happening now. New \ntechnology is coming on line. If there is a holdup in the buildout of \nthis technology, of maybe some of our locally owned companies--and some \nof our cooperatives as cooperatives, I doubt, will be affected by this \n--it is so we can get rid of some of this old equipment we carry on the \nbooks because it is not all depreciated out. It has not kept pace with \nthe technology.\n\n  There was, a couple of years ago--it was more than that, 5 or 6 years \nago, with then-Senator Brown from Colorado--offered an amendment to \nstandardize accounting clear through the Government. We did not get \nthat done. But nonetheless here is an old accounting system that is \nvery important to the high-tech area when it comes to buildout in the \nrural area, so broad-band technologies can be deployed and get rid of \nsome of the old equipment still on the books.\n  This amendment needs passing. I yield the floor and thank my friend \nfrom Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The distinguished Senator from Montana, the chairman of \nour Subcommittee on Communications, ought to be asking for a hearing on \nthis one. Another phrase caught my attention, when they say ``historic \ncost.'' They could go all the way back to 1934, which they have already \nbeen rewarded for over the many years, 60 or 70 years. Otherwise that \nis exactly what they have earned as a monopoly. Yes, we are moving. \nDon't say they did not foresee it.\n  I have just been through a vigorous campaign and visited rural folks. \nI admire the new equipment they have. They are changing over. They know \nwhat it is. They know what competition is. The small ones, more or \nless, have been bringing about the competition.\n  It is the Bell companies that told this Senator and the committee \ntime and again at hearings: We want to compete; we want to compete; we \nwant to compete.\n  Please, my gracious, all they have done is combine. Southwest Bell \nhas taken over Pacific Telesis. Now they want to take over Ameritech. \nBell Atlantic has taken over NYNEX. Another one, we heard just the \nother day, is taking over U.S. West. They are all moving to combine and \nform more monopolies, and before long we will have Ma Bell all over \nagain.\n  Then they have the audacity and unmitigated gall to come to the floor \nof the Senate and say let's just change the little accounting system so \nwe can take care of all of these costs, when they have been caught \nshort of unaccounted equipment that has been carried on the books over \nmany years and they have long since been compensated for in their \nrates.\n  I can say the universal service to the small business in Wyoming and \nMontana when the Bell company puts this one over on the United \nTelephone Association--if they put this over, they are going to have to \npay through the nose, I can tell you that right now. It is all going \nin. It is the big gobbling up the little ones.\n  There ought not to be any misunderstanding to all of a sudden \nchanging their accounting systems because they have found unaccounted \nequipment on the books that have been kept over many years, for which \nthey have long since been compensated, and for which they continue to \ncharge over and over. That is what is at issue here; without a hearing \nand putting it on the commerce bill which has jurisdiction over the FCC \nand saying it is just a small thing, they just want to look out for \npeople and want the same kind of report.\n  They want to get rid of the report that says you can carry all these \nexpenses ad infinitum, back to 1934, and continue to charge the \nratepayers for it. If that occurs, then universal service, the rates, \nand everything else with respect to the agreed-upon long distance and \nlocal rates is going totally out of kilter. The little boys are really \ngoing to suffer.\n  I am prepared, when all time has expired, to make a motion to table \nthis amendment. It definitely ought to be tabled in behalf of all \ncommunications and, more particularly, on account of procedures in the \nSenate. We have a committee. The distinguished Senator is chairman of \nthe subcommittee. The subject has never been mentioned, and, Heaven \nknows, I hear every day I am in the Senate: Please, call the \nCommission. We don't. Please write a letter to the Commission. All the \ndowntown lawyers again and again want to try their cases politically \nwhen they cannot prevail administratively.\n  I know if it were a real problem, I would have long since heard about \nit. My rural people would have told me about it long ago. But bam, at 7 \no'clock at night, they want to change the entire accounting system. It \nis the wrong procedure, if nothing else.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, what we are trying to do is harmonize and \nunify the accounting system, not eliminate and drastically change it. \nWe are talking about generally accepted accounting principles. This is \nwhat the accountants across the United States use day in and day out. \nWe are trying to unify it within the telecommunications industry.\n  One reason you have not heard about this a lot is that we are talking \nabout the small local exchange carriers. We are not talking about the \nbig corporations that have all the lawyers in Washington. We are \ntalking about the little guy out there who is trying to run a business \nand does not have as much time or expertise to run to Washington or \nknow specifically to whom to take his case. We are talking about small \nbusinesses. And we are not talking about small money here. We are \ntalking about them imposing extra regulations which cost them $200,000 \nto $1 million a year. That is money that could be put into new phone \nsystems or reducing rates. These are the small rural carriers.\n  As far as whether enough data is available, of course, it is \navailable. Corporations, big and small, across this Nation run and \nreport under generally accepted accounting principles. This is not a \nnew system. It is newer than the system we are talking about operating \nunder which was instituted in 1935.\n\n[[Page S9023]]\n\n  In 1935, when it was controlled by a monopoly, there needed to be \nmore detailed accounting. Anything that needs to be accounted can still \nbe accounted. It just has to follow generally accepted accounting \nprinciples instead of a multiple process of going to the FCC, \nnegotiating into some new accounts which already number in the \nneighborhood of 500, and coming in with the output that is needed to \nmake the decision, rather than a myriad of information.\n  How would you like to depreciate paper clips? It has gotten \nridiculous. Those things have to be taken into consideration. There is \nno threshold of expenses.\n  There have been a lot of changes in the communications industry. One \nof them is divestiture of AT There is a whole list of things that \nhave happened. A big one is the passage in 1996 of the \nTelecommunications Act, of which the Senator was speaking, and the \nissuance of the resulting FCC orders implementing various sections of \nthe act, including proceedings to implement local competition and \ninterconnection, as well as universal service, access charge, and price \ncap reform.\n  There is not anything under generally accepted accounting principles \nthat will not get the data that is needed to handle any of those \nissues. All of the service providers, with the exception of incumbent \nlocal exchange companies, have flexibility. The others already have the \nflexibility. AT has the flexibility to provide services priced on a \ncompetitive basis at rates dictated by the marketplace.\n  These service providers are not subject to the accounting and \nrecordkeeping rules contained in part 32--the big companies are not \nsubject to that--and associated monitoring and enforcement activities \nbut are simply required to follow GAAP in producing their external \nreports. Prices no longer bear a direct relationship to cost.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I find this to be rather confounding. I just want to \nmake sure I understand this clearly. These companies are required to \nmaintain two sets of books?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Accounted different ways; is that correct?\n  Mr. ENZI. The Senator from Missouri is absolutely correct. They are \nrequired to carry multiple books.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. And this adds as much as $20 million to $30 million to \nthe cost of doing business?\n  Mr. ENZI. For the local companies, it would be $25 million to $30 \nmillion. We are talking about at least $300 million across the United \nStates per year.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Some of these companies try to be competitive, not only \nnationally but internationally.\n  Mr. ENZI. They are, and we want them to be competitive without having \nto do all the mergers that were spoken of earlier.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Is it true these additional charges are eventually paid \nby consumers?\n  Mr. ENZI. Absolutely, they have to be paid by consumers.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. What we are imposing is almost like a tax that the \npeople of America are paying, $25 million or $30 million extra, that is \nreally unnecessary in these companies now.\n  Mr. ENZI. The Senator from Missouri is absolutely correct. It is like \na tax, and it is money that the rural telephone folks are having to \npay.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. And that is a substantial impairment on their capacity \nto do business?\n  Mr. ENZI. It is a substantial impairment on their ability to be \ncompetitive with the big national phone companies.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. This one unique, idiosyncratic accounting method is a \n1930s accounting system.\n  Mr. ENZI. That is correct.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That is still mandated in spite of the fact that for \nother purposes, to be competitive and to be successful in offering \ntheir stock and other things, they maintain a set of books that is \ngenerally accepted for accounting purposes.\n  Mr. ENZI. That is correct. We want the small companies able to do the \nsame kind of accounting as the big companies.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator's amendment is to basically say we want to \nrelieve them of this duplicitous, inefficient demand which results in \ntheir consumers having to pay a lot more and reducing the \ncompetitiveness of these companies.\n  Mr. ENZI. The Senator is absolutely correct. We want to increase \ntheir competitiveness. We want the people in the rural areas to have \nthe same accounting system, so they have lower costs, so they can pass \nthat on to the consumer.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator for his amendment. I think it is \ngood policy. It is the direction in which we should be going to be \ncompetitive. We need to move into the next century, not try to reinvent \nthe last century.\n  I thank the Senator for his excellent work and for allowing me to \ninterrupt his remarks to clarify this to make sure I understand clearly \nwhat the Senator from Wyoming said. He has made an outstanding \ncontribution to the understanding of other Senators and to the people \nof the United States about an archaic system imposed by Government \nwhich costs us all resources and which makes competition difficult for \nour own companies.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Missouri for his comments.\n  We have an opportunity to fix the system so it works the same for big \ncompanies and small companies so they all operate under generally \naccepted accounting principles, so the small rural guy is not doing all \nof the extra accounting that the big guys are not required to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 7 minutes \n55 seconds.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will use just a minute or two, Mr. President.\n  The word ``competitive'' intrigued this particular Senator. As they \ncongratulate each other over there with respect to this particular \nattempted fix, let me remind the Senate that we are talking about \nmonopolies. Monopolies do not have general accounting principles \nbecause they are not in the field of competition. They are monopolies. \nThey are guaranteed a return. And extra accounting principles have been \nlong since established for these companies and for small ones in that \nthe independent, local exchange carriers--there are many small ones--\nthey are monopolies, too. So these accounting methods and principles \nhave been in force for a long time.\n  And here without a hearing, and just, bam, and to start talking about \nsmall--and there is a $30 million tax, and so forth, that is just \nspurious reasoning and fanciful notions, if I have ever heard them.\n  The opposite is true. We are trying, with respect to a monopoly, to \nmake sure that it does not go to the ratepayer because the monopoly is \nguaranteed a return. So if any true costs are there, they are going to \nhave to be reflected in their guaranteed rate of return.\n  So this amendment is totally out of order in the sense of procedures \nhere in the Senate where we have a committee and we can have hearings \non it and we can find out if there is any infringement with respect to \nthe concern of the Senator from Wyoming. Because he knows all about \naccounting.\n  But I can tell you now, general accounting principles do not apply to \nmonopolies--and should not apply to monopolies--because there is no \ncompetition. They are guaranteed that return, and that is why they have \nthe special accounting system.\n  I thank the Chair. At the end of this, if my distinguished chairman \nwould permit, I think we ought to move to table this one.\n  Mr. ENZI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. ENZI. Would you be willing to go with an amendment that would \nrequire AT and other companies to meet the same requirements as \nlittle companies?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Oh, yes. I think whatever accounting system they have, \nI do not find a difference in it. I would go with having a hearing and \ngive you a definite return. We are not trying to delay or anything like \nthat, but I would have a hearing before the subcommittee of the Senator \nfrom Montana, and the full committee, and we would be glad to report \nsomething out. But we never have had hearings, and you just say \n``little and small.''\n\n[[Page S9024]]\n\n  The United States Telephone Association, that is big. I know from \nhard experience that is big. That is a ``Big Bell\" company. In relation \nto the chairman of this so-called company that has the accounting \nsystem, and so forth, do you know what they reported in USA Today the \nother day? The chairman of Bell South made last year $55.9 million--\neither $56 or $57 million. Can you imagine the head of a monopoly \nguaranteed a return, with no competition, making $55 million? Come on. \nAnd you are talking about little things? Don't give me that. They are \nnot little. In just agreeing to little and big, we have a different \nidea basically of what is big and what is little in this particular \ndebate.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. You would agree they all ought to be on the same accounting \nsystem?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I don't know of a reason for a separate accounting \nsystem. If there is less of an accounting system for the smaller one, I \ntend in that direction.\n  I agree with the sentiment that you have to look out for the small so \nthey are not gobbled up by the big. So I would almost agree to less of \nan accounting system for the small rather than the same required for \nthe big. I am trying to go in your direction.\n  Mr. ENZI. I would love to work with you on that, but right now the \nbig ones have the easier accounting system.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We can have hearings and find that out.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second on the amendment.\n  They yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second on the motion to \ntable?\n  No, there is not a sufficient second on the motion to table.\n  There is a sufficient second on the motion to table.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to table. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the first vote be on the \nLautenberg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The yeas \nand nays have been ordered on the Lautenberg amendment. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I suggest the absence of a quorum for a second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll to ascertain the \nabsence or the presence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded and that we have the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 1302\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1302 by the Senator from New Jersey. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to visit some detention \nfacilities across our country and meet with correctional officers and \nalso the incarcerated children and their parents. I am struck again and \nagain by one fact: The mentally ill and the juveniles--the children, \nthe kids--are particularly vulnerable to abuse and neglect in jails and \nprisons in our country. That is why I am offering this amendment that \nwill give back to the Federal courts full authority to remedy abusive \nconditions but only under which the mentally ill and juveniles are \nbeing held.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the Department of Justice released a report on the \nprevalence of mental illness among adult inmates in our jails and \nprisons. The Justice Department report merely confirms what many of us \nalready know. The criminalization of mental illness is a national \ncrisis.\n  Of particular concern to me have been the extraordinary problems \nchildren with mental illness and emotional disorders encounter in \njuvenile jails. That is why I introduced the Mental Health Juvenile \nJustice Act earlier this year. Of the 100,000 children who are arrested \nand incarcerated each year, as many as 50 percent suffer from a mental \nor emotional disturbance.\n  Jails and detention centers often find they are unprepared to deal \nwith these kids. For instance, medication which should be given is not \ngiven; medication that should be properly monitored is not properly \nmonitored; and guards may not even know how to respond to some of these \nkids.\n  Why do so many youth with mental illness end up in the juvenile \njustice system? The truth of the matter is, we ought to, on the front \nend, do a much better job of assessing the problems of these kids and, \nfor those who should not be incarcerated--some should--but for those \nwho should not be incarcerated, look to alternatives.\n  We have not invested as a country--you can talk to anybody down in \nthe trenches doing this work--adequately in the service programs and \ncommunity prevention programs that will reduce the need for \nincarceration. Therefore, many of these kids wind up in these \nfacilities. They are incredibly vulnerable. They do not get the care \nthey absolutely have to get, and the consequences are tragic.\n  Last year, as an example, I went with the National Mental Health \nAssociation to the Tallulah Correctional Center for Youth, a privately \nowned facility for over 600 youth in northeast Louisiana. I saw \nshocking civil rights violations which were cited by the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice. Basically what I am saying is, there were kids \nwho were diagnosed with mental problems getting absolutely no treatment \nwhatsoever.\n  The Justice Department has also exposed gross abuses in Georgia, \nKentucky, and the juvenile facilities in Louisiana. Other States also \nexperience similar problems. Investigators found cases of physical \nabuse and neglect of mental health needs, including unwarranted and \nprolonged isolation of suicidal children, hog-tie and chemical \nrestraints used on youth with serious emotional disturbances, forced \nmedication, and even denial of medication.\n  Children with extensive psychiatric histories who are prone to self-\nmutilation--cutting themselves with glass--never even saw a \npsychiatrist.\n\n  In some cases, abusive treatment of these children results directly \nfrom their being emotionally disturbed. Staff in the juvenile \nfacilities fail to recognize the problem and, in fact, punish these \nchildren for the symptoms of their disorders. Children have been \npunished for requesting treatment or put in isolation when they refuse \nto accept treatment. One child in a boot camp was punished for making \ninvoluntary noises that were symptoms of Tourette's syndrome. Mental \ndisorders are being handled almost solely through discipline, \nisolation, and restraints, according to investigations by the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice and human rights groups.\n  Nobody likes litigation, but sometimes lawsuits are necessary to \nprotect the constitutional rights of our people, especially vulnerable, \nvoiceless persons such as incarcerated children who suffer from mental \nillness. That is what this amendment is about.\n  Because juveniles and mentally ill persons are particularly \nvulnerable to abuse and neglect in State institutions, I am offering \ntonight an amendment which will give back to Federal courts the \nauthority to remedy abusive conditions under which juveniles with \nmental illness are being held. Regrettably, the Congress has taken \nsteps in recent years to limit the circumstances under which lawsuits \nchallenging the constitutionality of prison conditions can be brought.\n  Three years ago, this Congress passed the Prison Litigation Reform \nAct. Its sponsors claimed that the bill would merely end frivolous \nlawsuits by prisoners, and we all agree with that goal. I certainly do. \nBut the terms of the PLRA were much more sweeping. It deprived Federal \ncourts of important legal tools to remedy brutal, unconstitutional \nconditions in juvenile detention facilities throughout our country.\n  For example, the PLRA limited the power of Federal courts to impose \nand retain injunctive relief to improve conditions in juvenile \nfacilities. This means that parties can no longer settle these lawsuits \nby means of a consent decree--a court-enforceable injunction entered \ninto with agreement by the parties without admission of liability by a \ndefendant. That is very important. Also, any relief order must be \nterminated by the courts 2 years after it is issued unless the court \nholds another trial.\n  One of the most important judicial powers that the PLRA curtailed was \nthe appointment of special masters. Quite often judges will appoint \nspecial masters who will come in, do the mediation, do the negotiation, \nbut we have\n\n[[Page S9026]]\n\nso limited the compensation that we are not able to do that. The act \nlimited the powers of special masters so they can no longer perform \nthis task of mediating disputes and assisting the parties in reaching \nsome compliance with court orders.\n  While the PLRA has made it much more difficult for courts to improve \ninhumane conditions in prisons generally, it has had a devastating \nimpact on the conditions in which mentally ill and juvenile defenders \nare held. They are particularly vulnerable to abuse and neglect at \nState institutions, and precisely because of that fact, we must not be \nindifferent to their plight or ignore their need for protection.\n  Let me give some examples. Just consider some of these horrific \nconditions involving mentally ill juveniles that PLRA has made more \ndifficult to remedy:\n  In Philadelphia, children with mental illness in a juvenile detention \nfacility operating at 160 percent of capacity were regularly beaten by \nstaff with chains and other objects. Santiago v. Philadelphia.\n  In Delaware, juveniles with mental illness were housed in living \nunits the court found posed a serious fire hazard. Their food and \nclothing were inadequate. Children were routinely beaten, maced, and \nshackled. The medical and education programs they received were below \nminimally accepted standards. These are facts. This is what is going \non. John A v. Castle.\n  In a Pennsylvania-run juvenile facility, children were routinely \nbeaten by faculty staff, staff trafficking in illegal drugs was \nrampant, and sexual relations between staff and confined youth were \ncommonplace. DB v. Commonwealth.\n  A severely depressed 17-year-old in an adult prison in Texas was \nraped and sodomized. His request to be placed in protective custody was \ndenied. For the next several months, he was repeatedly beaten by older \nprisoners, forced to perform oral sex, robbed, and beaten again. Each \ntime, his requests for protection were denied by the warden. He \nattempted suicide by hanging himself in his cell after a guard had \nignored the warning letter he wrote. He was in a coma for 4 months, \nafter which he died.\n  The purpose of the Prison Litigation Reform Act was to reduce or \neliminate frivolous lawsuits by inmates. I am all for that, but as \nthese examples make clear--and I have many other examples--the inmates \nI seek to protect with this amendment are not filing frivolous \nlawsuits. Or I should say, what is happening to them is not the stuff \nof a frivolous lawsuit. They are young; they are uneducated; they are \nsuffering from mental illness that prevent them from functioning at the \nnecessary level to file a lawsuit on their own. This is a population of \nuniquely vulnerable inmates who need representation in the legal system \nand are not receiving that representation, who need the protection that \nthe Federal courts have historically provided.\n  Unfortunately, this Congress seems to be moving, at least on the \nHouse side--and I pray we do not do the same thing--in the opposite \ndirection. Just last month, the House adopted an amendment offered by \nCongressman DeLay to the juvenile justice bill that would actually \nterminate all consent decrees entered into prior to the passage of the \nPrison Litigation Reform Act.\n  The DeLay amendment would say that even when prison conditions were \nhorrible enough to warrant the continuation of the consent decree, that \ndecree is going to be terminated by an act of Congress. No matter how \nmany children will suffer, the Federal judge's hands will be tied.\n  I think it is unconstitutional. Let me give a couple of examples and \nconclude, because if this amendment is agreed to tonight, this will \nnegate the DeLay amendment in the House of Representatives.\n  In Ironton, OH, a 15-year-old girl ran away from home over night, \nthen returned to her parents but was put in the county jail by the \njuvenile court judge to ``teach her a lesson.'' On the fourth night of \nher confinement, she was sexually assaulted by a deputy jailer. More \nthan 500 children had been incarcerated in the jail over the past 3 \nyears, many for truancy and other status offenses. Under the consent \ndecree, no children may be held in the jail. But with what is happening \nin the House of Representatives, that consent degree would not even \napply.\n  In Portland, ME, a lawsuit was filed after a young boy held in the \ncounty jail was sexually assaulted by an older adolescent. In 1987, \ncounty officials agreed to stop holding children in the jail because of \nanother decree.\n  In Clovis, NM, children were held in the county jail in unsanitary \nconditions, without adequate fire safety procedures, recreation or \nprogramming, or adequate separation from adult inmates. In 1983, local \nofficials agreed to stop using the jail as a detention facility for \nchildren.\n  The DeLay amendment would automatically terminate these decrees even \nif judges disagreed. This amendment would deal with this problem.\n  In Tucson, AZ, children in the juvenile detention center were held in \nleather restraints, mail was censored, there were inadequate treatment \nprograms, and the facility was overcrowded. Another consent decree \nprovided for the protection of these children.\n\n  In Oklahoma, there was pervasive brutality in the operation of the \nState juvenile correctional institutions. Children were often \nhandcuffed and hog-tied, and institutional staff relied on physical \nforce and intimidation to keep order. The ``punishment unit'' was dark \nand dungeonlike. Another consent decree took care of that.\n  Again, this amendment I offer tonight is an effort to make sure what \nwas done in the House will essentially be negated.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude. My amendment would not repeal, I say \nto my colleagues, the Prison Litigation Reform Act or adversely affect \nthe crackdown on frivolous lawsuits. It would say that in the case of \nthe mentally ill and juveniles, we should try to protect them. My \namendment would merely carve a narrow exception to the PLRA \nrestrictions in limited circumstances involving children and those who \nstruggle with mental illness.\n  Elie Wiesel once said: ``More than anything--more than hatred and \ntorture--more than pain--do I fear indifference.'' We must be vigilant \nand we must not allow ourselves to be indifferent to children's misery, \nparticularly those children who may be sick, difficult, and test our \npatience and our understanding. In that spirit, I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this modest and humane exception.\n  This amendment has the support of the Bazelon Center for Mental \nHealth Law, the Children's Defense Fund, the Justice Policy Institute, \nthe National Education Association, the National Network for Youth, The \nNational Prison Project of the ACLU Foundation, The Shiloh Baptist \nChurch, the Youth Law Center, and other organizations as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have 10 minutes on this amendment \navailable and note that what we hope to do is stack the vote on this \namendment with a couple other votes later in the evening. I reserve the \n10 minutes because Senator Hatch has asked to speak to this amendment, \nand I will allocate him that time.\n  I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator withhold for a moment?\n  Mr. GREGG. I withhold for the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. For some of us who have been here--I know, through no \nfault of the distinguished chairman, we have had 5 hours of quorum \ncalls today, approximately. This evening I know some of us would like \nto be with our families. I know it is a family-friendly Senate. But for \nthose of us who have families and wish to be with our families--I know \nthe Senator from New Hampshire feels the same way--can we get some idea \nwhen we might vote, so we can do that? If we had not had so many quorum \ncalls, we would be done by now.\n  Mr. GREGG. You are absolutely right. We are working on an extensive \nlist of amendments. We have it down to very few. My hope is that within \nthe next hour we can get an agreement on which amendments still have to \ngo forward. Hopefully, there will be virtually none, and then we can go \nto final passage. That is the game plan.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I was wondering if the distinguished manager would \nconsider\n\n[[Page S9027]]\n\ngoing ahead with the vote on this amendment only because I know a lot \nof times you get everybody on the floor for a vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would like to do that, but I believe Senator Hatch \nwishes to speak on it. It is represented he is headed in this \ndirection. This is his jurisdiction and your jurisdiction.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand. I do not object to that.\n  Mr. GREGG. As soon as Senator Hatch comes and speaks, maybe we can \nmove to vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I reserve the final 4 \nminutes of my time. I ask my colleague, I assume there are no second-\ndegree amendments in order to this amendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I reserve the final 4 minutes of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I reserve our 10 minutes and ask unanimous consent that no \ntime be credited against this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, I want to accommodate the \ndistinguished chairman, but I have been sitting here having rearranged \nother things waiting for this vote. If I object, as a practical matter, \nthe time on the amendment will run out under the unanimous consent, and \nwe will have to have a vote.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The distinguished Senator from New Hampshire says the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah is on his way here.\n  Mr. GREGG. It has been represented by staff that they are in the \nprocess of asking him to appear, and it was represented he would be \ncoming.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I also realize the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire could put in a quorum call, even though the time will run if \nthe quorum call is not called off. We could take a long time doing \nthat, but we would be right back to what happened earlier because that \nwill protect him in that sense. I will object to the time not running. \nI say to the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah is on the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. This is good news for all of us.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Why don't we let him do that and go that way so we could \nhave a vote in the next few minutes, I say to my distinguished friend \nfrom Utah.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think if we could go to a quorum call briefly, the \nSenator from Utah will be back and will be speaking in a brief period \nof time.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the managers of the bill, I have been working with \nmy friend from South Carolina. We are doing----\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these \ncolloquies not be debited to the amendment of the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah is on the floor. We \nhave been working with our Members and have cleared most everything \nwith the Senator from South Carolina. We only have a few more \namendments----\n  Mr. GREGG. As do we.\n  Mr. REID. Requiring a very short period of time. I think if we can \nget past this, we would be in a position to give the Senator a finite \nnumber of amendments that still need to be debated and voted on.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is excellent news, obviously. We are also making good \nprogress on our side. Hopefully, we can go to a vote and maybe make \nsome more progress.\n  I yield to the Senator from Utah whatever remains of my 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I won't take long. The amendment exempts \njuveniles and the mentally ill from the reforms accomplished by the \nPrison Litigation Reform Act, which was passed in 1996. This was my \nbill. This amendment would subject State prison systems to \nmicromanagement by the Federal courts. Keep in mind, I am also the \nauthor of Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons, which is to take \ncare of a lot of these difficulties. I cast the deciding vote back in \nthe late 1970s passing that bill.\n  Currently everyone whose Federal or constitutional rights have been \nviolated retains the ability to bring suit and to have any violation of \ntheir rights remedied by a Federal court. All this Congress did in 1996 \nwas to say courts could not go beyond remedying people's Federal rights \nto micromanage prison systems.\n  I am opposed to this amendment because of that. I know the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota is trying to do something right, \nbut basically it flies in the face of what the reform basically says. \nIf true constitutional rights are being violated, they have a right to \ngo to court under current legislation, both in the Civil Rights Act for \nInstitutionalized Persons and the Prison Litigation Reform Act, which \nwe passed in 1996.\n  I reluctantly have to oppose this amendment because I believe that \nbasically the current law takes care of it. His amendment would allow \nmicromanagement of the Federal courts.\n  I am happy to yield the floor. I hope my colleagues will vote with me \non this, and I believe there will be a motion to table. I hope they \nwill vote to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, so Senator Leahy can vote--I am very \nproud to have his support--I will add as an organization that supports \nthis the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, and I yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have consulted with the Democratic leader \non the unanimous-consent request I am fixing to propound. I think it is \na reasonable solution to deal with a couple of very important issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent when the Senate convenes on Monday, July 26, \nit proceed to an original resolution, to be placed on the calendar by \nthe majority leader immediately following the acceptance of this \nagreement, and the resolution be considered under the following \nrestraints:\n  That the resolution be limited to 3 hours for each leader or his \ndesignee; that there be one amendment in order for the Democratic \nleader regarding restoring the point of order on exceeding the scope of \nconference, which debate time shall come out of the resolution time; \nand that final adoption of the resolution must occur prior to close of \nbusiness of the Senate on Monday, July 26; Provided further that when \nthe Senate considers the agricultural disaster relief amendment to be \noffered by Senator Daschle, or his designee, to the agriculture \nappropriations bill, no rule XVI point of order lie against the \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I tried to listen to all \nof the verbiage. I understand that Senator Daschle or his designee \nwould be allowed to offer the emergency agriculture package without any \nrule XVI, but to what bill? To what measure would the Democratic leader \nbe permitted to offer that?\n  Mr. LOTT. To the agricultural appropriations bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Agricultural appropriations. And that will come up before \nwe leave in August?\n  Mr. LOTT. Right.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Reserving the right to object, I ask the leader a \nquestion. I assume a second-degree amendment to the first-degree \nconcerning agriculture would be out of order under rule XVI?\n  Mr. LOTT. Amendments thereto would have to be protected in the same \nway in order for that to go forward. We can't have one amendment in \norder and not have amendments thereto be in order also.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will have to object.\n  Mr. LOTT. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, now I understand the reservation that the \nSenator from Wisconsin has, and we can clarify that.\n  Let me read the last paragraph again. I think it will make it clear:\n  Provided that when the Senate considers the agricultural disaster \nrelief amendment to be offered by Senator Daschle, or his designee, to \nthe agricultural appropriations bill, no rule XVI point of order lie \nagainst the amendment or amendments thereto relating to the same \nsubject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could, this just provides for a fair \nopportunity for debate on the restoration of the rule XVI issue that we \ntalked about earlier today which would allow Members to have a debate \non that and a vote. If rule XVI is put back into place, of course, \nlegislation on appropriations bills will be limited, unless there is a \nrule by the Chair and it gets 51 votes.\n\n  We also have to debate and vote on the question of scope issues \ncoming back out of conference.\n  When we do bring up agriculture appropriations before the August \nrecess, there will be one amendment relating to disaster relief by \nSenator Daschle or his designee, and we will have an opportunity to \nhave our amendment on the same subject. It will not relate to dairy, I \nmake that clear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/22/senate-section/article/S9028-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9028-S9046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY AND RELATED \n              AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--Continued\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with regard to tonight, we need to just keep \ngoing forward. Senator Reid, as usual, is doing good work. The \nmanagers, Senator Judd Gregg and Senator Hollings, have been working. I \nthink if we will be serious--and I don't think a lot of Senators are on \neither side--in trying to get this completed, we still have a raft of \namendments that either need to be accepted or withdrawn.\n  I tried to see if we could do the work in the daylight, and I tried \nto see if we could do it on Mondays or Fridays. None of that seems to \nsuit the Senate. I think we ought to keep going as late as it takes to \nfinish this legislation. That way, we can get it completed. So it is at \nyour pleasure. I live on Capitol Hill, so I will be at home watching \nyou all on TV and wishing you the best. When the votes are ready, I \nwill come back and vote. It is up to the Senators. Do we get rid of \nthis long list of amendments that Senator Reid and Senator Gregg have \nbeen working on and keep going on into the night, or we can come in \ntomorrow. I am flexible either way. We have to get this bill done. I \nthink we ought to keep going.\n  I hope Senators will get serious about getting rid of some of these \namendments. There is no reason we shouldn't have another vote or two \nand final passage. I hope we can get that done. This is not aimed at \none side or the other. It is on both sides. Let's get serious and \ncomplete this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I take a moment to thank the majority \nleader for his willingness to work with us and cooperate to the point \nthat he has tonight to reach the agreement we have for Monday. I \nbelieve this is a fair compromise. We will have an opportunity to \ndebate it, offer an amendment, and have the vote. We will also have the \nopportunity to have a good discussion about how we might proceed with \nagriculture disasters. I think this accommodates many of the concerns \nwe have raised.\n  I also must share his hope that we can finish this bill at a \nreasonable hour. It is 9 o'clock. There is no reason within the next \nhour we couldn't finish this bill. I appreciate especially the deputy \nminority leader for all of the work he has done to get us to this \npoint. We are down to a couple of amendments on our side. I am hopeful \nwe can finish. There is no reason we can't do it reasonably soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, what is the parliamentary \nsituation right now on the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Gregg amendment, \nNo. 1272.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent to set that amendment aside and \ncall up an amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from Iowa wants \nto discuss an amendment that has been agreed to for 6 minutes, is that \nso?\n  Mr. HARKIN. About 6 minutes. I want to call it up first.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is it necessary to call it up?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to call up my amendment.\n  Mr. REID. We are going to put it in the managers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair cannot hear. We have quite a lot of \nracket here in left field. If we could take those conversations to the \nCloakroom, it would sure help us proceed with the business at hand.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I was under the understanding I was going to bring up my \namendment, I would talk for 5 minutes, they would accept it, and that \nwould be the end of it.\n  Mr. GREGG. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1304\n\n  (Purpose: To provide $100,000,000 in Byrne grant funding offset by \nreducing funds for travel, supplies, and printing expenses in the bill \n   by 5.8 percent and cutting funds for preliminary work on possible \n                      Supreme Court improvements)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask consent to set aside the pending amendment. I have\n\n[[Page S9029]]\n\nan amendment at the desk. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(a) The total discretionary amount made available \n     by this Act is reduced by $92,000,000: Provided, That the \n     reduction pursuant to this subsection shall be taken pro rata \n     from travel, supplies, and printing expenses made available \n     to the agencies funded by this Act, except for activities \n     related to the 2000 census.\n       (b) Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \n     shall submit to the Committees on Appropriations of the House \n     of Representatives and the Senate a listing of the amounts by \n     account of the reductions made pursuant to the provisions of \n     subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send this amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bingaman, \nMr. Biden, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Rockefeller, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \nFeingold, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Bryan. I thank the managers of the \nbill for their willingness to accept this.\n  What this amendment would do is restore the funding for the Edward \nByrne Memorial Grant Program to the fiscal year 1999 level. In the bill \nbefore us, the Byrne grant was cut by $100 million from the fiscal year \n1999 level; I might point out, on a bipartisan basis. This was cut \nfirst by the President. It was kept in as the bill came to the floor.\n  I am grateful they accepted this amendment because these grants go \ndirectly to local and State law enforcement. For fiscal year 1999, $552 \nmillion was distributed to State and local law enforcement agencies \nthrough Byrne grants. But for fiscal year 2000, the Byrne grant was cut \nby the White House and by the initial actions before we got to the \nfloor by more than 18 percent. This amendment would restore the fiscal \nyear 1999 funding level for the Byrne program.\n  The Byrne program is one of the most successful Federal anticrime \nprograms ever. It pays for drug enforcement task forces, more cops on \nthe streets, improved technology, and countless other valuable antidrug \nand anticrime efforts in local communities.\n  Restoring the Byrne funds is a top priority of law enforcement groups \nwho know the impact the program has had on crime and drugs. The \nNational Association of Police Organizations, the National Sheriffs' \nAssociation, and the International Association of Police Chiefs have \nall contacted me, urging full funding of this program.\n  I have received dozens of letters from Iowa police chiefs and \nsheriffs describing the kinds of setbacks they would suffer if these \ncuts go through. The Byrne grant provides critical staff and resources \nfor Iowa's 24 drug enforcement task forces working to stem the \nmethamphetamine epidemic in the region.\n  Iowa and the Midwest have made great strides in reducing \nmethamphetamine production and supply over the last few years. The \nproposed cuts to the Byrne program would only set them back in their \nuphill battle.\n  Sgt. Tom Andrew, head of the Southeast Iowa Inter-Agency Drug Task \nForce that covers six rural counties, wrote me saying that his task \nforce was made possible through the Byrne grant. Without it, most of \nthe small agencies in that region would lack the manpower, funds, \ntraining, and technology necessary to combat the methamphetamine \nproblem. Sergeant Andrew said:\n\n       A funding cut of this magnitude would have a detrimental \n     effect on our program and would, in all probability, result \n     in the elimination of the task force.\n\n  I have heard this story over and over again from my contacts in Iowa. \nThese drug task forces are funded primarily by the Byrne grants, and \nthey are desperately needed to fight our State's battles against \nmethamphetamine use. I know this is the case in most States across the \ncountry.\n  We just cannot afford to have an 18-percent cut in the Byrne grants \nin our States next year. It makes no sense to cut such a successful \nprogram that directly benefits our local communities.\n  I thank the managers for accepting this amendment, and I trust we \nwill keep the Byrne memorial grants at least at the same level next \nyear as they were this year.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Kansas also for his strong support \nof this program. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to add my comments in support of \nthis amendment that Senator Harkin has put forward. I think it is a \ngood way of doing it. Here is a program that puts money directly back \nto the States for law enforcement; lets them decide. We take this out \nof travel and office supplies over the rest of the bill. I think it is \nmuch better we spend the money back in Iowa, in Kansas, in our various \nStates, rather than on travel and printing here in Washington. That is \na good trade. That is a good way to go. That is why I supported this \namendment, and I am glad to hear the managers are willing to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1304) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1305\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the transfer of a firearm or ammunition to an \n                          intoxicated person)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1305.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 111, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 6   . PROHIBITION OF TRANSFER OF A FIREARM TO AN \n                   INTOXICATED PERSON.\n\n       (a) Prohibition of Transfer.--Section 922(d) of title 18, \n     United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (8) and (9) as paragraphs \n     (9) and (10), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (7) the following:\n       ``(8) is intoxicated;''.\n       (b) Definition of Intoxicated.--Section 921(a) of title 18, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(35) The term `intoxicated', in reference to a person, \n     means being in a mental or physical condition of impairment \n     as a result of the presence of alcohol in the body of the \n     person.''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am happy to make my remarks very brief \nbecause I understand this amendment will be accepted. I ask, if it is \nOK with the managers, if I can have 3 minutes to explain the amendment \nbefore it is accepted?\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask consent the Senator from California have 3 minutes \nand the Senator from Idaho have 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very relieved that we are seeing an \nacceptance of this amendment. It is so straightforward.\n  Under current Federal law, you cannot sell a gun to any person if the \nseller knows or has reason to believe any of the following, that the \nbuyer is: a felon, a fugitive, an addict of a controlled substance, is \nmentally ill, is an illegal immigrant, has been dishonorably discharged \nfrom the military, has renounced his or her American citizenship, is \nsubject to a court order on domestic violence or has been convicted of \na domestic violence misdemeanor.\n\n[[Page S9030]]\n\n  Already under current law anyone selling such a person a weapon, who \nknows, or has reason to believe this, cannot do that. All we are adding \nto this is: a person who is intoxicated. This is very simple. I am so \npleased we are going to see this accepted. Senator Craig is going to \nmake some comments.\n  But I want to talk about one case, a story about a woman named \nDeborah Kitchen, who is a quadriplegic, and she got that way because \nher ex-boyfriend shot her.\n  Tom Knapp consumed, by his own estimate, a fifth of whiskey and a \ncase of beer. He went to K-mart in Florida to buy a .22-caliber rifle \nand a box of bullets. He was so intoxicated that the clerk had to help \nhim fill out the Federal form required to purchase the gun, but he \nstill bought the rifle, he shot his girlfriend, and left her a \nquadriplegic.\n  Let me tell you another story. This one is from Michigan. It involves \nan 18-year-old named Walter McKay, who had engaged in a day-long \ndrinking spree and then went and bought ammunition for his shotgun. He \nwas so intoxicated that he could not remember whether it was a man or \nwoman who sold him the ammunition and could not identify what he \npurchased.\n  He took those shotgun shells, loaded his gun, and intended to shoot \nout of the back window of an acquaintance's truck. He was intoxicated. \nThe shot missed, ricocheted off the wheel of the truck, and hit Anthony \nBuczkowski. Mr. Buczkowski had to have a finger amputated and his left \nwrist surgically fused.\n  To me, it flies in the face of common sense that someone who is \nintoxicated is able to buy a gun or ammunition. And it flies in the \nface of the evidence.\n  A 1997 study in the Journal of American Medical Association found \nthat ``alcohol and illicit drug use appear to be associated with an \nincreased risk of violent death.''\n  Yet, Mr. Knapp and Mr. McKay could buy a gun and ammunition because \nit is not--I repeat, not--against the law to sell a gun to someone who \nis intoxicated. Gun sales are largely regulated at the federal level. \nGun sales involve Federal licenses and federal forms. This is a Federal \nresponsibility, and there should be a Federal law that stops this \noutrage.\n  So, my amendment makes it against federal law to sell a firearm or \nammunition if the seller knows or has reasonable cause to believe that \nthe buyer is intoxicated.\n  I want to talk about for a minute about one of the items on the list. \nNotice that the current federal law includes a prohibition on the sale \nof a gun to a drug user.\n  In fact, the way the law is worded, you do not even need to be high \non drugs at the time you buy the gun. If the seller knows or has \nreasonable cause to believe that you are a user or addict of an illegal \ndrug--regardless of whether you are high at the moment the gun is \npurchased--he is not supposed to sell you a gun.\n  So, I say to my colleagues, if you cannot buy a gun when you are high \non drugs, you should not be able to buy a gun when you are intoxicated \non alcohol.\n  That is all my amendment does.\n  I want to make one more point. And that is about what an individual \ncannot do when he or she is intoxicated.\n  States and localities have all sorts of laws that prohibit \nintoxicated people from engaging in certain activities and buying \ncertain things that are otherwise legal.\n  There are State laws that prohibit people from serving alcohol to \nsomeone who is intoxicated, selling fireworks to someone who is \nintoxicated, and renting an intoxicated person a car.\n  But in reviewing State laws, we could not find a single State that \nprohibited the sale of guns to intoxicated persons. So this amendment--\nwhich prohibits it under federal law--is really critical.\n  Guns and alcohol do not mix. And all I am saying with this amendment \nis that if you are intoxicated, you cannot buy a gun or ammunition. It \nis very reasonable, and it will save lives.\n  In many States in this Union, if you are drunk you cannot drive a \ncar, operate a boat, operate a snowmobile, fly a plane, even get on a \nplane, operate an all-terrain vehicle, ride a bike, and in West \nVirginia you cannot even obtain a tattoo if you are drunk. But you can \ngo in and buy a gun.\n  So I think this is a really important step forward as we try to pass \nsensible gun control legislation. It is common sense. I am very pleased \nit has been accepted, and I am happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, at this time we are taking a close look at \nthe Boxer amendment. I have visited with the Senator from California. \nShe is being very straightforward with this amendment. No one out there \nwants to suggest that anybody in the legitimate business of selling \nguns in a legal fashion should sell one to an intoxicated person.\n  I am concerned about the section of the code she is amending as it \nrelates to penalties. I certainly do not believe any of us would \nsuggest that anybody in a retail business who sells guns within the \ncontext of the Federal law becomes an alcohol expert or has \nbreathalyzer equipment or any of that kind of thing at the point of \nsale. We want to make sure that is clear, because that is asking a \nnonprofessional to make a professional determination that could \nultimately put them in tremendous liability, up to 10 years in prison. \nWe want to make sure that is perfectly clear.\n  I said to the Senator from California we will work with her to assure \nthat going into conference, that section of the code is clarified so \nher amendment is as clear as, obviously, she intends it to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friends and say that clearly we \nare not suggesting in any way, shape, or form that people who are in \nthe retail business and sell guns should have a breathalyzer. We are \nmerely adding to this list a person who is intoxicated.\n  Clearly, under current law, you do not have to be a psychiatrist or \nyou do not have to have a psychiatrist on your staff at K Mart, if you \nsell guns, to determine if someone is mentally ill. The way 18 U.S.C. \n922(d) reads is you have to know or have reasonable cause to believe. \nIt is a pretty broad definition.\n  I hope Senator Craig, in working with us, will recognize we are not \ndoing anything different than we do for all of these other problem \nareas. It is just going to make the law stronger and better. We will \nstop people, such as Thomas Knapp, from walking in and buying a gun \ndead drunk, flat-out drunk, going home, and injuring a perfectly \ninnocent person, in this case a loving person. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment?\n  The amendment (No. 1305) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1306\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that parties to the tuna convention pay their fair \n share of the expenses of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission \n      before they are allowed to export tuna to the United States)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1306.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 83, at the end of line 19, before the period insert \n     the following: ``: Provided further, That of the amounts made \n     available for the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission in \n     Fiscal Year 2000, not more than $2,350,000 may be obligated \n     and expended: Provided further, That no tuna may be imported \n     in any year from any High Contracting Party to the Convention \n     establishing the Commission (TIAS 2044; 1 UST 231) unless the \n     Party has paid a share of the joint expenses of the \n     Commission proportionate to the share of the total catch from \n     the previous year from the fisheries covered by the \n     Convention which is utilized by that Party''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, we need to have a \ntime agreement established on this amendment. The Senator from \nCalifornia has indicated she needs 30 minutes.\n\n[[Page S9031]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest, then, we have 45 minutes on this amendment: 30 \nminutes to the Senator from California, 15 minutes in opposition.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, I may not take the entire 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. It will be very helpful to a lot of people, I suspect, if \nwe can move this amendment along.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am hopeful we can get through this.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from California, I am \nin touch with the Senator from Delaware, and he is going to make a \ndecision soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the reason I need a little time is that \nthis is a complicated situation we are facing and it involves the whole \nissue of dolphin protection versus trade versus countries that owe \nmoney to the Tuna Commission and are not at this point paying their \nfair share. I will explain all of this.\n  All my amendment says is that until the Latin American countries pay \ntheir fair share to the Tuna Commission, they should not be allowed to \nexport their tuna into this country.\n  The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission has set these laws. It \nsays that each member country to the Commission must pay its required \nshare to the Commission and makes it clear that if they do not pay as \nrequired by current law, they may not export tuna into the United \nStates.\n  Right now in this appropriations bill--and I think this is very \nimportant--our contribution is way too large. We are picking up the \ncontribution of the Latin American countries. The contribution of each \ncountry is supposed to be based on the percentage of the catch in the \neastern tropical Pacific. Our catch at maximum has been 40 percent, and \nyet in this bill, we are paying 75 percent of the total cost of the \nCommission.\n  I do not mind being Uncle Sam, but I object to being Uncle Sucker, \nand that is what we are doing. We should not be picking up the tab for \ncountries that want the privilege of exporting their tuna into our \nmarkets.\n  There are three principal benefits from this amendment which, by the \nway, is cosponsored by Senator Biden, Senator John Kerry, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Feingold, and Senator Reid.\n  One, the amendment forces countries to pay their fair share of \nexpenses which they committed to do when they signed on to the \nCommission.\n\n  Two, the amendment will delay the importation of tuna that is caught \nby chasing and circling dolphins. It will stop that importation because \nwe know that purse seining on dolphin hurts and harm the dolphin. There \nwas a huge boycott in this country by the schoolchildren a long time \nago because purse seining was seen by them and by many Americans as \nbeing wrong: harass the dolphin, chase the dolphin because they happen \nto swim over the tuna, then they encircle them, catch them in the net \nand a lot of them are harmed, some of them are killed. If we delay the \nimportation of tuna that is caught in this fashion, we will be saving \nthe dolphin.\n  Third, because we put a freeze on the amount of money that can be \npaid by the United States, or I should say be limited to $2.35 million, \nwe are saving about $1 million, and that $1 million can go to a host of \nother places and commissions that deal with fisheries conservation.\n  It is important to note that the Tuna Commission is involved in many \nactivities that affect all the member nations. Why should we be picking \nup the tab for them? There are costs associated with this commission, \nand the convention clearly indicated that each Nation should pay its \nfair share. It says the countries that fish more in this particular \npart of the ocean should pay more.\n  The convention states:\n\n       The proportion of joint expenses to be paid by each High \n     Contacting Party shall be related to the proportion of the \n     total catch from the fisheries covered by this Convention * * \n     *\n\n  This was decided in 1949, but it still makes sense. Countries are \nrequired to pay a share of expenses relative to their utilization of \nthe fisheries.\n  The United States has always paid its fair share, but this year, for \nsome unknown reason, we are paying the share of these other nations. We \nare not the largest beneficiary of tuna from the eastern tropical \nPacific, and we should not be paying 75 percent of the cost. It must \nstop. Other countries should be carrying their own weight on this and, \nfrankly, when we had our big debate over purse seining on dolphins and \nchanging the label that goes on the tuna can--and many of us who really \ndid not like this law went along with it--we went along with it in part \nbecause finally at least it recognized that these other countries have \nto pay their fair share, and now they are not doing it.\n  And these countries are purse seining the dolphin. They are harming \nthe dolphin. We have seen a decline, since that tuna labeling bill went \ninto effect, of 80,000 dolphin a year killed down to 5,000. Now, \nunfortunately, we lost that battle. This tuna that is caught in Latin \nAmerican countries is going to come in, and these countries are not \npaying their fair share of the costs of the Commission.\n  So I think it is very important that we agree to this amendment. It \nisn't right that other countries are not paying their fair share. \nFrankly, it isn't right that other countries are encircling the \ndolphin, killing the dolphin, maiming the dolphin, and they want to \ncome in to our market, and they want to come in without doing anything \nto pay their share.\n  Scientists, consumers, and tuna companies agree that chasing and \nnetting is not safe for dolphins. The dolphin population in the eastern \ntropical Pacific are not recovering. And the harassment by these \nfishermen is a tremendous problem that is affecting dolphin \nreproduction. So what do we do? Instead of trying to encourage safe \nfishing methods, we say to the other countries: Just do not worry. Send \nthis tuna in. We will even pay your share of the cost of the \nInternational Tuna Commission.\n  I understand that Senator Biden is on his way over, so I reserve the \nremainder of my time for him. I am happy to yield to the other side who \nis opposing us on this amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, my friend from California, the \ndistinguished Senator, Mrs. Boxer, feels a sense of compassion about a \nnumber of things, one of which is this amendment, and the way in which \nshe, for the past 15 years, has been fighting and successfully, for the \nmost part.\n  I have been at her side to make sure we, quite frankly, keep dolphins \nfrom being killed unnecessarily. It sounds like a simplistic message, \nbut it is as basic as that.\n  What happened is we got rolled last year by the administration and by \nthe Senate because there are more votes here. We had the Dolphin \nProtection Act in place. I will not take the time to discuss it now. \nActually, it was basically eviscerated by what took place.\n  I was not particularly pleased with Vice President Gore's position on \nthis, the administration's position, nor the position of my \ndistinguished friend whom I respect very much, Senator Breaux, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska. That was a formidable array we \nfaced, and we essentially lost.\n  What did we do last year? Last year, we did basically what the treaty \nsaid, and said: Look, we have this mechanism set up where everybody \npays their fair share to make it work. The treaty says that. And I will \nagain, in the interest of time, not recite the elements of the treaty \nwhich say that and point out how the following sentence can be \ndistinguished that lays out the proportional requirement to participate \nin this.\n  But the bottom line is very simple. We made an agreement last year \ninvolving countries in question. They said they agreed, the \nadministration promised, and the Senate said everybody will pay their \nfair share. Simple. Wrong.\n\n[[Page S9032]]\n\n  We are paying 70 percent or more of the administration of this \narrangement, and we should only be paying 40 percent. The distinguished \nSenator from California comes along and says: Hey, look, let's make it \n50 percent. We will pay more than we should, but not this \ndisproportionate amount. And if they do not pay as they promised, they \nshould not get the benefits that flow from the agreement that \nencompasses their participation.\n  So it is real simple, I say to my distinguished friend from South \nCarolina, who asked me to be brief. I will be brief. This is not fair. \nThe Senator from California is right. She is willing to have us pay \nmore than our fair share but not essentially twice what our fair share \nis.\n  So I support the amendment, and I hope the managers of the bill may \nsee fit, based on their sense of justice and their notion of fairness, \nto accept the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend, Senator Biden. So many years ago we \nteamed up to make sure that the dolphin were protected. He has stuck \nwith me through this battle, along with his daughter Ashley.\n  Senator Harry Reid would like to be added as a cosponsor. I ask \nunanimous consent that he be added as a cosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield to my friend, Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California for her leadership on \nthis issue. It is late at night. People do not want to talk about this. \nThey want to go home. Some of us will go home and eat tuna salad. And \nif you eat tuna in your household, you bear some responsibility. You \nhope that your children will have that opportunity, and you hope that \nthe fisheries around the world are going to be handled responsibly.\n  We passed a law here in 1997 and said: We are going to do what we can \nto conserve the dolphin which have become victims of those who are \nfishing for tuna--international convention, international agreement, \ndolphin conservation. And we said: If you happen to be one of the \ncountries fishing for tuna that may endanger the dolphin, we are going \nto make you participate, spend some money to make sure this program \nworks based on the percentage of your catch. That is a very reasonable \nprogram, conserving the dolphin, saying to each country: Pay your fair \nshare based on what you catch.\n  I live in the Midwest. I do not live near an ocean. But I get it. I \nunderstand this. I just cannot understand why in this bill--before the \namendment by the Senator from California--that we are suggesting the \nUnited States should pay more than its share.\n  There are countries here, for example, that are paying nothing.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Costa Rica, 7.6 percent of the catch, proportion of \npayments, zero; Venezuela, 16.2 percent of the catch, proportion of \npayments, zero; Ecuador, 26.3 percent of the catch, proportion of \npayments, zero.\n  Why aren't these countries paying their fair share, their fishery \nindustry fishing for tuna, signatories to this agreement? They should \nbe paying their share instead of being subsidized by the United States.\n  I think we should take the money saved by the Senator from California \nand dedicate it to a lot of other international fishery efforts that \nare listed within this legislation. I am happy to support her \namendment. I think it is eminently fair. I hope those listening to the \ndebate will join us in making certain that every country lives up to \nits obligation.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank all my friends tonight for helping \nthis through. I know when it gets this late, people get upset with you \nfor trying to pass amendments and continuing to work because everyone \nis exhausted. I am, too.\n  I want to be clear for the Record, I was willing to debate this on \nFriday and put off the vote until Monday night, but we were unable to \nreach that kind of agreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the list of the \ncountries and what they have been paying.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n           Tuna/Dolphin Amendment to CJS Appropriations Bill\n\n       Question 1. How much were we intending to pay according to \n     the State Department budget request?\n       Answer. $3.4 million.\n       Question 2. What is the total proposed budget for the \n     IATTC?\n       Answer. $4.7 million.\n       Question 3. What proportion of the IATTC budget is the \n     State Department request? What is the U.S. proportion of tuna \n     utilization?\n       Answer. U.S. proposed proportion of the budget is 72%; U.S. \n     tuna utilization is approximately 40%.\n       Question 4. How many nations are members of the IATTC and \n     who are they?\n       Answer. 11 members: Costa Rica, Panama, Japan, France, \n     Nicaragua, Vanuatu, Venezuela, El Salvador, Ecuador, Mexico \n     and the United States.\n       Question 5. What is the estimated utilization of each \n     nation and how much to they pay?\n       Answer. The most recent data that has been compiled on \n     utilization is from 1996. According to those figures, the \n     breakdown is as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Proportion  Proportion\n                                                      of          of\n                    Country                      utilization   payments\n                                                  (percent)    (percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnited States..................................         39.6       91.4\nFrance.........................................          1          9\nJapan..........................................          9          7.7\nNicaragua......................................          0          0\nPanama.........................................          0           .01\nCosta Rica.....................................          7.6        0\nVanuatu........................................          0           .01\nVenezuela......................................         16.2        0\nEcuador........................................         26.3        0\nEl Salvador....................................          0          0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. The United States portion of its catch and utilization is \nless than 40 percent, yet it has been paying 91 percent of the cost of \nthe Commission. As my friend pointed out, there are nations here--\nEcuador is catching 26 percent, and they are paying nothing. So what \nare we doing here?\n  I know these countries are our friends, but the taxpayers are our \nfriends, too, besides which, these countries are purse seining on \ndolphin, and they are hurting those beautiful creatures. So why are we \nin such a rush to cover their payments and let them bring in this tuna?\n  My last point is another point my friend from Illinois made. He \nusually hits the nail on the head; he has done it again. Here are some \nof the other commissions that could benefit from the $1 million we are \nsaving in this amendment: the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, Pacific \nSalmon Commission, International Pacific Halibut Commission, \nInternational Whaling Commission--it goes on and on--North Atlantic \nSalmon Conservation Organization, North Pacific Marine Science \nOrganization, Inter-American Sea Turtle Convention Commission, \nCommission for the Conservation of Highly Migratory Species in the \nWestern and Central Pacific Ocean.\n  Here we see that what we are doing is taking money from our taxpayers \nto pay for the Latin American countries that are going to get away with \nnot paying their bill, and still they are allowed, unless we pass this \nBoxer-Biden-Kerry amendment, to export their tuna into this country--I \nwant to underscore--unlike the American companies, that are really good \nto the dolphin and use safe fishing practices. They will bring their \ntuna in after purse seining dolphin, harassing the dolphin, killing \nthem, maiming them, harming them, hurting their reproductive capacity.\n  With this amendment, I think we do a lot of good things. We save \nmoney, we help other commissions, and we stand up to our friends in \nLatin America and say: Pay the bills.\n  I yield to my friend from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia--I think she makes an outstanding case--as I remember it, \nisn't this the compromise agreement made with the opposition, that \nthese amounts would be paid by these countries, some 2 years ago?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. This is the compromise we agreed to back 2 years ago.\n\n[[Page S9033]]\n\n What you are trying to do by your amendment is merely to enforce the \ncompromise with those opposed to us in the first instance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is exactly on target. When we reached this \ncompromise, which wasn't a happy compromise for us, one of the clear \nunderstandings was that as these countries sought to export their tuna, \nwhich has been banned from this country, as my friend knows, for a long \ntime, because of their fishing methods which are so cruel to the \ndolphin, we said: If you have to bring this tuna in, then pay your fair \nshare of the commission.\n  Essentially, if you look at the public law that we did pass, you will \nfind it exactly here. In order for them to export, such nation, the \nsection says, ``is meeting the obligation of the International Dolphin \nConservation Program and the obligations of membership, including all \nfinancial obligations.''\n  This is the law Senator Stevens agreed to, Senator Breaux agreed to, \nSenator Gregg agreed to, and all of us--sad that we were that we didn't \nwin what we wanted--agreed to. Now they are not paying their fair \nshare, and they still say, well, let them export their tuna. This is \nwrong.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is the reason I wanted to make the point. I \nunderstand a motion to table may be made. I hope we won't table it. The \nSenator from California is only making real the compromise agreement \nentered into some 2 years ago with the opposition.\n  I thank the Senator for her leadership.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am happy to yield back the remainder of \nmy time. I think we have made our point.\n  What we are doing is essentially, with this amendment, enforcing the \nagreement that everyone agreed to. If they don't come on board on this, \nI think it makes this agreement and this public law completely \nworthless. I hope people will support this amendment. It is good for \ntaxpayers, and it is good for the dolphin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this time I move to table the Boxer \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1307, Withdrawn\n\n(Purpose: To reduce amounts appropriated by the bill and make available \n     funds for the international criminal tribunals for the former \n                         Yugoslavia and Rwanda)\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk. I have \ndiscussed this with the manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will take unanimous consent.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana wants to discuss \nthe amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  I will not ask for a vote tonight on this. I have discussed this with \nthe manager, but I want to call it to the attention of the Senate. It \nis something Senator Specter and I have worked on, along with many \nothers on both sides, dealing with monies to properly fund the War \nCrimes Tribunal.\n  It has come to our attention that even though we were successful in \nputting some additional funding into the War Crimes Tribunal for all \nthe situations occurring in Kosovo, some of the money, sort of the \nstandard amount of money that we spend on war crimes, is not present in \nthe current bill we are discussing.\n  I wanted to offer an amendment to restore it. Given the late hour, \ngiven the tight constraints, I have talked with the Senator, and he \nsaid they will try to work this out at conference. I bring it to the \nattention of the Senate to thank him for his consideration.\n  At this time I will withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1307.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 89, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n       sec. 408.

Mr. President, my amendment ensures the Small Business \nAdministration's Drug-Free Workplace demonstration moves forward. I \nwant to thank Senators Kyl, Sessions, Abraham, DeWine and Snowe for \njoining me in this effort. I also want to express my sincere \nappreciation to Senators Bond, Gregg, and Hollings, as well as their \nstaffs for their cooperation.\n  Last year, the Drug Free Workplace Act received broad bipartisan \nsupport when it was enacted. The House passed it 402-9, and the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business endorsed it without opposition. We see this \nprogram as a critical opportunity to assist small businesses who are \ngrappling with the hardships of drug abuse in the workplace.\n  The funding included in the FY2000 Commerce, Justice, State \nAppropriations bill, will enable these demonstrations to go forward. \nThe Small Business Administration's initial grant applications indicate \nthere is tremendous need for drug-free workplace programs. It has been \nreported that no less than 146 qualified grant applications were \nsubmitted to SBA for FY1999 funding, but no more than 30 will be \nfunded. At least 116 of these qualified potential drug-free workplace \ndemonstration programs will go unfunded leaving $12 million in unmet \nneed.\n  Again, I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure the \nDrug-Free Workplace demonstration continues to receive the support of \nCongress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters demonstrating my point be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 Drug Free America\n\n\n                                             Foundation, Inc.,\n\n                                                     July 8, 1999.\n     Hon. Jon L. Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: It is my understanding that you and \n     Senator Coverdell intend to offer an amendment to the \n     Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Bill that would \n     earmark the $6 million necessary to complete the Drug-Free \n     Workplace Demonstration. I would like to commend both of you \n     for your efforts on this issue.\n       Having worked with you ongoing on the drug issue, I know \n     how important it is to you to fight this problem on every \n     front possible. The workplace is truly a significant front \n     where the battle can be waged. If you consider what makes up \n     a community, you will note that most segments are a workplace \n     of some type. We have schools, churches, social services, law \n     enforcement, private industry, and the public sector--all of \n     which are workplaces. These workplaces provide the perfect \n     opportunity, through drug-free workplace programs, to access \n     our adult population and educate them on the problems \n     associated with drug and alcohol abuse, to intervene on those \n     with problems, and to provide needed treatment to those \n     already addicted.\n       Over the last ten years, employers have made tremendous \n     progress in addressing drug and alcohol abuse in the \n     workplace. Back in 1986, when I owned a drug testing company, \n     I found the positive drug rate in the workplaces of some \n     communities to be as high as 38 percent. That rate has fallen \n     significantly to below 10 percent. I know from personal \n     testimonies of employees that many casual users ceased to use \n     illicit drugs when their employers began drug testing because \n     they valued their jobs. These individuals, of course, will \n     not become addicted to drugs because they have ceased to use. \n     Their employers' drug-free workplace programs did indeed \n     serve as an effective deterrent to drug use. I also know many \n     employees who have received treatment for drug and alcohol \n     addictions as a result of drug-free workplace programs.\n       There is a concern, however, for small employers. While the \n     larger companies have implemented very effective, proactive \n     drug-free workplace programs, many small employers have not \n     done so due to financial limitations. I fear that this has \n     resulted in many drug users, who cannot work in the larger \n     companies due to being subject to testing, going to work in \n     smaller companies that do not address the problem of drugs. \n     Having been a small business owner, I know what a struggle it \n     can be to manage a small business and keep it financially \n     afloat. Since drug abusers typically are involved in more \n     accidents, file more workers' compensation claims, are absent \n     more often, and use more leave, they surely take an \n     unnecessary financial toll on our small employers.\n       The Drug-Free Workplace Demonstration grant monies are \n     greatly needed in order to assist small employers in \n     implementing and maintaining proper drug-free workplace \n     programs to minimize the probability of having drug-using \n     employees. An additional benefit would, of course, be the \n     family members of these employees. When an employee has a \n     drug or alcohol problem, it negatively affects the entire \n     family. If an employer can deter or detect and correct the \n     problem with an employee, everyone benefits.\n       Please consider me a resource and let me know what I can do \n     to support your proposed amendment.\n           Regards,\n     Calvina L. Fay.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Arizonans for a\n\n\n                                          Drug-Free Workplace,\n\n                                        Tucson, AZ, June 25, 1999.\n       As a drug-free workplace initiative, representing a \n     coalition of over 3,000 businesses, the majority of which are \n     small businesses, we are requesting your help for the drug-\n     free workplace demonstration project.\n       We are asking that you support funding the remaining $6 \n     million of appropriated funds for the Small Business \n     Administration in support of this very important drug-free \n     workplace demonstration program.\n       The need and demand for drug-free workplace resources is \n     growing, while the available resources are shrinking. It is \n     business, and small business in particular, that contributes \n     greatly and supports the economy of this country. It is time \n     for these small businesses to get the help needed to stop the \n     high costs brought about by substance abuse in the workplace. \n     You have an opportunity to make drug-free workplace a reality \n     for many small businesses in this country.\n\n[[Page S9035]]\n\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Regards,\n                                                Elizabeth Edwards,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             The Council on Alcohol and Drugs,\n\n                                       Houston, TX, June 28, 1999.\n     Re. Support for Continued Drug-Free Workplace Funding.\n       I am writing to request your support for continued funding \n     for the 1998 Drug-Free Workplace demonstration project. The \n     remaining $6 million of appropriated funds for this project \n     is critical if we are to continue to provide assistance to \n     our small business community to help them eliminate substance \n     abuse in the workplace. As you know, small businesses employ \n     over 50% of the nation's workforce. These businesses are at \n     increased risk for on the job accidents, absenteeism, \n     turnover, and many other factors related to substance abuse \n     in the workplace.\n       The Drug-Free Business Alliance represents a coalition of \n     over 1,000 businesses, the majority of which are small \n     businesses. For the past fifteen years we have been providing \n     education and assistance to small businesses in the Houston \n     community to help them reduce the risks and costs associated \n     with on the job substance abuse. There are still thousands of \n     small businesses in need of our services. The $6 million in \n     remaining funding is critical if drug-free workplace \n     coalitions are to continue to provide services to the \n     thousands of small businesses in need of drug-free workplace \n     services.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Becky Vance,\n     Director, Drug-Free Business Alliance.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am writing to seek your support for the continuation of \n     funding for the 1998 Drug Free Workplace Act which provides \n     for funds for demonstration grants.\n       Drug Free Pennsylvania has operated a drug-free workplace \n     initiative since 1993 called the Drugs Don't Work Here \n     program. We have helped hundreds of employees adopt a drug-\n     free workplace program and provide them with the technical \n     assistance and training. Our program is one of the most \n     successful and strongest in the nation. Our success is due to \n     the strength of our board members and the services which we \n     offer to small employers including policy development, a drug \n     testing consortium, an employee assistance consortium, \n     training and technical assistance for supervisors, and \n     education materials for employees.\n       Unfortunately, in the past, the problem of substance \n     abusing employees was overlooked to fund other youth-targeted \n     programs. The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1998 raises the \n     drug-free workplace component on the federal government radar \n     screen and should not be compromised by a funding cut in this \n     budget cycle. I would urge you to continue to funding of the \n     Drug Free Workplace Act of 1998 at or above the funding level \n     originally intended for this program. The resources to assist \n     small business needs to come from non-profit organizations \n     such as ours and should not be set aside after only one year \n     of funding.\n       As I am sure you know, over 70 percent of drug abuses are \n     employed and over 73 percent of heavy alcohol users are \n     working. Clearly, the biggest burden it borne by employers \n     who hire these individuals in term of lost productivity, \n     increased accidents and workers' compensation costs, and \n     higher absenteeism and tardiness. The problem of substance \n     abuse is compounded by the low unemployment rate where small \n     employers are faced with hiring employees who test positive \n     or not filling a position. Accordingly, the demand for drug-\n     free workplace programs is increasing in a time where \n     programs such as ours are facing severe funding cuts. It is \n     thus imperative that the funding not cease for this \n     invaluable program.\n       If I can be of assistance to you, please contact me. Thank \n     you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Beth Winters.\n                                  ____\n\n                                  Golden Eagle Distributors, Inc.,\n\n\n                                            Executive Offices,\n\n                                        Tucson, AZ, June 28, 1999.\n       Your help would be appreciated in support of the $6 million \n     appropriation for the S.B.A. drug-free workplace program,\n       These funds are certainly needed for small business to keep \n     drugs out of the workplace.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jack Braddock,\n     Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                AAA Landscape,\n\n                                                    June 29, 1999.\n     Re: DFW Funding\n       As an office manager of a mid-sized landscape company in \n     Tucson, Arizona, I have a request to make of you.\n       Please support funding the remaining $6 million of \n     appropriated funds for the Small Business Administration in \n     support of the very important drug-free workplace \n     demonstration program.\n       The need and demand for drug-free workplace resources is \n     growing, while the available resource are shrinking. With \n     unemployment at an almost unheard of low, the need for able-\n     bodied, able-minded workers is desperate. Drug usage, both \n     within the current work force and among the unemployed, is an \n     enormous problem. This demonstration program, even in its \n     infancy, is beginning to make a real difference. We must give \n     it a fair chance.\n       Please advise Senator Kerry that to kill the second-year \n     funding of $6 million for the Drug-Free Workplace \n     demonstration program would be a huge injustice to small \n     business owners all over America.\n       Thank you for your time and attention.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jeane Fearson,\n     Office Manager.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Pima County, Sheriff's Department,\n\n                                        Tuscon, AZ, June 28, 1999.\n       With the extra trillion-dollar budget surplus announced \n     today in Washington, it seems to me that $6 million to \n     conclude a vital drug-free workplace demonstration project is \n     a mere drop in the federal bucket.\n       I serve as chairman of Arizonans For A Drug-Free Workplace, \n     and active member of a national drug-free workplace \n     initiative that represents a coalition of more than 3,000 \n     businesses, the majority of which are small businesses, We \n     seek your help in obtaining funding for the remaining $6 \n     million of appropriated monies for the Small Business \n     Administration in support of the demonstration project.\n       As you are aware, the need, and demand for drug-free \n     workplace resources have been increasing, while available \n     resources have been skrinking--an obvious contradiction in \n     view of today's fiscal revelation. Doesn't Congress \n     understand that it is business--and small business, in \n     particular--that contributes mightily to the strength of this \n     country's economy.\n       We in the drug-free workplace initiative believe it is time \n     for these small businesses to receive the help needed to stop \n     the high costs brought about my substance abuse in the \n     workplace. You have the opportunity to make a drug-free \n     workplace a reality for many small businesses across our \n     land.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Asa Bushnell,\n     Community Relations Manager.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Concrete Designs Inc.,\n\n                                        Tucson, AZ, June 29, 1999.\n       As a small business manager, I want to express my concern \n     regarding Senator Kerry's move to kill the Drug-Free \n     Workplace funding. The drug issue in the work force is a \n     growing problem in the United States and businesses have \n     little support to help deal with this. Last week alone, I \n     sent five applicants to take a pre-employment drug screen and \n     only one went and tested negative for drugs. This ratio has \n     been typical over the past year. In addition, we continue to \n     lose employees through our random testing program.\n       You are in the position to help change this trend. Please \n     support the funding of the appropriated funds.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Deby Wiest,\n     President, General Manager.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                National Drug-Free\n\n\n                                           Workplace Alliance,\n\n                                 Milwaukee, WI, June 29, 1999.\n\n       It has recently come to my attention that there may be a \n     move afoot to abolish to second year funding for the Drug-\n     Free Workplace Act of 1999. This is of paramount concern as \n     these dollars are aimed at developing drug-free workplace \n     demonstration programs for small business nationwide.\n       Drug-free workplace programs began, historically, with the \n     country's largest corporations and over the years, have \n     inadvertently, squeezed substance abusers toward smaller \n     business. The tragedy is that most small businesses do not \n     have the resources to develop programs to protect their \n     employees as well as the quality of their products and \n     services, to say nothing of the end users.\n       It is well documented that drug-free workplace programs are \n     extremely effective at reducing absenteeism, workplace \n     injuries and theft, to name just a few. Furthermore, it is \n     also well documented that these programs are terrific case \n     finding entities in that they provide incentive as well as \n     vehicles for employees to access Employee Assistance Programs \n     or treatment options to assist in their recovery process. Of \n     course the recovery, or lack of it, has a tremendous impact \n     on families and coworkers as well as the above cited issues \n     as well.\n       Our Alliance represents drug-free workplace initiatives in \n     nearly thirty states and we see the benefits of these \n     programs, with thousands of employers, on a daily basis. We \n     believe that the wisdom of these programs was recognized when \n     this legislation was initially passed and would ask for your \n     assistance in protecting this valuable pilot that can have a \n     far reaching impact not only at a business level but at a \n     social level as well.\n       If I or the other Alliance members may be a resource to \n     you, please do not hesitate to call.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Jerome L. Houfek,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                Mountain Power\n\n                                        Tucson, AZ, June 30, 1999.\n       Mountain Power Electrical Contractor, Inc. is a small \n     business dedicated to providing a safe working environment \n     for our employees, clientele, and the public. Part of our \n     safety culture includes striving to maintain a drug free \n     workplace.\n       The U.S. war against drugs is loosing ground. According to \n     the reports issued by the Community Epidemiology Work Group\n\n[[Page S9036]]\n\n     (CEWG), the percentage of drug users is on the rise in \n     various categories, including heroin, marijuana, cocaine, and \n     methamphetamines.\n       It is imperative that our political leaders, businesses, \n     and the public at large support education and prevention in \n     order to win the war against drugs. Dealing with the \n     aftermath of our nation's drug problem in America is proving \n     senseless and useless.\n       Therefore, our firm is requesting your assistance for the \n     drug-free workplace demonstration project. We are asking that \n     you support funding the remaining $6 million of appropriated \n     funds for the SBA in support of this very important drug-free \n     workplace demonstration program. This program directly \n     provides and assists small businesses with education, \n     literature, and resources to maintain a drug free workplace \n     and keep abreast of local ordinances, as well as legislative \n     issues.\n       Thank you for your support and assistance in making the \n     drug-free workplace a reality for small businesses in this \n     country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Debra Graham-Garcia,\n     Business Development Specialist.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Tucson Airport Authority,\n\n                                        Tucson, AZ, June 29, 1999.\n       As a Board member of Arizonans For A Drug-Free Workplace, \n     and the Director of Personnel for the Tucson Airport \n     Authority I am requesting that you support the second year \n     funding of $6 million for the Drug-Free Workplace \n     demonstration program authorized under last year's Drug-Free \n     Workplace Act of 1998.\n       The current funding level for year-one at $3 million for \n     the demonstration will only fund thirty or less programs, \n     hardly enough time or money to conduct a proper demonstration \n     period. The $6 million second-year funding will provide a \n     much better opportunity for all of the drug-programs to prove \n     that a drug free workplace can truly make a difference.\n       Without the appropriated funding drug-free workplace \n     programs will have to close their doors or modify their \n     existence to survive. This is an alarming trend that is \n     already occurring in our country. The need for drug-free \n     workplace funds is increasing while the available resources \n     are decreasing.

Mr. President, I am proud that S. 1217, the Commerce, \nJustice, and State Appropriations Bill contains an amendment by Senator \nCoverdell and me, securing $1.8 million for drug-free workplace \nprograms. It has been a pleasure to have worked with Senator Coverdell \nin obtaining funding for this critical program.\n  Our amendment is a victory for business and the fight against drugs.\n  Last year Senator Coverdell and I authored the Drug-Free Workplace \nAct, which became law. It provided grants to organizations in order to \nassist small businesses in starting drug-free workplace programs. The \nAct was designed to encourage partnerships between small businesses and \norganizations that have experience in tackling the problem of drugs in \nthe workplace. Many small business are reluctant to implement drug \ntesting or employee-assistance programs, because they lack expertise in \ncrafting such programs.\n  As we all know, sustaining a competent, able work force hinges on our \nability to keep drugs out of the workplace. Funding was needed to \ncontinue this instrumental program. Securing $1.8 million for FY 2000 \nis a victory, considering the Administration chose to not fund this \neffort at all.\n  Statistics confirm that drug-free workplaces are more productive and \nefficient than those where some employees abuse drugs. For instance, 47 \npercent of workplace accidents are drug-related. Moreover, U.S. \nbusinesses lose $176 billion annually to substance abuse for costs due \nto accidents, absenteeism, and increased health care costs. Drug and \nalcohol abusers utilize 300 percent more medical benefits than non-\nabusers.\n  This amendment will enable small businesses to combat an evil that \nplagues their work forces, drug abuse.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1311\n\n  (Purpose: To amend provisions relating to the implementation of the \n June 3, 1999 Agreement of the United States and Canada on the Treaty \n    Between the Government of the United States of America and the \n Government of Canada Concerning Pacific Salmon and for other purposes)\n\n       S. 1217 is amended as follows:\n       At page 59, line 12 strike ``$20,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$18,000,000''.\n       At page 59, line 14 strike ``Alaska'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``$20,000,000 is made available as a direct payment \n     to the State of Alaska''.\n       At page 59, lines 22 and 23 strike the comma and the phrase \n     ``subject to express authorization''.\n       At page 60, lines 2 and 3 strike the comma and the phrase \n     ``subject to express authorization''.\n       At page 76, line 11 strike the comma and the phrase \n     ``subject to express authorization''.\n       At the appropriate place in ``TITLE VI--GENERAL \n     PROVISIONS'' insert the following new section:\n       ``Sec. __.

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Iran has been designated as a state sponsor of \n     terrorism by the Secretary of State and continues to be among \n     the most active supporters of terrorism in the world.\n       (2) According to the State Department's annual report \n     entitled ``Patterns of Global Terrorism'', Iran supports \n     Hizballah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, \n     terrorist organizations which oppose the Middle East peace \n     process, continue to work for the destruction of Israel, and \n     have killed United States citizens.\n       (3) A United States district court ruled in March 1998 that \n     Iran should pay $247,000,000 to the family of Alisa Flatow, a \n     United States citizen killed in a bomb attack orchestrated by \n     the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza in April 1995.\n       (4) The Government of Iran continues to maintain a \n     repressive political regime in which the civil liberties of \n     the people of Iran are denied.\n       (5) The State Department Country Report on Human Rights \n     states that the human rights record of the Government of Iran \n     remains poor, including ``extra judicial killings and summary \n     executions; disappearances; widespread use of torture and \n     other degrading treatment; harsh prison conditions; arbitrary \n     arrest and detention; lack of due process; unfair trials; \n     infringement on citizen's privacy; and restrictions on \n     freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, religion, \n     and movement''.\n       (6) Religious minorities in Iran have been persecuted \n     solely because of their faith, and the Government of Iran has \n     detained 13 members of Iran's Jewish community without \n     charge.\n       (7) Recent student-led protests in Iran were repressed by \n     force, with possibly five students losing their lives and \n     hundreds more being imprisoned.\n       (8) The Government of Iran is pursuing an aggressive \n     ballistic missile program with foreign assistance and is \n     seeking to develop weapons of mass destruction which threaten \n     United States allies and interests.\n       (9) Despite the continuation by the Government of Iran of \n     repressive activities in Iran and efforts to threaten United \n     States allies and interests in the Near East and South Asia, \n     the President waived provisions of the Iran and Libya \n     Sanctions Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-172; 50 U.S.C. 1701 \n     note) intended to impede development of the energy sector in \n     Iran.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President should condemn in the strongest possible \n     terms the failure of the Government of Iran to implement \n     genuine political reforms and protect the civil liberties of \n     the people of Iran, which failure was most recently \n     demonstrated in the violent repression of student-led \n     protests in Teheran and other cities by the Government of \n     Iran;\n       (2) the President should support democratic opposition \n     groups in Iran more aggressively;\n       (3) the detention of 13 members of the Iranian Jewish \n     community by the Government of Iran is a deplorable violation \n     of due process and a clear example of the policies of the \n     Government of Iran to persecute religious minorities; and\n       (4) the decision of the President to waive provisions of \n     the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 intended to impede \n     development of the energy sector in Iran was regrettable and \n     should be reversed as long as Iran continues to threaten \n     United States interests and allies in the Near East and South \n     Asia through state sponsorship of terrorism and efforts to \n     acquire weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to \n     deliver such weapons.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1320\n\n (Purpose: To provide additional funding for law enforcement programs \n                         regarding hate crimes)\n\n     SECTION 1. HATE CRIMES.\n\n       (a) Declarations.--Congress declares that--\n       (1) further efforts must be taken at all levels of \n     government to respond to the staggering brutality of hate \n     crimes that have riveted public attention and shocked the \n     Nation;\n       (2) hate crimes are prompted by bias and are committed to \n     send a message of hate to targeted communities, usually \n     defined on the basis of immutable traits;\n       (3) the prominent characteristic of a hate crime is that it \n     devastates not just the actual victim and the victim's family \n     and friends, but frequently savages the community sharing the \n     traits that caused the victim to be selected;\n       (4) any efforts undertaken by the Federal Government to \n     combat hate crimes must respect the primacy that States and \n     local officials have traditionally been accorded in the \n     criminal prosecution of acts constituting hate crimes; and\n       (5) an overly broad reaction by the Federal Government to \n     this serious problem might ultimately diminish the \n     accountability of State and local officials in responding to \n     hate crimes and transgress the constitutional limitations on \n     the powers vested in Congress under the Constitution.\n       (b) Studies.--\n       (1) Collection of data.--\n       (A) Definition of hate crime.--In this paragraph, the term \n     ``hate crime'' means--\n       (i) a crime described in subsection (b)(1) of the first \n     section of the Hate Crime Statistics Act (28 U.S.C. 534 \n     note); and\n       (ii) a crime that manifests evidence of prejudice based on \n     gender or age.\n       (B) Collection from cross-section of states.--Not later \n     than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Comptroller General of the United States, in consultation \n     with the National Governors' Association, shall select 10 \n     jurisdictions with laws classifying certain types of crimes \n     as hate crimes and 10 jurisdictions without such laws from \n     which to collect data described in subparagraph (C) over a \n     12-month period.\n       (C) Data to be collected.--The data to be collected are--\n       (i) the number of hate crimes that are reported and \n     investigated;\n       (ii) the percentage of hate crimes that are prosecuted and \n     the percentage that result in conviction;\n       (iii) the length of the sentences imposed for crimes \n     classified as hate crimes within a jurisdiction, compared \n     with the length of sentences imposed for similar crimes \n     committed in jurisdictions with no hate crime laws; and\n       (iv) references to and descriptions of the laws under which \n     the offenders were punished.\n       (D) Costs.--Participating jurisdictions shall be reimbursed \n     for the reasonable and necessary costs of compiling data \n     under this paragraph.\n\n[[Page S9038]]\n\n       (2) Study of trends.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States and the General Accounting Office shall complete a \n     study that analyzes the data collected under paragraph (1) \n     and under the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990 to determine \n     the extent of hate crime activity throughout the country and \n     the success of State and local officials in combating that \n     activity.\n       (B) Identification of trends.--In the study conducted under \n     subparagraph (A), the Comptroller General of the United \n     States and the General Accounting Office shall identify any \n     trends in the commission of hate crimes specifically by--\n       (i) geographic region;\n       (ii) type of crime committed; and\n       (iii) the number of hate crimes that are prosecuted and the \n     number for which convictions are obtained.\n       (c) Model Statute.--\n       (1) In general.--To encourage the identification and \n     prosecution of hate crimes throughout the country, the \n     Attorney General shall, through the National Conference of \n     Commissioners on Uniform State Laws of the American Law \n     Institute or another appropriate forum, and in consultation \n     with the States, develop a model statute to carry out the \n     goals described in subsection (a) and criminalize acts \n     classified as hate crimes.\n       (2) Requirements.--In developing the model statute, the \n     Attorney General shall--\n       (A) include in the model statute crimes that manifest \n     evidence of prejudice; and\n       (B) prepare an analysis of all reasons why any crime \n     motivated by prejudice based on any traits of a victim should \n     or should not be included.\n       (d) Support for Criminal Investigations and Prosecutions by \n     State and Local Law Enforcement Officials.--\n       (1) Assistance other than financial assistance.--\n       (A) In general.--At the request of a law enforcement \n     official of a State or a political subdivision of a State, \n     the Attorney General, acting through the Director of the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall provide technical, \n     forensic, prosecutorial, or any other form of assistance in \n     the criminal investigation or prosecution of any crime that--\n       (i) constitutes a crime of violence (as defined in section \n     16 of title 18, United States Code);\n       (ii) constitutes a felony under the laws of the State; and\n       (iii) is motivated by prejudice based on the victim's race, \n     ethnicity, or religion or is a violation of the State's hate \n     crime law.\n       (B) Priority.--In providing assistance under subparagraph \n     (A), the Attorney General shall give priority to crimes \n     committed by offenders who have committed crimes in more than \n     1 State.\n       (2) Grants.--\n       (A) In general.--There is established a grant program \n     within the Department of Justice to assist State and local \n     officials in the investigation and prosecution of hate \n     crimes.\n       (B) Eligibility.--A State or political subdivision of a \n     State applying for assistance under this paragraph shall--\n       (i) describe the purposes for which the grant is needed; \n     and\n       (ii) certify that the State or political subdivision lacks \n     the resources necessary to investigate or prosecute the hate \n     crime.\n       (C) Deadline.--An application for a grant under this \n     paragraph shall be approved or disapproved by the Attorney \n     General not later than 24 hours after the application is \n     submitted.\n       (D) Grant amount.--A grant under this paragraph shall not \n     exceed $100,000 for any single case.\n       (E) Report.--Not later than December 31, 2001, the Attorney \n     General, in consultation with the National Governors' \n     Association, shall submit to Congress a report describing the \n     applications made for grants under this paragraph, the award \n     of such grants, and the effectiveness of the grant funds \n     awarded.\n       (F) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this paragraph $5,000,000 for \n     each of fiscal years 2000 and 2001.\n       (e) Interstate Travel To Commit Hate Crime.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 13 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 249.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Hate Crimes Prevention Act \n     of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n     perceived race, color, national origin, religion, sexual \n     orientation, gender, or disability of the victim poses a \n     serious national problem;\n       (2) such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n     communities and is deeply divisive;\n       (3) existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n     problem;\n       (4) such violence affects interstate commerce in many ways, \n     including--\n       (A) by impeding the movement of members of targeted groups \n     and forcing such members to move across State lines to escape \n     the incidence or risk of such violence; and\n       (B) by preventing members of targeted groups from \n     purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n     employment or participating in other commercial activity;\n       (5) perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence;\n       (6) instrumentalities of interstate commerce are used to \n     facilitate the commission of such violence;\n       (7) such violence is committed using articles that have \n     traveled in interstate commerce;\n       (8) violence motivated by bias that is a relic of slavery \n     can constitute badges and incidents of slavery;\n       (9) although many State and local authorities are now and \n     will continue to be responsible for prosecuting the \n     overwhelming majority of violent crimes in the United States,\n\n[[Page S9039]]\n\n     including violent crimes motivated by bias, Federal \n     jurisdiction over certain violent crimes motivated by bias is \n     necessary to supplement State and local jurisdiction and \n     ensure that justice is achieved in each case;\n       (10) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n     motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local \n     authorities to work together as partners in the investigation \n     and prosecution of such crimes;\n       (11) the problem of hate crime is sufficiently serious, \n     widespread, and interstate in nature as to warrant Federal \n     assistance to States and local jurisdictions; and\n       (12) freedom of speech and association are fundamental \n     values protected by the first amendment to the Constitution \n     of the United States, and it is the purpose of this title to \n     criminalize acts of violence, and threats of violence, \n     carried out because of the actual or perceived race, color, \n     religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or \n     disability of the victim, not to criminalize beliefs in the \n     abstract.\n\n     SEC. __03. DEFINITION OF HATE CRIME.\n\n       In this title, the term ``hate crime'' has the same meaning \n     as in section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note).\n\n     SEC. __04. PROHIBITION OF CERTAIN ACTS OF VIOLENCE.\n\n       Section 245 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (c) and (d) as subsections \n     (d) and (e), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following:\n       ``(c)(1) Whoever, whether or not acting under color of law, \n     willfully causes bodily injury to any person or, through the \n     use of fire, a firearm, or an explosive device, attempts to \n     cause bodily injury to any person, because of the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, or national origin of any \n     person--\n       ``(A) shall be imprisoned not more than 10 years, or fined \n     in accordance with this title, or both; and\n       ``(B) shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for \n     life, or fined in accordance with this title, or both if--\n       ``(i) death results from the acts committed in violation of \n     this paragraph; or\n       ``(ii) the acts committed in violation of this paragraph \n     include kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual \n     abuse or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an \n     attempt to kill.\n       ``(2)(A) Whoever, whether or not acting under color of law, \n     in any circumstance described in subparagraph (B), willfully \n     causes bodily injury to any person or, through the use of \n     fire, a firearm, or an explosive device, attempts to cause \n     bodily injury to any person, because of the actual or \n     perceived religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability \n     of any person--\n       ``(i) shall be imprisoned not more than 10 years, or fined \n     in accordance with this title, or both; and\n       ``(ii) shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for \n     life, or fined in accordance with this title, or both, if--\n       ``(I) death results from the acts committed in violation of \n     this paragraph; or\n       ``(II) the acts committed in violation of this paragraph \n     include kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual \n     abuse or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an \n     attempt to kill.\n       ``(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the circumstances \n     described in this subparagraph are that--\n       ``(i) in connection with the offense, the defendant or the \n     victim travels in interstate or foreign commerce, uses a \n     facility or instrumentality of interstate or foreign \n     commerce, or engages in any activity affecting interstate or \n     foreign commerce; or\n       ``(ii) the offense is in or affects interstate or foreign \n     commerce.\n       ``(3) No prosecution of any offense described in this \n     subsection may be undertaken by the United States, except \n     upon the certification in writing of the Attorney General, \n     the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General, \n     or any Assistant Attorney General specially designated by the \n     Attorney General that--\n       ``(A) he or she has reasonable cause to believe that the \n     actual or perceived race, color, national origin, religion, \n     sexual orientation, gender, or disability of any person was a \n     motivating factor underlying the alleged conduct of the \n     defendant; and\n       ``(B) that he or his designee or she or her designee has \n     consulted with State or local law enforcement officials \n     regarding the prosecution and determined that--\n       ``(i) the State does not have jurisdiction or refuses to \n     assume jurisdiction;\n       ``(ii) the State has requested that the Federal Government \n     assume jurisdiction; or\n       ``(iii) actions by State and local law enforcement \n     officials have or are likely to leave demonstratively \n     unvindicated the Federal interest in eradicating bias-\n     motivated violence.''.\n\n     SEC. __05. DUTIES OF FEDERAL SENTENCING COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Amendment of Federal Sentencing Guidelines.--Pursuant \n     to its authority under section 994 of title 28, United States \n     Code, the United States Sentencing Commission shall study the \n     issue of adult recruitment of juveniles to commit hate crimes \n     and shall, if appropriate, amend the Federal sentencing \n     guidelines to provide sentencing enhancements (in addition to \n     the sentencing enhancement provided for the use of a minor \n     during the commission of an offense) for adult defendants who \n     recruit juveniles to assist in the commission of hate crimes.\n       (b) Consistency With Other Guidelines.--In carrying out \n     this section, the United States Sentencing Commission shall--\n       (1) ensure that there is reasonable consistency with other \n     Federal sentencing guidelines; and\n       (2) avoid duplicative punishments for substantially the \n     same offense.\n\n     SEC. __06. GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Authority to Make Grants.--The Office of Justice \n     Programs of the Department of Justice shall make grants, in \n     accordance with such regulations as the Attorney General may \n     prescribe, to State and local programs designed to combat \n     hate crimes committed by juveniles, including programs to \n     train local law enforcement officers in investigating, \n     prosecuting, and preventing hate crimes.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     this section.\n\n     SEC. __07. AUTHORIZATION FOR ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO ASSIST \n                   STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Department \n     of the Treasury and the Department of Justice, including the \n     Community Relations Service, for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and \n     2002 such sums as are necessary to increase the number of \n     personnel to prevent and respond to alleged violations of \n     section 245 of title 18, United States Code (as amended by \n     this title).\n\n     SEC. __08. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this title, an amendment made by this \n     title, or the application of such provision or amendment to \n     any person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, \n     the remainder of this title, the amendments made by this \n     title, and the application of the provisions of such to any \n     person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am committed in my view that the Senate \nmust lead and speak against hate crimes.\n  Many of America's greatest strides in civil rights progress took \nplace during recent generations--from Congress' protection of Americans \nfrom employment discrimination on the basis of race, sex, color, \nreligion and national origin with the passage of the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964, to the protection of the disabled with the passage of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act in 1990, and many other important \npieces of legislation.\n  However, while America's elected officials have striven mightily \nthrough the passage of such measures to stop discrimination in the \nworkplace, or to the hands of government actors, what remains \ntragically unaddressed in large part is discrimination against peoples' \nown security--that most fundamental right to be free from physical \nharm.\n  Despite our best efforts, discrimination continues to persist in many \nforms in this country, but most sadly in the rudimentary and malicious \nform of violence against individuals because of their identities.\n  As much as we condemn all crime, hate crime can be more sinister than \nnon-hate crime. A crime committed not just to harm an individual, but \nout of the motive of sending a message of hatred to an entire \ncommunity--oftentimes a community defined on the basis of immutable \ntraits--is appropriately punished more harshly, or in a different \nmanner, than other crimes. Moreover, hate crimes are more likely to \nprovoke retaliatory crimes; they inflict deep, lasting and distinct \ninjuries--some of which never heal--on victims and their family \nmembers; they incite community unrest; and, ultimately, they are \ndownright un-American.\n  I am resolute in my view that the federal government can play a \nvaluable role in responding to hate crime. One example here is my \nsponsorship of the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990, another is the \npassage in 1996 of the Church Arson Protection Act.\n  Given the seriousness of our objective to eradicate hate crime, it is \nimperative that any measure abide by the constitutional limitations \nimposed on Congress, and be cognizant of the limitations on Congress' \nenumerated powers that are routinely enforced by the courts. This is \nmore true today than it would have been even a mere decade ago, given \nthe significant revival by the U.S. Supreme Court of the federalism \ndoctrine in a string of decisions beginning in 1992.\n  I have therefore proposed a response to hate crimes that is not only \nas effective as possible, but that carefully navigates the rocky shoals \nof these\n\n[[Page S9040]]\n\ncourt decisions. To that end, I have prepared a measure that I believe \nwill be not only an effective one, but one that would avoid altogether \nthe constitutional risks that attach to other possible federal \nresponses that have been raised.\n  There are four principal components to my approach:\n  First, it creates a meaningful partnership between the federal \ngovernment and the states in combating hate crime, by establishing \nwithin the Justice Department a fund to assist state and local \nauthorities in investigating and prosecuting hate crime. Much of the \ncited justification given by those who advocate broad federal \njurisdiction over hate crimes is a lack of adequate resources at the \nstate and local level.\n  Accordingly, before we take the step of making every criminal offense \nmotivated by a hatred of someone's immutable traits a federal offense, \nit is imperative that we equip states and localities with the resources \nnecessary so that they can undertake these criminal investigations and \nprosecutions on their own.\n  Second, my approach undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the raw \ndata that has been collected pursuant to the 1990 Hate Crime Statistics \nAct, including a comparison of the records of different jurisdictions--\nsome with hate crime laws, others without--to determine whether there \nis, in fact, a problem in certain states' prosecution of those criminal \nacts constituting hate crimes.\n  Third, my approach directs an appropriate, neutral forum to develop a \nmodel hate crimes statute that would enable states to evaluate their \nown laws, and adopt--in whole or in part from the model statute--hate \ncrime legislation at the state level.\n  One of the arguments cited for a federalization of enforcement is the \nvarying scope and punitive force of state laws. Yet there are many \nareas of grave national concern--such as drank driving, by way of \nexample--that are appropriately left to the states for criminal \nenforcement and punishment.\n  Before we make all hate crimes federal offenses, I believe we should \npursue avenues that advance consistency among the states through the \nvoluntary efforts of their legislatures. Perhaps, upon completion of \nthis model hate crime law, Congress will review its recommendation and \nconsider additional ways to promote uniformity among the states.\n  Fourth, my proposal makes a long-overdue modification of our existing \nfederal hate crime law (passed in 1969) to allow for the prosecution by \nfederal authorities of those hate crimes that are classically within \nfederal jurisdiction--that is, hate crimes in which state lines have \nbeen crossed.\n  I believe that passage of this comprehensive measure will prove a \nstrong antidote to the scourge of hate crimes.\n  It is no answer for the Senate to sit by silently while these crimes \nare being committed. The ugly, bigoted, and violent underside of some \nin our country that is reflected by the commission of hate crimes must \nbe combated at all levels of government.\n  For some, federal leadership necessitates federal control. I do not \nsubscribe to this view, especially when it comes to this problem. It \nhas been proposed by some that to combat hate crime Congress should \nenact a new tier of far-reaching federal criminal legislation. That \napproach strays from the foundations of our constitutional structure--\nnamely, the first principles of federalism that for more than two \ncenturies have vested states with primary responsibility for \nprosecuting crimes committed within their boundaries.\n  As important as this issue is, there is little evidence such a step \nis warranted, or that it will do any more than what I have proposed. In \nfact, one could argue that national enforcement of hate crime could \ndecrease if states are told the federal government has assumed primary \nresponsibility over hate crime enforcement.\n  Accordingly, we must lead--but lead responsibly--recognizing that we \nlive in a country of governments of shared and divided \nresponsibilities.\n  I encourage this body to question the dogma that federal leadership \nmust include federal control, and I encourage this body to act anew by \nsupporting a proposal that is far-reaching in its efforts to stem hate \ncrime, and that is at the same time respectful of the primacy states \nhave traditionally enjoyed in prosecuting crimes committed within their \nboundaries.\n  My proposal should unite all of us on the one point about which we \nshould most fervently agree--that the Senate must speak firmly and \nmeaningfully in denouncing as wrong in all respects those actions we \nhave increasingly come to know as hate crimes. Our continued progress \nin fighting to protect Americans' civil rights demands no less.\n  I take note that there are now two different hate crime measures that \nhave been accepted by the Senate. It is my hope that the conference \nwill consider the Hatch amendment's approach to be the wiser and the \nmore responsible, and accordingly adopt it. Alternatively, however, it \nis my hope that some accord might be reached between the two versions \nthat respects the constitutional and federalism boundaries I have \ndiscussed, and to the extent it is not, I may choose to pursue adoption \nof my measure through the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, as a member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee I have spoken out against hate crimes of many kinds \nand in many lands. For that reason I cannot be silent at home. I \nbelieve that government's first duty is to defend its citizens. To \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. To defend them \nregardless of their status, be they female, disabled or gay. The Hate \nCrimes Prevention Act is now a symbol that can become substance. By \nchanging this law we can change hearts and minds as well.\n  The law is a teacher and we should teach our fellow citizens that all \ncrime is hateful. But we can also teach that some crime is so odious \nthat an extra measure of prosecution is demanded by us, so that it will \nnever again be repeated among us.\n  Never again should we in the federal government withhold our help or \nstand idly by when a Matthew Shepard is tied to a fence, beaten and \nleft to die because he is gay. Never again should we defer to others \nwhen one James Byrd, Jr. is dragged to his death because he is black. \nNo, in these cases and in too many more, the Federal Government must \nhave the power to persuade, to pursue and to prosecute when hate is the \nmotive of violence against American victims, no matter their state, no \nmatter their minority or vulnerability.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \nto protect Americans from hate crimes. It is unfortunate that the \namendment's chief sponsor, Senator Ted Kennedy, couldn't be here to \ntake part in this debate. Senator Kennedy has worked tirelessly to \nenact this crucial piece of legislation. He has my heartfelt \nappreciation for his work on this and my sympathy for the loss of his \nnephew. I can't possibly match his passion and eloquence on this issue, \nbut I am here today to discuss and support his amendment on hate crimes \nprevention.\n  Hate crime is real. Despite great gains in equality and civil rights \nover the later part of this century, hate crimes are still being \ncommitted. Those who commit these heinous crimes must be punished.\n  We all remember Matthew Shepard. He was a young man who just last \nfall was viciously struck down in the prime of his life. Tragically, he \nis now a reminder of what happens when he do not stand up to hate and \nbigotry. We must treat hate crimes as the deadly threat they are and do \nmore to prevent them. These are not simply assaults. They are violent \ncrimes motivated by hate and bigotry.\n  Passing this amendment gives us more tools to fight hate. I am \npleased to join with many of my colleagues as a co-sponsor of this \nimportant legislation. The amendment would expand the definition of a \nhate crime and improve prosecution of those who act out their hate with \nviolence. If someone harms another because of the victim's race, \ngender, color, religion, disability or sexual orientation, they will be \npunished. No longer will the activity of the victim matter, but the \nactions and motivations of the perpetrator will be the focus. It is \nimportant to note that the prosecutor would still have to convince a \njury beyond a reasonable doubt that the criminal act was motivated by \nprejudice.\n  No one can beat a person to death and leave them to die without being\n\n[[Page S9041]]\n\nmotivated by a deep sense of hate. In the case of Matthew Shepard, it \nwas no simply robbery. The motive was hate.\n  I know some of my colleagues argue that the states are doing an \nadequate job of handling hate crimes on their own. I commend them for \ntheir efforts, but I believe the federal government has a further role \nin this as well. We already prosecute at the federal level many crimes \nthat are motivated by prejudice. We need to strengthen these federal \nhate crimes laws and increase the role of the federal government in \nending this violence. It wasn't that many years ago that we stood up \nfor equality and justice by forcing the states and private citizens to \nend segregation and discrimination. Now we must do the same for hate \ncrimes against any of our citizens.\n  I ask that my statement appear in the Record immediately following \nthe text of the hate crimes amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in \nexpressing my strong support for the Hate Crimes Prevention Amendment, \nlegislation of which I am a cosponsor.\n  The Hate Crimes Prevention Amendment is urgently needed to compensate \nfor two limitations in the current law. First, the current federal hate \ncrimes law covers only crimes motivated by bias on the basis of race, \ncolor, religion or national origin. As a result, federal authorities \ncannot prosecute individuals who commit violent crimes against others \nbecause of their sexual orientation, gender, or disability.\n  In addition, current law limits federal hate crime prosecutions to \ninstances in which the victims was targeted because he or she was \nexercising one of six narrowly defined federally-protected activities \n(such as serving on a jury, attending a public school, eating at a \nrestaurant or lodging at a hotel). As a result, the law does not reach \nmany cases where individuals kill or injure others because of racial or \nreligious hatred.\n  The Hate Crimes Amendment would remedy the glaring gaps and \ninadequacy of the current law by broadening the federal jurisdiction to \ncover all violent crimes motivated by racial or religious hatred, \nregardless of whether the victim was exercising a federally protected \nright. It would also include sexual orientation, gender and disability \nto the list of protected categories within current federal hate crime \nlaw, provided there is a sufficient connection with interstate \ncommerce.\n  At the same time, federal involvement would only come into play if \nthe Attorney General certifies that a federal prosecution is necessary \nto secure substantial justice. In recent years, the existing federal \nhate crimes law has been used only in carefully selected cases where \nthe state criminal justice system did not achieve a just result.\n  What does this mean? It means that crimes based on race, color, \nreligion or national origin would be covered under the federal hate \ncrimes law whenever the defendant causes bodily injury, or through the \nuse of fire, a firearm, or an explosive, attempts to case injury.\n  Crimes based on sexual orientation, gender or disability would be \nlimited to the same types of violent crimes, but only if the crime has \na sufficient connection with interstate commerce.\n  In all cases, the prosecution would have to show that the crime was \nmotivated in part by the actual or perceived sexual orientation, \ngender, or disability of the victim--and this would be a matter for the \njury to determine.\n  As would be the case for every element of a criminal offense, federal \nprosecutors would have to prove motivation beyond a reasonable doubt. \nIn all cases, these prosecutions would present evidence that a \nmotivating factor in the crime was bias against a particular group.\n  Hate crimes in these cases would carry a heavy penalty. Persons who \ncause bodily injury to another, or, through the use of fire, firearms, \nor explosives, attempts to cause bodily injury in the furtherance of a \nhate crime would face imprisonment up to 10 years. If the hate crime \nresults in death or the offense included kidnapping, aggravated sexual \nabuse or an attempt to kill, the convicted offender could face life \nimprisonment.\n  Mr. President, for many years I have been deeply concerned about hate \ncrimes and the immeasurable impact they have on victims, their families \nand our communities. In 1993, I sponsored the Hate Crimes Sentencing \nEnhancement Act, which was signed into law in 1994 as a part of the \nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The Act \nincreased the penalties for hate crimes directed at individuals because \nof their perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \ndisability or sexual orientation.\n  Today, I believe the Hate Crimes Prevention Amendment, builds on this \neffort by modifying the current law to allow the federal government to \nprovide the vital assistance to states in investigating of crimes of \nthis magnitude.\n  This legislation is long overdue, Mr. President. The brutal murders \nlast year of an African American, James Byrd, in Texas; a gay man, \nMatthew Shepard, in Wyoming; and the murderous rampage in Littleton, \nColorado earlier this year vividly portray why this legislation is so \nurgently needed.\n  Just recently, our nation awakened to the news of drive-by shooting \nattacks on Jews, and African-American, and Asian-Americans in Chicago, \nIllinois. These shootings were the despicable acts of virulent hatred. \nUndoubtedly these crimes have affected so many lives beyond its \nimmediate victims.\n  Two weeks before the shootings, three synagogues were torched in \nSacramento, California, sending shock waves throughout the Jewish \ncommunity in America.\n  Sadly, hate crimes are becoming too commonplace in America. According \nto the U.S. Department of Justice, in 1997, the last year for which we \nhave statistics, 8,049 hate crime incidents were reported in the United \nStates. That is almost one such crime per hour. Within these incidents, \nthere were 10,255 victims of these crimes.\n  Of that total, 4,710 or 58.5% of the crime were committed on account \nof the victim's race. Of these reported crimes, there were almost 1,300 \nvictims of anti-black crimes; 649 victims of anti-Hispanic crimes; and \n466 victims of anti-Asian crimes.\n  In that same year, 1,385 or roughly 17% of the victims were targeted \nbecause of their religious affiliation. The number of anti-Jewish \nincidents is second only to those against blacks and far exceeds \noffenses against all other religious groups combined. Moreover, while \nby most accounts anti-Semitism in America has declined dramatically \nover the years, the level of violence is escalating.\n  The FBI reports that crimes against gays, lesbians and bisexuals \nranked third in reported hate crimes in 1997, registering 1,102 or \n13.7% of reported incidents. And, gender-motivated violence occurs in \nour country at alarming rates. According to the Leadership Conference \non Civil Rights, ``society is beginning to realize that many assaults \nagainst women are not `random' acts of violence but are actually bias-\nrelated crimes.''\n  In addition, according to the California Attorney General, more than \n1,800 of the 8,000 hate crimes reported by the FBI were committed in \nCalifornia. That's a shocking number when one considers the motivation \nbehind a hate crime. These are truly among the ugliest of crimes, in \nwhich the perpetrator thinks the victim is less of a human being \nbecause of his or her gender, skin color, religion, sexual orientation \nor disability.\n  By enacting this legislation, federal prosecutors will be able to \nwork in full partnership with their state counterparts. In Wyoming, \ndespite clear evidence that the killing of Matthew Shepard was \nmotivated by bigotry against homosexuals, federal authorities lacked \njurisdiction to assist state and local authorities in investigating the \ncase.\n  It is imperative, therefore, that Congress move swiftly to address \nthis situation and enact this legislation. Although the Byrd and \nShepard, as well as the Littleton and Chicago atrocities, all have \nshocked the conscience of our nation, many hate crimes happen daily in \nour communities and do not receive national exposure and universal \ncondemnation.\n  For example, an 18-year-old San Francisco youth was savagely attacked \nand beaten after a recent athletic event between St. Ignatius College \nPreparatory School and Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory School. \nDuring the beating, his attackers yelled racial\n\n[[Page S9042]]\n\nslurs at him. Just a few days later, a 17-year-old senior at San Marin \nHigh School was beaten outside his school in Novato, a derogatory word \nregarding his presumed sexual orientation was etched into his arm with \na pen.\n  And, in an especially disturbing case in Ventura, California, four \nskinheads attacked a Latino couple and an African-American couple \nreturning from a high school homecoming date. Singing, and then \nshouting racial epithets, the skinheads followed the two couples and \nthrew a brick at the head of the African-American teenager. When the \nstudents tried to drive away, the skinheads kicked the car and beat it \nwith a baseball bat, causing $2,000 in damage.\n  These recent cases show far more vividly than I can express here \ntoday why we need this legislation now more than ever.\n  This amendment does not create any ``special interests.'' Hate crimes \nare not just the concern of any one race, one gender, or one segment of \nsociety. The victims of these types of attacks are black and white, \nyoung and old, gay and straight, mother and son, father and daughter. \nMost importantly, they are all human beings whom other human beings \nloved and depended on. No one, no matter where he lives or to what \ngroup she belongs can be certain who will suffer from senseless acts of \nviolence sparked by bigotry, hatred and prejudice.\n  History is replete with instances in which mindless fear, ignorance \nand prejudice propel unspeakable acts of inhumanity. There is a great \nmonument to this in this very city: the Holocaust Museum. The Holocaust \nMuseum serves as a stark and cogent reminder of how unchecked hatred \ncan spiral into the genocide of countless millions of Jews and others \nwho were singled out by Nazi Germany for no other reason than that they \nwere different.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, as recent events suggest, we do not \nhave to look back sixty years to find example of inhumanity fostered by \nhate. We can look across the oceans to Kosovo, where the consequences \nof ``ethnic cleansing,'' mass rapes, and rampant crime, all point to \nthe utter disregard for life and human dignity.\n\n  Mr. President, American values do not include attacking those who are \n``different'' or those with whom we disagree. No one here can \nreasonably argue that violently attacking a person because of his or \nher race, gender, disability, or sexual orientation is an acceptable \nform of behavior.\n  No one here can reasonably argue that protecting American values \nshould not include protecting women, disabled persons, or gays and \nlesbians from hate crimes.\n  And no one here today need fear a breakdown of society simply because \nwe extend Federal protection from acts of violent prejudice to those \nmembers of our society who currently face such an extraordinary threat \nof hate violence.\n  Instead, as Americans, we value the freedom to be individuals. We \nvalue the freedom to express ourselves peacefully. And, above all, Mr. \nPresident, we value freedom from fear and tyranny.\n  And, what we must take from the experience of World War II and Kosovo \nis that our nation must never sit still and permit acts of hatred to go \nunpunished and undeterred.\n  That is why, if we truly want to defend American values, we should \nwork to give our citizens protection from those who would do them harm \nsimply based upon their race, gender, disability or sexual orientation.\n  And, the Hate Crimes Prevention Amendment aims to send a message to \nour nation and the world that the singling out of an individual because \nof race, religion, sexual orientation, gender or disability will not go \nunnoticed or unpunished.\n  The Hate Crimes Prevention Amendment will make certain that those who \ncommit violent acts because someone is of the ``wrong gender, religion, \nrace, sexual orientation, or disability'' will be prosecuted because \neveryone, I repeat, everyone has a right to be free from violence and \nfear when they are going to school, work, travel, or doing something as \nsimple as going to a movie.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the Hate Crimes Prevention \nAmendment, which includes this important measure. I also urge the \nconferees on the Commerce, Justice, States appropriations bill to \nmaintain this position during the conference. All Americans, and our \nfuture generations, deserve no less.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. When we passed the first Hate Crimes Law there were \nthose who said that it was unnecessary and that hate crimes were \noverblown.\n  Then came the news of James Byrd in Texas, Matthew Shepard in \nWyoming, William Gaither in Alabama, Gary Matson and Scott Mowder in \nCalifornia--young men who were victims of crimes that desecrate \nAmerica.\n  Today's debate goes back to our original fight. Does this Congress \nbelieve that there are those in America who are motivated by hate? Does \nthis Congress believe that there is more that can be done to condemn, \nprosecute and prevent violent hate? Or do we believe--even after James \nByrd, even after Matthew Shepard, even after William Gaither, even \nafter Gary Matson and Scott Mowder--that Hate Crimes are overblown?\n  Since we started keeping statistics in 1991 the FBI has documented \nover 50,000 hate crimes. But they could prosecute only 37 because the \ncurrent law is too narrow.\n  The Kennedy bill completes the law. It gives it teeth. The Kennedy \nbill adds sexual orientation to hate crimes, an omission that has sent \na message to those who feed off hate, that bigotry against gays and \nlesbians is somehow less wrong than bigotry against blacks, latinos and \nJews.\n  It removes the civil rights test which gives prosecutors the chance \nto put violent bigots behind bars.\n  As a nation, we have divergent political views but we are bound by \nour commitment to punish acts of bigotry against African Americans, \nLatinos, Jews, and yes--lesbians and gays.\n  This is a bill that will bring this nation together. This is a bill \nthat will make people proud.\n  The only people who need fear the Kennedy bill are those whose \nprivate hatreds manifests itself in violent rage against the innocent.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, over the Fourth of July weekend, the nation \nwas stunned by the actions of a single young man on a racially \nmotivated killing spree. The man's name was Benjamin Smith, and it \nseems clear, he spent his short life consumed by hatred. Because of \nthis hatred, the nation mourns the death of a former University of \nDetroit and Western Michigan University basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong \nand doctoral student Won-Joon Yoon, both the victims of hate crime.\n  Benjamin Smith was just one of many who unleashed his hate onto \nothers through violence. According to FBI statistics, at least one hate \ncrime occurs every hour in the United States. That means at least one \nviolent crime each hour is motivated by bias. Hate crimes have no place \nin a society founded on tolerance and equality. There must be a clear \nmessage to hate-mongers like Benjamin Smith, that the federal \ngovernment will do everything in its power so that the perpetrators of \nbias crimes will be investigated, prosecuted and punished as quickly as \npossible. But the federal government is limited to a certain extent in \nits ability to assist state and local prosecutors in their \ninvestigations of hate crime.\n  That's why I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Hate \nCrimes Protection Act, a bill which would amend the existing federal \nhate crimes law and expand the federal government's role in the \ninvestigation and prosecution of bias-inspired conduct. The federal \ngovernment has always had a special role in stifling violence and \ndiscriminatory treatment. This Act continues in that tradition by \nstrengthening federal authority to ensure that racially-motivated \ncriminals are prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\n  This amendment would also expand the definition of hate crime, which \nnow only pertains to the victim's race, color, religion and natural \norigin, to include discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender, \nand disability. By expanding the definition of hate crime, the nation \nsends a clear message that it will not tolerate any violent crime, \nespecially targeted at those who have traditionally been more \nvulnerable to violence.\n  The Hate Crimes Prevention Act has the support of over 100 civil \nrights and law enforcement organizations, as well\n\n[[Page S9043]]\n\nas a broad range of state and local government associations, and state \nAttorneys General. These groups, who work with the victims of hate \ncrimes on a daily basis, understand that violent hate crimes, not only \naffect the victim's family, but are injurious to the entire community. \nBecause hate crimes have a such a deep impact on society, these civil \nrights and law enforcement organizations support the Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act, and the role it gives the federal government in \nensuring that perpetrators of bias crime are subject to enhanced \nprosecutions and penalties.\n  I am pleased to join a distinguished list of cosponsors on this \namendment and I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this Act \nand take a stand against hate crime.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Hate \nCrimes Prevention Act as an amendment to the Commerce, Justice, State \nand Judiciary Fiscal Year 2000 bill.\n  This legislation will provide the Federal Government a needed tool to \ncombat the destructive impact of hate crimes on our society. The \namendment also recognizes that hate crimes are not just limited to \ncrimes committed because of race, color, religion, or national origin, \nbut are also directed at individuals because of their gender, sexual \norientation or disability.\n  Mr. President, any crime hurts our society, but crimes motivated by \nhate are especially harmful. This amendment would take two important \nsteps to strengthen existing Federal hate crimes law.\n  First, the amendment would expand the situations when the Department \nof Justice can prosecute defendants for violent crimes based on race, \ncolor, religion or national origin. Second, the amendment would \nauthorize the Department of Justice to prosecute individuals who commit \nviolent crimes against others because of a victim's disability, gender, \nor sexual orientation provided there is a sufficient connection with \ninterstate commerce.\n  Many states, including my state of Vermont, have already passed \nstrong hate crimes laws, and I applaud them in this endeavor. An \nimportant principle of this amendment is that it allows for Federal \nprosecution of hate crimes without impeding the rights of states to \nprosecute these crimes.\n  Federal prosecutions under this amendment would still be subject to \nthe current provision of law that requires the Attorney General or \nanother senior official of the Justice Department to certify that a \nfederal prosecution is necessary to secure substantial justice. Mr. \nPresident, such a requirement under current law has ensured that states \nare the primary adjudicators of the perpetrators of hate crimes, not \nthe Federal government.\n  This has meant that in recent years the existing Federal hate crimes \nlaw has been used only in carefully selected cases. For example, there \nhave been an average of only 5.2 prosecutions per year under current \nlaw from Fiscal Year 1990 through Fiscal Year 1996.\n  Additionally, Federal authorities will consult with State and Local \nlaw enforcement officials before initiating an investigation or \nprosecution. Both of these are important provisions to ensure that we \nare not infringing on the rights of States to prosecute crimes.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has an opportunity today to take a strong \nstand against hate crimes, and I urge them to do so by supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the amendment seeks to deter violent crime \nborne out of prejudice and hatred. Since 1991, almost 50,000 hate \ncrimes have been voluntarily reported to the FBI. More than 8,000 were \nreported in l997 alone, and many more probably occurred.\n  I am of the view that violent hate crimes stain our national \ngreatness. This amendment cannot erase the stain entirely, but it is a \nstep toward removing the immunity from prosecution that perpetrators \nhave enjoyed for too long.\n  The amendment will close the loopholes in current federal hate crimes \nlaw and remove the straightjacket from local law enforcement so they \ncan get federal help when they need it.\n  The amendment does three things:\n  First, it would remove restrictions on the types of situations in \nwhich the Justice Department can prosecute defendants for violent \ncrimes based on race, color, religion or national origin.\n  Second, it would assure that crimes targeted against victims because \nof disability, gender or sexual orientation that cause death or bodily \ninjury can be prosecuted if there is a sufficient connection to \ninterstate commerce.\n  Third, it would require the Attorney General to certify in writing \nthat she had consulted with State and local law enforcement and that \nthey had asked for federal help, or did not have jurisdiction or, as in \ncurrent law, that federal prosecution is necessary to secure \nsubstantial justice in eradicating hate-based crimes.\n  Under current law, the Justice Department can prosecute crimes \nmotivated by race, religion and ethnicity only if two tests are \nsatisfied. First, DoJ must prove bias was the motive. Second, DoJ must \nprove the perpetrator intended to prevent the individual from doing \ncertain federally protected things, such as serving on a jury, \nenrolling or attending a public school, or applying for or enjoying \nemployment.\n  Motive for the crime is a matter for the jury to determine. And, as \nis the case for every element of a criminal offense, DoJ would have to \nprove motive beyond a reasonable doubt. Motive plays the same rule \nunder federal and state anti-discrimination laws as it does under the \ncurrent federal hate crimes law. My amendment does not affect this.\n  It is the second test which has prevented the law from reaching many \ncases where individuals kill or injure others because of racial or \nreligious hatred. In 1994, a jury acquitted 3 white supremacists who \nhad assaulted 3 African-Americans. Jurors revealed after the trial that \nthey felt racial animus had been established but not that the \ndefendants intended to prevent the victims from participating in a \nfederally protected activity. My amendment addresses this limitation.\n  Under my amendment, DoJ would still have to satisfy the first test \nand prove beyond a reasonable doubt that bias was involved. But in \ncases of crimes motivated by race, religion and ethnicity, DoJ would no \nlonger be limited to those situations where the victim was engaged in \nor enjoying a federally protected activity.\n  In 1996, 88 current members of the Senate voted to support a similar \nprovision in the Church Arson Prevention Act.\n  Under my amendment, federal involvement in prosecuting crimes based \non sexual orientation, disability or gender AND where bodily injury or \ndeath result would be limited to those instances where the violent \ncrime has a sufficient connection with interstate commerce.\n  This provision is critical for the 28 states that have no authority \nto prosecute bias-motivated crimes based on disability or sexual \norientation, and for the 29 states that have no authority to prosecute \nbias-motivated crimes based on gender, like the Son of Sam serial \nkillings in New York.\n  The amendment would provide two levels of penalties in all cases of \nhate crimes:\n  1. Imprisonment up to 10 years for persons who cause bodily injury, \nor through the use of fire, firearms or explosives, attempts to cause \nbodily injury; and\n  2. Imprisonment up to life if death results or if the offense \nincludes kidnaping, aggravated sexual abuse or an attempt to commit \naggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to kill.\n  Some believe that every crime is a hate crime. Every crime is tragic, \nbut not all crime is based on hate. A hate crime occurs when the \nperpetrator intentionally chooses the victim because of who the victim \nis. A hate crime affects not only the victim but an entire community or \ngroup of people.\n  Some believe this amendment would provide special protection to \ncertain groups. But it is perpetrators who intentionally single out \nvictims because of who they are in an attempt to send a chilling \nmessage to society or others in that group of people.\n  Some argue that hate crimes laws threaten free speech. Hate crimes \nlaws punish violent acts, not beliefs or thoughts, no matter how \nviolent those thoughts or beliefs might be. Nothing in this amendment \nwould prohibit or deny the lawful expression of one's deeply held \nreligious beliefs. However,\n\n[[Page S9044]]\n\ncausing or attempting to cause bodily injury is clearly not protected \nspeech.\n  Some have expressed concern that this amendment would federalize \ncrimes that are better left to the states to address. Today, there is \noverlapping jurisdiction in the case of many homicides, bank robberies, \nkidnaping and fraud. Like these areas, when both federal and state hate \ncrimes statutes apply, there will be no need for federal prosecution in \nthe vast majority of cases.\n  The amendment will not invite a tsunami of new cases. In no one year \nsince the first hate crime law was enacted in 1968 has there been more \nthan 10 indictments. In fact, from 1992 to 1997, federal officials \nprosecuted only 33 cases, or an average of fewer than 6 hate crimes \ncases a year. Mr. Eric Holder testified that this amendment will only \nlead to ``a modest increase in the number of cases.'' The significance \nof this amendment is to backstop state and local law enforcement by \ngiving them extra tools to fight hate crime, not to open the floodgates \nto frivolous cases.\n  Even in states with broad hate crimes laws, the higher penalties \navailable under federal statute, the complexity of the investigation, \nthe procedural advantages of a federal prosecution, or the failure of a \nstate prosecution may make federal prosecution desirable.\n  All but 8 states have hate crimes statutes, but only 21 cover sexual \norientation, 22 cover gender and 21 cover disability. Despite the clear \nevidence that last year's brutal murder of Matthew Shepard was \nmotivated by hatred of gays, federal authorities were unable to assist \nstate and local authorities in investigating the case because Wyoming \nhad no hate crime law and federal agencies lacked the authority.\n  Evidence indicates that hate crimes are under reported, but FBI \nstatistics show that since 1991 hate crimes have nearly doubled, with \nmore than 8,000 reported in l997. Race-related hate crimes were by far \nthe most common, accounting for 60%. Hate crime based on religion \naccounted for 17%, and hate crimes against gays and lesbians, which \njumped by 8% last year, accounted for 14% of all hate crimes reported.\n  The federal government has a long history in combating hate crimes:\n  In addition to the landmark civil rights laws of the l960s,\n  In 1990, Congress passed the Hate Crime Statistics Act to keep track \nof hate crimes;\n  In 1994, Congress enacted the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act \nto allow for increased sentences for offenses found beyond a reasonable \ndoubt to be hate crimes; in 1994 Congress passed the Violence Against \nWomen Act; and in 1996 Congress enacted the Church Arson Prevention \nAct.\n  Under the able leadership of Senator Hatch, the Judiciary Committee \nhas held several hearings on the problem of hate crimes. In my view the \nrecord overwhelmingly established the need for this legislation.\n  As if we need any further evidence, we need only look to the Fourth \nof July weekend headlines describing brutal acts of violence aimed at \nOrthodox Jews, Asian-Americans, African-Americans and a gay couple in \nCalifornia.\n  We must correct the deficiencies in current law. Today, a crime \nmotivated by race, religion or ethnic origin can be prosecuted by \nfederal authorities because it occurred on a public sidewalk but not if \nit took place in the private parking lot across the street. This is \nwrong. I believe Congress must focus the full force of the federal \ngovernment on investigating and prosecuting hate crimes.\n  The vote on this amendment will be a referendum on whether members \nwill continue to tolerate violent acts borne of prejudice.\n  In closing, I would say to my colleagues that this is not a problem \nthat needs further study. The evidence is in, and it is clear. We need \nto send a strong and unequivocal message that hate crimes will no \nlonger be tolerated; that the full force of federal law enforcement \nwill be brought to bear in prosecuting these violent acts.\n  I hope my colleagues will ask themselves the following question. If \nthey have a child or know of a child who has a disability, a child who \nis gay, or who is a girl, and that child suffers bodily injury or \nworse, death, simply because of who he or she is, do you want that \nchild to be just another statistic that is studied, or do you want the \nperpetrator to be prosecuted to the fullest extent allowed by the Hate \nCrimes Prevention Act?\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1325\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for a study on older individuals and crime)\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n       Sec.  . (a) In this section:\n       (1) The term ``hate crime'' has the meaning given the term \n     in section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note).\n       (2) The term ``older individual'' means an individual who \n     is age 65 or older.\n       (b) The Attorney General shall conduct a study concerning--\n       (1) whether an order individual is more likely than the \n     average individual to be the target of a crime;\n       (2) the extent of crimes committed against older \n     individuals; and\n       (3) the extent to which crimes committed against older \n     individuals are hate crimes.\n       (c) Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Attorney General shall submit to Congress a \n     report containing the results of the study.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. My amendment would require the Attorney General to \nconduct a study on crimes against older individuals no later than 180 \ndays after the date of enactment of this legislation.\n  The population aged 65 years or older numbered 34.1 million in 1997 \nand will continue to grow as the baby boomer generation ages. These \nindividuals are particularly vulnerable to crime.\n  Because they have made the determination that our large elderly \npopulation is susceptible to monetary scams and physical acts of \nintimidation, criminals defraud the elderly in areas ranging from \ntelemarketing to health care fraud to securities and insurance.\n  Federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials throughout Florida \nare spending more and more of their time in efforts against the cheats, \nfly-by-night operators, and other criminals who are targeting the \nelderly for financial profit.\n  The losses suffered as a result of these crimes not only affect the \nelderly and their families but also squander resources for programs \nthat provide services to millions of needy elderly Americans.\n  Mr. President, we can and must do better.\n  My amendment will require the Justice Department study to examine two \nvital issues: (1) whether an individual over 65 is more likely than the \naverage individual to be the target of a crime; and (2) the extent of \ncrimes committed against individuals over 65.\n  This amendment gives the Senate the opportunity to express its \ndetermination to protect this important segment of American society \nfrom criminals.\n  In his national bestseller, ``The Greatest Generation,'' NBC news \nanchor Tom Brokaw discusses the heroics of the World War II generation \nand how they saved the world from tyranny. It would be a shame if the \ngeneration that protected us in its youth was allowed to become victims \nof scam artists and violent criminals in its later years.\n  Mr. President, this study will be a first step toward freeing older \nAmericans from the threat of crime. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this important measure.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1326\n\n(Purpose: To extend temporary protected status for certain nationals of \n                                Liberia)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, my amendment will provide the Pacific \ncoastal tribes of Washington, Oregon, and California with salmon \nrecovery funding.\n  I would like to start by expressing my deep appreciation to \nSubcommittee Chairman Gregg and subcommittee ranking member, Senator \nHolllings, for including in the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations \nbill, $80 million for the Pacific coastal salmon recovery account. \nGiven the fiscal constraints I am pleased the money was made available.\n  The Pacific coastal salmon initiative was proposed by the \nAdministration to help address the rash of endangered species listings \nof salmon along the coast. The Administration's initiative called for \nthe funding of $100 million with up to 10% of that money going to the \nPacific coastal tribes. Another portion of the initiative called for \nincreased personnel for the National Marine Fisheries Service in order \nto handle a higher workload brought about by new ESA listings around \nthe nation. The NMFS received some funding in the bill to undertake \nthis initial work.\n  The only party to this initiative that did not receive funding was \nthe tribes. I do not know why this decision was made, but I believe it \nsends the wrong message and we must remedy the situation. My amendment \ndirects funds to Pacific coastal tribes to participate in the salmon \nrecovery process. We need them to make this process work.\n  I would like to recognize that my amendment to ensure tribal \nparticipation is cosponsored by Senators Inouye, Boxer, Feinstein, and \nWyden. I would also like to recognize the support of Governor Gary \nLocke of Washington and Governor John Kitzhaber of Oregon. Lastly, I \nappreciate the support of King County Executive Ron Sims, Pierce County \nExecutive Doug Sutherland, and Snohomish County Executive Bob Drewel.\n  The reason all these people are supporting this amendment is that \nthey know the tribes are a vital partner in the coordinated effort to \nrecover salmon. Successful recovery is going to require all parties \nworking as a team. Leaving the tribes out of the equation is not a way \nto build the team.\n  Some may suggest that my amendment is unnecessary because the tribes \ncan apply to the states for a portion of the money being provided to \nthe states. However, tribes should not have to receive these funds \nthrough a state grant process or via any other mechanism that might \ndiminish their roles as sovereign governments. It is Congress that can \ndo the right thing at this stage to respect the rights of the Tribes to \nbe self-governing and join their counterpart governments in this vital \npartnership.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of the Chairman and my colleagues in \nagreeing to the adoption of my amendment to make the Pacific coastal \ntribes true partners in our effort to recover threatened and endangered \nsalmon runs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1330\n\n    (Purpose: To improve the process for deporting criminal aliens)\n\n       On page 45, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       Sec.  .

Mr. President, I thank Senators Gregg and Hollings and \nReid for their efforts in helping an amendment be added to the \nmanagers' package which Senator DeWine and I offered relative to Great \nLakes stations and measuring stations for water levels. It is an \nimportant amendment for the Great Lakes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter that I and Senator DeWine wrote \nto Senators Gregg and Hollings dated June 24 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Chair, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Colleagues: We are writing to request that our \n     amendment providing $390,000 for upgrades to 13 Great Lakes \n     gauging stations be included in the managers' amendment to \n     the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill. It has only \n     recently come to our attention that NOAA/NOS was proposing to \n     close rather than upgrade these 13 stations due primarily to \n     budget consideration. Upgrades to the stations supported by \n     the one-time appropriation in amendment will cut the long-\n     term operating expenses for the stations by half or more \n     while ensuring timely transfer of the essential data to the \n     end users in the private sector and other Federal agencies. \n     Because the old technology employed in these stations is not \n     Y2K compliant, it is essential that the upgrades be provided \n     this year.\n       Many of the 13 stations slated for closure are of \n     particular importance to the monitoring network. Three of the \n     stations have been in operation since the turn of the last \n     century (1899-1901), forming a central part of the long term \n     record for Great Lakes water levels. Their closure represents \n     a grave loss to the continuity of the data. Six of the \n     gauging stations are located in connecting channels, \n     geographic locations for which water levels are nearly \n     impossible to accurately interpolate from other sites and \n     which are essential to determining flow rates between the \n     lakes. Closure of these connecting channel stations will \n     critically injure our ability to determine flow of water, \n     contaminants, and other substances among the Great Lakes.\n       Furthermore, the proposed reduction in gauging capability \n     comes at a time when such capability is needed most. Great \n     Lakes jurisdictions at the federal, state, provincial and \n     binational levels are confronting a series of complex issues \n     associated with water withdrawal, consumptive use and \n     removal, including export. The Great Lakes system is \n     currently experiencing dramatic declines in water levels \n     compared with just last year, ranging from an 8'' drop in \n     Lake Superior to 30'' in Lake Ontario. Overall, water levels \n     have changed from extreme highs to levels nearly a foot below \n     the long-term averages. This water level reduction has \n     already had profound impacts on commercial navigation and \n     recreational boating. Lake level regulation, dredging needs, \n     and other priorities also are set based on the expectations \n     of water level fluctuations. All of these issues have one \n     thing in common: they are fundamentally dependent upon the \n     accurate and comprehensive data provided by the 49 long-term \n     Great Lakes stations in the National Water Level Observation \n     Network. Federal, state and local decision makers in the \n     Great Lakes region rely upon this network to make informed \n     decisions regarding resource management and policy.\n       We believe that the funding level requested is both modest \n     and justifiable given the importance of the water level \n     gauging network to the Great Lakes region and the long-term \n     cost savings that will be realized.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mike DeWine.\n     Carl Levin.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1337\n\n       On page 34, line 25, after ``title'', insert the following: \n     ``Provided further, That of the total amount appropriated not \n     to exceed $550,000 shall be available to the Lincoln Action \n     Program's Youth Violence Alternative Project.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1338\n\n       On page 26 of S. 1217, line 2 after the word ``Programs'', \n     strike the period and insert the following:\n       Provided further, That of the total amount appropriated, \n     not to exceed $1,000,000 shall be available to the TeamMates \n     of Nebraska project.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1339\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for an analysis by the Securities Exchange \n  Commission of the effects of electronic communications networks and \n                  night trading on securities markets)\n\n       On page 98, line 16, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``:  Provided further, That the Commission shall \n     conduct a study on the effects of electronic communications \n     networks and extended trading hours on securities markets, \n     including effects on market volatility, market liquidity, and \n     best execution practices''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1340\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding for task forces coordinated by the United \nStates Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Wisconsin and the \n              Western and Northern Districts of New York)\n\n       On page 8, line 13, strike ``$25,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$27,000,000''.\n       On page 8, line 23, insert before the period ``; and of \n     which $1,000,000 shall be for the task force coordinated by \n     the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern \n     District of Wisconsin, and $1,000,000 shall be for task \n     forces coordinated by the Office of the United States \n     Attorney for the Western District of New York and task forces \n     coordinated by the Office of the United States Attorney for \n     the Northern District of New York.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1341\n\n       (Purpose: To allocate funds for Tibetan Exchange Program)\n\n       On page 78, line 8, before the period insert the following: \n     Provided further, That of the amount appropriated under this \n     heading for the Fulbright program, such sums as may be \n     available may be used for the Tibetan Exchange Program''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/22/senate-section/article/S9046-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9046-S9068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL \n                   NOISE RULE AFFECTING HUSHKITTED AND REENGINED \n                   AIRCRAFT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) For more than 50 years, the International Civil \n     Aviation Organization (ICAO) has been the single entity \n     vested with the authority to establish international noise \n     and emissions standard; through OCAOs efforts, aircraft noise \n     has decreased by an average of 40 percent since 1970;\n       (2) ICAO is currently working on an expedited basis on even \n     more stringent international noise standards, taking into \n     account economic reasonableness, technical feasibility and \n     environmental benefits;\n       (3) International noise and emissions standards are \n     critical to maintaining U.S. aeronautical industries' \n     economic viability and to obtaining their on going commitment \n     to progressively more stringent noise reduction efforts;\n       (4) European Council (EO) Regulation No. 925/1999 banning \n     certain aircraft meeting the highest internationally \n     recognized noise standards from flying in Europe, undermines \n     the integrity of the ICAO process and undercuts the \n     likelihood that new Stage 4 standards can be developed;\n       (5) While no regional standard is acceptable, this \n     regulation is particularly offensive, there is no scientific \n     basis for the regulation and it has been carefully crafted to \n     protect European aviation interests while imposing arbitrary, \n     substantial and unfounded cost burdens on United States' \n     aeronautical industries;\n       (6) The vast majority of aircraft that will be affected by \n     EC Regulation No. 925/1999 are operated by U.S. flag \n     carriers; and\n\n[[Page S9049]]\n\n       (7) The implementation of EC Regulation No. 925/1999 will \n     result in a loss of jobs in the United States and may cost \n     the U.S. aviation industry in excess of $2,000,000,000.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) EC Regulation No. 925/1999 should be rescinded by the \n     EC at the earliest possible time;\n       (2) that if it is not done, the Department of State should \n     file a petition regarding EC on Regulation No. 925/1999 with \n     ICAO pursuant to Article 84 of the Chicago Convention; and\n       (3) the Departments of Commerce and Transportation and the \n     United States Trade Representative should use all reasonable \n     means available to them to ensure that the goal of having the \n     rule repealed is achieved.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment expresses the Sense of the \nSenate with respect to the discriminatory European trade practices \nbeing perpetrated against certain American products in the guise of \npromulgating regulations on noise emissions.\n  Last year the European Union began to restrict the use of so called \nhushkitted or reengined U.S. aircraft in the European community. These \naircraft had been specifically modified to meet U.S. Stage 3 quiet \nnoise standards. Ironically, the United States is several years ahead \nof Europe in urging U.S. aircraft to be reengined to comply with such \nstandards.\n  EC Regulation No. 925/1999 has been crafted in such a way as a noise \nstandard to effectively prohibit U.S. aircraft that have been \nhushkitted from flying in European airspace even though these aircraft \nare actually quieter than many European aircraft and engines. The \nstandard is written in such a clever way that it touches only U.S. \nproducts. That in and of itself should make anyone suspicious as to \nwhether the motive is noise abatement or a clearly disguised technical \nbarrier to trade.\n  At the moment the EU has delayed implementation of the regulation but \nit has not been formally rescinded. That means that anyone thinking \nabout buying U.S. aircraft that have been hushkitted, which most older \naircraft have been to meet U.S. standards, would have to make some \njudgement as to whether this regulation is likely to resurface again. \nIf the judgement is yes then a potential buyer would refuse to buy U.S. \naircraft if they would be contemplated for use on European routes.\n  For more than fifty years, the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization (ICAO) has been the single entity vested with the \nauthority to establish international noise and emission standards, and \nthanks to its efforts aircraft noise has been decreased by forty \npercent. Moreover, ICAO is working as we speak to tighten international \nnoise standards even further. For the European Council to arbitrarily \nseek to preempt the efforts of the ICAO is extremely unhelpful and \npatently discriminatory against U.S. aircrafts and engines.\n  The amendment I have offered today calls upon the U.S. Department of \nState to seek international relief from this discriminatory regulation \nby partitioning the ICAO under existing relevant international \nconventions. It also calls upon other relevant U.S. agencies with \njurisdiction over trade and transportation matters to work to resolve \nthis matter.\n  Mr. President, there are clearly binding amendments that could be \noffered to deal with this problem. I do not support such an effort at \nthis time. This is a matter for the Departments of State and \nTransportation together with the Office of the United States Trade \nRepresentative to work out with their European counterparts. I strongly \nurge them to do so on an expeditious basis.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a sense of \nthe Senate regarding the European Council noise rule affecting \nhushkitted and reengined aircraft. Under the guise of an environmental \nregulation, the European Union is engaged in a blatant effort to lock \nout the U.S. industry. Once again the EU is dragging its feet rather \nthan finding a balanced resolution to this issue. It is time that we \nturned up the heat on the EU and roll back this patently protectionist \nmeasure.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1342) was agreed to.\n\n\n                               fcc funds\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I would like to clarify the intent of the Committee \nregarding the funds appropriated in this bill for the Federal \nCommunications Commission (FCC). The Committee's intent is that none of \nthe funds provided for the agency in this bill are to be used by the \nFCC to reimburse the General Services Administration for the cost of \nthe agency's relocation to the Portals site. I would ask the Ranking \nDemocrat of the Subcommittee if that is his understanding as well.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Subcommittee Chairman has accurately stated the \nintent of the Committee with regard to this issue.\n\n\n                        school safety initiative\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nmy colleague from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, the ranking member \nof the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and \nJudiciary (CJS), about an innovative program recently started by the \nState of Virginia, which I believe falls within the allowable use of \nfunds within the Safe Schools Initiative, a line item that appears in \nthe FY 2000 CJS Appropriations Bill.\n  Senator Hollings, it has recently come to my attention that the State \nof Virginia has begun implementing a new program to reduce crime in its \nschools called ``4 Safe VA.'' This program is a public/private \npartnership, which includes online reporting of school crime, a toll-\nfree statewide hotline, and an extensive training program.\n  Before school begins again in the fall, Virginia will train nearly \n3,000 teachers, law enforcement, school resource officers, and other \nschool personnel in school safety procedures. There will be four \nseparate training programs, which are as follows: (1) a training \nprogram for school resource officers to prepare them to act as ``first \nresponders'' in crisis situations, such as that which occurred in \nLittleton, Colorado; (2) a training program for school staff and local \nlaw enforcement in communities where there are no school resource \nofficers to prepare them for responding to crisis situations; (3) a \ntraining program for 60 Virginia State Troopers to prepare them to \nsupport localities should a crisis situation occur; and (4) a training \nprogram for custodians, cafeteria workers, and other support staff, who \nknow the students and who are often the ``eyes and ears'' of the \nschool, to prepare them to assist in emergencies.\n  I have looked at Virginia's program plan and have found it to be \ninnovative and thoughtful. I consider it to be the type of program for \nwhich we set aside $38 million for community planning and prevention \nactivities under the Safe Schools Initiative line item. It is my hope \nthat the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, which \nwill be administering these grants, will give careful thought to \nproviding the State of Virginia with funds to continue to enhance the 4 \nSafe VA project.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I agree with you, Senator Gregg, that the 4 Safe VA \nproject is a creative and solid approach to preventing and reacting to \npossible school crises in the State of Virginia. I agree that this is \nthe type of program that should be funded under the Safe Schools \nInitiative. I also hope that the Office of Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention give full consideration to funding this program.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I very much thank the Senator from South \nCarolina for supporting me and engaging in this colloquy. I look \nforward to working with him in the future on ensuring that our nation's \nschools are safe.\n\n\n                              census 2000\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I understand my colleague from New Hampshire, the \nManager of this bill, Senator Gregg is interested in making comments on \nthe conduct of the 2000 Census as it regards Alaska Natives.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, I would like to join you in remarking on the 2000 \nCensus and Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would like to start by referencing a letter received \nfrom the Alaska Governor, Tony Knowles, which relates certain \nGovernment Accounting Office findings on the 1990 census. Governor \nKnowles reports that the Alaska Native population was undercounted by \n11,000, resulting in an annual loss of federal funding of $162 million \nover ten years.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is important to bring this statistic to the Senate's \nattention\n\n[[Page S9050]]\n\nto underscore the significance of reform proposals the Senator from \nAlaska will raise here today.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I've often noted on this floor that the \nawesome size of Alaska makes for unique problems in rendering federal \nservices. The 2000 Census count is no exception. The sheer physical \nseparation of neighboring communities makes communication and \ncoordination of planning difficult. The population is dispersed and \nalso remote from the hub cities where resources are often concentrated. \nCompeting forces and policies demand both centralization and \ndecentralization of services.\n  Mr. GREGG. My staff and myself have traveled to Alaska at your \ninvitation and agree that the distances between communities are a \nchallenge in implementing federal programs and directives.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The situation is complicated by the diverse ad varied \nsocial and political institutions set up in localities and at the \nregional level. Alaska Natives by traditional or necessity have chosen \nto organize in various ways to address different circumstances. Often \nfederal agencies chose among these groups and are satisfied that they \nhave covered their bases with Alaska Natives. I urge the Census to take \na hard look at the expertise and advice of all Native entities, \nincluding Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act corporations which by \nvirtue of their day-to-day business responsibilities and duties to \nshareholders also have a vigorous pool of human resources to assist in \npublic education and input.\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree that expediency should not compromise the thorough \nstudy and development of local and regional solutions to Census 2000 \nissues.\n  Mr. STEVENS. A necessary first step to addressing these issues, is \nfor senior-staff oversight of the Alaska Native Census in Washington, \nDC. I also urge the staffing and funding of an Alaska office of the \nCensus.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would support this measure.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The State of Alaska can do its part. For example, the \nState could set up an Alaska advisory committee on the Census. This \ncommittee could include representatives of rural area, urban areas, \nAlaska Natives, the military, and municipal and state government.\n  But I hope Census officials understand that certain agency decisions \nalready being pursued need to be reviewed right now before an advisory \ncommittee can be organized. For example, sub-regional hubs like \nDillingham are subject only to an update, not a full enumeration under \nthe 2000 Census. Also, reportedly, there are no focus groups for the \nmany and varied Alaska Native voices to be heard; and it is my \nunderstanding that groups classified by the federal government as \nminorities have been provided this opportunity in other states. I urge \nthe Census to develop a public education campaign that will communicate \nto rural and urban residents the importance of being counted.\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree these are important issues.\n  Mr. STEVENS. A specific issue that should be addressed in some manner \nis the highly mobile urban-rural population of Alaska Natives. We see \nmany families coming to Anchorage on a periodic or seasonal basis, \nsharing common quarters in the city but considering themselves rural \nresidents. Likewise, commercial fishermen will split the year between \ntwo or more residences within the state, and do some subsistence \nfishing at a traditional fish camp for some part of the year near the \nvillage of their birth. The proper enumeration of Alaska Natives would \nbenefit from an effort to reconcile these migration patterns with the \nfixed residency standards used in a number of federal programs and \nformulas.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Alaska and \nwill work with him to address his concerns.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank my colleague and ask unanimous consent that the \nletter I referenced earlier be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  State of Alaska,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                       Juneau, AK, April 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: I am concerned about an issue \n     critical to our state--the upcoming year 2000 census. When \n     you consider this issue in Congress, I urge you to defend the \n     plan submitted by the experts at the Census Bureau to obtain \n     the fairest and most accurate population counts for use over \n     the next decade.\n       As you know, any possible undercount of our population \n     means the loss of vital federal funding for Alaska. In a \n     recent U.S. General Accounting Office report, Alaska in 1990 \n     was undercounted by more than 11,000 people with a 10-year \n     fiscal impact of $160 million.\n       We have common goals of obtaining our state's fair share of \n     federal resources to help fund our investments in Alaska. We \n     should not let partisan differences over census methodology \n     impact the accuracy of census data and its use in revenue \n     sharing and funding formulas.\n       The 1990 Census was the first to be less accurate than its \n     predecessor. I am hopeful Congress will fund the Bureau of \n     Census at a level appropriate to meet U.S. Supreme Court \n     decisions and other mandates necessary to ensure timely \n     completion of the next census. I urge you to do all possible \n     to ensure Alaska receives its fair share of federal funds and \n     to support the efforts to make the 2000 Census as accurate as \n     possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Tony Knowles,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n\n       national coral reef institute/noaa national ocean service\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to engage the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee in a \ncolloquy. First let me begin by thanking my friends for ensuring the \ncommittee report included $2 million under the National Ocean Service \naccount to support scientific research and coral reef studies. It is my \nunderstanding this money is to be divided equally between the National \nCoral Reef Institute in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, and the University of \nHawaii. This research is critical to our understanding of the factors \nat work in the degradation of reef ecosystems around the world and I \nappreciate all my colleagues did in Committee to support this effort.\n  I say to my colleagues, it is my understanding the Chairman's \namendment contains additional funding for this account. Is it correct \nto say these funds are in addition to the $2 million currently provided \nby the Committee to the National Coral Reef Institute and the \nUniversity of Hawaii?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Florida is correct. The funds included in \nthe Chairman's amendment are in addition to the $2 million provided to \nthe two institutions you mentioned. Senator Hollings, is this also your \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, the Chairman is correct.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank my colleagues for this clarification and for their \nsupport of coral reef research.\n\n\n                       noaa activities in florida\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee if he would consent to discuss with me for a moment two \nissues of concern to me with respect to NOAA activities in Florida.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am pleased to join my colleague from Florida in a \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. MACK. First, let me say I appreciate my friend from New \nHampshire's hard work for the strong support he's given to the State of \nFlorida in the bill before us today. But I would like to bring to the \nChairman's attention an initiative undertaken by Florida's top three \nresearch universities: the University of Florida, Florida State \nUniversity and the University of Miami. These three institutions came \ntogether to ensure their extensive capabilities in the areas of marine, \natmosphere and climate prediction research were focused on the needs of \nthe entire Southeast region. They have especially come together to \nstudy the El Nino phenomenon. Their effort has been recognized by NOAA \nand they have become one of the agency's first regional assessment \ncenters.\n  My concern, Mr. President, is about the possibility that NOAA may \nreduce resources available to Florida and this valuable research \ninitiative. Clearly, Florida and the Southeast region are significantly \nimpacted by climatic developments. A strong and continued investment in \nFlorida and the region--along with a balanced investment in the \nregional assessment centers--is essential. I would ask the support of \nthe Committee to continue the base level funding of this important \ncollaborative\n\n[[Page S9051]]\n\neffort. The institutions had been receiving approximately $500,000 per \nyear through the Office of Global Programs, and I would like the \nChairman's assurances that this level of funding should and will be \ncontinued during the next fiscal year.\n  Mr. GREGG. I know how important this initiative has been to the \nSenator from Florida. I can assure the Senator that it is the \nCommittee's intent that the base-level funding you indicated be \npreserved in the next fiscal year. Did the Senator from Florida have an \nadditional concern?\n  Mr. MACK. Yes. I know the chairman is aware of the Florida \nCongressional delegation's strong commitment to the restoration of the \nEverglades and Florida Bay. I have heard some concern, however, that \ninternal reallocations within NOAA could result in at least a $1 \nmillion reduction in South Florida based Florida Bay activities. The \nadministration asked for significant funding of the Everglades-Florida \nBay initiative in both FY 99 and FY 2000 through the Coastal Ocean \nScience Program. But the concern I'm hearing from Florida indicates \nthat NOAA may reallocate funds away from this initiative and toward \nother programs and purposes. I would like the Chairman to join me in \nstressing to the agency that funds in this bill currently allocated for \ncritical Florida Bay initiatives not be depleted. I would like the \nChairman to join me in working to ensure the NOAA contribution to the \ninteragency program for Florida and adjacent coastal marine waters is \ncontinued at the current levels.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the Senator from Florida's comments. The \nCommittee supports and shares your commitment to Everglades and Florida \nBay restoration; specifically with respect to the funds allocated to \nthe initiative funded by the Coastal Ocean Science Program.\n  Mr. MACK. I appreciate my friend's comments with respect to these two \nissues. I thank him again for his continued support of Florida \npriorities.\n\n\n    the las vegas special police enforcement and eradication program\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President. I take this opportunity to thank Chairman \nGregg and Senator Hollings for their consideration of my request to \nprovide $1 million in funds to the Las Vegas Special Police Enforcement \nand Eradication Program. Methamphetamine manufacturing, use and \ntrafficking is a serious problem that deserves the highest priority, \nand I appreciate the leadership of the Chairman and the Ranking Member \nin this effort.\n  At this time, I would like to make a technical clarification of my \nrequest. I ask the Chairman and the Ranking Member, if, in making this \nappropriation, it is their understanding that of the $1 million \nprovided, $500,000 is to be directed to the Las Vegas Police Department \nto be used for their Methamphetamine Eradication Initiative, while \n$500,000 is to be directed to the North Las Vegas Police Department for \ntheir Methamphetamine Eradication Initiative?\n  Mr. GREGG. The senior Senator from Nevada is correct. Of the $1 \nmillion provided, $500,000 is to be directed to the Las Vegas Police \nDepartment to be used for their Methamphetamine Eradication Initiative, \nand $500,000 is to be directed to the North Las Vegas Police Department \nfor their Methamphetamine Eradication Initiative.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I concur with the Chairman.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the chairman and ranking member.\n\n\n  women's business center program at the small business administration\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire, the Chairman of the Subcommittee, in a \ncolloquy.\n  I want to begin by commending you, Senator Gregg, and your Ranking \nMember, Senator Hollings, for the hard work you have done in crafting \nthis Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary appropriations bill. \nYou have done a great job in funding the priorities identified by the \nCommittee in this bill. You have been particularly helpful to me in my \nefforts to curb the trafficking of Mexican black tar heroin in my home \nstate of New Mexico.\n  A separate issue of particular importance in my home state is the \nWomen's Business Center program at the Small Business Administration. \nIn this bill, you have funded the Administration's request of $9 \nmillion for this program, and I applaud you for meeting the President's \nrequest.\n  Unfortunately, the President's request fails to address an important \nissue for the future of the Women's Business Center program. \nParticularly, the President's request does not take into account the \nneed to allow existing WBCs to re-compete for federal funds once their \ninitial five-year funding stream expires. So, many existing centers \nwith outstanding track records of facilitating the growth of women-\nowned businesses and providing technical assistance to fledgling \ncompanies will go unfunded, while the SBA allows new, untested centers \nto open in other areas. Sacrificing the successful, existing centers to \nreplace them with new, untested ones seems like bad policy. I think we \nneed to open more new Women's Business Centers, but we also need to \nhelp the existing ones continue their work.\n  Senator Bond, the distinguished Chairman of the Small Business \nCommittee, Senator Kerry and I, along with a group of 25 bi-partisan \nco-sponsors, have introduced S. 791, the Women's Business Center \nSustainability Act. This bill would increase the authorization for the \nWomen's Business Center program to $12 million and allow existing \ncenters to re-compete for up to 40 percent of the federal funds \navailable under the program. Is the Chairman of the Subcommittee aware \nof this bill?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am aware of this effort and am told that the Small \nBusiness Committee will work to report the bill to the full Senate, \nwith the hope that the bill will pass later this year.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As the Chairman may know, an additional $2 million in \nfunding this year would be critical to the effort to allow existing \ncenters to re-compete for federal assistance. Without this additional \nfunding, many existing centers will be forced to close their doors. \nAssuming that S. 791 passes both houses of Congress and is signed by \nthe President later this year, I hope that the Chairman will be willing \nto find a way to provide this additional $2 million for the program \nonce this bill gets to conference.\n  Mr. GREGG. I share your concerns about allowing existing Women's \nBusiness Centers to re-compete for federal funds. If the Small Business \nCommittee and the Senate approve S. 791 before the conference on this \nbill, I will make every effort to provide the additional funding you \nhave requested.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Chairman, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n\n                           shoreline mapping\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy \nwith my friend, the chairman of the subcommittee, on shoreline mapping.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am more than happy to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the issue, which I wish to discuss, is \nthe mapping of our country's shoreline. As the chairman knows, the \nNational Ocean Service runs a Coastal Mapping Project which is \nresponsible for mapping the nearly 95,000 miles of the US shoreline in \nan accurate, consistent, tide-coordinated, and up-to-date manner.\n  I'm concerned that nearly 30 percent of the US shoreline has not been \nmapped. In addition, one-quarter of what has been mapped as mapped \nprior to 1970 with severely outdated technology. Since this data is \nused as the official shoreline on NOAA's nautical charts and is used by \nthe government and the private sectors, it is important to keep up with \nthe changes that result from coastal development and natural processes, \nwhich can be drastic.\n  This year, there was an increase over both FY99 funding levels and \nthe administration's FY00 request within the Committee's recommendation \nfor the ``Mapping and Charting'' account. Would you agree, Mr. \nChairman, that it is the recommendation of the Committee that $2 \nmillion of those funds can be used for shoreline mapping within the \nCoastal Mapping Project.\n  Mr. GREGG. I do agree with my esteemed colleague from Maryland that \n$2 million of the funds within the ``Mapping and Charting'' account can \nbe used for shoreline mapping.\n\n\n                      ANTI-METHAMPHETAMINE FUNDING\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of entering into \na colloquy with the senior Senator from\n\n[[Page S9052]]\n\nWisconsin, Senator Kohl, regarding the $1 million appropriation for the \nWestern Wisconsin Methamphetamine Law Enforcement Initiative in S. \n1217.\n  As the Senator from Wisconsin knows, the domestic manufacture and \nimportation of Methamphetamine, also know as Meth, has become a \ncontinuing public health threat to the United States and most recently \nto the Midwest. Senate Kohl, what is the extent of the Meth problem \nwithin the State of Wisconsin? Also, would you please describe how the \nproposed $1 million will be used to address the problem?\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina for \nhis questions, his acknowledgment of the severity of the Meth problem \nfaced by rural communities and cities in the Midwest and throughout our \ncountry, and his active support for increased funding to combat Meth. \nIn my own State of Wisconsin, criminal justice officials recognized \nearly on that we had to develop a strategy and consolidate our \nenforcement and prevention efforts to limit the spread of the Meth \nepidemic that has been invading our Western Wisconsin borders from \nMinnesota and Iowa since the mid 1990's. Today, the number of Meth-\nrelated incidents is increasing. The Wisconsin State Laboratory \nreported increases of Meth analysis from 42 examinations in 1996 to 112 \nexaminations in 1998. In 1998 alone, the Wisconsin Department of \nNarcotics Enforcement opened 90 investigations regarding Meth and \nprosecuted 40 individuals. In Wisconsin, Meth users generally range \nfrom 18 to 25, and recently there was even a disturbing report of Meth \ntrafficking in a rural high school.\n  With the escalation of Meth trafficking, in February 1997 Wisconsin \nlaw enforcement officials organized a coordinated enforcement and \nprevention initiative among local, state, and federal law enforcement \npartners to target Meth traffickers. This major effort also addressed \nthe need for training to prevent the potential health threat from toxic \nand flammable chemicals in clandestine Meth labs. Funding for this \ncontinuing intiative has been raised from a variety of sources, \nincluding the Wisconsin Office of Justice Assistance and the State \nAttorney General.\n  Recently, representatives from Wisconsin agricultural associations \nhave reached out to their members and communities to educate the public \nabout the dangers of Anhydrous ammonia, a precursor used in the crude \nproduction of Meth. These associations are now working with law \nenforcement as well.\n  And this May, the State Attorney General and the U.S. Attorney for \nthe Western District of Wisconsin sponsored three Meth symposiums to \neducate and train members of the criminal justice system.\n  The $1 million appropriated for the Western Wisconsin Methamphetamine \nInitiative will help build on these efforts and promote more \ncoordination of anti-Meth activities. It will be used jointly by the \nOffice of Attorney General (through the Division of Narcotics \nEnforcement) and the Office of Justice Assistance (under the direction \nof the Governor) to support a plan developed in coordination with each \nother to continue combatting Meth production, distribution and use and \nfor policing initiatives in ``hot spots'' of Meth trafficking activity. \nPart of this funding will also be used for community and school-based \nMeth education and prevention awareness programs.\n  Again, I thank the distinguished Senator from South Carolina--and our \nChairman, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg--\nfor their commitment to addressing the Meth problem.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin for \nthis fame and effort in this very significant issue.\n\n\n                            funding for dea\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy \nwith Senator Gregg on funding for the Drug Enforcement Agency and on \nnational issues concerning local law enforcement training skills to \ncombat methamphetamine abuse in rural communities, small cities, mid-\nsize communities and on activities to alleviate the growing financial \nburden resulting from the cleanup of clandestine laboratories and other \ndrug-related hazardous waste.\n  I say to Senators Stevens and Gregg that Senators Kyle, DeWine, Kohl, \nHagel, and I have offered a bill, the Rural Methamphetamine Use \nResponse Act of 1999, that would provide additional funding to combat \nmethamphetamine production and abuse, and for other purposes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am aware of the bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. As the Senator knows, we have been working on this bill \nand on others to ensure adequate funding for our nation's counter \nnarcotics efforts. I appreciate the committee's funding efforts to \nspecifically address the national methamphetamine issue and to combat \nmethamphetamine production, distribution, and use. I am also aware that \nwe face tough budget decisions and we need to balance many program \nneeds within a balanced budget.\n  Mr. GREGG. We have had to make a lot of tough decisions in this bill \nwhile trying to ensure that we meet the needs of many critical \nprograms. The subcommittee has worked earnestly to be fair, and we have \nhad to make tough choices.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I appreciate their efforts. I know that the \nsubcommittee has allotted the Drug Enforcement Agency the tools it \nneeds to properly wage the war on illegal drugs. I also know that the \nsubcommittee has added personnel and resources to the western and \ncentral regions of the United States to focus primarily on the \nmethamphetamine problems in those geographic regions of the country. \nHowever, as you may know, methamphetamine abuse and production across \nthe United States has forced law enforcement agencies to address \nchallenges that exceed the many years of experience of the State and \nlocal law enforcement personnel within such agencies. Methamphetamine \naffects smaller communities and rural areas disproportionately. In many \ncases, these communities lack the investigative and technical skills, \nand resources to confront major criminal gangs or the environmental \nhazards caused by meth product.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am aware of the training challenges state and local law \nenforcement personnel have had regarding methamphetamine production and \nhandling of these explosive chemicals involved in the methamphetamine \nproduction process and Senator Hollings and I have worked to address \nthose needs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Since the Senator from New Hampshire is aware of the \ntraining challenges of state and local law enforcement agencies, the \nfinancial burden of meth cleanup, and the volatile properties of meth, \nfrom the funding provided to DEA for methamphetamine initiatives, I \nhope, where possible, that funding be set aside within the final bill \ndirecting DEA to establish a select cadre of Special Agents with \nSpanish language capabilities to work with local law enforcement \nagencies across the United States on matters relating to combating \nmethamphetamine-related drug trafficking. I also ask within the funding \nallotment for methamphetamine training initiatives, funding for DEA \nstaffing at appropriate training facilities for purposes of providing \ncoherent, essential, and sustained clandestine laboratory training to \nState and local law enforcement personnel, and if possible, funding for \nDEA to provide these personnel with the skills necessary for \nclandestine laboratory recertification.\n  Mr. GREGG. I share in the Senators' concerns for the need for \nsustained and adequate funding nationally to combat methamphetamine \nabuse. I will work to ensure, where possible within the funding \nallotments for methamphetamine initiatives, that the final bill will \nsupport the concerns you have raised.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank Senators Gregg and Hollings for their \nwillingness to work with me and my colleagues on funding this needed \nrequest.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for recognizing the \nneeds of Missouri law enforcement in this bill. As he knows well, the \nState of Missouri is experiencing a law enforcement crisis of epidemic \nproportions as the methamphetamine trade has exploded in recent years. \nMy colleague, Senator Gregg, as seen to it that the DEA has increased \nresources to assist state and local law enforcement as they take on \nthese drug dealers.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I too thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his \nattention to this problem. I would like to\n\n[[Page S9053]]\n\nbring a matter to the attention of the Chairman. Under the Violent \nCrime Control Trust Fund section of this bill, the Chairman has \nincluded $6 million for the Midwest Methamphetamine Initiative. The \nlanguage states that the funding is to be used by the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration to train state and local officers on the proper \nrecognition, collection, removal and destruction of methamphetamine and \nmaterials seized in clandestine labs. Is my colleague familiar with the \ntitle?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, I am.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I have heard repeatedly from local law enforcement \nofficers, as has Senator Bond, that DEA provides excellent training and \nprepares well officers to raid, bust and clean up these labs. I know \nthat the Chairman is also aware of the funding required for the DEA to \nassist state and local law enforcement with the clean up of these labs \nafter they have been busted.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am aware that resources are necessary so that these \nsites can be cleaned up adequately.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It is my understanding from local law enforcement \nofficers that DEA funds are needed not only in the training of state \nand local law enforcement officers, but also in the removal and \ndestruction of the materials seized in the labs. Is it the Chairman's \nunderstanding that the resources made available to the Midwest \nMethamphetamine Initiative will also be available for the DEA to assist \nstate and local law enforcement in the clean up methamphetamine labs?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, I am aware that the needs to combat the growing meth \nproblem are pressing and that funds made available to the DEA may be \nused not only to train state and local officers on the proper \nrecognition and collection of meth labs, but also in the removal \ndestruction of the materials seized in the labs.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chairman for his assistance.\n  Mr. BOND. I too thank the Chairman for his assistance in this matter. \nDEA's participation in fighting the methampetamine epidemic is \nessential to state and local law enforcement. As my colleague stated, \nthe DEA provides training for local officers that well prepares them to \nhandle and dispose of the toxic material that they encounter while \nbusting clandestine methamphetamine labs. The DEA also has an important \nrole in the clean up process. There were over 800 clandestine \nmethamphetetamine labs seized in the State of Missouri last year. Most \nof the labs were busted in rural areas and smaller towns. These towns \nhave police forces and sheriffs offices of a very limited sizes. DEA's \npresence and help in rural areas is essential to ensure that these \ncommunities are not overwhelmed by the drug and the havoc in this wake. \nIf this menace is to be brought under control, local law enforcement \nmust have the assistance of the DEA. The Senator from New Hampshire has \nbeen a good friend to Missouri law enforcement as he has worked closely \nwith us in recent years to ensure that the DEA has the resources to \nfocus on this problem and I appreciate him clarifying the use of those \ndesignated funds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, I have spent years \naddressing the drug problem that confronts our nation. I personally \nhave visited drug source and transit countries throughout the region \nwith the objective of searching for ways to resolve and overcome this \nescalating problem. As a result of many hearings and meetings on this \nimportant matter, last year Senator DeWine and I introduced the Western \nHemisphere Drug Elimination Act, a $2.7 billion--3 year authorization \nfor enhanced drug eradication and interdiction efforts. We were \nsuccessful in getting this legislation passed into law and providing a \n$800 million down payment for this bill. We must continue to fund this \nimportant law.\n  Recognizing that US government resources are limited, it is important \nto fund agencies that can get a huge return on a small investment. the \nDrug Enforcement Administration indeed is an agency that demonstrates \nthis objective on a daily basis. With limited funding, the DEA is a \nvital source not only for our law enforcement activities, but for other \nnations as well. Relying primarily on manpower, the DEA has \ndemonstrated how effective an agency with limited funding can produce \nsignificant results. Last year, the DEA seized more drugs and arrested \nmore traffickers than ever before. They play an integral part in \ntraining foreign law enforcement officials overseas to help them help \nus keep drugs out of our country. they do a great service to our \nnation.\n  This past March, Senators DeWine and I sent a letter to the Chairman \nand Ranking Member of the Commerce, State, Justice Subcommittee, \ncalling for building on this year's investment in the DEA and \nrequesting additional funding for 300 new DEA agent, analysts and \nsupport personnel, and for other DEA initiatives. This request is \nconsistent with DEA initiatives outlined in the Western Hemisphere Drug \nElimination Act. Specifically, 16 senators--both Republicans and \nDemocrats--co-signed the letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member.\n  I thank the Subcommittee for addressing our needs in our request. The \nSubcommittee earmarked $17.5 million for new hires for DEA agents, \nanalysts, and support staff. I recognize this was a difficult task \ngiven the tight budget caps confronting this Subcommittee and the other \nAppropriations subcommittees. While I appreciate the tremendous efforts \nmade by the Subcommittee and their staff to earmark money for new DEA \nhires within their account, I am concerned that there isn't any \nadditional funding for the DEA. The DEA will have to sacrifice other \nimportant and necessary programs for these new hires.\n  I realize that the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Commerce, \nJustice, State Subcommittee are trying to complete the bill this \nevening. I had intended to offer an amendment to request $24 million in \nadditional DEA funding for new agents, analysts and support staff \nhires. After talking to the Subcommittee leadership, however, I have \ninstead agreed not to offer my amendment and would commit to working \nwith the Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee to help find a way to \nprovide additional funding to the DEA during conference of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I see Senator DeWine on the floor and understand that \nhe too would like to say a few words on this matter. I yield the floor \nto my distinguished colleague from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWine. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nGeorgia for yielding the floor. I commend him for all his tireless \nefforts in finding ways to combat the drug war. Mr. President, I \npreviously gave a floor statement on the importance of the role of the \nDrug Enforcement Administration in keeping drugs off our streets. I \nhave traveled with the DEA to various countries throughout the \nhemisphere and have seen them first hand in action. the DEA does a \ntremendous service to our country both inside and outside our border \nand should be commended. I agree with Senator Coverdell on the need for \nadditional funding for the DEA. I too believe that the DEA is \nunderfunded and should receive increased funding, particularly if there \nare additional resources available at a later date.\n  Mr. President, I see the Chairman of the Commerce, State, Justice \nSubcommittee on the floor. I speak for Senator Coverdell when I say \nthat it is my hope that we can work together with the Subcommittee \nleadership to help provide additional funding for the DEA during \nconference, or in the future even that there may be additional \navailable funding.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank Senator Coverdell and Senator DeWine for their \nstatements. I have listened very carefully to their remarks, and I \ncommend them for his tireless efforts in supporting anti-drug efforts, \nhere in the United States and throughout the world. I would like to \nassure both Senator Coverdell and Senator DeWine that I will give every \npossible consideration to their request when we go to conference and in \nthe event that additional funding may become available for FY 2000 in \nthe future.\n  Mr. DeWine. I thank my distinguished friend from New Hampshire and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I too thank my distinguished friend from New \nHampshire, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     definition of public aircraft\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am prepared to offer an amendment with\n\n[[Page S9054]]\n\nmy distinguished colleague Senator DeWine to the Commerce, State, \nJustice appropriations bill that will help law enforcement officers in \ntheir efforts to protect our citizens. We believe that after the \nCongress passed Public Law 103-411, it had unintended consequences that \nhave imposed unnecessary costs on state and local governments. Under \nthis law, aircraft belonging to law enforcement agencies are considered \n``commercial'' if costs incurred from flying missions to support \nneighboring jurisdictions are reimbursed. Multiple governmental \nagencies have recognized this problem, with the support of the Federal \nAviation Administration, they have jointly drafted corrective language \nfor this problem. Before proceeding, however, I would like to inquire \nas to the plans for consideration of this issue by the Commerce \nCommittee this year. I wonder if my distinguished colleagues from the \nstate of Arizona and South Carolina--the Chairman and ranking member of \nthe Senate Committee on Commerce, which has oversight on these \nmatters--could engage Senator DeWine and me in a discussion regarding \nthis matter.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would be pleased to engage in a \ndiscussion with the distinguished Senators from Florida and Ohio on the \nsubstance of this matter.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his time. In the \nstate of Ohio the Bureau of Criminal Justice Services uses aircraft for \ndrug eradication efforts. Under current law Ohio is forced to use \nprivate planes for this mission at a considerable cost, rather than \ntheir own surplus aircraft. Mr. Chairman is it your assessment that \ncurrent law defining public aircraft places unnecessary restrictions \nand costly burdens on law enforcement agencies who operate public \naircraft?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would agree that as the current law is written a number \nof our law enforcement agencies that operate public aircraft are faced \nwith burdens in being reimbursed for the costs associated from flying \nmissions in support of neighboring jurisdictions. The Senate Commerce \nCommittee intends to act to review the matter and work to develop \nlegislation that will help law enforcement.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senators from Arizona and South Carolina agree \nto review this matter on the FAA reauthorization bill and by the end of \nyear?\n  Mr. McCAIN. As I have indicated to my colleague, I will as the \nChairman of the Commerce Committee review this matter by the end of the \nyear and work with my colleague from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, \nin a good faith effort to resolve this issue by the end of the year.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I agree with my distinguished colleague from Arizona \nand look forward to working with him on this issue this year.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I want to thank Senators McCain and Hollings for their \nsupport on this issue. I look forward to working with them on this \nissue.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I also want to thank Senators McCain and Hollings for \ntheir support on this issue. I should also thank the law enforcement \norganizations that have strongly supported this amendment. \nSpecifically, the National Sheriff's Association, Airborne Law \nEnforcement Association, International Association of Chiefs Of Police, \nFlorida Sheriff's Association, and the California State Sheriff's \nAssociations. Mr. President, in light of what the distinguished \nChairman and ranking member have said, I withdraw my amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Graham and DeWine, to support an amendment to the \nCommerce-Justice-State appropriations bill that will assist our local \nlaw enforcement agencies to respond in a timely fashion to life or \ndeath situations.\n  Sheriffs and police chiefs in my state and around this country have \nfound that their hands are tied when it comes to sharing helicopters or \nother public aircraft with neighboring jurisdictions. The Milwaukee \nCounty Sheriff's Department recently became the first local law \nenforcement agency in Wisconsin to acquire a helicopter. Neighboring \njurisdictions would like to borrow that helicopter and reimburse the \nMilwaukee County Sheriff for the cost of their use of that helicopter. \nThe Milwaukee County Sheriff's Department is perfectly willing, indeed \neager, to share its helicopter but it can't easily do so. Under current \nlaw, in order for the assisting agency to receive a cost reimbursement \nfrom the neighboring jurisdiction, the neighboring sheriff or police \nchief must first exhaust the possibility that a private commercial \nhelicopter is available. Even when the neighboring law enforcement \nagency is faced with a serious imminent threat to life or property, the \nlaw requires the neighboring sheriff or police chief to first determine \nwhether a privately operated helicopter is available. Mr. President, \nthis law is absurd and puts everyone's safety at risk.\n  Law enforcement agencies use helicopters for a variety of reasons--to \nchase a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime, in search and rescue \nmissions, to observe crowds in public gatherings, to transport \nprisoners, and to detect marijuana fields. Current law, however, stands \nin the way of cooperation between agencies to carry out these important \nlaw enforcement functions. Cooperation between law enforcement agencies \nis good. It saves time, money, resources and maybe even lives. We \nshould do all we can to promote law enforcement cooperation.\n  Saving lives and maintaining law and order is delayed if we require \nsheriffs and police chiefs to determine first whether they can find a \nprivate helicopter. Public safety is also jeopardized because private \ncommercial pilots are likely not trained law enforcement personnel with \nexperience in sensitive and sometimes dangerous situations. In \naddition, a commercial helicopter is most likely not equipped with the \ninstrumentation and tools needed by law enforcement officers to do \ntheir job. But if we allow sheriffs and police chiefs to share their \naircraft with neighboring jurisdictions without first exhausting \nprivate avenues, law enforcement response is far more likely to be \nswift and sure.\n  Current law effectively prevents law enforcement from borrowing a \nhelicopter or other aircraft from a neighboring agency. The law must be \nchanged and this amendment does the job. This amendment modifies the \ndefinition of ``public aircraft'' so that law enforcement agencies no \nlonger need to make an attempt to find a private helicopter operator \nbefore using a neighboring jurisdiction's helicopter. This amendment is \nsupported by the National Sheriffs' Association, as well as numerous \npolice chiefs and sheriffs across the country.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators McCain and Hollings, \nfor working with us on this issue. They raised some concerns, but, as \ndescribed in the colloquy, they have given us assurances that they will \nwork to resolve the urgent needs of law enforcement either on the \nFederal Aviation Administration appropriations bill or by the end of \nthe year. I welcome their recognition of the magnitude of this problem \nto law enforcement and their willingness to work with us on this issue.\n  Mr. President, we demand that law enforcement act quickly and \nprofessionally to life or death situations, but we're not always giving \nthem the tools they need to do their job. We must do our part. I urge \nmy colleagues to join in this bipartisan effort to change the law and \ngive the sheriffs and police chiefs in Wisconsin and across this \ncountry the tools they need to keep our communities safe and secure.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                 Barry University Intercultural Center\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman of the \nsubcommittee in a brief colloquy regarding Barry University in Miami \nShores, Florida. Barry University has a strong history of addressing \nimportant Miami community issues like urbanization, ethnic diversity, \ncommunity development and cultural understanding. Recently the \nUniversity announced the planning of an Intercultural Community Center \nwhich is designed to promote necessary neighborhood and small business \nrevitalization. The facility will provide conference space, meeting \nrooms, executive seminars and continuing education courses related to \ninternational business and commerce.\n  It is my understanding Barry University will be requesting an \nEconomic Development Administration grant for this project from the \nDepartment of Commerce during the next fiscal year. I would appreciate \nthe Chairman's support in recommending the Department of Commerce give \nstrong consideration\n\n[[Page S9055]]\n\nto the merits of University's grant application.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Florida for bringing this issue \nto my attention. The Committee is aware of Barry University's efforts \nand I would strongly urge the Economic Development Administration to \nconsider its application within applicable procedures and guidelines \nand provide a grant if warranted.\n  Mr. MACK. I appreciate my friend from New Hampshire's comments on \nthis important initiative and for all he and the Senator from South \nCarolina have done in this bill for the citizens of Florida.\n\n\n                             epscot program\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nSubcommittee Chairman, Senator Gregg, to engage in a colloquy on a \nmatter of extreme importance to my State and a number of others, and \nthat is the need for more funding for the Experimental Program to \nStimulate Competitive Technology, a program of the Department of \nCommerce's Technology Administration.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to the Senator \nfrom Louisiana and engage in a colloquy.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, as you know, technology is fueling the \ntremendous economic growth the nation is currently experiencing. \nHowever, as is frequently the case, rural states are struggling to \nparticipate in this new economy. The EPSCoT program is a competitive \nmatching grants program that reaches beyond the traditional recipients \nof federal research and development funding. This pioneering initiative \nbrings together the interest of economic development, science and \ntechnology, university research, and private business. Although the \nprogram is only a couple of years old, it has met with very high \nenthusiasm in areas such as Louisiana and New Hampshire.\n  Mr. President, there is important work being done through the EPSCoT \nprogram. This is a flexible program designed to assist states. \nApplications may be submitted by state, local, or Indian tribal \ngovernments, community colleges, universities, non-profit \norganizations, private organizations, technology business centers, \nindustry councils or any combination of these entities from the \neligible states. The eligible states are those that have received less \nin federal research and development funding than the majority of the \nstates. Therefore, the program is carefully designed to benefit those \nstates that need more assistance in developing a high-tech economy.\n  Mr. President, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \nalso a part of the Department of Commerce's Technology Administration, \nruns the Advanced Technology Program. The ATP provides matching funds \nfor high-risk research with broad economic benefits. As a part of the \nprogram, grants occasionally are reclaimed by the ATP due to business \nfailures and other such circumstances. These reclaimed monies are used \nby the ATP to fund new awards. The Committee has provided in the bill \nthat the ATP may use these ``carry over'' funds for new awards in \nFiscal Year 2000.\n  Does the Senator from New Hampshire concur that it is the intent of \nthe committee to direct $2.0 million in funds provided to NIST for new \nATP awards under the provisions dealing with the use of carry-over \nfunds be used for new grants under the Technology Administration's \nEPSCoT program?\n  Mr. GREGG. It is the intent of the Committee to direct $2.0 million \nin carry-over funds for the ATP be used for new grants under the \nTechnology Administration's EPSCoT program. I look forward to working \nwith the Senator from Louisiana to ensure that the $2.0 million in ATP \ncarry-over funds are provided to the EPSCoT program for new grants in \nFiscal Year 2000.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, does the Senator from South Carolina \nconcur?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, it is the Committee's intent that $2.0 million in \nATP carry-over funds be provided to the EPSCoT program for FY 2000 \ngrants.\n\n\n  Distribution of technology funds to Burlington, Rutland, and Saint \n                               Johnsbury\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would first like to thank Senator \nGregg for all his work on crafting the Commerce, Justice, State, and \nJudiciary Fiscal Year 2000 appropriations bill. In this time of tight \nbudgetary caps, and with the many requests by members, Senator Gregg \nhas worked hard to get the bill through the Appropriations Committee \nand to the floor of the Senate.\n  I would especially like to thank Senator Gregg for recognizing the \nneed of three Vermont towns to upgrade, modernize and acquire \ntechnology for their police departments. Allowing these police \ndepartments to improve their technology will permit them to increase \nthe efficiency and effectiveness of the services they provide. \nReflecting the needs of the police departments, the $1.5 million should \nbe divided on the following basis: one-half ($750,000) to the \nBurlington Police Department, one-third ($500,000) to the Rutland \nPolice Department, and one-sixth ($250,000) to the St. Johnsbury Police \nDepartment. Again, I appreciate Senator Gregg's help to address the \ntechnology problems these town's police departments are facing, and I \nlook forward to working with him to get this important appropriations \nbill signed into law.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Jeffords bringing the \nneeds of these three police departments to my attention, and will work \nwith him to ensure that the money for technology grants to these three \nVermont towns are distributed in the way he has described.\n\n\n                   International War Crimes Tribunals\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman of \nthe Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee in a colloquy.\n  I am deeply concerned that the Subcommittee bill does not include the \nfull Administration request for funding of the International War Crimes \nTribunals.\n  We are all horrified by the crimes against humanity that occurred in \nKosovo. Recent reports state that as many as 10,000 people were \nmurdered. An untold number of women were raped. Hundreds of thousands \nof people were driven from their homes. The War Crimes Tribunal needs \nadequate funding to gather evidence, to pursue and to try those who are \nresponsible for these crimes against humanity.\n  Congress provided additional funding for the War Crimes Tribunals in \nthe Supplemental Appropriations bill. These funds were necessary to \nprovide emergency assistance to the War Crimes Tribunal for the former \nYugoslavia. Before we provided this funding, Chief Justice Louise \nArbour said that she had only seven investigators available for Kosovo. \nHowever, full funding for the War Crimes Tribunal is necessary for \nfiscal year 2000, if we are to continue ongoing investigations in \nBosnia or Rwanda.\n  The Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Committee \nis a strong supporter of law enforcement--both in the United States and \nabroad. I ask him to join me in supporting the full request for funding \nof the International War Crimes Tribunals during the Conference on the \nCommerce, Justice and State Department Appropriations bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. I share the Senator's strong support for the work of the \nInternational War Crimes Tribunals. The Subcommittee, with the Senators \nhelp, provided more than $40 million for the War Crimes Tribunals in \nthe fiscal year 1999 bill. The full committee, again with the Senator's \nassistance, made an additional $28 million available to the tribunals \nas part of the fiscal year 1999 emergency supplemental that passed in \nMay. Just two weeks ago, the Subcommittee approved yet another $2 \nmillion for FBI forensic teams investigating massacre sites in Kosovo \nunder the tribunal's direction. I look forward to working with the \nSenator during the Conference on this bill to ensure that full funding \nis provided.\n\n\n                     child abuse prevention program\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I again thank Senator Gregg and his \nstaff for working with me to provide funding for two important \ninitiatives in my home State of Vermont. It is my understanding that \nwithin funds provided to Department of Justice of Juvenile Justice \nPrograms, the FY 2000 Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and \nRelated Agencies Appropriation Bill provides $100,000 for the \nestablishment of a teen center in Colchester, Vermont and $100,000 to \nPrevent Child Abuse-VT to evaluate the SAFE-T program, a comprehensive \nchild abuse prevention program for middle school communities.\n\n[[Page S9056]]\n\n  There is a great need for a community center with a focus on youth in \nthe Town of Colchester. Currently after school gathering places for \nColchester youth are limited to local restaurants and supermarkets. \nThis project has strong local support. Last October, a group of local \ncitizens formed a non-profit organization called the ``Colchester \nCommunity Youth Project'' and purchased an available property in the \ntown for use as a teen center. The Town of Colchester hopes to buy the \nbuilding from the non-profit, and then plans to renovate the 4,500 \nsquare foot main building to house a youth center/multi use space, \noffices, and a branch of the local public library.\n  For over four years, Prevent Child Abuse-VT has funded, developed and \npiloted SAFE-T, a comprehensive health education and abuse prevention \nprogram for middle school communities. Students learn victim an \nvictimizer prevention, build healthy relationship skills and experience \npersonal and social change. Parents, guardians, school staff and \nservice providers participate in training, dialog assignments, \nclassroom presentations and school community change projects. SAFE-T \nresearch-based and classroom tested with over 500 students.\n  More work, however, needs to be done to evaluate the success of the \nSAFE-T program. Dr. David Finkelhor, Co-Director of the Family Violence \nResearch Laboratory at the University of New Hampshire, plans to embark \nshortly on a three-year scientific evaluation of the SAFE-T program. I \nam very pleased that this appropriation will enable this evaluation to \nmove forward.\n  The sexual abuse of and by children is now at epidemic proportions in \nAmerica. The SAFE-T Program is an excellent resource in helping early \nadolescents develop the skills they need to grow safe, free of abuse. \nThis program offers great promise as a national model for comprehensive \nabuse prevention programs. A thorough scientific evaluation will ensure \nthat this research-based initiative can be proven effective and \ndisseminated properly.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I applaud Senator Jeffords' work on these \nimportant issues. He is correct that the FY 2000 Commerce, Justice, \nState, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriation Bill provides \n$100,000 for the establishment of a teen center in Colchester, Vermont \nand $100,000 to Prevent Child Abuse-VT to evaluate the SAFE-T program, \na comprehensive child abuse prevention program for middle school \ncommunities.\n\n\n                     department of justice funding\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to address a question to the Chairman of the \nSubcommittee, the Senator from New Hampshire, regarding funding for the \nCivil Division of the Justice Department.\n  In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton announced that \nthe Federal Government intended to sue the Nation's tobacco companies \nto recover billions of dollars in smoking-related health care costs \nreimbursed by federal heatlh care programs. The Administration's FY \n2000 budget requested $15 million in new resources for the Civil \nDivision of the Justice Department and $5 million for the Fees and \nExpenses of Witnesses account to support this litigation effort.\n  Unfortunately, we were unable to provide the additional resources \nrequested by the Administration for the Civil Division to carry out \nthis task. While I regret that the Committee was unable to provide the \nnew funds, it is my understanding that if the Justice Department deems \nthis activity to be a high priority, base funding, including funds from \nthe Fees and Expenses of Witnesses account, can be used for this \npurpose.\n  I ask the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee if my \nunderstanding of the bill and the report language is correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree with the Senator from Iowa. While the Committee \nwas unable to provide new funding as the Administration requested, \nnothing in the bill or the report language prohibits the Department \nfrom using generally appropriated funds, including funds from the Fees \nand Expenses of Witnesses Account, to pursue this litigation if the \nDepartment concludes such litigation has merit under existing law.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I also agree with Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to address the Chairman of the Subcommittee. \nDoes the Chairman also agree to strike the language on page 15 and on \npage 25 of Senate Report 106-76 relating to funding for tobacco \nlitigation?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n\n\n              Community-Based Habitat Restoration Program\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, with the indulgence of my distinguished \ncolleagues from New Hampshire and South Carolina, I would like to bring \nto their attention one of the Federal government's most successful \nrestoration programs for marine and estuarine habitats--the Community-\nBased Habitat Restoration Program started by the National Marine \nFisheries Service in 1995. This program promotes restoration of \nfisheries habitats around the country through voluntary partnerships \namong state and local governments, the conservation community, industry \nand businesses, and the academic community. Since its inception, more \nthan 60 projects have been funded. There is a minimum one-to-one match \nrequired, but non-Federal parties typically contribute three dollars, \nand often as much as ten dollars, for every one spent by NMFS. Indeed, \nover the life of the program, Federal funding totaled $1.2 million, \nwith $6.1 million raised in non-Federal funds.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am aware of the program and agree with the Senator from \nRhode Island. It is an excellent program that supports worthwhile \nprojects with limited funding. Last year, $450,000 was appropriated for \nthe program.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Unfortunately, S. 1217, as approved by the Committee, did \nnot provide any funding for the program for FY 2000.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct. The Administration's budget proposal \nincluded the program as part of a larger and new initiative that did \nnot receive any funds.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would like to request that the distinguished manager of \nthe bill provide some funding for the program for FY 2000, so that it \ncan continue to build on its past success. Numerous groups, in \nparticular the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and the \nFishAmerica Foundation, rely on grants from the program for their \nrestoration efforts, and they would be hardpressed to continue these \nefforts if the program were not funded. As it is, about 145 projects in \n1999 alone are going unfunded due to lack of funds, of which seven are \nin my own state of Rhode Island.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am pleased to consider the request of the Senator for \nRhode Island. I have discussed this with my distinguished colleague \nfrom South Carolina, and we have agreed to a provision in the manager's \namendment that directs NMFS to take $1 million from available funds \nwithin its budget and apply it to the Community-Based Habitat \nRestoration Program.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I agree with my distinguished colleagues from Rhode \nIsland and New Hampshire, and am pleased to support the program. The \nmanager's amendment ensures that the program will not only be \ncontinued, but will receive some additional funding.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wholeheartedly thank my colleagues from New Hampshire \nand South Carolina. It is always a pleasure working with them, \nespecially on a worthwhile endeavor such as this.\n\n\n                    arms control treaty verification\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my \ncolleague, the Subcommittee Chairman, regarding a specific funding \nprovision in this bill within arms control treaty verification. I have \nbeen concerned for some time that our arms control efforts have been \nfocused on treaty negotiation at the expense of treaty verification. \nThe Committee report expressed the same concern. As a result, \ntechnological advances in arms control verification made at the \nnational laboratories are not being fully applied or exploited. \nAccordingly, this bill provides $10,000,000 for this purpose. I want to \nbe absolutely precise about what the Committee has directed in this \narea so I will quote from the Committee's report accompanying this \nbill. The report states the following: ``the Committee recommendation \nprovides a $10,000,000 increase over fiscal year 1999 for verification \ntechnology.''\n\n[[Page S9057]]\n\n  Mr. President, I think the plain meaning of this language could not \nbe any clearer and I think my colleague the Subcommittee Chairman would \nagree with me. That is why I was puzzled to hear from my staff that, in \ninformal conversations, State Department personnel have expressed \nconfusion over how to interpret this language. If my understanding is \ncorrect, some in the State Department have expressed their belief that \nthe $10,000,000 increase is intended to be applied first to the \nPresident's priorities for increased funding--costing approximately \n$8,000,000--and that only the remaining $2,000,000, left over after the \nPresident's priorities are funded, would be applied to the treaty \nverification work.\n  Mr. President, I certainly hope that the information I have about the \ninterpretation of agency officials is incorrect. I certainly hope that \nthe State Department would not disregard the abundantly clear direction \nprovided by the Committee. I ask my colleague if my interpretation of \nthe Committee's direction comports with his own, as Chairman of the \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. GREGG. My colleague from Idaho is correct. In setting the funding \npriorities for the Bureau of Arms Control, within the State Department, \nthe Committee has clearly directed that the $10,000,000 provided be \nused for the purpose of verification technology. The Committee further \nspecifies that verification technology will include systemization of \npromising non-intrusive nuclear topographic techniques including the \nFission Assay tomography System and the Gamma Neutron Assay Technique, \nwhich together will provide the ability to detect and characterize \nspecial nuclear materials while at the same time ensuring that design \ninformation is not revealed. The President's budget request is just \nthat--a request for the Committee's consideration--but Congress, within \nits prerogatives, sets agency funding levels, and sets priorities \nwithin those levels.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the distinguished Subcommittee Chairman. I am \nassured that his understanding of the Committee's intent for these \nfunds is the same as mine.\n\n\n                 funding for the sba office of advocacy\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues, Senator Gregg and \nSenator Hollings, for their initiative to allocate $2.5 million in the \nFiscal Year 2000 Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill to fund the \nresearch function of the Office of Advocacy at the Small Business \nAdministration. This is an increase of $1.1 million over the amount in \nthe President's FY 2000 budget request for SBA.\n  The Office of Advocacy, which is headed by the Chief Counsel for \nAdvocacy, performs an essential role acting as the eyes, ears, and \nvoice from within the Federal bureaucracy on behalf of the small \nbusiness community. One key responsibility carried out by the Office of \nAdvocacy is the research it conducts on issues critical to small \nbusinesses. It is our understanding that $500,000 of the additional \nfunds for the Advocacy research function are targeted toward the review \nof interpretative regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service of \nthe Department of the Treasury and rules issued by the Mine Safety and \nHealth Administration of the Department of Labor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join my colleague and friend from \nMissouri, Senator Bond, in supporting the additional funding for the \nOffice of Advocacy. This is a substantial increase over FY 1999 \nfunding, which I believe is important for the ability of the Office of \nAdvocacy to carry out its important mission on behalf of small \nbusiness. Among others, those responsibilities include conducting \nresearch on a number of issues that are critical to small minority-\nowned and women-owned firms, and the cost of Federal regulations. I \ncommend my colleagues, Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings, for their \ninitiative in providing this increase.\n  We are also very concerned about the current staffing needs of the \nOffice of Advocacy, which has declined significantly in recent years. \nIn FY 1990, there were 70 full-time employees assigned to the Office of \nAdvocacy. During the current fiscal year, it is my understanding the \nSBA Administrator has allocated 49 full-time staff for the Office of \nAdvocacy.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator Kerry about the \nfailure of SBA to allocate adequate staff to the Office of Advocacy. \nThis shortfall has placed an enormous burden on the ability of the \nOffice to fulfill its mission. While I would encourage the SBA \nAdministrator to allocate staff for the Office of Advocacy at the 1990 \nlevel, I realize they may not be able to make such an large increase in \none year. Therefore, I would like my colleagues on the Commerce-\nJustice-State Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Gregg and Senator \nHollings, to clarify their intent for the increase in the FY 2000 \nbudget for the Office of Advocacy.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the time and effort spent by Senator Bond and \nSenator Kerry working with the Subcommittee in developing the FY 2000 \nbudget for SBA. The Subcommittee approved the increase in the budget \nfor the Office of Advocacy to enable it to assess the economic \ncontributions made by small businesses, to determine the impact of \nfederal regulations and tax policies on small businesses, to dedicate \nsufficient resources to help carry out its responsibilities under the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act, and to undertake reviews of interpretative \nregulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service of the Department of \nthe Treasury and rules issued by the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration of the Department of Labor.\n  It was further our intention to direct SBA to add 5 full-time \nequivalent employees to the Office of Advocacy for a total of 54 full-\ntime employees for FY 2000. It is our belief this number of full-time \nstaff is reasonable to address the burgeoning responsibilities of this \nimportant office.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I concur with my good friend and colleague from the New \nHampshire on the use of the increased funds for the Office of Advocacy. \nIn addition, it was our intent to add 5 full-time equivalent employees \nin the Office of Advocacy bringing the total for FY 2000 to 54 full-\ntime employees.\n  Mr. GREGG. I want to make one further clarification regarding the \n$2.5 million earmarked for research by the Office of Advocacy. It was \nour intention that this amount be spent on research contracts and other \ninitiatives by the Office of Advocacy. The Subcommittee did not intend \nthat any of these funds would be transferred to the general operating \naccount for the Agency nor would any of these funds be used to pay the \ncosts of maintaining the full-tme staff of the Office of Advocacy.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I concur with the statement by Senator Gregg.\n\n\n                          the bunker hill site\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a discussion with \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, the distinguished Chairman of the \nCommerce, Justice, State and Judiciary Appropriations Subcommittee \nconcerning a situation that exists in my home state of Idaho.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would be pleased to engage in such a discussion with my \nfriend the senior Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. this past weekend Senator Crapo, Congresswoman Chenoweth \nand I conducted a public meeting in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho where federal, \nstate, local, tribal officials and citizens give statements and \nresponded to questions concerning the federal, tribal and state \ngovernments' involvement in a Superfund site in North Idaho known as \nthe Bunker Hill site.\n  To date there has been approximately $200 million spent on cleanup. \nSignificant progress has been made, but there is a great deal of debate \ngoing on between the parties concerning what other areas in the Basin \nneed to be included in the cleanup. I believe the State of Idaho, the \nCoeur d'Alene Tribe and the federal agencies can work out these \nquestions and resolve the conflicts that have gone on over this issue \nin the Coeur d'Alene Basin for over a decade.\n  I feel the Department of Justice, Idaho and the Nation as a whole \nwould be well served if the DOJ and the other parties involved in \nlitigation were to work among themselves parties to resolve the issues \nrather than to continue to litigate.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator raises excellent points. The resources of the \nNational are better served in working to resolve these types of \nproblems rather than to continue in a litigation strategy for years and \nyears. All parties should work to resolve the problems in\n\n[[Page S9058]]\n\nthe Coeur d'Alene Basin and the Committee will work with the Senator \nfrom Idaho to see if further direction is appropriate in the Conference \nReport.\n\n\n               development of a habitat conservation plan\n\n  Mr. BURNS. The Senate is accepting my amendment to allocate $250,000 \nfor the development of a Habitat Conservation Plan as part of the Idaho \nand Montana Coldwater Fishery Enhancement Program. This funding is \nimperative in the preparation of a voluntary Habitat Conservation Plan \naimed at saving our native fish populations in the two states. As you \nknow, we are at the upper end of the Columbia River drainage and the \nimpacts seen on salmon in that drainage are interrelated to our native \ntrout as well.\n  As the debate raged on about what exactly was impacting the native \nfish populations in the lower Columbia system, those of us in the upper \nreaches of the system were doing our best to ensure that enough water \nwas sent downstream at the appropriate time to help the native fish as \nmuch as possible. What we have learned from this practice is that the \nhealth of our bull trout population is linked to that of the salmon. \nFewer salmon returning from the ocean to spawn placed concern on the \nhealth of the entire river system, and the traditional actions taken to \nhelp one species sometimes had negative impacts on others. As is \ncommonly the case with these types of issues, we didn't always realize \nthe interrelation until some negative impacts had already taken place.\n  Making these funds available for the Idaho and Montana Coldwater \nFishery Enhancement Program will help us address more of the survival \nneeds of native fish species in the Columbia Basin. Stabilizing the \nbull trout population and developing this plan will allow us more \nflexibility in helping the salmon populations recover as well. Senator, \nI hope you will join me in clarifying where this money is to be \ndirected and to reaffirm the value of developing a state-led voluntary \nHabitat Conservation Plan for bull trout in Idaho and Montana.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Idaho and Montana Coldwater Fishery Enhancement \nProgram is an important element in the concerted effort to help native \nfish throughout the Pacific Northwest. This year's appropriations bills \nplace a priority on stabilizing the native fish populations throughout \nthe region, and this program fills a niche previously left unmet by \nother recovery efforts.\n\n\n                             SCAAP Funding\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to inquire of my friend, \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, about funding in this measure for the \nState Criminal Alien Assistance Program, popularly known as the SCAAP.\n  As the Senator knows, states and localities, especially those such as \nCalifornia with high immigrant populations, face extraordinary costs in \nincarcerating illegal aliens who have committed serious crimes in the \nUnited States and sentenced for their felony offenses.\n  The burden on states and localities which incarcerate criminal aliens \ncontinues to grow. In California, for example, during February 1997, \nthere were 17,904 criminal alien inmates with INS holds on them. This \nrose to 19,355 in 1998. At the end of February, 1999, there were 21,792 \nalien inmates in the California state correctional system who have INS \nholds.\n  Congress appropriated $585 million for SCAAP in fiscal year 1999 to \nhelp reimburse state and local governments for the costs of \nincarcerating illegal aliens.\n  Given the increasing numbers of illegal aliens that California and \nother states must incarcerate, one would reasonably expect that funding \nfor this important program would be increased in fiscal year 2000.\n  But it is my understanding, Mr. President, that the bill reported by \nthe committee actually makes dramatic cuts in federal funding for \nSCAAP, reducing the level of funding by more than 80 percent to only \n$100 million.\n  Given the urgency of the need and the fact that all 50 states, the \nDistrict of Columbia, two territories and 244 localities received SCAAP \nfunding in the most recent reimbursement period, I would like to \ninquire of my friend from New Hampshire if there is something that can \nbe done to increase funding in this bill for SCAAP to a more \nappropriate level.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the excellent \ncomments of my good friend, the Senator from California, and also look \nforward to working with the chairman and ranking member of the \nsubcommittee to resolve the funding disparity in the State Criminal \nAlien Assistance Program (SCAAP).\n  Before I begin my comments about this important program and the level \nof funding in the Senate Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill, I \nwant to state my full support for what I have been told will be a $585 \nmillion funding level for SCAAP in the House FY 2000 bill. I would also \nlike to insert for the record a copy of a letter from the U.S./Mexico \nBorder Counties Coalition (which consists of 18 county governments \nlocated on the Southwestern border) that describes why an adequate \nfunding level for SCAAP is so important to these border ares, many of \nwhich are facing very difficult fiscal situations.\n  Through the Crime Control Act of 1994, the Congress created SCAAP to \nreimburse states and localities for the costs they incur incarcerating \ncriminal illegal aliens. Such costs, it has been made clear, are the \nresponsibility of the federal government. SCAAP is authorized at $650 \nmillion, although total expenditures of the states exceed $2 billion \nper year. Though the financial burden of criminal illegal aliens \noverwhelms the criminal justice budget of many states and localities, \nSCAAP has never even been allocated its full authorization. In 1996 and \n1997, SCAAP was allocated $500 million and last year, states and \nlocalities received a total of $585 million.\n  Frankly, the Congress would be fully justified in increasing the \nauthorization level to $2 billion annually. In 1998, the taxpayers of \nArizona spent $38 million incarcerating criminal illegal aliens, \nincluding $26.8 million in state facilities, $406,000 in Cochise \nCounty, $9 million in Maricopa County, $136,000 in Mohave County, \n$534,000 in Pinal County, $450,000 in Santa Cruz County, and $401,000 \nin Yuma County. In turn, the state received a reimbursement of $15.1 \nmillion in SCAAP funds--less than half of what Arizona should have \ngotten, and that was when SCAAP was funded at $585 million overall.\n\n  To reduce the total 1999 SCAAP fund by more than 80 percent for \nfiscal year 2000, to $100 million, is absolutely unacceptable. Should \nfunding be reduced to $100 million, all 50 states, D.C., and the 244 \nlocal jurisdictions, which currently receive 39 cents on the dollar, \nwould be reimbursed a mere seven cents on the dollar, even though such \ncosts are a clear federal responsibility. This situation is especially \ndisturbing, considering incarceration is only one component of the \noverwhelming cost incurred by states and localities when processing \ncriminal illegal aliens--and one for which the federal government \npromised to provide reimbursement in the Crime Control Act of 1994.\n  In Santa Cruz County, Arizona, the overall costs of both processing \nand incarcerating illegal criminal aliens takes up 39 percent of the \ncounty's criminal justice budget. And that is just one county in my \nstate. The combined costs to jurisdictions all over the country are \nstaggering, and the SCAAP program only reimburses states for the \nincarceration portion of these onerous costs. Unless Congress \nappropriates sufficient funds for SCAAP, at the very least, Arizona and \nother state and local governments will continue to shoulder billions of \ndollars of the expense of incarcerating and processing criminal illegal \naliens.\n  Mr. President, I very much hope that Senators Gregg, Hollings, \nFeinstein and I can work to resolve these issues before this bill is \nsigned into law.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the \ncomments expressed by my friends, the Senator from California and the \nSenator from Arizona, and commend them for their efforts on the \nextremely important issue.\n  The State Criminal Alien Assistance Program provides much needed \nfinancial assistance to New York State and many of our great state's \ncities and counties, as they try to grapple with the significant costs \nof incarcerating criminal aliens. In fiscal year 1998, New York and its \nlocalities received a total of $96.4 million in SCAAP funding--\n\n[[Page S9059]]\n\nwith New York City securing the largest single grant for a locality in \nthe nation.\n  I am very disappointed and disturbed that the bill reported by the \ncommittee would reduce SCAAP funding to $100 million for fiscal year \n2000, This could translate to a $80 million cut in assistance for New \nYork: a $46 million cut for the state itself, $27.7 million for New \nYork City, 4 million for Nassau County, $1 million for Suffolk County, \n$800,000 for Westchester County, $32,000 for Montgomery County, $25,500 \nfor Albany County, $19,500 for Putnam County, and smaller amounts for \nCortland County.\n  Cuts of this magnitude would leave New York to assume a difficult and \nheavy burden for what is very much a federal responsibility. I join my \nfriends from California and Arizona in asking our friend from New \nHampshire whether something could be done to restore SCAAP funding to a \nmore acceptable level.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank my friends from California, \nArizona, and New York for their excellent observations. I know that \nthey have been tireless in their efforts to secure both an end to \nillegal immigration and to ensure that the federal government assume a \nshare of the financial responsibility for its inability to control \nillegal immigration.\n  I know, as well, that the senator from California and the senator \nfrom Arizona were two of the principal authors of the SCAAP program \nwhen it was created by the 1994 Crime bill, and that they both worked \nvery hard to help secure the $585 million which was appropriated last \nyear and in fiscal year 1998 for this important program.\n  Knowing of the great need for adequate funding for SCAAP, it pains me \nthat the Committee was unable to fund it at the level it deserves. I \nassure the senators that I will make it a high priority during the \nconference between the House and Senate to secure adequate funding for \nthis program, that does so much for all of our states that are burdened \nby the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I concur with my colleague from New Hampshire. I \nunderstand the importance of this funding for states impacted by high \nrates of criminal alien incarceration and I am hopeful we can provide \nan adequate funding level for SCAAP during conference.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for their \nencouraging words. As I am sure they know, the SCAAP reimbursements \nprovided in prior years did not nearly cover the costs states and \nlocalities incurred to incarcerate illegal aliens in their \njurisdictions.\n  In fiscal year 1998, the last year for which such cost figures are \navailable, the cost for states and localities amounted to $1.7 billion. \nThus, last year's funding level covered only 30 percent of actual \ncosts.\n  A cut along the magnitude of that which is included in the Committee \nbill would be absolutely devastating. I understand the House CJS \nSubcommittee is recommending an FY00 SCAAP funding level of $585 \nmillion. I will work closely with the Chairman and Ranking Member and \nothers in both bodies during the weeks to come to assure that the \nconference on this bill adequately funds this program.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would like to associate myself with the remarks of \nmy colleagues with regard to the issue of funding for the State \nCriminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). SCAAP is a vital \nreimbursement program for states like mine that assists in the \nsignificant cost of incarcerating criminal aliens.\n  Although securing the border is the responsibility of the federal \ngovernment, states and localities have had to bear the costs associated \nwith incarcerating aliens should they enter the criminal justice \nsystem. In previous years, Congress has recognized their burden and \nworked to secure as much as $585 million for this critical program. \nEven at that level, less than 40% of Texas' costs of criminal alien \nincarceration have been reimbursed. Cutting SCAAP by over 80% as \nproposed in this measure would result in a reimbursement of only about \n7% of the total cost to the State of Texas. It is estimated that the \nState of Texas would receive less than $7 million, and Texas counties \nwould share in less than $3 million. Dallas County would receive less \nthan $200,000 despite enduring costs of over $2.5 million; the County \nof El Paso, with costs exceeding $2.6 million, would be reimbursed only \nabout $200,000; and Harris County, with costs nearing $14 million, \nwould receive less than $1 million. Mr. President, this is the same \nHarris County that last week took custody in its county jail of the \naccused railway murderer, Angel Maturino-Resendez. In this case, Harris \nCounty is forced to assume the costs of detaining Maturino-Resendez, \nwho is alleged to have repeatedly entered this country illegally and \nfurther alleged to have committed a string of stunningly violent \nmurders across the United States. There could not be a more graphic \nillustration of why we need to support the State Criminal Alien \nAssistance Program, so that our cities, counties and States are not \nleft alone to pay the costs of the Federal government's failure to \nprotect the border.\n  I pledge to work with the chairman to see that adequate funding can \nbe restored to this vital program and appreciate the Senator from \nCalifornia bringing this important matter to the floor.\n\n\n            the harbor gardens economic development project\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to express my \nsupport for the Harbor Gardens economic development project. I have \nrequested funding in the Economic Development Administration (EDA) \naccount for this worthwhile initiative in the Manchester neighborhood \nof Pittsburgh.\n  The mission of Harbor Gardens is to continue to help in rebuilding \nthe economic, physical, social, human, and cultural infrastructure of \none of Pittsburgh's most distressed communities. The project consists \nof a state-of-the-art urban greenhouse for the benefit of students and \ncity residents. Horticulture is the fastest growing segment of agri-\nbusiness, and therefore, the skills which program participants gain can \ntranslate into well-paying jobs. The project will ensure the education \nof its graduates in the horticultural industry, including advance \ngreenhouse production technology and landscaping techniques. The \nBusiness and Industrial Development Corporation is partnering with the \nPennsylvania State University, the School District of Pittsburgh, \nPittsburgh Civic Garden Center, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical \nCenter, Zuma Canyon Orchids, and Pittsburgh Cut Flowers. Rare plants \nwill be grown to be purchased for resale, and tours, seminars, plant \nauctions, and festivals will all contribute to maximizing revenues.\n  Federal funding crucial to the completion of this innovative approach \nto economic development, and an EDA grant will play an important role \nin meeting that federal commitment.\n  I look forward to working with the Chairman of the Subcommittee, \nSenator Gregg, to ensure that this project receives funding.\n  Mr. GREGG. I welcome the comments by the Senator from Pennsylvania \nand look forward to continuing to work with him on this request. I am \nwell aware of the importance he places on the Harbor Gardens project. I \nwould strongly urge the EDA to consider a proposal by the Business and \nIndustrial Development Corporation within applicable procedures and \nguidelines and provide a grant if warranted.\n\n\n                            the byrne grant\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Gregg, regarding \nthe importance of the Byrne Grant.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand the Senator's interest in this area.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank Senator Gregg for entering this colloquy with me \nabout a program which is particularly vital to the law enforcement \npersonnel in my own state of Arizona. As you know, the Byrne Grant is a \nkey source of federal financial assistance for state and local drug law \nenforcement efforts. It funds a wide variety of activities ranging from \ntask forces and drug education to apprehension and prosecution. In \nArizona, numerous counties and agencies rely on Byrne Grant funds to \npay the salaries of nearly 300 law enforcement and prosecution \npersonnel; rural counties especially benefit from Bryne Grant funds for \ntheir law enforcement activities.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am aware of the Byrne grant program and its importance, \nas\n\n[[Page S9060]]\n\nwell as the fact that the Administration's budget cut Byrne by over $90 \nmillion, not to mention the Administration's ``zero-funding'' of the \nLocal Law Enforcement Block Grant--which this Subcommittee funded at \n$400 million. As Chairman of the subcommittee that provides funds for \nlaw enforcement, I am intimately familiar with the need to fund \neffective and successful law enforcement programs. I join with the \nSenator from Arizona in recognizing the importance of the Byrne Grant. \nAs this bill moves to conference, I look forward to working with you to \naddress your concerns.\n  Mr. KYL. Once again, I thank the distinguished Chairman.\n\n\n                   warden offender nomitoring system\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Gregg and his staff for their tireless \nefforts on this legislation. I believe this legislation contains some \nimportant steps in a number of areas, including law enforcement. At \nthis time, I would like to engage the Chairman in a discussion with \nregard to a new technology developed by Capstone Technologies, a \ncompany located in my state of Alabama. I think it is essential that we \nexplore new areas of technology that can increase the effectiveness of \nlaw enforcement.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Alabama for his interest in this \nlegislation and in improving our law enforcement efforts. I agree that \nwe should explore new techniques that can improve the capabilities of \nthe law enforcement community.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Capstone Technologies developed the Warden Offender \nMonitoring System to aid in monitoring offenders that have been put \nunder residential detention. The Warden is a biometric, three \ndimensional monitoring system using voice verification, personal \nhistory inquiry and voice recording. The Warden uses computer voice \nverification to identify offenders placed on residential detention. The \nWarden monitors the offender using a touch-tone phone, with no new \nequipment to install or maintain. Random calls are made by the computer \nto the home of the offender during the hours sanctioned by the court. \nThe system uses the ``voiceprint'', which is recorded initially, to \nidentify the offender on the phone. All calls are monitored and all \nviolations identified by the computer are followed by a personal call \nfrom the staff to ensure that there are no false violations recorded. \nThe Warden can also detect when an offender is under the influence of \nalcohol or other drugs. If the computer detects certain characteristics \nof intoxication it will report a violation immediately to the \nsupervisor with a recommendation to conduct a sobriety test. I believe \nthis technology could be an extremely useful tool for law enforcement. \nOne specific area in which the Warden system might be very helpful \nwould be in monitoring juveniles. By implementing a versatile \nresidential detention system, we can avoid having to place our youth in \njail, and possibly help parents and the individual gain control of his \nlife before it's too late.\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree that this technology could have useful \napplications to our law enforcement system. I look forward to working \nwith the Senator from Alabama in the future as we explore technological \ndevelopments and other useful tools that can aid our law enforcement \ncommunity.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chairman again for his leadership and for \nhis interest in this important issue. I look forward to working with \nhim on this new technology in the months to come.\n\n\n the economic development administration of the department of commerce\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire, Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary \nAppropriations Subcommittee, for joining me to discuss the urgent need \nto provide funding for defense conversion in the greater St. Louis \narea. Over 7,000 Missourians are in danger of losing their jobs if the \nF-15 production line shuts down at the Boeing plant in St. Louis. These \nare high-paying, high-skilled jobs, and I am committed to doing \neverything I can to help these hard-working Missourians find other \nsources of employment in the greater St. Louis area.\n  These workers have helped keep America strong through their work on \nthe F-15 and other military systems that are so integral to our \nnational security. Their skill and knowledge are a national asset--a \nnational asset which I think should be preserved through keeping the F-\n15 line open. I have worked toward that end, and Senator Bond and I \nsuccessfully secured funding for additional F-15 purchases in the \nDefense Appropriations bill last month. But hundreds of F-15 workers \nwill lose their jobs even with additional purchases of the plane, and \nthose workers should be assisted in the transition process.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Hampshire is well aware of the \nEconomic Development Administration (EDA) and the good work EDA does to \nfacilitate economic adjustment in so many parts of the country.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am well aware of the EDA and the economic adjustment \nprograms it funds, including substantial work in areas of the country \nimpacted by defense downsizing.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I appreciate the Senator's reference to the defense \nconversion work performed by the EDA. In fact, EDA has assisted St. \nLouis before, as the regional economy has adjusted from defense layoffs \nover the past decade. St. Louis has one of the most effective and \nhighly respected economic adjustment offices in the country, as the \nDefense and Commerce Departments would attest. The city has a \ndemonstrated track record of using federal dollars effectively and is \nwell-prepared to use EDA funding to meet the current, pressing needs of \nthese F-15 workers. I would like to ask the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire if he will work with me in the coming months to address \nthe defense conversion needs in the St. Louis area.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am aware of the good work St. Louis has done in the past \nwhen defense downsizing has affected the city's economy. As Chairman of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee overseeing funding for the Commerce \nDepartment and the EDA, I will work with the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri to assist the city.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator for his kind remarks and his \nwillingness to work with me to address this important matter in \nMissouri.\n\n\n      rapid response system for young children exposed to violence\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the \nSenate Maine's Community Alliance to End Violence Against Children. The \nAlliance, which includes the Maine State Police, Catholic Charities \nMaine, and the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Pleasant Point, will improve and \nexpand the coordination of services for preventing and reducing the \nnegative impact that exposure to violence has on young children. As my \ndistinguished colleague from New Hampshire is aware, rural regions have \nunique problems coordinating and delivering services to children \nexposed to violence.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am pleased the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, \nJustice, State, and the Judiciary directed the Office of Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention to examine the proposal for a Rapid \nResponse Program for children living in Hancock and Washington Counties \nand to provide a grant for the program if warranted.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Downeast Maine is particularly in need of help. \nWashington County, for example, is a large rural area in which chronic \npoverty, unemployment, substance abuse and domestic violence result in \nfar too many children being exposed to violence. Currently there is no \nprogram in these counties that offers adequate intervention and \ntreatment to address the harmful aftereffects of exposure to violence. \nThe Alliance will develop a system through which existing resources can \nbe coordinated to provide appropriate and timely responses to the \nemotionally and physically damaging situations children often face. \nThere is strong evidence that a rapid response team, intervening on \nbehalf of children in crisis situations, can mitigate the long term \nconsequences of trauma.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Maine for her efforts to address \nthis problem. Data from urban areas have shown that a rapid response to \ntrauma in children does reduce the development of anti-social behavior \nin the long term. However, there are no data from rural communities. \nThe demonstration project that the Alliance proposes can be a model for \nservice delivery in other rural areas and\n\n[[Page S9061]]\n\nappears to be an excellent candidate for Department of Justice funds.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am sure that many rural communities will benefit from \nthe work of the Maine Alliance. Its plan has been inspired by the work \nof Dr. Carl Bell, President of the Community Mental Health Council in \nChicago, Illinois. Dr. Bell's analysis of the effects of trauma and the \nneeds of African-American youth in Chicago can be applied to the \npredominantly white and Native-American youth in eastern, rural Maine \nand ultimately youth in any rural area.\n  Mr. GREGG. I want to assure the Senator from Maine that I understand \nthe importance of the work of the Maine Community Alliance to End \nViolence Against Children and its potential significance as a model for \nrural areas across the nation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chairman and the Subcommittee for their \nsupport and look forward to working with you to implement this project.\n\n\n        consolidation of all first responder training at the CDP\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire in a brief colloquy to discuss the merits of \nconsolidating training for our Nation's First Responders.\n  Would the Senator agree consolidation of all Department of Justice \nfirst responder training under the Center for domestic Preparedness at \nFort McClellan, Alabama would significantly improve the quality and \nlevel of first responder domestic preparedness training?\n  Mr. GREGG. Is Consolidation of training in one organization really \nnecessary?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes. Stakeholders have repeatedly stated the need for a \nsingle authoritarian point of contact for training information. Also \nthe June 2, 1999 Report to Congress specifically recognized the \nrequirement: ``A centrally coordinated and standardized national \ntraining program is needed to ensure an effective, integrated response \nand to minimize redundancy in training programs.''\n  Mr. GREGG. What would be the advantage of this consolidation?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. OSLDPS approach to responder training is somewhat \nfragmented. The CDP currently oversees most DoJ training. However, in \nOctober, 2000, DoD will transfer responsibility for its Nunn-Lugar City \nTraining program to DoJ. Current plans are to manage this new program \nout of OSLDPS in Washington, DC office. Consolidation of all DoJ \ntraining at the CDP would centralize all training in one organization \nproviding a more effective, efficient use of resources.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much City Training will remain once the programs \ntransfers to DoJ?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Of the original 120 cities scheduled to receive \ntraining, only 25 will be completely finished by October 2000. \nApproximately 65 cities will be in some phase of training. This is a \nvery large and complex training program requiring extensive \ncoordination and attention to detail.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the CDP have the expertise to execute such a large \ntraining program?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes. The CDP Director and his key staff have extensive \nexperience in planning, coordinating and executing large training \nprograms with DoJ, DoD and other agencies. The staff also has expertise \nin the first responder disciplines, such as fire, law enforcement and \nemergency medical. The CDP is also closer and perhaps, more attuned to \nfirst responder issues.\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the relative experience of the OSLDPS key staff?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. While they have some experience in coordinating \nprograms within the interagency arena, their primary experience has \nbeen in the area of grant formulation and execution. no one on the \nOSLDPS staff currently has any experience in executing a training \nprogram this large.\n  Mr. GREGG. Are there other advantages to consolidating DoJ first \nresponder training at CDP?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes. Placing one organization in charge of all DoJ \ntraining has several advantages:\n  It centralizes all training and course development, curriculum \nstandardization, assessment and instructor certification in one \norganization;\n  It provides more effective oversight of training and related \nprograms;\n  Eliminates course overlap and course redundancy;\n  It facilitates coordination of training issues in the interagency \ncommunity; and\n  It provides a single point of contact ``one stop shopping'' for state \nand local responders for all training issues.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will this consolidation save money and manpower?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Dual-hatting the Director of the CDP as the OSLDPS \nDirector of Training will eliminate the need for a large training \ncoordination and oversight function/staff in Washington, DC.\n  Mr. GREGG. Why is this so important?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Consolidation of all training at the CDP is important \nbecause it will provide a single authoritative source for training and \nrelated technical assistance and information. To this end, I am \nconvinced that the National Guard should establish its central distance \nlearning facility at Fort McClellan to leverage these training \nrequirements for the 11 million First Responders in America.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would like to say to my good friend from Alabama that I \nagree with his views on training consolidation at the Center for \nDomestic Preparedness, and I appreciate his time and attention to this \nimportant issue. I look forward to working with him to fully explore \nthis issue with Justice Department officials in the coming months. I \nwould hope they will move aggressively to implement a National Training \nStrategy.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for participating \nin this colloquy and for his support on this issue. I, too, look \nforward to working with my friend from New Hampshire and other \ncolleagues on this important issue.\n\n\n         the repeal of section 110 of the 1996 immigration law\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the important \nissue of a visa entry-exit control system with the Senator from \nMichigan, Mr. Abraham, the Chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, \nand Senator Gregg, the Chairman of the Commerce-Justice-State \nAppropriations Subcommittee.\n  Senator Abraham, you and I and other Members who represent the \nNorthern regions of our country have been working for over 3 years now \nto repeal Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-208). Section 110 of this 1996 \nImmigration law would require a recording and identification system to \nbe implemented to document the arrival and departure of all non-U.S. \ncitizens at all ports of entry in the U.S., including those entry \npoints along the U.S. border with Canada.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. The Senator is correct. Those of us who represent states \nbordering Canada know well the immense volume of tourism and trade that \npasses through our states from our neighbor to the North. The \nimplementation of Section 110 would cause gross delays to all those \ncrossing the Northern border from Canada, and ultimately have a \ndisastrous impact on the Northern economy as critical trade and travel \nroutes are slowed. It would also harm states along the Southern border \nas well.\n  Ms. COLLINS. In my State of Maine, this new border policy would have \nthe most immediate impact on border communities such as Calais, \nHoulton, Madawaska, and Jackman. Businesses in these communities rely \non Canadian consumers to stay in business. Moreover, the impact on \ntrade, including lumber and tourism, would extend beyond these \ncommunities and reverberate across Maine and through the Northern \neconomy as a whole.\n  Those of us who represent states along the Canadian border know \nintimately how deep the shared ties between the U.S. and Canada truly \nare. Our relationship has included disagreements over the years, but \nour Canadian neighbors are part of our family--a fact that is literally \nand figuratively true for many Mainers whose extended families live \nacross the border in Canada.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Our border policy with Canada has served us well, and is \na symbol of the close relationship between our two countries. The \nborder with Canada is the longest continuous open border in the world, \nand our close friendship should not be clouded by a needless \nbureaucratic exercise. Moreover, numerous jobs, jobs held by\n\n[[Page S9062]]\n\nAmericans in Michigan and elsewhere, would be lost if Section 110 is \nimplemented. The effect on tourism and on just-in-time deliveries would \ninhibit the flow of goods and people in a way that would hurt the \neconomics of many states.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Largely because of your efforts, Senator Abraham, \nSection 110 has yet to be substantively implemented at land borders and \nsea ports of entry. Last year, the FY99 Omnibus Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act (105-277) delayed the implementation of Section 110 \non land and sea ports of entry until March 31, 2001, and included \nlanguage stating that the entry/exit control system must ``not \nsignificantly disrupt trade, tourism, or other legitimate cross-border \ntraffic at land border points of entry''. And in today's Commerce-\nJustice-State Appropriations bill, Section 110 is repealed outright. I \nsalute your efforts on behalf of this very important measure which will \nbenefit both of our states and the northern economy as a whole.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Maine for her remarks, and for \nthe important work she has done to repeal this measure. As the \noverwhelming vote nearly one year ago illustrates, there is near \nunanimity in the Senate on this issue, and I salute the Senator from \nNew Hampshire for his outstanding ongoing support, and his willingness \nto insert provisions addressing this problem into the underlying \nCommerce-Justice-State Appropriations Bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am pleased to support the measure to repeal Section 110 \nof the 1996 Immigration bill. I too believe strongly that the border \npolicy we currently enjoy with the country of Canada should not be \ndisturbed. I will continue to work in Conference to see that this \nmatter is finally put to rest.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Senator Gregg, your efforts are deeply \nappreciated by the American people.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you to both Senators for their leadership on this \nissue, and for joining me in this colloquy.\n\n\n                    Drug Enforcement Administration\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as the Senate reaches the conclusion of \nthe Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill, I would like to speak a \nmoment about an important US law enforcement agency funded in this \nbill--an agency dedicated to keeping drugs off our streets. I am \nspecifically talking about the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n  Mr. President, in 1998, the DEA seized more drugs and arrested more \ntraffickers than ever before. With limited funding, and unlimited hard \nwork and dedication, DEA human resources are a vital source not just \nfor our law enforcement activities, but for other nations as well. The \nDEA does its job without a heavy reliance on big ticket items like \nships and aircraft. On the contrary, this agency relies primarily on \nmanpower. Their manpower and skill are what makes them such an \neffective organization both inside and outside our borders.\n  Fortunately after 2 years of almost stagnant funding levels, the \nRepublican Congress has been working to increase its investment in the \nDEA. Last year Congress provided the DEA with $1.4 billion in Fiscal \nYear 1999, an increase of roughly $60 million. This increase was \npossible largely through legislation Senator Coverdell and I introduced \nand Congress passed last year--the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination \nAct. However, we need to do more.\n  Congress should continue its support of the DEA. Increasing our \ninvestment in DEA, which will in turn increase the strength and ability \nof our counter-narcotics strategy, is the only way to continue to \nincrease the numbers of drug arrests and seizures.\n  Let me give you some examples of where more DEA resources have and \ncan continue to make a difference. Mr. President, I have visited Haiti \nnumerous times and have visited the Dominican Republic as well. It is \ntruly unfortunate that roughly twenty per cent of the drugs entering \nthe United States travel through these two countries. The Haiti-\nDominican Republic transit route has become increasingly popular for \ndrug traffickers because both governments do not present a real threat \nto drug traffickers. What makes matters worse is that our resources \ndevoted to preventing drugs from reaching this island have been minimal \nat best.\n  When I visited Haiti back in March 1998, I was astonished to find out \nthat there was only one DEA agent stationed in Haiti. When I visited \nthe Dominican Republic on the same trip, I was disappointed to find out \nthere were only two DEA agents stationed there. How can our government \nkeep drugs from entering our country if we do not make a commitment to \nseize drugs along a major international route on the drug trafficking \nhighway? When I returned from that trip, I worked with the DEA and the \nAttorney General to get additional agents assigned to both countries. I \nreceived a commitment to station seven DEA agents in Haiti and six \nagents in the Dominican Republic. The process has been slow in getting \nthe agents to Haiti--because of language training in particular--but \nthe increase in agents has already made a tremendous difference.\n  Since that trip back in March 1998, I have returned to Haiti and the \nDominican Republic, and visited with the DEA agents stationed there. As \na result of our increased DEA presence on the island, the DEA, in \nconjunction with the US Customs and with the Haiti and Dominican \ngovernments, has pursued several counter-drug operations. Their \npresence also has helped increase cooperation between the two nations.\n  I had the opportunity to visit the Haitian-Dominican border last \nNovember to observe a DEA-Customs counter-drug initiative called \nOperation Genesis. Until that time, there was virtually no cooperation \nbetween the two nations at the border. This lack of cooperation is a \nmajor reason why the island became a popular drug trafficking route. \nThe objective of Operation Genesis was to help both countries better \ncoordinate and cooperate with each other to prevent drugs from \ntransiting the border.\n  The enhanced Haitian-Dominican cooperation through overall DEA \nefforts has proven successful. For example, last February, the Haitian \nNational Police in coordination with the DEA, arrested relatives of the \nConeo family--a well known Colombian drug trafficking family with \nconnections in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Heriberto Coneo's \nwife, son and his brother-in-law were arrested in Haiti for carrying \nfalse Dominican passports. Haiti later expelled them to the Dominican \nRepublic, where they were arrested and placed in prison. This was a \nmajor victory.\n  Another example of this enhanced cooperation was the recent arrest of \na Haitian National Police Division Chief who had fled to the Dominican \nRepublic after his involvement in the deaths of more than 11 Haitians. \nThe coordinated efforts by the DEA with these two countries resulted in \nthe Dominicans arresting the police official and expelling him to \nHaiti.\n  The DEA also has helped train the Haitian National Police counter-\ndrug unit. With DEA assistance, our Embassy in Port-au-Prince reports \nthat the Haitian police has seized more than $1 million in money being \nsmuggled out of the country in large sums.\n  I also have seen the DEA in action in South America, specifically in \nPeru and in Colombia. I walked through poppy fields in Neiva, Colombia \nwhere I saw first hand the source of the serious heroin problem \nplaguing our country today. We were in a region only 20 miles from the \nColombian demilitarized zone. The DEA has been instrumental in working \nand training the Colombian National Police to seize drugs and arrest \ndrug lords.\n  While, I have described a few success stories, I need to remind my \ncolleagues that the DEA is producing incredible returns on a very small \ninvestment.\n  Imagine what more the DEA could do if they had more personnel. The \nfact is the DEA simply does not have the resources to meet their \ndemanding and necessary tasks. With more resources, border initiatives \nlike the one in Haiti and the Dominican Republic could be expanded, \nallowing for a greater reduction in the heavy trafficking that occurs \nbetween the two countries. With more resources, additional DEA agents \ncan be sent overseas to assist law enforcement officials in learning \nways to stop drug trafficking. That kind of investment--to build anti-\ndrug operations in other countries--will build even more barriers to \ndrugs outside our borders.\n\n[[Page S9063]]\n\n  Mr. President, last March, Senator Coverdell and I, along with a \nnumber of our colleagues--Republican and Democrat--sent a letter to the \nChairman and Ranking Member of the Commerce-Justice-State \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings, \ncalling for building on this year's investment in the DEA and \nrequesting additional funding for 300 additional DEA agents, analysts \nand support personnel, and for other DEA initiatives. This request \nwould enable the DEA to carry out specific initiatives outlined in the \nWestern Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, a three year initiative for \nenhanced international drug eradication and interdiction efforts.\n  I recognize the serious budget challenges facing this Subcommittee \nand other Appropriations subcommittees as well. Chairman Gregg and \nSenator Hollings were extremely gracious in accommodating our request. \nSpecifically, the Subcommittee earmarked $17.5 million for new DEA \nagents, analysts, and support staff for both international and domestic \nposts.\n  Mr. President, this is an important first step. It is my hope that as \nthis bill moves to a conference with the House, the conferees will work \nto increase our overall investment in the DEA, so that specific \npriority requirements are not funded at the expense of other important \nDEA programs.\n  Again, Mr. President, since 1995 Congress has made great progress \nlast year to increase our investment to revive our international \ncounter narcotics strategy. Last year's passage of the Western \nHemisphere Drug Elimination Act was the latest example of this \nprogress. Not only did Congress pass legislation, but we also provided \nan $800 million down payment for the bill.\n  Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration is not showing a similar \ncommitment. The President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2000 provided zero \nfunding for provisions outlined in the Western Hemisphere Drug \nElimination Act. In fact, it calls for more than $100 million less than \nour total anti-drug funding for 1999. The Coast Guard received zero \nfunding for the acquisition of air/maritime assets; the Drug \nEnforcement Agency received zero funding for new agents; our Customs \nService received zero funding for procurement of maritime/air assets \nand zero increases for U.S. Customs inspectors. This Administration has \nnot demonstrated a commitment to fund a real, coherent international \ncounter-drug strategy. What good is it to have tough drug laws here at \nhome and a tough international counter narcotics policy at and beyond \nthe border if you do not have the resources to enforce them?\n  Mr. President, I have repeatedly expressed my concerns that the \nAdministration has not been doing enough in the fight against drugs. \nWhen the Clinton Administration took over, the DEA workforce dropped \nfrom 7,277 in 1992 to 7,066 in 1994. However, since the Republican \ntakeover of Congress in 1994, we have fought to boost the workforce \nfrom 7,066 to more than 9,000. The Administration's latest action, or \nlack of action, only reinforces my belief that more can be done. There \nhas been an increasing number of reports of outrageous amounts of drugs \nbeing distributed throughout our country that originates \ninternationally and domestically. Why is that? Only the federal \ngovernment can devote the resources to seize drugs outside our country. \nIt is unfortunate that the Clinton Administration continues to fail to \nfully support this exclusive federal responsibility.\n  With increased DEA funding, we have the opportunity to eliminate one \nof the most glaring omissions in the President's budget. It is my hope \nthat we will continue to search for additional funding to the DEA so \nthat they can hire these new agents, analysts, and support personnel \nwithout having to sacrifice other important programs. These agents \nwould work hand-in-hand with international law enforcement authorities \nto provide the intelligence, expertise, and even the manpower required \nto arrest the drug traffickers.\n  Mr. President, I have seen the DEA at work throughout the region. The \nagency is a group of hard-working dedicated individuals who risk their \nlives to create a healthy environment for democracies to flourish, \nwhile at the same time get the drugs off the streets of America. They \ndo so much good with the limited resources they have. It is now time \nfor us to pass this amendment, give the DEA additional resources and \nonce again watch the number of arrests and seizures increase causing \nthe flow of narcotics into our country to sharply decrease.\n  Mr. President, it is time to renew drug interdiction efforts; time to \nprovide the necessary personnel and equipment to our drug-enforcement \nagencies, and time to make the issue a national priority once again.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of this bill \nfor their hard work in putting forth annual legislation which provides \nfederal funding for numerous vital programs. The Senate will soon vote \nto adopt the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Bill for the \nFiscal Year 2000. I intend to support this measure because it provides \nfunding for fighting crime, enhancing drug enforcement, and responding \nto threats of terrorism. This further addresses the shortcomings of the \nimmigration process, funds the operation of the judicial system, \nfacilitates commerce throughout the United States, and fulfills the \nneeds of the State Department and various other agencies.\n  For many years, I have tried to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending \nfrom the annual appropriations bills--with only limited success, I must \nadmit. Nonetheless, I will continue my fight to curb wasteful pork-\nbarrel spending, and I regret that I must again come forward this year \nto object to the millions of unrequested, low-priority, wasteful \nspending in this bill and its accompanying report. This year's bill has \nover $1 billion in pork-barrel spending. This is a disgracefully huge \nincrease over last year's FY 99 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations \nBill, which contained $361 million in pork-barrel spending. $1.2 \nbillion is an unacceptable amount of money to spend on low-priority, \nunrequested, wasteful projects. In short, Congress must curb its \nappetite for such unbridled spending.\n  CBO projects that we will have close to a trillion dollar budget \nsurplus over the next 10 years. However, if we continue with our \ncurrent levels of wasteful spending, these budget surpluses may not \noccur. Pork-barrel spending today not only robs well-deserving programs \nof much needed funds, it also jeopardizes social security reform, \npotential tax cuts, and our fiscal well-being into the next century.\n  The multitude of unrequested earmarks buried in this proposal will \nundoubtedly further burden the American taxpayers. While the amounts \nassociated with each individual earmark may not seem extravagant, taken \ntogether, they represent a serious diversion of taxpayers' hard-earned \ndollars to low priority programs at the expense of numerous programs \nthat have undergone the appropriate merit-based selection process. \nCongress and the American public must be made aware of the magnitude of \nwasteful spending endorsed by this body.\n  I have compiled a lengthy list of the numerous add-ons, earmarks, and \nspecial exemptions provided to individual projects in this bill. It \nwould take a substantial amount of time to recite this list to you. \nInstead, I will ask unanimous consent to include this list in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. President, because of our nation's robust economy, we now have a \nbalanced budget. But we cannot continue to bear the financial burden of \nservicing a $5.6 trillion national debt. We need to continue to work to \ncut unnecessary and wasteful spending so we can begin to pay down our \ndebt and save billions in interest payments.\n  As I mentioned earlier, CBO recently projected that we will have \nclose to a trillion dollar budget surplus over the next 10 years. These \nare projections and not real dollars until they materialize. Further, \nthese surplus projections are all contingent on Congress maintaining \nthe spending caps. Unfortunately, I already hear the grumbling to break \nthese caps even as we have only deliberated on a small number of \nappropriations bills.\n  Simply because we can fund programs of questionable merit within the \nspending caps does not mean that we should. There is no room for pork-\nbarreling when we are so close to breaking the caps. Last year alone, I \nuncovered\n\n[[Page S9064]]\n\nover $14 billion of wasteful spending in the appropriations bills. $14 \nbillion funds a lot of worthy programs.\n  As a matter of simple fairness, we have an obligation to ensure that \nCongress spends taxpayers' hard-earned dollars prudently to protect our \nbalanced budget and to protect the projected budget surpluses. The \nAmerican public cannot understand why we continue to earmark these huge \namounts of money to locality specific special interests at a time when \nwe are trying to cut the cost of government and return more dollars to \nthe people. Pork barrel spending cannot be justified in an environment \nwhere our highest fiscal priorities should be to save Social Security, \nand provide much needed tax relief such as: increasing the number of \ntax payers in the 15% tax bracket, elimination of the marriage penalty; \nreduced taxation of savings and investment income; repeal of the estate \nand gift tax; repeal of the Social Security Earnings Test; increasing \nthe contribution level for 410(k), and 457 retirement plans; and \nincreasing the contribution level for the traditional IRA to $5,000.\n  Let me say very frankly that I do not generally like the idea of \ngriping year after year regarding Congress' appetite for wasteful pork-\nbarrel spending. But it is a sad commentary on the state of politics \ntoday that the Congress cannot curb its appetite to earmark funds for \nprograms that are obviously wasteful, unnecessary, or unfair. \nUnfortunately, however, Members of Congress have demonstrated time and \nagain their willingness to fund programs that serve their narrowly \ntailored interest at the expense of the national interest.\n  I ask unanimous consent the list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   OBJECTIONABLE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN S. 1217 THE DEPARTMENTS OF \n   COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED AGENCIES \n                          APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n                             Bill Language\n\n\n                         Department of Justice\n\n       $2,500,000 for the operation of the National Advocacy \n     Center at the University of south Carolina\n       $5,000,000 for a task force in each of the paired locations \n     of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Camden, New Jersey;

Mr. President, I rise to address the funding for the \nJudicial Branch for fiscal year 2000. The Appropriations Committee that \nworked on this budget has done an outstanding job with limited \nresources and very demanding budget requests. Senators Stevens, Gregg, \nByrd, and Hollings, and their staffs, are to be commended for doing a \nvery difficult job in a professional manner that does credit to the \nSenate.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have a special interest in \nthis budget. And I agree with most of the Senate bill. The Senate bill \nfully funds compensation for judges. This is required by the \nConstitution.\n  The Senate bill fully funds judges' staffs. This is appropriate \nbecause judges cannot operate without their law clerks and secretaries.\n  The Senate bill fully funds the rental costs of court facilities \nleased from the General Services Administration. This is appropriate \nbecause we must have courtrooms for judges and their staffs to work in.\n  Further, the Senate bill appropriately reduces funding for certain \nexpenditure requests that were not critically needed.\n  However, the Senate bill underfunds court support staff and operating \nexpenses for the circuit and district courts by a net 257 million \ndollars.\n  The Judiciary's budget request was for maintaining the current level \nof services by support staff. The support staff is needed to handle \nhigh levels of criminal cases, bankruptcy cases, pretrial services, and \nsupervised release services. These duties are not going away. The \nJudiciary is required by law to continue to address each of these \nareas. Moreover, I note that the Judiciary's budget request does not \neven take into account the increased workload that new legislation, \nlike the Juvenile Crime Bill, will place on the federal courts.\n  The Judiciary cannot maintain the current level of services in the \nCourts of Appeal and District Courts without some portion of the 257 \nmillion dollar shortfall being replaced.\n  I request that over the next few months we work together to provide \nthe Judiciary with additional funding for support staff on the Courts \nof Appeal and the District Courts.\n  I am also concerned about a deeper problem that exists with the \nbudget process for the Judiciary.\n  Current law requires the Executive Branch to submit the Judiciary's \nannual budget request to Congress ``without change.'' Nonetheless, the \nAdministration's Office of Management and Budget indirectly decreases \nthe Judiciary's budget request through the use of negative allowances.\n  The Judicial Branch should be required to be responsible in its \nbudget requests, and I believe they are. But, the Judicial Branch's \nbudget should not be subject to reductions by the Executive Branch to \nfund the political priorities of the President. Current law prohibits \nsuch reductions, but the Administration does not follow this law. This \nis a systemic problem that I hope we can address in the future along \nwith the Judiciary's current-year budget needs.\n  As legislators, it is our duty under Article I of the Constitution to \nprovide sufficient funds so that the federal courts established under \nArticle III of the Constitution are effective and federal law is \nupheld. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to address these issues in the next few months.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \nthank Senator Gregg, the Chairman of the Commerce, State, Justice \nAppropriations Committee, as well as Senator Hollings, for their full \nsupport of the Crime Identification Technology Act in this \nappropriations bill. Their support represents a strong commitment to \nanti-crime measures that really work to reduce crime.\n  This Act is a bipartisan law that Congress passed unanimously last \nyear. The Crime Identification Technology Act is based on the \nrecognition that technology is the key to the future of police work. We \ncan no longer continue to ask law enforcement to fight increasingly \nmobile and sophisticated criminals with outmoded twentieth-century \nTechnology.\n  The Crime Identification Technology Act will help state and local \njustice systems update and integrate their anti-crime technology \nsystems and support their overburdened forensic crime laboratories. \nCITA authorizes $250 million to states and local governments each year, \nfor five years, for crime technology. This effort is fully funded in \nthis appropriation bill.\n  State and local governments are at a crucial juncture in the \ndevelopment and integration of their criminal justice technology. This \nbill provides for system integration, permitting all components of the \ncriminal justice system to share information and communicate more \neffectively, on a real-time basis.\n  This is one of the wisest investments we could possibly make. I would \nlike to emphasize three reasons for this. First, crime technology, in \nitself, is crucial to making significant reductions in the crime rates \nin our communities. Second, we can use this opportunity to leverage the \nFederal Government's investments in national anti-crime systems that \nrequire state participation, such as the Integrated Automated \nFingerprint Identification System, the National Criminal Information \nCenter 2000, and the National Integrated Ballistics Information \nNetwork. We have literally invested billions of dollars in national \nsystems. That is a key reason why so many organizations have applauded \nthe appropriators' support of anti-crime technology, including the \nInternational Association of Police Chiefs, National Governor's \nAssociation, National League of Cities, American Society of Crime \nLaboratory Directors, the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, and \nour states' information repository directors in the National Consortium \nof Justice & Information Statistics.\n  Third, but certainly not last, there is a tremendous need to \nconsolidate the patchwork of Federal programs, which have funded \nspecific areas of anti-crime technology to the exclusion of others. A \nrecent GAO report identified more than $1.2 billion in direct and \nindirect support to state and local governments; however, the absence \nof coordination and integration of both systems and funding means that \nif we continue the current system of disparate funding streams, there \nwill never be enough money or integration. Too many existing Federal \nprograms mandate specific technology spending, instead of allowing \nstates the flexibility to meet their respective anti-crime technology \nneeds within the type of broad framework which the Crime Identification \nTechnology Act. CITA offers a dedicated, coordinated stream of funding \nto help states develop and upgrade their anti-crime technology from the \npatchwork of existing programs, and utilize the technical assistance of \nagencies who have developed technological expertise. I believe that \nthis will greatly increase accountability and efficiency.\n  The bottom line for me, based on my more than 25 years in law \nenforcement, is that fully employing our anti-crime technology today \nwill help law enforcement solve more crime, more rapidly, and pursue \nincreasingly sophisticated, mobile criminals.\n  Again, I want to thank Chairman Gregg, and Senator Leahy and Senator \nHatch for their strong support of the Crime Identification Technology \nAct and its appropriation. I would also like to extend my personal \nthanks to Senator Gregg's staff, particularly Jim Morhard and Eric \nHarnschteger for making the best of a very difficult funding situation.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                  ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Snowe \nto voice my deep concerns regarding the substantial cut to the economic \nDevelopment Administration's Fiscal Year 2000 budget. The FY 2000 \nCommerce, Justice, State appropriations bill being considered by the \nSenate cuts EDA's budget by $164.1 million--from $392.4 million in FY \n1999 to $228.3 million for FY 2000. This represents a\n\n[[Page S9068]]\n\n42 percent cut. Clearly, this reduction will have a dramatic affect on \nthe EDA's ability to serve distressed rural and urban communities in \nstates like Arkansas, New Hampshire, Maine, Alaska, New Mexico, \nKentucky, and Colorado.\n  My colleagues will remember that last November we passed the Economic \nDevelopment Administration Reform Act of 1998. In response, the EDA has \nbecome a more efficient and effective agency by reducing regulations by \n60 percent; they have trimmed the period of processing applications to \n60 days; and they are now requiring applicants to demonstrate both \neligibility and need at the time of application. I firmly believe that \nthese achievements will only strengthen the EDA's history of providing \ncritical assistance to distressed areas.\n  In its 34 years of service to Americans, the EDA has created 2.9 \nmillion private sector jobs; investing $16.8 billion in distressed \ncommunities. Currently, every $1 invested by the EDA generates $3 in \noutside investment. With an administrative overhead of less than 8%, \nmore Americans in economically distressed areas benefit from their tax \ndollars.\n  This is good news for my home state. As a rural state with many \neconomically distressed communities, Arkansas relies heavily on the EDA \nand their invaluable services. Sam Spearman, who heads EDA in Arkansas, \nis a true servant and a great asset to my constituents. From the \ntornadoes that tore through northeast and central Arkansas this \nJanuary, to the Levi-Strauss and Arrow Automotive closing in Morrilton, \nArkansas, the EDA is helping communities stay alive. To help grow the \neconomies in some depressed areas, the EDA has been assisting in \nplanning and developing inter-modal facilities in Marion and West \nMemphis.\n  My state was not immune to BRAC in the early 1990s. A Strategic Air \nCommand bomber base in Blytheville and an Army training facility in \nFort Smith were closed. As a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I am happy to report to my colleagues that both communities \nare slowly recovering, but not without ongoing assistance from EDA.\n  Again, last November we passed legislation to restructure and reform \nthe EDA. I believe that they have responded well to Congressional \ndirection, however, reducing their funding by 42% greatly limits their \nability to implement the changes we thought were necessary. I thank my \ncolleagues and hope that they will support increasing funding to EDA in \nFY 2000.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/22/senate-section/article/S9068-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9068-S9069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CALLING OF THE BANKROLL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I promised that from time to time when I \nparticipate in debates on legislation I would point out the role of \nspecial interest money in our legislative process, an effort I have \nentitled the Calling of the Bankroll. When I Call the Bankroll I will \ndescribe how much money the various interests lobbying on a particular \nbill have spent on campaign contributions to influence our decisions \nhere in this chamber.\n  Of course I embarked on this effort with the hope of exposing the \ncorruption of our current campaign finance system, and in particular \nhow wealthy donors exploit the soft money loophole.\n  When I began this effort, I never worried that I would lack for \nopportunities to Call the Bankroll, and as I've demonstrated over the \npast few months, there are countless opportunities to Call the Bankroll \nabout efforts to influence legislation before this body.\n  For example, so far I have talked about the contributions of special \ninterests working to influence the debate over the Patients' Bill of \nRights, I have discussed the contributions of the high tech industry \nand trial lawyers lobby during debate on the Y2K legislation, and I \nhave pointed out the contributions of gun makers and gun control \nadvocates during the juvenile justice debate, just to name a few.\n  And now we have before this body the Commerce, State, Justice \nappropriations bill.\n  During his state of the union address last January, the President \ncalled for the Justice Department to prepare a ``litigation plan'' \nagainst the tobacco companies to reclaim hundreds of billions of \ntaxpayer dollars spent through federal health-care programs such as \nMedicare to treat smoking-related illnesses.\n  But this bill does something quite different. The language in the \ncommittee report on the Commerce, State, Justice Bill attempts to grant \nimmunity to the tobacco industry from any federal litigation. Instead \nof a litigation plan, this bill would create a protection plan for the \ntobacco companies.\n  I hope my colleagues in this body would agree that the Justice \nDepartment must be able to pursue litigation based on the law, and that \nwe should do everything in our power to enable the department to \nenforce the law.\n  But the language currently in the committee report prevents the \nJustice Department from enforcing the law. So instead of a huge federal \nlawsuit, the tobacco industry will have immunity from federal \nlitigation. It looks like the tobacco companies have really gotten what \nthey wanted in this bill, Mr. President.\n  It's a fortunate turn of events for the tobacco companies, but based \non the tobacco industry's track record of political donations and \npolitical clout, I can't say that it's surprising.\n  The nation's tobacco companies are some of the most generous \npolitical donors around today, Mr. President, including Philip Morris, \nwhich reigns as the largest single soft money donor of all time. During \nthe 1997-1998 election cycle the tobacco companies, including Philip \nMorris, RJR Nabisco, Brown and Williamson, US Tobacco and the \nindustry's lobbying arm, the Tobacco Institute, gave a combined $5.5 \nmillion dollars in soft money to the parties, and another $2.3 million \nin PAC money contributions to candidates.\n  I offer this information to my colleagues and to the public to paint \na clearer picture of who is trying to influence the bill before us, and \nhow they are using the campaign finance system--very successfully, I \nmight add--to get what they want from this bill and this Congress.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1217, the \nCommerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations Bill for \n2000.\n  This bill provides new budget authority of $34 billion and new \noutlays of $23.1 billion to finance the programs of the Departments of \nCommerce, Justice, and State, and the federal judiciary.\n  I congratulate the Chairman and Ranking Member for producing a bill \nthat complies with the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. This is one of \nthe most difficult bills to manage with its varied programs and \nchallenging allocation, but I think the bill meets most of the demands \nmade of it while not exceeding its budget. So I commend my friend, the \nchairman, for his efforts and leadership.\n  When outlays from prior-year BA and other adjustments are taken into \naccount, the bill totals $34.1 billion in BA and $34 billion in \noutlays. For general purpose activities as well as crime funding, the \nbill is at the Senate subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for both budget \nauthority and outlays.\n  I ask members of the Senate to refrain from offering amendments which \nwould cause the subcommittee to exceed its budget allocation and urge \nthe speedy adoption of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n S. 1217, COMMERCE-JUSTICE APPROPRIATIONS, 2000--SPENDING COMPARISONS--\n                          SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n               [Fiscal year 2000, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  General\n                                  purpose    Crime   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-Reported Bill:\n  Budget authority.............   29,460     4,150        523    34,133\n  Outlays......................   28,214     5,271        529    34,014\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.............   29,460     4,150        523    34,133\n  Outlays......................   28,214     5,271        529    34,014\n1999 level:\n  Budget authority.............   27,165     5,509        523    33,197\n  Outlays......................   26,364     4,369        529    31,262\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.............   32,347     4,216        523    37,086\n  Outlays......................   31,327     4,538        529    36,394\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.............  ........  ........  .........  ........\n  Outlays......................  ........  ........  .........  ........\n \nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.............  ........  ........  .........  ........\n  Outlays......................  ........  ........  .........  ........\n1999 level:\n  Budget authority.............    2,295    (1,359)  .........      936\n  Outlays......................    1,850       902   .........    2,752\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.............

Mr. President, I rise to address the need for prompt action \non S. 761, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act. Senator Abraham has \ncrafted a solid legislative measure that will promote continued growth \nin electronic commerce.\n  The Millennium Digital Commerce Act has 11 cosponsors including \nSenators Wyden, Torricelli, McCain, Burns, Frist, Gorton, Brownback, \nAllard, Grams, Hagel, and myself.\n  Mr. President, on June 23, almost one month ago, the Senate Commerce \nCommittee unanimously approved and ordered S. 761 reported with an \namendment in the nature of a substitute. This substitute is widely \nsupported by the States, industry, and the administration. In fact, on \nJune 22, the day before the mark-up, the Commerce Department issued a \nformal letter of support for this bipartisan measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Administration's letter.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            General Counsel of the\n\n\n                                  U.S. Department of Commerce,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter conveys the views of the \n     Department of Commerce on the substitute version of S. 761, \n     the ``Millennium Digital Signature Act,'' that we understand \n     will be marked-up by the Senate Commerce Committee. A copy of \n     the substitute that serves as the basis for these views is \n     attached to this letter.\n       In July 1997 the Administration issued the Framework for \n     Global Electronic Commerce, wherein President Clinton and \n     Vice President Gore recognized the importance of developing a \n     predictable, minimalist legal environment in order to promote \n     electronic commerce. President Clinton directed Secretary \n     Daley ``to work with the private sector, State and local \n     governments, and foreign governments to support the \n     development, both domestically and internationally, of a \n     uniform commercial legal framework that recognizes, \n     facilitates, and enforces electronic transactions \n     worldwide.''\n       Since July 1997, we have been consulting with countries to \n     encourage their adoption of an approach to electronic \n     authentication that will assure parties that their \n     transactions will be recognized and enforced globally. Under \n     this approach, countries would: (1) eliminate paper-based \n     legal barriers to electronic transactions by implementing the \n     relevant provisions of the 1996 UNCITRAL Model Law on \n     Electronic Commerce; (2) reaffirm the rights of parties to \n     determine for themselves the appropriate technological means \n     of authenticating their transactions; (3) ensure any party \n     the opportunity to prove in court that a particular \n     authentication technique is sufficient to create a legally \n     binding agreement; and (4) state that governments should \n     treat technologies and providers of authentication services \n     from other countries in a non-discriminatory manner.\n       The principles set out in section 5 of S. 761 mirror those \n     advocated by the Administration in international fora, and we \n     support their adoption in federal legislation. In October \n     1998, the OECD Ministers approved a Declaration on \n     Authentication for Electronic Commerce affirming these \n     principles. In addition, these principles have also been \n     incorporated into joint statements between the United States \n     and Japan, Australia, France, the United Kingdom and South \n     Korea. Congressional endorsement of the principles would \n     greatly assist in developing the full potential of \n     electronic commerce as was envisioned by the President and \n     Vice President Gore in The Framework for Global Electronic \n     Commerce.\n       On the domestic front, the National Conference of \n     Commissioners of Uniform State Law (NCCUSL) has been working \n     since early 1997 to craft a uniform law for consideration by \n     State legislatures that would adapt standards governing \n     private commercial transactions to cyberspace. This model law \n     is entitled the ``Uniform Electronic Transactions Act'' \n     (UETA), and I understand that it will receive final \n     consideration at the NCCUSL Annual Meeting at the end of \n     July. In the view of the Administration, the current UETA \n     draft adheres to the minimalist ``enabling'' framework \n     advocated by the Administration, and we believe that UETA \n     will provide an excellent domestic legal model for electronic \n     transactions, as well as a strong model for the rest of the \n     world.\n       Section 6 of the substitute (``Interstate Contract \n     Certainty'') addresses the concern that several years will \n     elapse before the UETA is enacted by the states. It fills \n     that gap temporarily with federal legal standards, but \n     ultimately leaves the issue to be resolved by each state as \n     it considers the UETA.\n       With regard to commercial transactions affecting interstate \n     commerce, this section eliminates statutory rules requiring \n     paper contracts, recognizes the validity of electronic \n     signatures as a substitute for paper signatures, and provides \n     that parties may decide for themselves, should they so \n     choose, what method of electronic signature to use.\n       Another important aspect of the substitute is that it would \n     provide for the termination of any federal preemption as to \n     the law of any state that adopts the UETA (including any of \n     the variations that the UETA may allow) and maintains it in \n     effect. We note that this provision would impose no \n     overarching requirement that the UETA or individual state \n     laws be ``consistent'' with the specific terms of this Act; \n     this provision, and its potential effect, will be closely \n     monitored by the Administration as the legislation \n     progresses. There is every reason to believe that the States \n     will continue to move, as they consistently have moved, \n     toward adopting and maintaining an ``enabling'' approach to \n     electronic commerce consistent with the principles stated in \n     this Act. We therefore believe that any preemption that may \n     ultimately result from this legislation can safely be allowed \n     to ``sunset'' for any state upon its adoption of the eventual \n     uniform electronic transactions legislation developed by the \n     states.\n       We also support limiting the scope of this Act to \n     commercial transactions, which is consistent with the current \n     approach of the draft UETA, and utilizing definitions in the \n     Act that mirror those of the current draft UETA, which we \n     consider appropriate in light of the expert effort that has \n     been directed to the development of the UETA provisions under \n     the procedures of NCCUSL.\n       With regard to section 7(a), the Administration requests \n     that the Committee delete the reference to the Office of \n     Management and Budget (``OMB''); there is no need for \n     agencies to file duplicate reports. The report that the \n     Secretary of Commerce is directed to prepare pursuant to \n     section 7(b) will, of course, be coordinated with OMB.\n       The substitute version of S. 761 would in our view provide \n     an excellent framework for the speedy development of uniform \n     electronic transactions legislation in an environment of \n     partnership between the Federal Government and the states. We \n     look forward to working with the Committee on the bill as it \n     proceeds through the legislative process.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the transmittal of this report from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Andrew J. Pincus.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act provides \na baseline national framework for conducting online business to \nbusiness transactions. It is vital to interstate electronic commerce \nbecause it would provide legal standing for electronic signatures on \ncontracts and other business transactions.\n  This common sense and timely legislation will help promote continued \ngrowth in electronic commerce. It is good for business, consumers, and \nthe overall American economy.\n  While more than forty States have laws on the books concerning the \nuse of authentication technology such as electronic signatures, the \nStates have not yet chosen to adopt the same approach. This hodgepodge \nof State laws will undoubtedly have a chilling effect on e-commerce.\n  This Congress cannot and should not sit by and wait until the States \ncoordinate this milieu of laws on electronic signatures. This delay \nwould unnecessarily restrain the growth of our Nation's economic well-\nbeing.\n\n[[Page S9070]]\n\n  The Millennium Digital Commerce Act is an interim step that will help \nfacilitate interstate and international commerce. It is a necessary \nprecursor to state-by-state adoption of the Uniform Electronic \nTransactions Act (UETA).\n  Mr. President, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle strongly \nagree that it is now time to move S. 761 to the floor.\n  It has broad support and I hope we can work together to move this \nbipartisan pro-technology, pro-electronic commerce legislation forward \nas soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/22/senate-section/article/S9070-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MARY MCGRORY ON JOHN F. KENNEDY, JR.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it happens I was in the White House, in \nwhat was then Ralph Dungan's southwest office just down the hall from \nthe Oval Office--where they were cleaning the carpet, the President's \nfurniture having been moved to the outside corridor with his rocking \nchair atop the clutter--when word came from Dallas that the President \nwas dead. A few moments later Hubert H. Humphrey burst in, embraced \nDungan and let out: ``My God, what have they done to us.'' By ``they'' \nof course he meant the political right wing in Texas. Later we learned \nthat the Dallas police had arrested a man associated with Fair Play for \nCuba. What indeed had been done to us, what were we doing to ourselves?\n  That evening a group of us who lived on Macomb Street, out \nConnecticut Avenue, drifted over to Mary McGrory's. We sat about, \nsaying little. At length Mary, with the feeling only she can put into \nwords, announced: ``We'll never laugh again.'' ``Heavens, Mary,'' I \nreplied, ``we'll laugh again. It's just that we will never be young \nagain.''\n  In this morning's Washington Post, her column ``A Death in the \nFamily'' describes in poignant detail the history from then to now, now \nbeing of course the death of John F. Kennedy, Jr., so much on our minds \nin those slow-paced days of mourning so many years ago, now himself \ngone, along with his wife Carolyn and his sister-in-law Lauren \nBessette.\n  I ask unanimous consent that her reflections be reprinted in the \nRecord in full following my statement.\n  There being no objection, the article ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 22, 1999]\n\n                         A Death in the Family\n\n                           (By Mary McGrory)\n\n       To understand the round-the-clock coverage of John \n     Kennedy's death, the unending talk about it, and the \n     makeshift memorials, it helps to remember what the country \n     felt about his parents. His father, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, \n     handsome and dashing, came out of Boston insisting on being \n     our first Catholic president--and was assassinated on Nov. \n     22, 1963.\n       His beautiful mother, Jacqueline Bouvier, once dismissed as \n     a social butterfly, stepped forward and held the country \n     together. She arranged a funeral that was majestic and moved \n     through it like a queen. She saw to every detail from the \n     kilted Irish pipers to the eternal flame.\n       When it was over, she summoned the most famous political \n     scribe of his time, Theodore H. White, and put a name on her \n     husband's time in office, Camelot. The country has been \n     emotionally involved with the Kennedy's ever since. They are \n     numerous, good looking and always up to something. They have \n     provided a pageant of smiles, tears and scandals.\n       When John Kennedy's single-engine plane, with him at the \n     controls, fell off the radar at the Martha's Vineyard \n     airport, the nation once again went to its post by the \n     television to keep vigil with the Kennedys.\n       In the five days that followed, the dread and dismay were \n     laced with indignation. This was not supposed to happen. This \n     was entirely gratuitous. The crown prince had been exempt \n     from ``the curse of the Kennedys''--a phrase coined by Uncle \n     Teddy during the Chappaquiddick crisis. Had not Jackie \n     Kennedy sequestered her children from the turbulence at the \n     Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, as Bobby Kennedy's \n     fatherless sons wrestled with various demons? She took John \n     and Caroline over the water to Martha's Vineyard.\n       John had not followed in his father's footsteps. He was his \n     mother's son. She brought him up not to be a Kennedy, but to \n     be himself. He shared her detachment about politics. When \n     asked a while back how, in the light of his father's \n     posthumously revealed promiscuity, Jack Kennedy would have \n     tolerated today's fierce press scrutiny, John Kennedy said \n     coolly he thought his father might have chosen to go into \n     another line of work.\n       John Kennedy died like his father violently and too soon. \n     His blond wife, Carolyn Bessette, and his sister-in-law \n     Lauren Bessette died with him. At 38, he left more \n     unfulfilled promise than performance. He was strikingly \n     handsome and unexpectedly nice for one of his looks and \n     station. He was courteous to all, even the paparazzi who \n     dogged him from the age of 3 when he broke the nation's \n     heart by saluting his father's coffin.\n       The tabs called him ``The Hunk'' and People magazine said \n     he was ``the sexiest man alive.'' If the grief seems \n     disproportionate to his life, it is easily explained. He was \n     measured by who he was, not what he did.\n       His mother vetoed his first choice of a career, the \n     theater. He went into the law, but not for long. He founded a \n     magazine he called ``George.'' It was to be a glossy, trendy \n     monthly that treated politics as entertainment.\n       He courted publicity for ``George'' by sometimes doing odd \n     things: He posed nude for an illustration to accompany a \n     critique of his Kennedy cousins' behavior. More recently, he \n     visited Mike Tyson, the convicted rapist, in prison; he \n     invited pornographer Larry Flynt to the White House \n     correspondents' dinner. Like his mother, he never explained \n     his actions. He was a free spirit. His father, despite his \n     private excesses, was decorous in his public life, having a \n     politician's perpetual concern about what the neighbors will \n     think. Jack Kennedy was witty, sometimes in the mordant Irish \n     way; his son was whimsical. Politics does not allow for \n     whimsy.\n       John's love life was of aching, international interest. He \n     courted a string of gorgeous girls and then married one. He \n     married willowy Carolyn Bessette at a secret wedding on an \n     island off Georgia. He was terribly proud of his coup against \n     the press. He released one picture. It was of him kissing his \n     bride's hand. It was drop-dead romantic.\n       The country spent the last weekend soaking up every detail, \n     watching hour after hour of Jack's funeral, Bobby's funeral, \n     touch football, prayers at Arlington. The context was pure, \n     incredible Kennedy. The clan had gathered at Hyannis Port to \n     celebrate the wedding of Rory Kennedy. A huge tent had been \n     set up on Ethel's lawn. It was the one mercy of the grim \n     weekend. The Kennedys, who derive such solace from each \n     other, were together. The wedding was postponed. The family \n     mourned.\n       Washington talked of nothing else. Arguments broke out over \n     ``the curse of the Kennedys''--was it really the rashness of \n     its members? ``Where was God in all this?'' one man demanded \n     to know at a subdued Saturday party.\n       All agreed on one point: It was a shame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/22/senate-section/article/S9070-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9070-S9071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CALIFORNIA'S GUN CONTROL LAWS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this week, California Governor Gray \nDavis signed into law two of the strictest gun control measures in the \ncountry. One of these laws is the nation's most comprehensive ban on \nassault weapons, and the other prohibits the purchase of more than one \nhandgun a month.\n  California residents support these common sense safety measures \ndesigned to take lethal, semiautomatic weapons off the streets, and \nreduce illegal gun trafficking. Californians feel strongly about ending \nthe easy accessibility of guns because of their history with gun \nviolence over this last decade. In 1989, Americans were shocked when a \nmadman walked into a schoolyard in Stockton, CA, with a rapid-firing \nAK-47 and shot off 50 rounds a minute for 2 minutes, killing 5 children \nand wounding 30. Californians were again struck by tragedy in a 1993 \nmassacre at a San Francisco law firm in which 8 people died and 6 were \nwounded, and again in 1997, when a high profile armed bank robbery \nspilled out on to the streets of North Hollywood.\n  As always, NRA lobbyists were working to undermine the effort of the \nCalifornia state legislature. But because gun violence has held such a \nprominent and tragic place in the minds and hearts of Californians, the \nlegislature was able to defy the NRA and pass these responsible gun \ncontrol measures. So many families in California have been torn apart \nby gun violence, and so many people have been affected by the weak gun \ncontrol laws in this nation, that the NRA failed in the California \nstate legislature.\n  I hope that other states will follow the lead of the California state \nlegislature and pass responsible gun control measures. I pray that they \nlearn from the tragedies in California, rather than wait for a decade \nof tragedies to occur in their own states, before passing responsible \nsafety measures. I also make an appeal to my Congressional colleagues \nto pass sensible gun control legislation now. Although in this case, \nthe debate on gun violence has moved to the state legislature, Congress \nhas not been absolved of its responsibility.\n\n[[Page S9071]]\n\nWe must end the plague of gun violence that claims so many innocent \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/22/senate-section/article/S9071-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to lend my \nsupport for the inclusion of $15,000,000 million for the Oklahoma City \nNational Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism. This \nimportant funding brings to completion the creation of the Oklahoma \nCity National Memorial Trust as specified by PL. 104-58.\n  During the 104th Congress, we created the Oklahoma City National \nMemorial Trust to commemorate the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah \nFederal Building in Oklahoma City. The Oklahoma City National Memorial \nwill consist of three components: the actual Memorial, an interactive \nlearning museum, and the Memorial Institute now funded in this \nlegislation.\n  Fundraising for the symbolic Memorial and the Memorial Center is \nnearly complete and construction for the symbolic Memorial is complete. \nWith the funding provided in this legislation, the Memorial Institute \nis one step closer to a reality. Already, an implementation plan for \nthe Memorial Institute is complete and work has begun to prepare for \nthe construction.\n  In preparation, the Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation and \nthe Oklahoma City Memorial Trust have entered into a partnership with \nthe Oklahoma Alliance for Public Policy Research to establish an \noperational relationship for the Memorial Institute. The Alliance \nconsists of all of Oklahoma's research universities (Oklahoma State, \nUniversity of Oklahoma, and Tulsa University), while the University of \nOklahoma Health Sciences Center will perform the administrative and \nfunctional duties as directed by the Institute's management team.\n  The Alliance meets the joint public-private partnership arrangement \nprovided for in the Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust Act. This \njoint partnership is both prudent and necessary as Oklahoma and the \nnation begins to consider the broader implications of domestic \nterrorism.\n  The Memorial Institute will be the only institute of its kind in the \nnation dedicated to understanding, deterring, and mitigating against \nterrorism. Naturally, it is only fitting that such a center is located \nin Oklahoma given our close, personal relationship with domestic \nterrorism. Yet this Memorial Institute will go beyond being just \nanother reminder of the tragic event that struck Oklahoma and the \nnation early in the morning of April 19, 1995.\n  The Memorial Institute will also provide a collaboration and exchange \nof knowledge between public and private, Federal and state, and \nmilitary and civilian efforts to counter terrorism. Another important \nissue that will be researched at the Memorial Institute is how to \nbetter coordinate and integrate health care and medical efforts \nassociated with our response to terrorism. This collaborative research \non emerging counter-terrorism projects will lend key insights to \nensuring that the events of April 19 never occur again.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chairman, Senator Gregg, and the Ranking \nMember, Senator Hollings, for efforts to secure this important funding \nfor the Memorial Institute.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend a constituent of mine from Fort Collins, Colorado--Lieutenant \nCommander Carl Oesterle, an F-18 pilot on the air craft carrier U.S.S. \nConstellation. Colorado is a state blessed with a large number of \ndedicated active duty personnel and retired military, and as a member \nof the Armed Services Committee I like to take the opportunity to \ncommend our personnel when they conduct themselves in a top notch \nmanner.\n  I am sure that LCDR Oesterle would insist that he was doing nothing \nmore than his duty on June 23, while participating in a night training \nmission in the Pacific. But his actions in salvaging his seriously \ndisabled fighter by conducting an emergency landing on the \nConstellation demonstrate the excellent training and dedication of our \nnation's fighter pilots. The episode is outlined very well in a July 9, \narticle in the Washington Times and I ask unanimous consent that this \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, July 9, 1999]\n\n                     Inside the Ring--Navy Heroics\n\n                 (By Bill Gertz and Rowan Scarborough)\n\n       The Navy aviation community is buzzing over the heroics of \n     an F-18C pilot on the carrier USS Constellation, or \n     ``Connie'' to her friends.\n       On June 23, as the pilot catapulted off the deck in the \n     Pacific for a night mission, he experienced twin engine \n     problems blamed on the dreaded ingestion of foreign objects, \n     such as a metal washer or shirt button, that sometimes miss \n     detection on deck, according to a Navy source.\n       The $35 million strike fighter was so crippled, aviators on \n     the Connie thought the pilot would quickly bail out.\n       But instead of taking the easy way, the pilot stuck with \n     the plane, coaxing its altitude up to 80 feet, then 150 as he \n     jettisoned fuel.\n       Meanwhile, the ship's crew scurried to erect netting, \n     called a barricade, to trap the aircraft if the pilot could \n     achieve enough speed and altitude to manhandle it into \n     landing position.\n       His first pass was high. On a second try, as tension grew \n     and the landing signal officer barked commands via radio, the \n     pilot hit the barricade dead center. the ship erupted in \n     cheers.\n       ``Everyone on the platform was hugging and almost in \n     tears,'' said an officer who helped the pilot to safety. \n     ``Our prayer was definitely answered as Oyster (the pilot's \n     nickname) popped open the canopy and hopped out of the jet.''\n       What motivated the pilot to risk his life to save the \n     plane?\n       A naval pilot in Washington offered this: ``It's long been \n     a question in flying circles on when to make the \n     determination it's time to eject. With today's zero-defect-\n     mentality and second-guessing. There's tremendous pressure \n     for a guy to stay with the airplane. It's a tough call.''\n       Cmdr. Dave Koontz, a Navy spokesman in San Diego, could not \n     confirm that the pilot encountered double engine problems. He \n     said one engine failed and the Navy has started an inquiry to \n     find out why.\n       ``You're trained to handle emergencies and there is a \n     variety of emergencies that come up,'' said Cmdr. Koontz, a \n     former helicopter pilot who served on the Constellation. ``I \n     personally think what he did was pretty heroic.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/22/senate-section/article/S9071-4", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9071-S9072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:52 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Berry, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1995.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to limit \nthe reporting requirements regarding higher education tuition and \nrelated expenses, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 HIGHER EDUCATION REPORTING RELIEF ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce The Higher \nEducation Reporting Relief Act of 1999, which will reduce the \nburdensome reporting requirements placed on educational institutions by \nthe Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning Tax Credits. I am pleased to \nbe joined by my principal cosponsor, Senator DeWine, who has been a \nleader on this and many other education issues, and by one colleague \nSenator Gordon Smith, who shares our concern for the reporting burden \nwe are placing on our institutions of higher education.\n  When Congress created the Hope Scholarship and the Lifetime Learning \nTax Credits, it unfortunately imposed a burdensome and costly reporting \nrequirement on our universities, colleges and proprietary schools. If \nimplemented, the regulations will require schools to provide the IRS \nwith information on their students that is difficult to obtain, \nincluding the taxpayer identification number of the individual who will \nactually claim the tax credit generated by the student. In many cases, \nthis individual will not be the student but rather his or her parent or \nparents.\n  In the words of the President of the University of Maine at \nFarmington:\n\n       At a time when we are working to increase access and to \n     contain college costs, new government reporting requirements \n     are working against us. We will need to add personnel, not in \n     support of our educational functions but to comply with new \n     IRS regulations. This is not sensible and it is definitely \n     not in the interests of the people we are here to serve.\n\n  I think that her words say it very well.\n  Already, the University of Maine System has been forced to spend \n$112,000 to meet the Hope Scholarship reporting requirement, and the \nmost burdensome requirements have not yet become mandatory. In total, \nthese reporting requirements are estimated to cost America's \npostsecondary educational institutions as much as $125 million. This \nburden does not make sense.\n  Last year, by passing the Collins-DeWine amendment to the Internal \nRevenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act, the Senate eliminated one \nof the most difficult reporting requirements. Our amendment freed \nschools from the requirement to report financial aid received by a \nstudent from a third party and held them responsible for only informing \nthe IRS about financial aid that a school actually administered. In \naddition, the conference report on the act recognized the problem faced \nby schools and deferred the implementation of full reporting \nrequirements until the IRS had issued final guidelines. Since the final \nreporting requirements have not been issued, this deferral remains in \neffect for tax year 1999.\n  The conference report further urged the IRS to modernize its computer \nsystems to include the capacity to match a dependent student's taxpayer \nidentification number with the return of the person claiming the \nstudent as a dependent. This is the true answer to this problem. \nUnfortunately, this has not yet been done. If this step is not taken, \ninstitutions of higher education will be required to provide this \nburdensome & costly information to the IRS--a very difficult process.\n  The legislation we introduce today will defer the implementation of \nthe reporting requirements for three years--through tax year \n2001. Further, it will require the IRS to upgrade its data processing \nsystems along the lines recommended by the conference report. Today, as \nI mention, the IRS has not done this. The IRS will be required to make \nthis change in time for processing tax returns for the year 2002. We \nhave included this delay to give the IRS 2 years after it has been \ncompleted dealing with any data processing problems caused by the year \n2000 problem.\n\n  The rationale for the Hope and the Lifetime Learning credits is to \nmake postsecondary education more affordable and therefore more \naccessible. What Congress has given with one hand it has taken away in \npart with its regulatory hand. The cost of conforming to the regulatory \nrequirements will inevitably result in increases in tuition, chipping \naway at the benefit of the tax credits. We need to correct this \nproblem. The $112,000 that the University of Maine has already been \nforced to spend to comply with the law clearly is going to be passed on \nto the students in increased tuitions.\n  Last year, Senator DeWine and I introduced the Higher Education \nReporting Relief Act that would have completely repealed the reporting \nrequirements imposed on educational institutions. Because of the cost \nof that approach, we have reworked last year's bill in a way that will \naccomplish its most important objectives while substantially reducing \nits potential costs to the Treasury. Our legislation would still leave \na reporting burden on the schools but a much more modest and reasonable \none that takes into account who is best equipped to report the \ninformation that the IRS needs to administer the law.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us in supporting the Higher Education \nReporting Relief Act of 1999.\n  I yield the reminder of my time to Senator DeWine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I am delighted to again join with my distinguished \ncolleague from the State of Maine to try to give some relief to \ncolleges and universities. As she has pointed out, this burden placed \nby Congress was unintended. I\n\n[[Page S9074]]\n\nseriously doubt if anyone thought that aspect of the legislation \nthrough or fully understood what kind of costs this would impose on our \ncolleges.\n  The Senator has indicated that Maine, for example, has already been \nhit with over $100,000 in costs. We could multiply that around the \ncountry for every university and every college. This ultimately, of \ncourse, will go where all costs go, to the students and the parents.\n  This is something we should deal with and we should deal with very \nquickly. I join this morning with my colleague from Maine to introduce \nthe Higher Education Reporting Relief Act. As she has indicated, this \nis the second time she and I have introduced legislation to provide \nsome very much needed paperwork relief for the colleges and \nuniversities of our country.\n  A compromise version of the legislation we introduced last year was \npassed by Congress as part of the IRS reform bill. Senator Collins and \nI are here today to complete that very important work and to do what \nhas remained undone from last year.\n  As my colleague from Maine has indicated, what prompted the need for \nthis legislation was the Hope scholarship and the Lifetime Learning tax \ncredit. This legislation required colleges and universities to comply \nwith very burdensome and costly regulations. Schools were required to \nissue annual reports to students and the Internal Revenue Service \ndetailing the students' tuition payments. The IRS planned to use the \nreports to monitor the eligibility of students who apply for the \neducation tax credits. These reporting requirements require colleges \nand universities to spend millions of dollars to implement and \nmaintain.\n  The legislation Senator Collins and I were able to pass last year \neliminated many of the most burdensome reporting requirements, yet \nthere are burdensome requirements that still remain law. It is time, we \nbelieve, to finish the job we started last year.\n  Our bill will further reduce the reporting requirements by making two \nvery commonsense changes to our Tax Code. First, the IRS will be \nprohibited from imposing any new reporting requirements on colleges and \nuniversities prior to the year 2002. No school of higher education \nshould have additional IRS requirements imposed while it is still \ndeveloping its reporting system.\n  Second, the IRS will be required to update its computer system by the \nend of 2002. The IRS computer system would be updated to make it \ncapable of matching the IRS taxpayer identification number of the \nstudent with the person claiming this child as a dependent. This update \nwould greatly reduce the reporting burden of the Hope scholarship.\n  After this update, when a parent uses the Hope scholarship, the IRS \nwill be able to electronically verify that a family was qualified to \nuse this deduction. This process will eliminate a great deal of costly \nand time-consuming paperwork for the colleges and universities of our \nNation. This legislation brings a simple, fair, commonsense solution to \nthe unintentional barriers created by the reporting requirements of the \nHope scholarship and the Lifetime Learning tax credit. It would \nrepresent significant savings to our colleges and to our universities.\n  I certainly hope the Senator from Maine and I will once again be \nsuccessful this year, as we were last year, in bringing relief to \ninstitutions of higher education. I invite my colleagues in the Senate \nto join as cosponsors.\n  I, once again, thank my colleague from Maine for her leadership on \nthis legislation. She is a true leader in the area of education and has \ndone a great deal of work in this area. This bill is one more example \nof her true understanding of how the real world works--what happens in \nour home States when Congress takes actions that, frankly, result in \nunintended consequences. The unintended consequences in this case are \nadded burdens on our colleges, costs that our colleges have to bear, \ncosts that our colleges then have to turn around and impose on parents \nand students.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Maine for once again being a true \nleader in this area.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 1413. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the deduction from the estate tax for family-owned business \ninterest; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESS ESTATE TAX RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nDorgan today introducing legislation which would make it easier for a \nfamily to hold onto a small business or farm when the head of the \nfamily passes away. I am especially pleased to be joined by Senator \nDorgan on this bill as he has been a good friend and colleague for \nalmost two decades and a real leader on small business issues since his \nelection to Congress in 1980.\n  Mr. President, ownership is a powerful force. Anyone who has gone \nfrom renting to owning a home will tell you how much more work you put \nin as an owner. Suddenly, problems with the plumbing or the roof that \nused to be the landlord's problems are now your problems. Developments \nin the neighborhood take on new meaning and you tend to spend more time \nworking with neighbors to figure out ways to make your community \nstronger.\n  The trade-off for all this work is that whatever improvements we make \nto our homes and our communities, they're ours. And if our homes \nincrease in value, we get to keep the difference.\n  The same is true for small businesses and family farms. Most people \nwho have gone from being an employee to owning a small business or farm \nwill tell you that they work harder as an owner, save more, and take \nmore pride in their work. As with homeowners, small businesspeople and \nfarmers are willing to put in the extra work it takes to run a business \nbecause they know it will come back to them in the form of more \ncustomers and higher profits. It is this industrious spirit that has \ndefined our nation for more than two centuries and allowed us to enjoy \na level of prosperity unknown in any other part of the world, in any \nother era of human history.\n  The bill we are introducing today makes a simple change in the tax \ncode that will help families pass down the legacy of business ownership \nfrom one generation to the next.\n  Mr. President, the federal estate tax is one of the most \ncontroversial provisions of the tax code. Whatever the merits or \nshortcomings of the estate tax, I believe most of my colleagues would \nagree that a family should not have to sell a small business or family \nfarm just because the head of the family passes away. Unfortunately, \nsmall business owners face a very real concern that the estate tax may \nforce their families to do just that, particularly families whose \nbusiness' principal assets consist of machinery, real estate, \nequipment, and inventory . Those families fortunate enough to avoid \nselling their business or farm are often frustrated by having to \nfinance their estate tax burden at the expense of needed investments in \nthe business.\n  Recognizing this problem, Congress worked on a bipartisan basis in \n1997 to include provisions in the Taxpayer Relief Act which provide \ntargeted assistance to estates with family-owned businesses and farms. \nAmong its provisions, the Taxpayer Relief Act provided an immediate \nincrease in the estate tax exemption from $600,000 to $1.3 million for \nestates with businesses that are kept in the family, and improved the \nterms for installment payments made by estates with businesses by \nreducing the interest rate from 4 percent to 2 percent for the first $1 \nmillion in taxable value of the business in excess of the $1.3 million \nexemption.\n  The bill that Senator Dorgan and I are introducing today builds on \nthe 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act by simply doubling the $1.3 million \nexemption for family-owned businesses and farms to $2.6 million. This \nnew level would mean that a typical business with up to 25 employees \nwould face no estate tax liability if the business is kept in the \nfamily after the owner dies. Somewhat larger businesses would enjoy a \nsignificant reduction in their estate tax burden.\n  Mr. President, we should be doing what we can to promote small \nbusiness and farm ownership in America. This bill does just that by \nsimply making it easier for families to continue their tradition of \nsmall business ownership. I urge all my colleagues to join Senator \nDorgan and me in supporting this legislation.\n\n[[Page S9075]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1413\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTIOIN 1. INCREASE IN ESTATE TAX DEDUCTION FOR FAMILY-OWNED \n                   BUSINESS INTEREST.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 2057(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to maximum deduction) is amended by \n     striking ``$675,000'' and inserting ``$1,975,000''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 2057(a)(3)(B) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to coordination with \n     unified credit) is amended by striking ``$675,000'' each \n     place it appears in the text and heading and inserting \n     ``$1,975,000''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to estates of decedents dying after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I'm pleased to join Senator Durbin \nin introducing estate tax relief legislation to boost immediately to \n$2.6 million the amount of family business assets that can be \ntransferred to the next generation without loading up that family \nbusiness with a large tax debt. I feel strongly that we must prevent \nour estate tax laws from hindering the transfer of family farms, \nranches and other small businesses to the next generation of family \nmembers who would continue to operate them. We made some important \nchanges to the estate tax laws in the last Congress to make it easier \nfor children to take over a family business when a parent dies and keep \nthe business going. But these changes did not go far enough.\n  Family-owned enterprises are a source of social stability and \ncohesion in this country. They generate jobs and wealth. Yet in far too \nmany cases, the estate tax laws exert pressure on the children and \ngrandchildren who inherit a modestly-sized family business to sell it, \nor a large part of it, to pay off those taxes. Our tax laws should \nencourage enterprises to stay in family ownership, with all the \nbenefits that brings to our communities and to the nation. Yet \nfrequently today the estate tax laws do the opposite.\n  Congress took some steps in a major tax bill in 1997, which I \nsupported, to enable family farms, ranches, and other small family \nbusinesses to be passed along to the next generation without being \nloaded up with massive estate tax debt. The 1997 bill changes estate \ntaxes in two basic ways. First, the legislation increased the unified \nestate and gift tax exemption from $600,000 to $1 million over a period \nof years. Second, it provided a new exemption from estate taxes for \nqualifying family businesses, valued up to $1.3 million, that are \npassed down to the children and grandchildren who will operate the farm \nor business. This new exclusion is the result of a bipartisan effort in \nCongress to encourage business enterprise that is based on the family \nunit.\n  However, Senator Durbin and I believe that the $1.3 million family \nbusiness exclusion needs to be substantially increased, and we suspect \nthat a number of our colleagues in the Senate share this view. We are \nproposing such an increase today.\n  Our legislation is simple and straightforward. It doubles the dollar \nvalue from $1.3 million to $2.6 million of a family business that may \nbe transferred to inheriting family members without an estate tax \nobligation. This will be a great help to families that want to pass \nalong a small business, which might have been the family's major asset \nfor decades, to the kids to operate following the death of a parent.\n  Estate tax relief for family businesses is not a partisan issue. It \nis important for the survival of our nation's family businesses, and it \nshould be a priority for any tax cuts that Congress enacts.\n  This is not however a proposal to reduce estate taxes for every rich \nperson in America. We see no need to enact a big new benefit for the \nnation's trust fund babies. It should go to where the need is greatest, \nand where the economic and social benefits will be greatest as well. \nThat means small family businesses.\n  In the end, we hope that some additional estate tax relief will be \nenacted to sustain family-owned businesses and farms, which make up the \nbackbone of our economy. We believe that our approach takes a large \nstep in that direction. We urge our colleagues to cosponsor this much-\nneeded legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK:\n  S. 1414. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrestore access to home health services covered under the Medicare \nProgram, and to protect the Medicare Program from financial loss while \npreserving the due process rights of home health agencies to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\nmedicare home health beneficiary equity and payment simplification act \n                                of 1999\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President today I am pleased to join my colleague, Mr. \nBreaux, in sponsoring The Medicare Home Health Beneficiary Equity and \nPayment Simplification Act of 1999.\n  This legislation sets forth a fully developed prospective payment \nsystem for Medicare home health benefits that can be implemented easily \nusing currently available data and can be accurately monitored to \nprevent fraud and abuse. Most importantly, the bill restores access to \ncovered services for the sickest, most frail Medicare beneficiaries \nwhile providing incentives for efficient treatment of all patients \nregardless of the acuity of their medical condition.\n  The bill provides for a simple four-category prospective payment \nsystem for home health services (similar to the four-category system \nwhich has been in place for hospice services since 1983) which is based \non data from a 1997 study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation on \ncharacteristics of Medicare patients in need of covered home health \nservices. The Kaiser Foundation study found that Medicare patients in \nneed of home health services historically have fallen into one of the \nfollowing categories:\n  1. Post-hospital, short stay beneficiaries\n  2. Medically stable, long-stay beneficiaries\n  3. Medically complex, long-stay beneficiaries\n  4. Medically unstable and complex, extremely high use beneficiaries\n  Beneficiaries who meet all eligibility and coverage requirements for \nMedicare will be assigned to the appropriate category by a physician \nwho does not have a prohibited relationship with the home health agency \nas defined in the ``Stark II'' law. Beneficiaries who do not clearly \nfit in one of the four categories will be placed in the first, lowest \nrate category.\n  Payment rates for each of the categories is the average cost of \ntreating patients in that category in 1994 as determined by the Kaiser \nFoundation study. Those rates are adjusted for wage variations in \ndifferent parts of the country and updated by the home health market \nbasket for each fiscal year. The Secretary of HHS is given the \nauthority to provide additional payments to certain agencies that have \nhigher costs due to reasons beyond their control.\n  The bill would eliminate the 15% cut in Medicare home health \nreimbursement which is scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 2000. \nThe bill would also simplify the reimbursement system by making \npayments based on the location of the agency rather than the residence \nof the patient. The bill is intended to provide a ``fail safe'' \nprospective payment mechanism in the event that HCFA falls behind in \nits schedule to implement a prospective payment system by October 1, \n2000 that can be administered efficiently and monitored effectively.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in co-sponsoring this important piece \nof legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1414\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Home Health \n     Beneficiary Equity and Payment Simplification Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Research has shown that medicare beneficiaries who are \n     in need of home health services that are covered under the \n     medicare program generally fall into 1 of the 4 following \n     categories:\n\n[[Page S9076]]\n\n       (A) Post-hospital, short-stay beneficiaries.\n       (B) Medically stable, long-stay beneficiaries.\n       (C) Medically complex, long-stay beneficiaries.\n       (D) Medically unstable and complex, extremely high-use \n     beneficiaries.\n       (2) The interim payment system for home health services \n     under the medicare program, enacted as part of the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997 and amended by title V of the Tax and \n     Trade Relief Extension Act of 1998 (contained in Division J \n     of Public Law 105-277), is having the following unintended \n     consequences:\n       (A) The sickest, most frail medicare beneficiaries are \n     losing access to medically necessary home health services \n     that are otherwise covered under the medicare program.\n       (B) Many high quality, cost-effective home health agencies \n     have had per beneficiary limits under the interim payment \n     system set so low that such agencies are finding it \n     impossible to continue to provide home health services under \n     the medicare program.\n       (C) Many home health agencies are being subjected to \n     aggregate per beneficiary limits under the interim payment \n     system that do not accurately reflect the current patient mix \n     of such agencies, thereby making it impossible for such \n     agencies to compete with similarly situated home health \n     agencies.\n       (D) Medicare beneficiaries that reside in certain States \n     and regions of the country have far less access to home \n     health services under the medicare program than individuals \n     who have identical medical conditions but reside in other \n     States or regions of the country.\n       (E) The health status of home health beneficiaries varies \n     significantly in different regions of the country, creating \n     differing needs for home health services.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor S corporation reform, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould provide critical and direct improvements to the competitiveness \nof the over 2.1 million S corporations nationwide. The vast majority of \nS corporations operate as small businesses. By 1995, they comprised 48 \npercent of all corporations. In my home state of Utah, S corporations \nmake up half of the 21,600 corporations in the state.\n  Despite the reforms that were enacted in 1996 and in previous years, \nthe tax laws that currently govern S corporations remain too \nrestrictive, complex, and burdensome, particularly in comparison with \nthe laws that are imposed on other entities. As a result, Mr. \nPresident, many of these small businesses are unable to attract \nsufficient capital and to grow to their full potential.\n  For example, the inability to issue preferred stock denies S \ncorporations access to badly needed senior equity. Capital is also \neliminated by a requirement that prevents straight debt from being \nconverted into stock. Substantial reforms need to be enacted to ensure \nbetter competition for small businesses in today's increasingly \nsophisticated and global economy.\n  Mr. President, the current law is threatening the multi-generational \nfamily business in our country. Law allows only for 75 shareholders \nunder an S corporation, and each member of a family is currently \ntreated as a single, distinct shareholder. In addition, nonresident \naliens are not allowed as shareholders. This ban on nonresident alien \nshareholders is an outmoded restriction dating back to the creation of \nSubchapter S. Since that time, partnerships have been allowed to \ninvolve nonresidential aliens. And, as the economy becomes more global, \nS corporations will be at a disadvantage relative to the more flexible \npartnerships. Mr. President, this bill would eliminate these outdated \nprovisions and allow for all family members to be counted as one \nshareholder for purposes of S corporation eligibility, as well as \npermitting nonresident aliens to be shareholders.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to review and support the \nSubchapter S Revision Act. This legislation will help American families \npass their businesses from one generation to the next and to create a \nlevel playing field for small business. We should not allow the more \nthan 10,000 S corporations in my home state, as well as the many others \nacross the country, to be subject to rules and regulations that limit \ntheir competitiveness. I am looking forward to working with my fellow \nmembers of the Finance Committee in enacting this bill.\n  I ask that a description of the bill's provisions be in included in \nthe Record.\n  The description follows:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/22/senate-section/article/S9077-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9077-S9093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TITLE 1--SUBCHAPTER S EXPANSION\n\n\n         Subtitle A--Eligible Shareholders of an S Corporation\n\n       Sec. 101. Members of a family treated as one shareholder--\n     All family members within seven generations who own stock \n     could elect to be treated as one shareholder. The election \n     would be made available to only one family per corporation, \n     must be made with the consent of all shareholders of the \n     corporation and would remain in effect until terminated. This \n     provision is intended to keep S corporations within families \n     that might span several generations.\n       Sec. 102. Nonresident Aliens--This section would provide \n     the opportunity for aliens to invest in domestic S \n     corporations and S corporations to operate abroad with a \n     foreign shareholder by allowing nonresident aliens to own S \n     corporation stock.\n\n\n     Subtitle B--Qualifications and Eligibility Requirements of S \n                              Corporations\n\n       Sec. 111. Issuance of preferred stock permitted--An S \n     corporation would be allowed to issue either convertible or \n     plain vanilla preferred stock. Holders of preferred stock \n     would not be treated as shareholders; thus, ineligible \n     shareholders like corporations or partnerships could own \n     preferred stock interests in S corporations. Subchapter S \n     corporations would receive the same recapitalization \n     treatment as family-owned C corporations. This provision \n     would afford S corporations and their shareholders badly \n     needed access to senior equity.\n       Sec. 112. Safe harbor expanded to include convertible \n     debt--An S corporation is not considered to have more than \n     one class of stock if outstanding debt obligations to \n     shareholders meet the ``straight debt'' safe harbor. \n     Currently, the safe harbor provides that straight debt cannot \n     be convertible into stock. The legislation would permit a \n     convertibility provision so long as that provision is \n     substantially the same as one that could have been obtained \n     by a person not related to the S corporation or S corporation \n     shareholders.\n       Sec. 113. Repeal of excessive passive investment income as \n     a termination event: This provision would repeal the current \n     rule that terminates S corporation status for certain \n     corporations that have both Subchapter C earnings and profits \n     and that derive more than 25 percent of their gross receipts \n     from passive sources for three consecutive years.\n       Sec. 114. Repeal passive income capital gain category--The \n     legislation would retain the rule that imposes a tax on those \n     corporations possessing excess net passive investment income, \n     but, to conform to the general treatment of capital gains, it \n     would exclude capital gains from classification as passive \n     income. Thus, such capital gains would be subject to a \n     maximum 20 percent rate at the shareholder level in keeping \n     with the 1997 tax law change. Excluding capital gains also \n     parallels their treatment under the PHC rules.\n       Sec. 115. Allowance of charitable contributions of \n     inventory and scientific property--This provision would allow \n     the same deduction for charitable contributions of inventory \n     and scientific property used to care for the ill, needy, or \n     infants for Subchapter S as for Subchapter C corporations. In \n     addition, S corporations would no longer be disqualified from \n     making ``qualified research contributions'' (charitable \n     contributions of inventory property to educational \n     institutions or scientific research organizations) for use in \n     research or experimentation.\n       Sec. 116. C corporation rules to apply for fringe benefit \n     purposes--The current rule that limits the ability of ``more-\n     than-two-percent'' S corporation shareholder-employees to \n     exclude certain fringe benefits from wages would be repealed \n     for benefits other than health insurance.\n\n\n           Subtitle C--Taxation of S Corporation Shareholders\n\n       Sec. 120. Treatment of losses to shareholders--A loss \n     recognized by a shareholder in complete liquidation of an S \n     corporation would be treated as an ordinary loss to the \n     extent the shareholder's adjusted basis in the S corporation \n     stock is attributable to ordinary income that was recognized \n     as a result of the liquidation. Suspended passive activity \n     losses from C corporation years would be allowed as \n     deductions when and to the extent they would be allowed to C \n     corporations.\n\n\n                       Subtitle D--Effective Date\n\n       Sec. 130. Effective Date--Except as otherwise provided, the \n     amendments made by this legislation shall apply to taxable \n     years beginning after December 31, 1999.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 1416. A bill to amend the Agricultural Marketing Agreement of 1937 \nto allow a modified bloc voting by cooperative associations of milk \nproducers in connection with the scheduled August referendum on Federal \nMilk Marketing Order reform; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n               DEMOCRACY FOR DAIRY PRODUCERS ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a measure \nthat will begin to restore to many dairy farmers throughout the nation, \npart of the market power they have lost in recent years.\n  Mr. President, on March 31 of this year, Secretary Glickman put forth \nthe Department of Agriculture's final rule on the Federal Milk \nMarketing Order system. As many of you know, that proposal consolidated \nfederal orders and made changes to various pricing formulas in current \nlaw.\n\n[[Page S9078]]\n\n  As mandated in last year's Omnibus Appropriations bill, this new \nfederal policy is scheduled to take effect no later than October 1, \n1999. However, prior to October, this nation's farmers will put USDA's \nproposal to a referendum. Farmers will have the opportunity to vote on \ntheir futures. Or at least that is what is supposed to happen.\n  Mr. President, most farmers in the country won't actually get to vote \non this, the most significant change in dairy policy in sixty years. \nTheir dairy marketing cooperatives will cast their votes for them.\n  This procedure is called bloc voting and it is used all the time. \nBasically, a Cooperative's Board of Directors decides that, in the \ninterest of time, bloc voting will be implemented for that particular \nvote. In the interest of time, but not always in the interest of their \nproducer owner-members.\n  Mr. President, I do think that bloc voting can be a useful tool in \nsome circumstances, but I have serious concerns about its use in the \nAugust referendum on USDA's plan. Farmers in Wisconsin and in other \nstates tell me that they do not agree with their Cooperative's view on \nthe upcoming vote. Yet, they have no way to preserve their right to \nmake their single vote count.\n  After speaking to farmers and officials at USDA, I have learned that \nif a Cooperative bloc votes, individual members simply have no \nopportunity to voice opinions separately. That seems unfair when you \nconsider what a monumental issue is at stake. Coops and their members \ndo not always have identical interests. We shouldn't ask farmers to \nignore that fact.\n  Mr. President, the Democracy for Dairy Producers Act of 1999 is \nsimple and fair. It provides that a cooperative cannot deny any of its \nmembers a ballot if one or two or ten or all of the members chose to \nvote on their own.\n  This will in no way slow down the process at USDA; implementation of \nthe final rule will proceed on schedule. Also, I do not expect that \nthis would change the final outcome of the vote. Coops could still cast \nvotes for their members who do not exercise their right to vote \nindividually. And to the extent that coops represent farmers interest, \nfarmers are likely to vote along with the coops, but whether they join \nthe coops or not, farmers deserve the right to vote according to their \nown views.\n  I urge my colleagues to return just a little bit of power to \nAmerica's farmers, and a little bit of pure democracy to the vote on \nthe USDA plan which is sure to have such an impact on their future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Democracy for Dairy Producers \nAct, a dairy bill without regional bias.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 1417. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nextend the authority of State Medicaid fraud control units to \ninvestigate and prosecute fraud in connection with Federal health care \nprograms and abuse of residents of board and care facilities; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                 health care fraud control act of 1999\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senator Breaux in \nintroducing the Health Care Fraud Control Act of 1999. This bill is an \neffective, efficient and economical way to fight fraud, waste and abuse \nin publicly funded health care programs. It takes a system that is \nsuccessful in combating Medicaid fraud and expands its authority to \npursue investigations in other federal programs when investigators \nuncover or suspect fraudulent or abusive activities. This bill is \ncommon sense.\n  State Medicaid Fraud Control Units have long been at the forefront of \nhealth care fraud enforcement. The Health Care Fraud Control Act would \ngive these units the authority needed to investigate other fraud and \nabuse cases, including Medicare cases, at the same time as Medicaid \ncases. This bill, which will be introduced by Rep. Rick Lazio (R-N.Y.) \nin the House, would streamline the enforcement process for anti-fraud \nagents, cutting down on bureaucracy and allowing investigators to \npursue anti-fraud cases more efficiently. This bill is an important \nweapon in the war against health care fraud in the Medicaid and \nMedicare programs.\n  The streamlined effort would be especially effective in fighting \nnursing home fraud and neglect. Many times seniors are eligible for \nboth Medicare and Medicaid payments. Combined, these two programs cover \nthe bulk of the cost of nursing home care in our country. When a \nnursing home receives both Medicare and Medicaid payments, the \npotential for fraud is much too high. As the law stands, even if a \nfraud control unit establishes a strong case showing Medicaid fraud and \nuncovers Medicare fraud at the same time, it must wait while various \nfederal agencies investigate the Medicare side before the case can be \nprosecuted.\n  Any effort to combat fraud is critical. Medicaid's annual budget is \n$178 billion, and fraud cases can involve significant amounts of money. \nMeanwhile, improper payments through Medicare were $12.6 billion in \nFiscal Year 1998.\n  Expanding the Medicaid anti-fraud units' jurisdiction will help us \nerode health care fraud. With billions of tax dollars wasted each year, \nwe need every weapon we can find in the anti-fraud arsenal. We can't \nafford to waste a single health care dollar.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 1419. A bill to amend title 36, United States Code, to designate \nMay as ``National Military Appreciation Month''; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                  national military appreciation month\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \ndesignate the month of May National Military Appreciation Month. As my \ncolleagues may recall, I had sponsored a resolution earlier in the \nyear, cosponsored by 61 Senators, designating May 1999 as National \nMilitary Appreciation Month. That resolution, S. Res. 33, passed by a \nvote of 93-0 on April 30. The new bill will make that designation \npermanent.\n  The introduction of an All-Volunteer Army was an outgrowth of the \ndisenchantment many Americans felt in the wake of the Vietnam War. The \nend of conscription and the transition to the All-Volunteer concept has \nbeen criticized by some for not adequately reflecting socioeconomic \ndivisions within our country. In point of fact, however, with the \nrequisite attention and care, it produced the finest armed forces in \nhistory. How far we had come since the tumultuous times of the 1970s \nwhen military readiness descended to abysmal levels was evident for all \nthe world to see in the overwhelming victory over Iraqi forces during \nOperation Desert Storm. But that success has been taken for granted too \nlong. Over 15 years of declining military budgets, combined with record \nhigh levels of deployments, have stretched the military to precarious \nlevels.\n  The end of conscription had another, more far-reaching and subtle \nimplication: it diminished the percentage of the public, including its \nelected officials, with military experience. This is not a criticism of \nthose who did not serve; on the contrary, as a strong supporter of the \nAll-Volunteer Army, I remain committed to its survival and success. \nThis gradual diminishment in the shared experience of having served in \nuniform, however, makes it increasingly important that the public \nreflect every year on the enormous role their armed forces have on \npreserving freedom.\n  As thousands of American soldiers move into position in Kosovo, while \nothers continue to serve in Bosnia as well as on the demilitarized zone \nin Korea and around the world, it is imperative that our men and women \nin uniform know of the strong continuing support of their country for \ntheir dedication and service to this country. Whether we individually \nagree with each and every deployment or not, we have learned to \nseparate our support every deployment or not, we have learned to \nseparate our support for the armed forces from our differences over the \npolicies that sent them into harm's way. Dedicating one month every \nyear to express our appreciation for the armed forces, the same month \nin which we recognize Victory in Europe Day, Military Spouse Day, Armed \nForces Day, and, most importantly, Memorial Day, is an appropriate \nmeasure that I hope will have the support of all my colleagues in \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I generally take a somewhat dim view of celebratory \nresolutions. But those who fought on the battlefields of Lexington, \nGettysburg, Normandy, in the Ardennes and on\n\n[[Page S9079]]\n\nOkinawa, in Hue and at Khe Sanh, in the deserts of the Persian Gulf and \nthe dusty streets of Mogadish, in the skies over Kosovo and who stand a \nlonely vigil on the DMZ, must not be forgotten. Too much blood has been \nspilled in defense of liberty. We owe to those who perished and those \nwho survived, to devote one month out of the year to reflect on the \nsacrifices of those who have worn their nation's uniform throughout its \nhistory.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, the attached \ncorrespondence in support of S. Res. 33 from the Secretary of the Air \nForce and Air Force Chief of Staff, as well as a letter from retired \nGeneral Gordon Sullivan, president of the Association of the United \nStates Army, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1419\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a fund for the restoration and \nprotection of ocean and coastal resources, to amend and reauthorize the \nCoastal Zone Management Act of 1972, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                        coastal stewardship act\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will shortly be sending to the desk for \nappropriate referral the Coastal Stewardship Act which I am introducing \ntoday, along with Senators Hollings, Breaux, Inouye, Boxer, Feinstein \nand Kennedy. The goal of the Coastal Stewardship Act is to \nsignificantly strengthen our national commitment to and capacity to \nprotect the coastal communities and all of our coastal and ocean \nenvironment.\n  Our coasts--I know the Chair knows this because he represents a State \nthat has enormous fishing interests--our coasts and our oceans are \nincreasingly fragile environments, and they are increasingly \nthreatened. Their health depends on a very complex chain of ecosystems \nthat includes rainwater runoff from inland, estuaries, wetlands, flood \nplains, tidal basins, coral reefs, our fisheries and the whole deal \nmore. Damage to any one of those ecosystems can wind up degrading and \ndamaging the others, and they can cause severe cultural and economic \nimpact for all of our coastal communities.\n  Moreover, as our coastal population grows and as coastal development \nincreases, as it has been almost every year for the last 50 years, we \nare placing more and more stress on these fragile and increasingly \nunique and interconnecting ecosystems.\n  Since 1960, the coastal population in the United States has increased \nby over 50 percent, and that trend is expected to continue. Indeed, it \nis predicted that over the course of the next 10 years or so, well over \n75 percent of the American population will live within 50 miles of \ncoastline of one kind or another. In the next decade alone, an \nadditional 14 million Americans are expected to settle in coastal \nareas.\n  The impact is very clear. On the Atlantic coast, we have had toxic \noutbreaks of pfiesteria. In the Gulf of Mexico, we have a dead zone \nthat has formed that harms shrimp stocks and kills off other species. \nOur Nation has lost more than 89 million acres of coastal wetlands, and \nour commercial fisheries are depleted from a combination of \nmismanagement and also ecosystem impacts. Parts of the Great Lakes have \nsuffered from nutrient enrichment which is destructive to those \necosystems. Finally, even urban areas along our coasts face a unique \nchallenge as they work to clean up polluted industrial sites and bring \ntheir waterfronts back to life.\n  The Coastal Stewardship Act creates the Ocean and Coast Conservation \nFund to receive permanent funding from Federal oil and gas leasing on \nthe Outer Continental Shelf. The fund would accrue 10 percent, or a \nminimum of $250 million of OCS revenues each year.\n  The CSA uses funds from the Ocean and Coast Conservation Fund and \ngeneral revenues to support the restoration and preservation of our \ncoastal and marine resources. The specific investments include the \nfollowing:\n\n[[Page S9080]]\n\n  First, the CSA provides increased support to the Coastal Zone \nManagement Act. The CZMA is a highly flexible program that allows \nStates to prioritize, design, and implement management plans, meeting \nbroad national objectives for coastal environmental protection and \neconomic development.\n  Second, the CSA establishes a new highly flexible program within the \nDepartment of Commerce to fund coastal habitat, restoration, and \npreservation projects. With these block grants for conservation, States \nset priorities and decide how and when projects proceed within broad \nnational goals.\n  Third, it enhances the Federal commitment to the National Marine \nSanctuary Program, a very successful program that designates unique \nocean habitat for protection and research. Our 12 national marine \nsanctuaries restore and rebuild marine habitats to their natural \ncondition and monitor and maintain already healthy areas.\n\n  Four, the CSA creates a coral reef restoration and conservation \nprogram at the Department of Commerce. The legislation recognizes the \nimportance of maintaining the health and stability of coral reefs for \ntheir environmental and economic value, and it builds on the work of \nthe U.S. Coral Reef Task Force.\n  Five, one of the most difficult challenges to overcome in developing \nsound policy for U.S. fisheries has been the lack of high-quality \ninformation. The CSA establishes a comprehensive program to improve the \nquality and quantity of fisheries information available to evaluate \nstock status, design control measures, and monitor effectiveness of \nthose control measures.\n  Six, the CSA increases Federal support of State and local enforcement \nby expanding existing cooperative enforcement agreements. These joint \nventures allow States and local governments to tailor enforcement \nprocedures to fit the local needs and available resources, and also \nallow for collaboration between State and local enforcement agencies \nand Federal agencies.\n  I will close my comments, Mr. President, by saying to my colleagues \nthat some have expressed concern that somehow this broader effort might \nhave an impact on reauthorization of coastal zone management and \nnational marine sanctuaries, et cetera.\n  I assure my colleagues this legislation is in addition to and \nsupportive of and supplementary to each of those other efforts which I \nhave personally had the privilege of leading in the past years when I \nwas chairman of the committee. We have reauthorized those in past \nyears, and always we have found that a comprehensive approach has been \na far more effective and a, frankly, far more needed approach. But \nnothing will stand in the way, I am confident, of our efforts to \ncooperate on each and every one of those efforts.\n  We need to better meet the needs of our coastal communities, and it \nis absolutely essential that we look in this country at this issue, not \nas individual pieces that come at us one by one, but as the sum total \nof the parts they represent. We need a national policy to reflect that \nsum total.\n  I say to Senator Boxer and Senator Landrieu, who have legislation of \ntheir own regarding the Outer Continental Shelf, that I am proud to be \nan original cosponsor of Senator Boxer's Resources 2000 effort, and I \nlook forward to working with them to try to address all the concerns we \nshare regarding these issues.\n  Finally, I am very pleased my colleagues on the Commerce Committee \nhave joined in this. As the Senate knows, the Commerce Committee has \nprimary jurisdiction over our Nation's major coastal programs, and \nSenators Hollings, Breaux, Inouye, and others bring very valuable \nexperience to these issues. I am pleased to include their efforts in \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER:\n  S. 1422. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to improve the quality of education and raise student \nachievement by strengthening accountability, raising standards for \nteachers, rewarding success, and providing better information to \nparents; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                       school quality counts act\n\n      By Mr. SCHUMER:\n  S. 1423. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom income $40,000 of the salary of certain teachers who teach high-\npoverty schools; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     teacher tax relief act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the School \nQuality Counts Act and the Teacher Tax Relief Act of 1999. Mr. \nPresident, the National Center for Education Statistics estimates that \nour nation will require two million teachers over the next decade. In \nNew York State this problem is particularly acute: 40,000 new teachers \nwill be needed over the next four years. In New York City, where there \nare 10,000 emergency-certified teachers overwhelmingly concentrated in \nthe highest poverty schools, there is virtually no incentive for \nqualified professionals to teach at the highest poverty schools and as \na result there exists an uneven distribution of well trained teachers.\n  Across the nation, many school districts are experiencing both \ngeographic and subject area teacher shortages. In many instances, \nschool districts with lower tax bases are forced to compete with \ndistricts that can afford to pay their teachers higher salaries thus \ncreating a drain on the pool of experienced and qualified teachers in \nlower income school districts. Attracting and retaining well-qualified \nteachers, and compensating them appropriately, is critical to raising \nstudent achievement.\n  Mr. President, the School Quality Counts Act deals directly with the \nteacher quality issue in three ways: First, the bill strengthens state \nand local accountability for student results by requiring that school \ndistricts take specific steps to improve teacher quality within two \nyears of the bill's enactment; second, the legislation would empower \nparents and taxpayers by providing information on student and school \nperformance through the issuance of school report cards; third, the \nbill would provide ``achievement awards'' to those schools that \ndemonstrate continuous student improvement.\n  In addition to these steps, Mr. President, one of the most concrete \nand important steps we can take now is to create real financial \nincentives for qualified individuals to teach in high-poverty schools. \nThe Teacher Tax Relief Act of 1999 would create these incentives by \nexempting the first $40,000 of a teacher's salary from federal income \ntax for qualified individuals teaching academic subjects in schools \nwhere at least 50 percent of the students qualify for the free or \nreduced price lunch programs. In order to qualify for the exemption, \nthe teacher must be qualified to provide instruction in each and every \nacademic course they teach. No individual who is teaching under an \n``emergency'' designation is eligible for the exemption and no teacher \nwhose gross family income exceeds $120,000 is eligible for the \nexemption. Mr. President, this legislation would increase take-home pay \nfor a teacher earning $40,000 by over $5,000 and would steer high \nquality teachers to underperforming school districts in addition to \nproviding middle class tax relief. I ask for unanimous consent that the \ntext of both bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1422\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthe same tax treatment for special pay as for combat pay; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n               tax exempt military pay orders (tempo) act\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce with my colleague Kay \nBailey Hutchison the Tax Exempt Military Pay Orders (TEMPO) Act. This \nmeasure will not only correct an inequity in the way we treat our \ndeployed armed forces, but it also will help let our soldiers know that \nwe recognize and appreciate the sacrifices they and their families \nmake.\n  Our proposal would provide that income received by a member of the \nArmed Forces of the United States, while receiving special pay, should \nbe tax exempt. Currently, members of the U.S. Armed Forces who serve in \na Presidentially designated ``combat zone'' receive special tax \nexemptions. I think we all recall that this exemption was in effect \nduring Kosovo. During Kosovo, soldiers did not have to pay excise taxes \non phone calls that they make from the combat zone. Nor did they have \nto pay income taxes on the money earned while in that zone.\n  The measure we introduce today provides that these same tax \nexemptions would be triggered when the Secretary of Defense designates \nhis employees as eligible for ``special pay'' based on hostile \nconditions. Under current law, members of the Armed Forces receive \nspecial pay when: subject to hostile fire; on duty in which he, or \nothers with him, are in imminent danger of such fire; were killed, \ninjured or wounded by hostile fire or were on duty in a foreign area in \nwhich he was subject to the threat of physical harm or imminent danger \non the basis of civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism, or wartime \nconditions. In the last few years soldiers in Somalia and Haiti have \nreceived special pay.\n  Let me explain why I believe we need to change the tax treatment of \nspecial pay. The original tax exemption for combat pay was put in place \nduring the Korean war. From that time until the fall of the Berlin \nWall, the employment of U.S. forces almost always was in combat zones. \nBut since the end of the cold war, as we all know, our Armed Forces \nhave been deployed more often, and in a wider variety of circumstances. \nToday, a soldier with the 82nd Airborne from North Carolina may be sent \non a mission that is as dangerous as any combat mission, but because it \nis not precisely in a combat zone, he cannot receive any tax benefits.\n  Given the current uses of our Armed Forces, I believe the measure we \npropose today makes a great deal of sense. I also believe that making \nthis change in the tax code would correct an inequity. Now, I think it \nis only right that soldiers in the Kosovo engagement are receiving tax \nexemptions. But during a recent visit to Fort Bragg, many soldiers and \ntheir families commented that the same benefits should have been \nextended to the soldiers who served in Somalia and Haiti. I have to say \nthat I agreed with them.\n  And so, this bill addresses the new realities of the post-code-war \nworld. As the Senate knows all too well, the end of the cold war \nbrought with it a significant drawdown in the size of our armed forces. \nAdditionally, we shifted from an overseas-based force to one based \nprimarily in the United States. Almost concurrently, our national \nsecurity strategy has lead us into an era of seemingly continuous \ndeployments. In the 40 years between 1950 and 1990, elements of the \nU.S. Army were deployed 10 times. In the less than 10 years since the \nfall of the Berlin Wall, elements of the Army have been deployed 34 \ntimes. The Navy's responses have doubled in the 90's. The Air Force has \nseen its deployed forces rise 400% while its active duty personnel \ndropped 33%. Some of these deployments are a few months in duration; \nsome are part\n\n[[Page S9084]]\n\nof a continuous presence--such as our forces in the Sinai. All work \nhardship on both the members deployed and their families, particularly \nwhen there are repeated or back-to-back deployments.\n  These demands contribute to both recruitment and retention problems. \nIn recognition of these demands and of the likelihood that we will \ncontinue to see more of these deployments, this bill recognizes that we \nneed to bring our tax code up to date so that it acknowledges these new \nrealities.\n  Mr. President, let me tell you more about what this proposal would \ndo. As I previously said, members of the military who receive combat \npay get certain tax exemptions. For example:\n  The income of the soldier while in the combat zone is tax exempt. So \nis the income of a soldier while hospitalized for injuries received in \nthe combat zone and that portion of a pension or retirement acquired \nwhile in a combat zone. In addition, pay received while a prisoner of \nwar as a result of service in the combat zone is tax exempt.\n  Special tax rates apply for the surviving spouse of a soldier who is \nmissing in action (or presumed dead) in a combat zone.\n  All taxes are eliminated for the years the soldier served in the \ncombat zone if he is killed in the combat zone.\n  There are other exemptions, and I ask unanimous consent that this \ncopy of the relevant exemptions be printed in the Record.\n  My bill would give those exact same exemptions to soldiers who \nreceive special pay.\n  Mr. President, as we close out this century and address the realities \nof the new century, I ask the Senate approve this measure as a means of \nacknowledging the sacrifices being demanded of our service members and \ntheir families.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SECTION 1: SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tax Exempt Military Pay \n     Orders (TEMPO) Act''.\n\n                                S. 1424\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Edwards \nof North Carolina to offer legislation very important to those members \nof our Armed Forces who are deployed in defense of our nation's \ninterests around the world. Our bill will provide for federal tax \nexemption to those serving in hostile areas not officially designated \nas combat zones. The current restrictions on this exemption to formally \ndesignated combat zones--which do not include many of our peacekeepers \nwho face daily threats to their lives--are a half-century old relic of \nthe Korean War that do not address the realities of the military \nmissions in our post-cold-war world.\n  Today there are two combat zones as designated by the President in \nExecutive Orders. One is in the Middle East, including the Persian \nGulf, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Oman, the Gulf of Aden, as well as Iraq, \nKuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab \nEmirates. This area has been a combat zone since January 1991. The \nother combat zone is the Kosovo Area of Operations including the \nFederal Republic of Yugoslvia (Serbia/Montenegro), Albania, the \nAdriatic Sea, and the Ionian Sea. This combat zone has been in effect \nsince March 1999. Members serving in those areas get a tax exemption.\n  Yet, today there are 17 areas considered so dangerous that our troops \nthere get a special allowance known as Imminent Danger Pay that do not \nreceive the same tax relief that those in a designated combat zone get. \nIn fact, combat zone tax provisions did not apply to our troops in \nSomalia, where we lost 18 Rangers in one bloody gunfight.\n  Our bill argues, in effect, that if a location is dangerous enough to \nearn the allowance reserved for imminent danger, then it's dangerous \nenough to get favorable tax treatment, too. This would include troops \nthat are in some of the most dangerous parts of the world, including \nAlgeria, Burundi, Pakistan, Sudan, and Yemen.\n  When our troops are deployed in harm's way anywhere, there should not \nbe a discrepancy in tax benefits from one location to another. This is \nan administrative distinction that matters little to the brave young \nAmericans who are out there defending us. These determinations are made \nafter careful study by the Secretary of Defense, based on the inherent \ndangers in a foreign area.\n  The Senate expressed its support for addressing this inequity in a \nresolution we passed as part of the FY2000 Defense Authorization Bill. \nNot only is this the right and fair thing to do, but during these times \nof increased deployments and personnel shortages, it is in our national \ninterest to continue to show our dedicated service members that we \nappreciate their sacrifice and commitment.\n  I commend the Senator from North Carolina for his leadership on this \nissue and urge other Senators to join us in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 1425. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \n10 percent biotechnology investment tax credit and to reauthorize the \nResearch and Development tax credit for ten years; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                  BIOTECHNOLOGY TAX CREDIT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are faced today with the unique \nchallenges brought by the extraordinary biological, technological, and \nmedical advances of this decade. We have seen miraculous breakthroughs \nin the fight\n\n[[Page S9085]]\n\nagainst communicable diseases: the complete eradication of small pox, \nthe near global eradication of polio, vaccines for ailments such as \nmeasles, rubella, and even the flu. Revolutionary new drugs and \nimproved surgical techniques allow us all to lead longer, more \nproductive lives. But past success is not a guarantee of future \nprogress and science does not bear fruit overnight. Breaking the code \nfor complex problems takes a steady and sustained commitment of people \nand money. As we enter the next century, we have a responsibility to \nperpetuate and improve upon our enormous capacity to prevent, detect, \ntreat, and cure diseases of all types.\n  The Congress continues to be gravely concerned with rising health \ncare costs, as demonstrated by contentious debate as recently as last \nweek during consideration of the Patients' Bill of Rights. According to \nthe Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), health care spending \nin this country had risen to $1.1 trillion in 1997, or an average of \njust under $4,000 per person. Private sources paid for a little over \nhalf of that, about $585 billion, with the remainder coming from public \nprograms like Medicare and Medicaid. HCFA further predicts that public \nspending on health will nearly double over the next decade, reaching \n$2.1 trillion in 2007.\n  I disagree with the premise that this is simply a dollars and cents \nproblem. I believe science holds our best chance for both combating \ndisease and controlling the ever-spiraling costs it imposes on society. \nFor victims of cancer and heart disease, scientific research represents \ntheir only hope for new drugs and medical treatments that can add years \nto life. Research can produce miracle vaccines that save the lives of \nchildren stricken with deadly diseases like leukemia. And for growing \nnumbers of elderly, research holds the key to stopping the ruinous \neffects of Alzheimer's disease, stroke and arthritis--all very \nexpensive ailments to treat. To me, the equation is a simple one: less \ndisease and illness mean less human suffering and lower health care \ncosts.\n  Over the next three decades, the number of Americans over age 65 will \ndouble. My state of Pennsylvania houses the second highest elderly \npopulation, currently totaling nearly 2 million citizens. Mr. \nPresident, unless science finds cures and effective treatments for \ndisease and illness, our society will face even higher costs and our \nhospitals and nursing facilities will be strained to the breaking \npoint.\n  As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education, I have said many times that I firmly \nbelieve that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the crown jewel \nof the Federal government, and substantial investment is crucial to \nallow the continuation of the breakthrough research into the next \ndecade. In 1981, NIH funding was less than $3.6 billion. For the past \nthree years, NIH funding has increased by 6.8 percent in fiscal year \n1997, 7.1 percent in fiscal year 1998, and 15 percent in fiscal year \n1999, for a total of $15.7 billion. I am continuing to fight to double \nthe NIH budget, a sentiment which was unanimously supported in the \nUnited States Senate during the 105th Congress. Further, on January \n19th of this year, I joined my colleagues, Senators Mack, Frist and \nHarkin in introducing S. Res. 19, a Sense of the Senate resolution to \nincrease biomedical research funding by $2 billion for fiscal year \n2000.\n  Mr. President, I cite continued efforts to increase the Federal \ninvestment in biomedical research in order to highlight the public \npolicy importance of scientific investment. I believe that the Federal \ngovernment also has the responsibility to provide an economic \nenvironment that promotes Research and Development in biomedical \nresearch in the private sector as well. To make good business \ndecisions, particularly relating to investment in R, biomedical and \n``biotech'' firms need to have reliable and well defined tax laws. \nToday I am introducing legislation that would establish a 10 percent \ntax credit for investment in biomedical research, and would extend the \nR & D tax credit to 10 years.\n  The purpose of the investment tax credit is to encourage biomedical \nresearch and to stimulate the economy, as well as to enhance our long-\nterm competitiveness in the global biomedical arena. The investment tax \ncredit would provide a 10 percent tax credit for purchases of capital \nequipment, instruments and supplies used in a laboratory setting by a \nbiotechnology company. Without this tax credit, American companies will \nbe competing with one hand tied behind their backs.\n  The R & D tax credit has proven to be critical to the U.S. biomedical \nresearch industry. The credit has allowed for many successes in U.S. \nscientific research and innovation, such as rapid progress in finding \ncures for life threatening diseases such as AIDS, cancer, and multiple \nsclerosis. My Subcommittee has held hearings on the state of affairs in \nbiomedical research, and I understand from many scientists that we are \non the cusp of breakthroughs many of today's most complex diseases--\nAlzheimer's, AIDS, heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis, to name a \nfew. But, the scientists caution, it will only be through sustained \ninvestment, both public and private, that we will reap the rewards of \nbiomedical research. If we cut investment in medical progress today, \nthe consequence may be irrevocable and society may rue that decision \nfor years to come.\n  As we prepare for the 21st century, we must remain committed to \nproviding an environment that fosters technological investment, \nscientific exploration, and global competitiveness. Future economic \ngrowth and the prosperity of all Americans depends on continued R in \nall sectors of our nation.\n  Mr. President, we must act now to extend the R credit and send the \nright signal to our nation's researchers. Failure to act will not only \njeopardize our research efforts, but it will also threaten the United \nStates's world leadership in R and perpetuate the rising health care \ncosts we so desperately have tried to contain. It should be noted that \neverything that is good and desirable is not necessarily worthy of a \ntax credit, but targeted tax credits are particularly appropriate where \nan activity engaged in by one company or individual provides such \nconsiderable benefits to society at large.\n  We must constantly remind ourselves that medical innovation is the \nmost viable, long-term solution for cost-effective quality care. Our \ntask in Congress should be to assure that the path of innovation \nremains open, unobstructed and attractive to both public and private \ninvestors.\n  For me, creating a better atmosphere for investment in medical \nresearch is more than a symbolic goal. It is a recognition that \nexpanding our base of scientific knowledge inevitably leads to better \nhealth, lower health care costs, and an improved quality of life for \nall Americans. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation, and urge its swift adoption.\n  In my capacity as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee for \nLabor, Health, Human Services and Education, our subcommittee has the \nresponsibility for funding the National Institutes of Health. The \nSenate passed a resolution targeting a doubling of National Institutes \nof Health funding over a 5-year period. That requires an enormous \nincrease.\n  Last year, with the cooperation of my distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Harkin, we increased NIH funding by $2 billion. The year before \nthe Senate voted an increase of some $950 million, which was \nconferenced out at $907 million.\n  This year the subcommittee faces a 302(b) allocation--if anyone is \nlistening on C-Span II, that's how much money the subcommittee is \nallotted under the budget--that is some $12 billion under the \nPresident's request, about $12 billion under any logical sum of money \nto fund those three departments: The Department of Labor, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and the Department of \nEducation. We are struggling to try to find the funds to match last \nyear's $2 billion increase. If we were to reach the goal set by the \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution we would have to come up with $2.3 \nbillion.\n  In talking to the people in the biotech industry, they are very much \ninterested in having an investment tax credit. An investment tax credit \nof 10 percent would provide a real tax incentive to induce biotech \ncompanies to do\n\n[[Page S9086]]\n\nresearch. We are on the brink of some phenomenal advances as a result \nof what happened with stem cell research late last year. Stem cell \nresearch has the potential to be a veritable fountain of youth, to \ntackle ailments like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, or perhaps heart \ndisease or cancer.\n  There is a controversy on that question, as to whether embryos may \nappropriately be used for research. So far the Department of Health and \nHuman Services and their legal counsel concluded that the current \nlimitation on research would not apply to research on stem cells after \nthey are extracted from embryos. Realistically, there ought to be no \nlimitation at all, because in dealing with embryos we are not dealing \nwith an entity which could produce life. These are discarded embryos \nfrom in vitro fertilization.\n  This controversy is very similar to the controversy which existed \nwith respect to fetal tissue, where arguments were made that using \nfetal tissue would lead to induced abortions where the fact of the \nmatter was the fetal tissue was discarded fetal tissue, did not induce \nabortions.\n  But the opportunities for phenomenal advances in medical research are \nvirtually unlimited. In the absence of the ability of the Congress, \ngiven budget limitations, to meet the doubling goal within 5 years, an \ninvestment tax credit would be an enormous help in stimulating \ninvestments by the biotech companies.\n  The research and development tax credit has been extended year by \nyear, and a firm statement by Congress extending it for 10 years again \nwould be an inducement for biotech.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 1425\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to promote the \nconservation of soil and related resources, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                 the conservation security act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to talk about \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers and the promise they hold for us and the \nfuture for our environment, for production of bountiful, safe, and \nnourishing food for us and for the population around the globe.\n  Specifically on the issue of conservation, it became a national \npriority in the days of the Dust Bowl, leading to the creation in the \n1930s of the Soil Conservation Service at the Department of \nAgriculture, which is now the Natural Resources Conservation Service. \nWith the very foundation of our food supply at risk, the Government \nstepped forward with billions of dollars in assistance to help farmers \npreserve their precious soils.\n  Since that time, Federal spending on conservation has steadily \ndeclined. Yet today agriculture faces a wide range of environmental \nchallenges, from overgrazing and manure management to fertilizer runoff \nand water pollution. Urban and rural citizens alike are increasingly \nconcerned about the environmental impact of agriculture.\n  Farmers and ranchers pride themselves on being good stewards of the \nland, and there are farm-based solutions to these problems being \nimplemented all over the country. But every dollar spent on \nconstructing a filter strip or developing a nutrient management plan is \na dollar that farmers don't have in hard times like these. And even in \nbetter times, there is a lot of competition for that dollar.\n  So who benefits from conservation on farm lands? As much or more than \nthe\n\n[[Page S9087]]\n\nfarmer, it is the rest of us, who depend on the careful stewardship of \nthe water that travels across fields and pastures before reaching \nrivers, streams, and our groundwater. Farmers and ranchers tend not \nonly to their crops and animals, but also to our public resources.\n  Since we all share in these benefits, it is only right that we share \nin their costs. It is time to enter into a true conservation \npartnership with our farmers and ranchers to help ensure that \nconservation is not a luxury that comes and goes but an essential and \npermanent part of sustainable agricultural production nationwide.\n  In the 1985 farm bill, we required that farmers who wanted to \nparticipate in USDA farm programs develop soil conservation plans for \ntheir highly erodible land. This provision helped put new conservation \nplans in place for our most fragile farmlands. In the most recent farm \nbill, we streamlined conservation programs and established new cost-\nshare and incentive payments for certain practices.\n  Today I am introducing the Conservation Security Act of 1999, \nproposed legislation that builds on our past successes and takes a bold \nstep forward in farm and conservation policy.\n  My bill would establish a universal and voluntary incentive payment \nprogram to support and encourage conservation activities by all farmers \nand ranchers. Under this program, farmers and ranchers could receive up \nto $50,000 per year in conservation payments. Under this conservation \nsecurity program, farmers would enter into 3- to 5-year contracts with \nUSDA and choose from one of three classes of conservation practices for \nwhich they would receive a payment based on the number of acres covered \nand the county rental rate for those acres.\n  This program is directed toward conservation on working lands. It is \nnot a set-aside. It is not an easement program. It is not a \nconservation reserve program. It is a conservation program so that we \nfarm in the best way possible to conserve our resources and to prevent \npollution.\n\n  For implementing a basic set of practices, farmers would receive an \nannual payment of 10 percent of the rental rate of the land covered. I \ncall this basic category class I, and it would include such practices \nas nutrient management, conservation tillage, and runoff and drainage \ncontrol.\n  There would be a class II under which farmers could receive up to 20 \npercent of the rental rate, where farmers would add to their class I \npractices by choosing from a menu of class II practices that would be \nestablished by the USDA--such things as nutrient management, \ncomposting, intensive grazing, partial field practices such as buffer \nstrips and windbreaks, wetland restoration, and wildlife habitat \nenhancement.\n  Then the third class, farmers who wanted to do class III conservation \npractices would enroll their whole farm under a total resource \nmanagement plan that addresses all aspects of air, land, water, and \nwildlife. For that, the farmers would receive a 40-percent payment, 40 \npercent of the rental rate of land in that county.\n  This bill also provides an incentive for livestock producers. In \npayment for preparing and adopting comprehensive manure management \nplans, producers raising under 1,000 animal units at any given time--\nthat would be 2,500 hogs, 1,000 beef cattle, 700 dairy cattle, 55,000 \nturkeys, or 100,000 chickens--they would be given a per animal \nincentive payment equal to 10 percent of the 5-year average market \nprice.\n  This program would not replace or otherwise affect any other \nconservation program, not at all, this is to add on, except that a \nfarmer could not receive incentive payments under this program in \naddition to incentive payments under another program in addition to \nincentive payments for land already enrolled in a program such as the \nConservation Reserve Program. In other words, you couldn't have your \nland in the Conservation Reserve Program and then enter this program \nwith that same land.\n  Again, I emphasize, the Conservation Security Program would be \ntotally voluntary. It would be up to the farmer to decide if they want \nto do it. If they do, then they would get additional payments. A lot of \nthese practices farmers are already doing now, for which they receive \nlittle or no support.\n  Again, these practices don't just benefit the farmer; in fact, a lot \nof times it may burden the farmer. That farmer may have to do extra \nwork, require a little extra time. Maybe some equipment for these kinds \nof conservation practices. The beneficiaries of this are all of us. We \nall will benefit from cleaner air, cleaner streams and rivers, \nprotecting our groundwater, wildlife habitats for those of us who like \nto hunt and fish.\n  Our private lands are a national resource, and conservation on farm \nand ranchlands provides environmental benefits that are just as \nimportant as the production of abundant and safe food. I am introducing \nthe Conservation Security Act because I believe it will help secure \nboth the economic future of our farmers, help them a little bit with \nthe safety net, and it will be a cornerstone, I think, of our national \nfarm policy and the environmental future of agriculture.\n  I am introducing this bill for myself, Senator Daschle, Senator \nLeahy, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator Conrad, and Senator Johnson.\n  I ask other Senators who are interested to contact my staff. We are \nnow actively seeking cosponsors for this new voluntary conservation \nprogram.\n  I thank the Chair.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Biden, \n        Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Bond, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Helms, Mr. \n        Reid, and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 1428. A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act and the \nControlled Substances Import and Export Act relating to the \nmanufacture, traffick, import and export of amphetamine and \nmethamphetamine, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n             methamphetamine anti-proliferation act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to day to introduce the \nMethamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999, a very important piece \nof legislation in America's on-going war on drugs. Three years ago I \nintroduced the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Act of 1999, which this \nbody passed, to address the frightening and very real problem of \nmethamphetamine abuse in this country. That legislation has provided \nlaw enforcement with necessary tools to combat methamphetamine and has \nhelped us track and slow the proliferation of methamphetamine \nmanufacturing and abuse. However, there remain too many people in this \ncountry who are determined to undermine our drug laws and turn America \ninto one colossal metamphetamine laboratory. For this reason, I, along \nwith Senators Feinstein, DeWine, Bond, Thurmond, Biden, Bryan, and \nReid, are introducing this bipartisan bill that seeks to shield America \nagainst the proliferation of methamphetamine Manufacturing.\n  The methamphetamine threat differs in kind from the threat of other \nillegal drugs because methamphetamine can be made from readily \navailable and legal chemicals and substances, and because it poses \nserious dangers to both human life and to the environment. America's \nhistory of fighting illegal drugs has been long and tiring but with so \nmany young Americans still being exposed to so many destructive drugs, \nnow is not the time to give up--it is a time to fight smarter and \nharder. The provisions of this bill will provide law enforcement with \nseveral effective tools that will help us turn the tide of \nproliferation of methamphetamine manufacturing in America.\n  Traditionally, the overwhelming majority of illegal drugs consumed in \nAmerica has been manufactured outside of our borders and then illegally \nsmuggled into America. The rapid spread and growing use of \nmethamphetamine threatens to change the future of where drugs are \nmanufactured. Drug pushers are threatening to turn America into a \nproducing country of a drug that affects the lives of every American \nbecause it not only destroys the lives of those who use the drug, but \nalso can have devastating effects on people situated around lab sites, \non law enforcement officials that have to clean the labs, and on the \nenvironment.\n  According to a report prepared by the Community Epidemiology Work \nGroup, which is part of the National Institute\n\n[[Page S9088]]\n\non Drug Abuse, methamphetamine ``abuse levels remain high . . . and \nthere is strong evidence to suggest this drug will continue to be a \nproblem in West Coast areas and to spread to other areas of the United \nStates.'' the reasons given for the ominous prediction are that \nmethamphetamine can be produced easily in small, clandestine labs and \nthe chemicals used to make methamphetamine are readily available.\n\n  This threat is real and immediate, and the numbers are telling. \nAccording to the Drug Enforcement Administration, the DEA, the number \nof labs cleaned up by the Administration has almost doubled each year \nsince 1995. Last year 5,786 amphetamine and methamphetamine labs were \nseized by DEA and State and local law enforcement officials, and \nmillions of dollars were spent on cleaning up the pollutants and toxins \ncreated and left behind by operators of these labs. In Utah alone, \nthere were 266 lab seizures last year, a number which elevated Utah to \nthe unenviable position of being ranked third among all states for \nhigher per capita clan lab seizures. The problem with the high number \nof manufacturing labs is compounded by the fact that the chemicals and \nsubstances utilized in the manufacturing process are unstable, \nvolatile, and highly combustible. The smallest amounts of these \nchemicals, when mixed improperly, can cause explosions and fires. And \nof course, those operating these labs are not scientists, but rather \nunskilled, ignorant, criminals and fly-by-nights who are completely \napathetic to the destructive powers that are inherent in the \nmanufacturing process. This fact is even more frightening when you \nconsider that most of these labs are situated in residences, motels, \ntrailers, and vans.\n  Let me take a moment to highlight some of the provisions of this bill \nthat will assist Federal, State, and local law enforcement in \npreventing the proliferation of methamphetamine manufacturing in \nAmerica.\n  First, the bill will bolster the DEA's ability to combat the \nmanufacturing and trafficking of methamphetamine and other drugs by \nauthorizing the hiring of new agents to carry out a variety of anti-\ndrug initiatives. Agents will be hired to assist State and local law \nenforcement officials in small and mid-sized communities in all phases \nof methamphetamine manufacturing investigations. Due to the large \nnumber of manufacturers and traffickers that are setting up shop in \nsmall and rural cities, law enforcement agencies located in these areas \nare in dire need of the DEA's expert guidance and knowledge of \nmethamphetamine investigations, including assistance in interrogating \nsuspects, conducting surveillance operations, and collecting evidence \nto build a case. This bill also authorizes the expansion of the number \nof DEA resident offices and posts-of-duty, which are smaller DEA \noffices often set up in small and rural cities that are overwhelmed by \nmethamphetamine manufacturing and trafficking.\n  Another way this legislation will help the DEA assist State and local \nofficials is to provide for the training of State and local law \nenforcement personnel in techniques used in methamphetamine \ninvestigations and to provide them with certification training in \nhandling the dangerously-volatile and toxic wastes produced by \nmethamphetamine labs. It also provides for the creation of another DEA \nprogram that will enable certain State and local law enforcement \nofficials to recertify other law enforcement in their regions. These \nprograms are authorized for a three year period and designed to pass on \nthe DEA's knowledge and expertise to State and local officials so that \nthey can become more independent of the DEA and thereafter rely rather \non each other in combating the scourge of methamphetamine \nmanufacturing.\n\n  This bill contains many references to the drug amphetamine, a lesser \nknown, but equally dangerous drug. Because the process of manufacturing \namphetamine is as dangerous as manufacturing methamphetamine, this bill \nseeks to equalize the punishment for manufacturing the two drugs. Other \nthan being slightly less potent, amphetamine is manufactured, sold, and \nused in the same manner as methamphetamine. In fact, many times a \nperson can set out to manufacture a batch of methamphetamine and end up \nwith amphetamine if just one precursor chemical is used in place of \nanother. When this happens, drug dealers sell amphetamine as \nmethamphetamine and users buy and use it thinking it is \nmethamphetamine. The dangers posed to the environment are also the \nsame. Amphetamine labs have the same destructing and polluting ability \nas methamphetamine labs. Every law enforcement officer with whom I have \nspoken, including federal and State prosecutors and federal and State \nlaw enforcement officials, agreed that the penalties for amphetamine \nshould be the same as those for methamphetamine.\n  Another important section of this bill will assist in preventing the \nmanufacture of methamphetamine and other illegal drugs by banning the \ndissemination of drug ``recipes'' and other demonstrative information \nrelating to the manufacturing and use of controlled substances. The \ndissemination of this type of information is prohibited if the intent \nof the person disseminating the information is for it to be used for, \nor in furtherance of, a federal crime or if the person disseminating \nthe information has knowledge that the person receiving the information \nintends to use the information for, or in furtherance, of a federal \ncrime. Currently, there are hundreds of sites on the Internet that \ninstruct how to manufacture methamphetamine and other illegal drugs, \nincluding what ingredients are required, what instruments or equipment \nis needed, and how to combine precisely the ingredients. These step-by-\nstep instructions will be illegal under this bill if the person posting \nthe information or the person receiving the information intends to \nengage in activity that violates our drug laws.\n  I was shocked to discover that those who embrace the drug counter-\nculture these days are using the Internet to promote, advertise, and \nsell illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia. In 1992, Congress passed a \nlaw that made it illegal for anyone to sell or offer for sale drug \nparaphernalia. This law resulted in the closings of numerous ``head \nshops,'' yet, now the out-of-business store owners are selling their \nillegal drug paraphernalia on the Internet. This bill will amend the \nanti-drug paraphernalia statute to clarify that advertisements for sale \ninclude the use of any communication facility, including the Internet, \nto post or publicize in any way any matter, including a telephone \nnumber or electronic or mail address, knowing that such matter is \ndesigned to be used to buy, distribute, or otherwise facilitate a \ntransaction in drug paraphernalia. This will not only prevent web sites \nfrom advertising drug paraphernalia for sale, but it will also prohibit \nweb sites that do not sell drug paraphernalia from allowing other sites \nthat do from advertising on its web site. Currently, anyone can log on \nto the Internet, go to one of the numerous pro-drug sites, and purchase \nillegal drug paraphernalia, such bongs, water pipes, ``Toke'' bottles \nand ``High Again'' bottles, along with descriptions of how these \ndevices can assist in getting a better ``high'' from smoking marijuana. \nThere are even web sites that advertise for sale marijuana and poppy \nseeds, along with growing and nurturing instructions. This type of \nbehavior is not only reprehensible, but it is also illegal, and this \nclarifying provision can help stop this behavior from continuing over \nthe Internet.\n\n  Finally, this legislation seeks to impose harsher penalties on \nmanufacturers of illegal drugs when their actions create a substantial \nrisk of harm to human life or to the environment. The inherent dangers \nof killing innocent bystanders and, at the same time, contaminating the \nenvironment during the methamphetamine manufacturing process warrant a \npunitive penalty that will deter some from engaging in the activity.\n  Mr. President, many people have grown increasingly more skeptical as \nto whether America can ever rid our nation of the dreadful plague of \nillegal drug use. I say to all those skeptics that now is not the time \nto take a defeatist attitude. Too many bright young people are \ndepending on us to do what is right. Sure, some measures taken in the \npast have not been as helpful as some may have hoped, but that just \nmeans we need to keep persevering to find the right answers. I believe \nthat this bill contains many of\n\n[[Page S9089]]\n\nthe right answers and will help in one of our nation's most difficult \nstruggles. We can defeat the drug dealers and traffickers. We must \nfight back for the sake of our children and grandchildren. I hope that \nSenators will join me in this fight and support this very important \npiece of legislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of this legislation and a summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1428\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999\n\n     SEC. 2. MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF AMPHETAMINE AND \n                   METHAMPHETAMINE.\n\n       Section 1 amends title 21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1) to make the \n     statutory punishment for the manufacture and distribution of \n     amphetamine the same as that of methamphetamine.\n\n     SEC. 3. IMPORT AND EXPORT OF AMPHETAMINE AND METHAMPHETAMINE.\n\n       Section 2 amends the Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. \n     960(b)) to make the statutory punishment for amphetamine the \n     same as that of methamphetamine.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENTENCING GUIDELINES.\n\n       Section 3 amends the Sentencing Guidelines to adjust the \n     penalty for amphetamine to meet the penalty for \n     methamphetamine. It also provides for a 6 level enhancement \n     if the manufacturing either meth or amphetamine created a \n     substantial risk of danger to the health and safety of a \n     minor or incompetent.\n\n     SEC. 5. ADVERTISEMENTS FOR DRUG PARAPHERNALIA AND SCHEDULE I \n                   CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.\n\n       Section 8 amends 21 U.S.C. 863 (drug paraphernalia statute) \n     to prohibit direct or indirect advertisements for the sale of \n     paraphernalia. It defines advertisements for sale to include \n     the use of any communication facility to post or publicize in \n     any way any matter, including a telephone number or \n     electronic or mail address, knowing that such matter has the \n     purpose of seeking or offering, or is designed to be used, to \n     receive, buy, distribute, or otherwise facilitate a \n     transaction.\n       It also amends 21 U.S.C. 843(c) to prohibit direct or \n     indirect advertising for the sale of a Schedule I Controlled \n     Substance. The current statute arguably only prohibited the \n     direct advertising of a schedule I drug in the print media.\n\n     SEC. 6. CONTINUING CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE.\n\n       Section 11 amends the Continuing Criminal Enterprise \n     statute (21 U.S.C. 848) by replacing the phrase ``continuing \n     series of violations of'' with the phrase ``continuing series \n     of 3 or more acts made punishable by.'' This change is in \n     response to the recent Supreme Court case Richardson v.  \n     United States (decided June 1, 1999) where the Court held \n     that a jury in a CCE case must unanimously agree not only \n     that the defendant committed some ``continuing series of \n     violations,'' but also about which specific ``violations'' \n     make up that ``continuing series.'' There was previously a \n     split among the circuits (the 4th Circuit and the D.C. \n     Circuit both had ruled unanimity with respect to particular \n     ``violations'' was not required).\n\n     SEC. 7. MANDATORY RESTITUTION FOR METH LAB CLEAN-UP.\n\n       Section 7 makes reimbursement for the costs incurred by the \n     U.S. or State and local governments for the cleanup \n     associated with the manufacture of amphetamine or \n     methamphetamine mandatory. It also provides that the \n     restitution money will go to the Asset Forfeiture Fund \n     instead of the treasury.\n\n     SEC. 8. ENDANGERING HUMAN LIFE OR THE ENVIRONMENT WHILE \n                   ILLEGALLY MANUFACTURING AMPHETAMINE OR \n                   METHAMPHETAMINE.\n\n       Section 8 increases the penalty under 21 U.S.C. 858 to not \n     less than 10 years for manufacturing or trafficking a \n     controlled substance that creates a substantial risk of harm \n     to human life or the environment. It creates a rebuttable \n     presumption that the manufacturing of amphetamine or \n     methamphetamine constitutes the creation of a substantial \n     risk of harm to human life and the environment.\n\n     SEC. 9. CRIMINAL PROHIBITION ON DISTRIBUTION OF CERTAIN \n                   INFORMATION RELATING TO THE MANUFACTURE OF \n                   CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.\n\n       Section 9 prohibits teaching or demonstrating the \n     manufacture or use of a Controlled Substance or distributing \n     by any means information pertaining to the manufacture or use \n     of a Controlled Substance (1) with the intent that this \n     information be used for, or in furtherance of, an activity \n     that constitutes a federal crime; or (2) knowing\n\n[[Page S9092]]\n\n     that such person intends to use this information for, or in \n     furtherance of, an activity that constitutes a federal crime. \n     The penalty for violation is not more than 10 years in \n     prison.\n\n     SEC. 10. NOTICE; CLARIFICATION.\n\n       This section amends 18 U.S.C. 3103a to allow for the delay \n     of any notice that is, or may be, required pursuant to the \n     issuance of a warrant under this section or any other law.\n\n     SEC. 11. TRAINING FOR DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION AND \n                   STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL \n                   RELATING TO CLANDESTINE LABORATORIES.\n\n       Section 11 authorizes $5.5 million in funding for DEA \n     training programs designed to (1) train State and local law \n     enforcement in techniques used in meth investigations; (2) \n     provide a certification program for State and local law \n     enforcement enabling them to meet requirements with respect \n     to the handling of wastes created by meth labs; (3) create a \n     certification program that enables certain State and local \n     law enforcement to recertify other law enforcement in their \n     regions; and (4) staff mobile training teams which provide \n     State and local law enforcement with advanced training in \n     conducting clan lab investigations and with training that \n     enables them to recertify other law enforcement personnel. \n     The training programs are authorized for 3 years after which \n     the States, either alone or in consultation/combination with \n     other States, will be responsible for training their own \n     personnel. The States will be required to submit a report \n     detailing what measures they are taking to ensure that they \n     have programs in place to take over the responsibility after \n     the three year federal program expires.\n\n     SEC. 12. COMBATING METHAMPHETAMINE IN HIGH INTENSITY DRUG \n                   TRAFFICKING AREAS.\n\n       This section authorizes $5 million a year for fiscal years \n     2000-2004 to be appropriated to ONDCP to combat trafficking \n     of methamphetamine in designated HIDTA's by hiring new \n     federal, State, and local law enforcement personnel, \n     including agents, investigators, prosecutors, lab technicians \n     and chemists. It provides that the funds shall be apportioned \n     among the HIDTA's based on the following factors: (1) number \n     of Meth labs discovered in the previous year; (2) number of \n     Meth prosecutions in the previous year; (3) number of Meth \n     arrests in the previous year; (4) the amounts of Meth seized \n     in the previous year; and (5) intelligence data from the DEA \n     showing trafficking and transportation patterns in \n     methamphetamine, amphetamine and listed chemicals. Before \n     apportioning any funds, the Director must certify that the \n     law enforcement entities responsible for clan lab seizures \n     are providing lab seizure data to the national clandestine \n     laboratory database at the El Paso Intelligence Center. It \n     also provides that not more than five percent of the \n     appropriated amount may be used for administrative costs.\n\n     SEC. 13. COMBATING AMPHETAMINE AND METHAMPHETAMINE \n                   MANUFACTURING AND TRAFFICKING.\n\n       This section authorizes $6.5 million to be appropriated for \n     the hiring of new agents to (1) assist State and local law \n     enforcement in small and mid-sized communities in all phases \n     of drug investigations; (2) staff additional regional \n     enforcement and mobile enforcement teams; (3) establish \n     additional resident offices and posts of duty to assist State \n     and local law enforcement in rural areas; and (4) provide the \n     Special Operations Division with additional agents for \n     intelligence and investigative operations.\n\n     SEC. 14. ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH ILLEGAL \n                   MANUFACTURE OF AMPHETAMINE AND METHAMPHETAMINE.\n\n       Authorizes the DEA to receive money from the Asset \n     Forfeiture Fund to pay for cleanup costs associated with the \n     illegal manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine. It \n     also allows for reimbursements to State and local entities \n     for cleanup costs when they assist in a federal prosecution \n     on amphetamine or methamphetamine related charges.\n\n     SEC. 15. ANTIDRUG MESSAGES ON FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INTERNET \n                   WEBSITES.\n\n       Requires all federal departments and agencies, in \n     consultation with ONDCP, to place antidrug messages on their \n     Internet websites and an electronic hyperlink to ONDCP's \n     website. Numerous government agencies have children's \n     websites, including the Social Security Administration.\n\n     SEC. 16. MAIL ORDER REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       This section represents changes to the reporting \n     requirements of 21 U.S.C. 830(b)(3) worked out between the \n     DEA and industry. Reporting will no longer be required for \n     valid prescriptions, limited distributions of sample \n     packages, distributions by retail distributors if consistent \n     with authorized activities, distributions to long term care \n     facilities, and any product which has been exempted by the \n     AG. It also allows the AG to revoke an exemption if he finds \n     the drug product being distributed is being used in violation \n     of the Controlled Substances Act.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, 3 years ago this week I joined with my \ndistinguished friend and colleague, Senator Hatch, to introduce the \n``Hatch-Biden Methamphetamine Control Act'' to address the growing \nthreat of methamphetamine use in our country before it was too late.\n  Our failure to foresee and prevent the crack cocaine epidemic is one \nof the most significant public policy mistakes in recent history. \nDespite the warning signs of an outbreak, few took action until it was \ntoo late. But we did learn an important lesson from that mistake. When \nwe began to see similar warning signs with methamphetamine, we acted \nswiftly to make sure that history would not repeat itself.\n  That Act provided crucial tools that we needed to stay ahead of the \nmethamphetamine epidemic and avoid the mistakes made during the early \nstages of the crack epidemic. We increased penalties for possessing and \ntrafficking in methamphetamine and the precursor chemicals and \nequipment used to manufacture the drug. We tightened the reporting \nrequirements and restrictions on the legitimate sales of products \ncontaining precursor chemicals to prevent their diversion, and imposed \neven greater requirements on firms that sell those products by mail. We \nensured that meth manufacturers who endanger the life of any individual \nor endanger the environment while making this drug receive enhanced \nprison sentences. And finally, we created a national working group of \nlaw enforcement and public health officials to monitor any growth in \nthe methamphetamine epidemic.\n  I have no doubt that our 1996 legislation slowed this epidemic \nsignificantly. But we are up against a powerful and highly addictive \ndrug. Meth stimulates the central nervous system, making the user feel \nenergetic, clever and powerful. Unlike crack, whose effects sometimes \nlast only a matter of minutes, a meth high lasts for hours.\n  Last year in my home State of Delaware law enforcement officers \nbusted what was described as ``the largest and most sophisticated drug \nlab in the Northeast,'' seizing 50 pounds of meth and meth base. This \nwas only one of the 5,786 reported clandestine laboratory seizures in \nthe United States last year.\n  We have countless heart wrenching stories of violence and families \nbeing tragically ripped apart by methamphetamine use, sadly reminiscent \nof what we saw with crack cocaine. A recent news story reported that a \nwoman in California has been charged with the murder of her infant son. \nHigh on meth, she left him in a sealed car in the summer heat while she \nand her boyfriend slept in an air-conditioned motel room nearby. The \ninnocent infant died a tragic and senseless death.\n  Unfortunately, this unspeakable tragedy is not an isolated incident. \nIt is not unusual for a meth user to remain awake for days. And as the \nhigh begins to wane, the user is likely to be violent, delusional and \nparanoid. Not surprisingly, this behavior often leads to crime. In \nareas like San Diego where the meth epidemic rages, more than 33 \npercent of people arrested in 1998 tested positive for the drug.\n  On top of the violence associated with methamphetamine users, there \nis also the enormous problem of violence among methamphetamine \ntraffickers and the environmental and life-threatening conditions \nendemic in the clandestine labs where the drug is produced.\n  But perhaps the most frightening fact of all is that despite all of \nthe evidence that methamphetamine is a horribly destructive substance, \nthe percentage of kids who perceive it as a harmful drug is on the \ndecline.\n  And that I why I am joining my friend from Utah once again --along \nwith Senators DeWine, Feinstein and Bond--to build on the 1996 \nmethamphetamine legislation and continue to fight this pernicious drug.\n  Our Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act, first and foremost, \naddresses the growing problem of amphetamines as a meth substitute by \nmaking the penalties for manufacturing, importing, exporting or \ntrafficking amphetamine equivalent to those established for \nmethamphetamine in our 1996 law. The two drugs are nearly identical --\nthey differ by only one chemical. Whereas methamphetamine is made with \nephedrine, a substance found in some over-the-counter cold remedies, \namphetamine is produced with phenylpropanolamine, a chemical found in \nover-the-counter diet pills. The two drugs are produced in the same \ndangerous clandestine labs and are often sold interchangeably on the \nstreets; the penalties for dealing in both substances should be the \nsame.\n  This legislation also provides the Drug Enforcement Administration \nwith much needed funding to clean up clandestine labs after they are \nseized\n\n[[Page S9093]]\n\nas well as to train state and local law enforcement officers to handle \nthe hazardous wastes produced in the meth labs. Methamphetamine is made \nfrom an array of hazardous substances--battery acid, lye, ammonia gas, \nhydrochloric acid, just to name a few--that produce toxic fumes and \noften lead to fires or explosions when mixed. I am revealing nothing by \nnaming some of these chemical ingredients. Anyone with access to the \nInternet can download a detailed meth recipe with a few simple \nkeystrokes. Our legislation would make such postings illegal.\n  This bill also tightens the restrictions on direct and indirect \nadvertising of illegal drug paraphernalia and Schedule I drugs. Under \nthis legislation, it would be illegal for on-line magazines and other \nwebsites to post advertisements for such illegal material or provide \n``links'' to websites that do. We crafted this language carefully so \nthat we restrict the sale of drug paraphernalia without restricting the \nFirst Amendment.\n  Finally, the bill provides more money for law enforcement. This \nincludes hiring more Drug Enforcement Administration agents to assist \nstate and local law enforcement in small and mid-size cities and rural \nareas and providing more money to combat meth in places designated as \nHigh Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas.\n  While I clearly support the goals of this legislation, I want to make \nit clear that I think we may need to tweak it as it goes through the \nprocess to ensure that we do not stymie a good idea with the fine \nprint. Specifically, I have concerns about how we fund meth lab clean \nup. As written, some of the money would come from the asset forfeiture \nfund, a most important resource for law enforcement. We are now \nstruggling with reforming the overall structure of asset forfeiture in \nthis country and I would hope we could find an alternative pot of money \nto tap to do the important work of cleaning up meth lab sites.\n  That being said, I am confident that any concerns I may have at this \ntime will be resolved during the committee process.\n  I want to commend Senator Hatch for his continued leadership on this \nissue. I urge all my colleagues to join us in protecting our children \nand our society from the devastations of methamphetamine by supporting \nthis vital legislation.\n\n

Mr. President, I rise today along with my \ncolleagues, Senators Ashcroft, Enzi, Brownback, and Burns, to offer an \namendment expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the next round \nof agricultural trade negotiations. As a member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, I am very concerned about U.S. agriculture's \nposition in the next round of negotiations. This resolution establishes \nclear direction to the Administration as it enters the Seattle \nnegotiations this November.\n  These process and procedural guidelines have been developed through a \nconsensus process of the Seattle Round Agricultural Committee (SRAC). \nSRAC represents over 70 agricultural organizations--from the Farm \nBureau to the National Oilseed Processors Association to Kraft Foods. \nThis diverse group of agriculturalists have spent many hours developing \nthese principles too ensure that our international agriculture markets \nremain strong, open and fair for our nation's farmers.\n  The U.S. agricultural sector is one of the only segments of our \neconomy that consistently produces a trade surplus. In fact, our \nagricultural surplus totaled $27.2 billion in 1996. However, we must \nnot rest on our laurels; the United States Department of Agriculture \nprojects that our agricultural trade surplus in 1999 will dwindle to \napproximately $12 billion. We must not let this trend continue.\n  Free and open international markets are vital to my home state. \nIllinois' 76,000 farms cover more than 28 million acres--nearly 80 \npercent of Illinois. Our farm product sales generate nine billion \ndollars annually and Illinois ranks third in agricultural exports. In \nfiscal year 1997 alone, Illinois agricultural exports totaled $3.7 \nbillion and created 57,000 jobs for our state. Needless to say, \nagriculture makes up a significant portion of my state's economy, and a \nhealthy export market for these products is important to my \nconstituents.\n  As you know, farm commodity prices have recently been in a severe \nslump. This situation makes open debate on agricultural trade and the \nSeattle round even more timely and necessary. While the average tariff \nassessed by the United States on agricultural products is less than \nfive percent, the average agricultural tariff assessed by other World \nTrade Organization members exceeds 40 percent. This situation is \nclearly unfair and certainly depresses U.S. agricultural commodity \nprices. Accordingly, this issue must be addressed in the next round.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on policies to tear down \ninternational trade barriers and ensure that our agricultural trade \nsurplus expands and remains strong. This resolution is the first step \ntoward ensuring that agriculture is a top priority of the \nAdministration during the next round of multilateral trade \nnegotiations.\n  With the Seattle round expected to initiate on November 30th of this \nyear, the American farmer cannot wait for action on this resolution. \nWhile I would like to pass this sense of the Senate as a free standing \nresolution, action on this resolution simply cannot wait. The Commerce, \nState, Justice Appropriations bill, which contains funding for the \nUnited States Trade Representatives Office, provides the perfect \nvehicle for this trade resolution. I hope my colleagues will give it \nthe consideration it deserves.\n  I want to recognize and commend my colleagues, Senators Ashcroft, \nEnzi, Brownback, and Burns, for joining me as original co-sponsors of \nthis resolution. This resolution should enjoy bipartisan support, and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation important \nto our nation's farmers. Mr. President, I ask that a list of supporters \nof this resolution and a letter from Dean Kleeker, president of the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n  Supporters of Seattle Round Agricultural Committee (SRAC) 1999 WTO \n                            Policy Statement\n\n       Ag Processing Inc.\n       Agricultural Retailers Association.\n       American Crop Protection Association.\n       American Farm Bureau Federation.\n       American Feed Industry Association.\n       American Soybean Association.\n       American Sugar Alliance.\n       Animal Health Institute.\n\n[[Page S9097]]\n\n       Archer Daniels Midland Company.\n       Biotechnology Industry Organization.\n       Bryant Christie Inc.\n       Bunge Corporation.\n       CF Industries, Inc.\n       Cargill, Incorporated.\n       Chocolate Manufacturers Association.\n       Coalition for a Competitive Food and Agricultural System.\n       ConAgra, Inc.\n       Continental Grain Company.\n       Corn Refiners Association.\n       Distilled Spirits Council of the ISA.\n       Farmland Industries, Inc.\n       Florida Phosphate Council.\n       Food Distributors International Association.\n       Gold Kist, Inc.\n       Grocery Manufacturers of America.\n       Independent Community Bankers of America.\n       International Dairy Foods Association.\n       Kraft Foods.\n       Louis Dreyfus Corporation.\n       Monsanto Company.\n       National Association of Animal Breeders.\n       National Association of State Departments of Agriculture.\n       National Association of Wheat Growers.\n       National Barley Growers Association.\n       National Cattleman's Beef Association.\n       National Chicken Council.\n       National Confectioner's Association of the U.S.\n       National Corn Grower's Association.\n       National Council of Farmer Cooperatives.\n       National Cotton Council of America.\n       National Food Processors Association.\n       National Grain and Feed Association.\n       National Grain and Sorghum Producers Association.\n       National Grain Trade Council.\n       National Grange.\n       National Milk Producers Federation.\n       National Oilseed Processors Association.\n       National Pork Producers Council.\n       National Renderers Association.\n       National Sunflower Association.\n       North American Export Grain Association.\n       North American Millers' Association.\n       Northwest Horticulture Council.\n       Pacific Northwest Grain and Feed.\n       Pet Food Institute.\n       Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc.\n       Ralston Purina Company.\n       Sunkist Growers.\n       Sweetener Users Association.\n       The Fertilizer Institute.\n       The IAMS Company.\n       Transportation, Elevator, & Grain Merchants Association.\n       USA Poultry and Egg Export Council.\n       USA Rice Federation.\n       U.S. Apple Association.\n       U.S. Dairy Export Council.\n       U.S. Meat Export Federation.\n       U.S. Poultry and Egg Association.\n       U.S. Rice Producers Association.\n       U.S. Wheat Associates, Inc.\n       United Egg Association.\n       United Egg Producers.\n       World Perspectives Inc.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     American Farm\n\n\n                                            Bureau Federation,\n\n                                    Park Ridge, IL, June 18, 1999.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: The American Farm Bureau Federation \n     strongly supports S. Res. 101, expressing the sense of the \n     Senate establishing agriculture as a top priority of this \n     Administration during the next round of multilateral trade \n     negotiations. We ask you to support and cosponsor this \n     resolution. Exports are agriculture's source of future growth \n     in sales and income.\n       As the host of the 1999 World Trade Organization (WTO) \n     Ministerial, the United States has a tremendous opportunity \n     to influence the agenda for the next round of WTO \n     negotiations. The U.S. also has the most to gain from the \n     next round. The United States is the largest, most dynamic \n     economy in the world. Further trade liberalization is needed \n     to open new market opportunities for the ever-increasing \n     output of U.S. agriculture. America's farmers and ranchers \n     must have the freedom to compete in the international \n     marketplace, and with the help of strong leadership by U.S. \n     trade negotiators in Seattle later this year, that goal can \n     begin to be realized.\n       S. Res. 101 embodies the procedure and policy developed \n     through a consensus process by the Seattle Round Agricultural \n     Committee (SRAC). The SRAC represents over 70 agricultural \n     organizations, agribusinesses, and food processors, \n     supporting the new round of multilateral trade negotiations \n     under the auspices of the WTO. The fact is that 96 percent of \n     the world's consumers live outside the U.S. and in many \n     developing countries the demand for food and agricultural \n     products is growing as income and population increase.\n       We are counting on this administration and Congress to \n     ensure that U.S. farmers and ranchers have a significant \n     place at the negotiating table, and are armed with the tools \n     they need to be successful. The 1999 WTO Negotiations is the \n     best opportunity for the U.S. agriculture to achieve more \n     open and freer global markets.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Dean Kleckner,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 BIDEN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1285\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Robb, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Reid, \nMr. Harkin, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Graham, \nMr. Lieberman, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \nKohl, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, \nMr. Wellstone, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \nBryan, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Dodd, \nMrs. Boxer, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \nSpecter, Ms. Collins, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. \nEdwards) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1217, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 32, after line 7, insert the following:\n\n\n                  community oriented policing services\n\n                    violent crime reduction programs\n\n       For activities authorized by the Violent Crime Control and \n     Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (Public Law 104-322) (referred to \n     under this heading as the ``1994 Act''), including \n     administrative costs, $325,000,000 to remain available until \n     expended for Public Safety and Community Policing Grants \n     pursuant to title I of the 1994 Act, of which $140,000,000 \n     shall be derived from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund: \n     Provided, That $180,000,000 shall be available for school \n     resource officers: Provided further, That not to exceed \n     $17,325,000 shall be expended for program management and \n     administration: Provided further, That of the unobligated \n     balances available in this program, $170,000,000 shall be \n     used for innovative community policing programs, of which \n     $90,000,000 shall be used for the Crime Identification \n     Technology Initiative, $25,000,000 shall be used for the \n     Bulletproof Vest Program, and $25,000,000 shall be used for \n     the Methamphetamine Program.\n       Provided further, That the funds made available under this \n     heading for the Methamphetamine Program shall be expended as \n     directed in Senate Report 106-76: Provided further, That of \n     the funds made available under this heading for school \n     resource officers, $900,000 shall be for a grant to King \n     County, Washington.\n       On page 21, line 16, strike ``$3,156,895,000'' and insert \n     ``$3,151,895,000''.\n       On page 26, line 13, strike ``$1,547,450,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,407,450,000''.\n       On page 27, line 13, strike ``$350,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$260,000,000''.\n       On page 30, line 21, strike all after ``Initiative'' \n     through ``Program'' on line 23.\n       On page 35, line 1, strike ``$218,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$38,000,000''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   COCHRAN AMENDMENTS NOS. 1286-1288\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. COCHRAN submitted three amendments intended to be proposed by him \nto the bill, S. 1217, supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 1286\n\n       On page 111, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MEDICARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) ushered in the \n     single largest change to the medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act since the program's \n     inception in 1965.\n       (2) As a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, \n     hospitals in all parts of the country, both in urban and \n     rural areas, are beginning to reduce health care services as \n     hospitals implement the provisions of such Act.\n       (3) Beginning 5 years after the date of enactment of the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997, total medicare margins for all \n     hospitals will be negative 4.4 percent, and such margins for \n     rural hospitals will be negative 7.1 percent.\n       (4) The Congressional Budget Office estimated immediately \n     prior to the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \n     that the provisions of such Act would result in \n     $53,000,000,000 of savings to the medicare program because of \n     payment cuts to hospitals; but\n       (5) Actual savings to the medicare program as a result of \n     such cuts will be more in the range of $71,000,000,000, an \n     $18,000,000,000 increase in the estimate described in \n     paragraph (4).\n       (6) The Congressional Budget Office now projects that the \n     provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 will result in \n     a total $206,000,000,000 of savings to the medicare program, \n     double the level of estimated savings when such Act was \n     enacted 18 months ago.\n       (7) The passage and implementation of the Balanced Budget \n     Act of 1997 has proved especially devastating to rural \n     hospitals, as their patient base is typically older, poorer, \n     and sicker, than non-rural hospitals and their most important \n     payment source is the medicare program.\n       (8) The provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have \n     strained the resources of even the most fiscally healthy of \n     these facilities, as rural hospitals are no longer able to \n     recruit and retain qualified health care professionals, \n     including physicians, and such hospitals no longer have \n     access to capital for equipment replacement, maintenance, or \n     repair.\n\n[[Page S9098]]\n\n       (9) Rural hospitals are now being forced to severely limit, \n     or even eliminate, the type and scope of health care services \n     they provide, limiting access to health care and forcing \n     patients to travel long distances.\n       (10) Rural hospitals are often the largest employers for \n     many miles, and the only employer of highly skilled workers \n     in the community.\n       (11) The systematic reduction of health care delivery \n     prompted by the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \n     has the potential to deal a severe blow to the economic well \n     being of many of our Nation's small towns.\n       (12) The concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2000 recognized the problems associated with the \n     provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and set aside \n     funding to address the unintended consequences associated \n     with the implementation of such provisions.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress and the President work expeditiously to develop \n     proposals that would--\n       (1) reject--\n       (A) further reductions in the medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act; and\n       (B) extensions of the provisions of the Balanced Budget Act \n     of 1997; and\n       (2) target new resources from the onbudget surplus, as set \n     forth in the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2000, for the medicare program in order to address the \n     unintended consequences that the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \n     has had on hospitals, and especially on hospitals located in \n     rural areas.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1287\n\n       On page 27, line 9, after the colon insert ``Provided \n     further, That $1,000,000 shall be available to the National \n     Institute of Justice for research and development of next \n     generation backscatter X-ray personnel scanning devices to \n     assist in the dectection of illegal drugs and narcotics.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1288\n\n       On page 25, line 5, before ``and'' insert ``of which \n     $2,000,000 shall be made available to the Department of \n     Psychiatry and Human Behavior at the University of \n     Mississippi School of Medicine for research in addictive \n     disorders and their connection to youth violence''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 LUGAR (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1289\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Mack, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Kerrey, \nand Mr. Lieberman) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1217, supra;

PROTECTION OF SENIORS AND THE DISABLED IN FEDERAL \n                   FAMILY VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) of the estimated more than 1,000,000 persons age 65 and \n     over who are victims of family violence each year, at least \n     \\2/3\\ are women;\n       (2) national statistics are not available on the incidence \n     of domestic or family violence and sexual assault against \n     disabled women, although several studies indicate that abuse \n     of disabled women is of a longer duration compared to abuse \n     suffered by women who are not disabled;\n       (3) in almost 9 out of 10 incidents of domestic elder abuse \n     and neglect, the perpetrator is a family member, and adult \n     children of the victims are the largest category of \n     perpetrators and spouses are the second largest category of \n     perpetrators;\n       (4) the number of reports of elder abuse in the United \n     States increased by 150 percent between 1986 and 1996 and is \n     expected to continue increasing;\n       (5) it is estimated that at least 5 percent of the Nation's \n     elderly are victims of moderate to severe abuse and that the \n     rate for all forms of abuse may be as high as 10 percent;\n       (6) elder abuse is severely underreported, with 1 in 5 \n     cases being reported in 1980 and only 1 in 8 cases being \n     reported today;\n       (7) many older and disabled women fail to report abuse \n     because of shame or as a result of prior unsatisfactory \n     experiences with individual agencies or others who lack \n     sensitivity to the concerns or needs of older or disabled \n     individuals;\n       (8) many older or disabled individuals also fail to report \n     abuse because they are dependent on their abusers and fear \n     being abandoned or institutionalized;\n       (9) disabled women may fear reporting abuse because they \n     are fearful of losing their children in a custody case;\n       (10) public and professional awareness and identification \n     of violence against older or disabled Americans may be \n     difficult because these persons are not integrated into many \n     social networks (such as schools or jobs), and may become \n     isolated in their homes, which can increase the risk of \n     domestic abuse; and\n       (11) older and disabled Americans would greatly benefit \n     from policies that develop, strengthen, and implement \n     programs for the prevention of abuse, including neglect and \n     exploitation, and provide related assistance for victims.\n       (b) In General.--Part T of title I of the Omnibus Crime \n     Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended--\n       (1) in section 2001 (42 U.S.C. 3796gg)--\n       (A) in subsection (a)--\n       (i) by inserting ``, including older women and women with a \n     disability'' after ``combat violent crimes against women'';

as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following title:\n\n    TITLE __--CHILDREN WHO WITNESS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROTECTION ACT\n\n     SEC. __01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Children Who Witness \n     Domestic Violence Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Witnessing domestic violence has a devastating impact \n     on children, placing the children at high risk for anxiety, \n     depression, and, potentially, suicide. Many children who \n     witness domestic violence exhibit more aggressive, \n     antisocial, fearful, and inhibited behaviors.\n       (2) Children exposed to domestic violence have a high risk \n     of experiencing learning difficulties and school failure. \n     Research finds that children residing in domestic violence \n     shelters exhibit significantly lower verbal and quantitative \n     skills when compared to a national sample of children.\n       (3) Domestic violence is strongly correlated with child \n     abuse. Studies have found that between 50 and 70 percent of \n     men who abuse their female partners also abuse their \n     children. In homes in which domestic violence occurs, \n     children are physically abused and neglected at a rate 15 \n     times higher than the national average.\n       (4) Men who witnessed parental abuse during their childhood \n     have a higher risk of becoming physically aggressive in \n     dating and marital relationships.\n       (5) Exposure to domestic violence is a strong predictor of \n     violent delinquent behavior among adolescents. It is \n     estimated that between 20 percent and 40 percent of \n     chronically violent adolescents have witnessed extreme \n     parental conflict.\n       (6) Women have an increased risk of experiencing battering \n     after separation from an abusive partner. Children also have \n     an increased risk of suffering harm during separation.\n       (7) Child visitation disputes are more frequent when \n     families have histories of domestic violence, and the need \n     for supervised visitation centers far exceeds the number of\n\n[[Page S9099]]\n\n     available programs providing those centers, because courts \n     therefore--\n       (A) order unsupervised visitation and endanger parents and \n     children; or\n       (B) prohibit visitation altogether.\n       (8) Recent studies have demonstrated that up to 50 percent \n     of children who appear before juvenile courts in matters \n     involving allegations of abuse and neglect have been exposed \n     to domestic violence in their homes.\n\n     SEC. __03. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Domestic violence.--The term ``domestic violence'' \n     includes an act or threat of violence, not including an act \n     of self defense, committed by a current or former spouse of \n     the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child \n     in common, by a person who is cohabiting with or has \n     cohabited with the victim, by a person who is or has been in \n     a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with \n     the victim, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the \n     victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the \n     jurisdiction of the victim, or by any other person against a \n     victim who is protected from that person's act under the \n     domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction.\n       (2) Indian tribal government.--The term ``Indian tribal \n     government'' has the meaning given the term ``tribal \n     organization'' in section 102 of the Older Americans Act of \n     1965 (42 U.S.C. 3002).\n       (3) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n     States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin \n     Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands.\n       (4) Witness domestic violence.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``witness domestic violence'' \n     means to witness--\n       (i) an act of domestic violence that constitutes actual or \n     attempted physical assault; or\n       (ii) a threat or other action that places the victim in \n     fear of domestic violence.\n       (B) Witness.--In subparagraph (A), the term ``witness'' \n     means to--\n       (i) directly observe an act, threat, or action described in \n     subparagraph (A), or the aftermath of that act, threat, or \n     action; or\n       (ii) be within earshot of an act, threat, or action \n     described in subparagraph (A), or the aftermath of that act, \n     threat, or action.\n\n     SEC. __04.

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Iran has been designated as a state sponsor of \n     terrorism by the Secretary of State and continues to be among \n     the most active supporters of terrorism in the world.\n       (2) According to the State Department's annual report \n     entitled ``Patterns of Global Terrorism'', Iran supports \n     Hizballah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, \n     terrorist organizations which oppose the Middle East peace \n     process, continue to work for the destruction of Israel, and \n     have killed United States citizens.\n       (3) A United States district court ruled in March 1998 that \n     Iran should pay $247,000,000 to the family of Alisa Flatow, a \n     United States citizen killed in a bomb attack orchestrated by \n     the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza in April 1995.\n       (4) The Government of Iran continues to maintain a \n     repressive political regime in which the civil liberties of \n     the people of Iran are denied.\n       (5) The State Department Country Report on Human Rights \n     states that the human rights record of the Government of Iran \n     remains poor, including ``extra judicial killings and summary \n     executions; disappearances; widespread use of torture and \n     other degrading treatment; harsh prison conditions; arbitrary \n     arrest and detention; lack of due process; unfair trials; \n     infringement on citizen's privacy; and restrictions on \n     freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, religion, \n     and movement''.\n       (6) Religious minorities in Iran have been persecuted \n     solely because of their faith, and the Government of Iran has \n     detained 13 members of Iran's Jewish community without \n     charge.\n       (7) Recent student-led protests in Iran were repressed by \n     force, with possibly five students losing their lives and \n     hundreds more being imprisoned.\n       (8) The Government of Iran is pursuing an aggressive \n     ballistic missile program with foreign assistance and is \n     seeking to develop weapons of mass destruction which threaten \n     United States allies and interests.\n       (9) Despite the continuation by the Government of Iran of \n     repressive activities in Iran and efforts to threaten United \n     States allies and interests in the Near East and South Asia, \n     the President waived provisions of the Iran and Libya \n     Sanctions Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-172; 50 U.S.C. 1701 \n     note) intended to impede development of the energy sector in \n     Iran.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President should condemn in the strongest possible \n     terms the failure of the Government of Iran to implement \n     genuine political reforms and protect the civil liberties of \n     the people of Iran, which failure was most recently \n     demonstrated in the violent repression of student-led \n     protests in Teheran and other cities by the Government of \n     Iran;\n       (2) the President should support democratic opposition \n     groups in Iran more aggressively;\n       (3) the detention of 13 members of the Iranian Jewish \n     community by the Government of Iran is a deplorable violation \n     of due process and a clear example of the policies of the \n     Government of Iran to persecute religious minorities; and\n       (4) the decision of the President to waive provisions of \n     the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 intended to impede \n     development of the energy sector in Iran was regrettable and \n     should be reversed as long as Iran continues to threaten \n     United States interests and allies in the Near East and South \n     Asia through state sponsorship of terrorism and efforts to \n     acquire weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to \n     deliver such weapons.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HATCH AMENDMENT NO. 1320\n\n  Mr. GREGG (for Mr. Hatch) proposed an amendment to the bill S. 1217, \nsupra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SECTION 1. HATE CRIMES.\n\n       (a) Declarations.--Congress declares that--\n       (1) further efforts must be taken at all levels of \n     government to respond to the staggering brutality of hate \n     crimes that have riveted public attention and shocked the \n     Nation;\n       (2) hate crimes are prompted by bias and are committed to \n     send a message of hate to targeted communities, usually \n     defined on the basis of immutable traits;\n       (3) the prominent characteristic of a hate crime is that it \n     devastates not just the actual victim and the victim's family \n     and friends, but frequently savages the community sharing the \n     traits that caused the victim to be selected;\n       (4) any efforts undertaken by the Federal Government to \n     combat hate crimes must respect the primacy that States and \n     local officials have traditionally been accorded in the \n     criminal prosecution of acts constituting hate crimes; and\n       (5) an overly broad reaction by the Federal Government to \n     this serious problem might ultimately diminish the \n     accountability of State and local officials in responding to \n     hate crimes and transgress the constitutional limitations on \n     the powers vested in Congress under the Constitution.\n       (b) Studies.--\n       (1) Collection of data.--\n       (A) Definition of hate crime.--In this paragraph, the term \n     ``hate crime'' means--\n       (i) a crime described in subsection (b)(1) of the first \n     section of the Hate Crime Statistics Act (28 U.S.C. 534 \n     note);

and\n\n[[Page S9106]]\n\n       (iv) references to and descriptions of the laws under which \n     the offenders were punished.\n       (D) Costs.--Participating jurisdictions shall be reimbursed \n     for the reasonable and necessary costs of compiling data \n     under this paragraph.\n       (2) Study of trends.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States and the General Accounting Office shall complete a \n     study that analyzes the data collected under paragraph (1) \n     and under the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990 to determine \n     the extent of hate crime activity throughout the country and \n     the success of State and local officials in combating that \n     activity.\n       (B) Identification of trends.--In the study conducted under \n     subparagraph (A), the Comptroller General of the United \n     States and the General Accounting Office shall identify any \n     trends in the commission of hate crimes specifically by--\n       (i) geographic region;\n       (ii) type of crime committed; and\n       (iii) the number of hate crimes that are prosecuted and the \n     number for which convictions are obtained.\n       (c) Model Statute.--\n       (1) In general.--To encourage the identification and \n     prosecution of hate crimes throughout the country, the \n     Attorney General shall, through the National Conference of \n     Commissioners on Uniform State Laws of the American Law \n     Institute or another appropriate forum, and in consultation \n     with the States, develop a model statute to carry out the \n     goals described in subsection (a) and criminalize acts \n     classified as hate crimes.\n       (2) Requirements.--In developing the model statute, the \n     Attorney General shall--\n       (A) include in the model statute crimes that manifest \n     evidence of prejudice; and\n       (B) prepare an analysis of all reasons why any crime \n     motivated by prejudice based on any traits of a victim should \n     or should not be included.\n       (d) Support for Criminal Investigations and Prosecutions by \n     State and Local Law Enforcement Officials.--\n       (1) Assistance other than financial assistance.--\n       (A) In general.--At the request of a law enforcement \n     official of a State or a political subdivision of a State, \n     the Attorney General, acting through the Director of the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall provide technical, \n     forensic, prosecutorial, or any other form of assistance in \n     the criminal investigation or prosecution of any crime that--\n       (i) constitutes a crime of violence (as defined in section \n     16 of title 18, United States Code);\n       (ii) constitutes a felony under the laws of the State; and\n       (iii) is motivated by prejudice based on the victim's race, \n     ethnicity, or religion or is a violation of the State's hate \n     crime law.\n       (B) Priority.--In providing assistance under subparagraph \n     (A), the Attorney General shall give priority to crimes \n     committed by offenders who have committed crimes in more than \n     1 State.\n       (2) Grants.--\n       (A) In general.--There is established a grant program \n     within the Department of Justice to assist State and local \n     officials in the investigation and prosecution of hate \n     crimes.\n       (B) Eligibility.--A State or political subdivision of a \n     State applying for assistance under this paragraph shall--\n       (i) describe the purposes for which the grant is needed;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Hate Crimes Prevention Act \n     of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n     perceived race, color, national origin, religion, sexual \n     orientation, gender, or disability of the victim poses a \n     serious national problem;\n       (2) such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n     communities and is deeply divisive;\n       (3) existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n     problem;\n\n[[Page S9107]]\n\n       (4) such violence affects interstate commerce in many ways, \n     including--\n       (A) by impeding the movement of members of targeted groups \n     and forcing such members to move across State lines to escape \n     the incidence or risk of such violence; and\n       (B) by preventing members of targeted groups from \n     purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n     employment or participating in other commercial activity;\n       (5) perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence;\n       (6) instrumentalities of interstate commerce are used to \n     facilitate the commission of such violence;\n       (7) such violence is committed using articles that have \n     traveled in interstate commerce;\n       (8) violence motivated by bias that is a relic of slavery \n     can constitute badges and incidents of slavery;\n       (9) although many State and local authorities are now and \n     will continue to be responsible for prosecuting the \n     overwhelming majority of violent crimes in the United States, \n     including violent crimes motivated by bias, Federal \n     jurisdiction over certain violent crimes motivated by bias is \n     necessary to supplement State and local jurisdiction and \n     ensure that justice is achieved in each case;\n       (10) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n     motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local \n     authorities to work together as partners in the investigation \n     and prosecution of such crimes;\n       (11) the problem of hate crime is sufficiently serious, \n     widespread, and interstate in nature as to warrant Federal \n     assistance to States and local jurisdictions; and\n       (12) freedom of speech and association are fundamental \n     values protected by the first amendment to the Constitution \n     of the United States, and it is the purpose of this title to \n     criminalize acts of violence, and threats of violence, \n     carried out because of the actual or perceived race, color, \n     religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or \n     disability of the victim, not to criminalize beliefs in the \n     abstract.\n\n     SEC. __03.

Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of \ninternational exchange programs. Americans benefit from an opportunity \nto work and study abroad. Foreigners benefit from time in the United \nStates both in their professional development and by exposure to the \nAmerican system and values. Exchanges are a proven way to disperse \nAmerican principals of freedom and democracy around the world. \nTherefore, I am disappointed that the committee report recommends \nreducing funding for several exchange programs, including the funding \nfor students, scholars and teachers portion of the Fulbright Program. \nThe Fulbright Program has served America and Americans very well for \nmany years. It is not in our best interest to reduce funding for it at \nthis time. I would hope that all of the programs on the committees \nreprioritization list will be carefully evaluated before any decision \nis made to reduce or eliminate them.\n  The Tibetan Fulbright Program touches Vermonters very close to home. \nNgawang Choephel, a Tibetan exile living in India, was the recipient of \na Fulbright Scholarship and studied ethnomusicology at Middlebury \nCollege in Middlebury, Vermont. He was unjustly arrested by the Chinese \nin 1995 in his native Tibet when he returned to document traditional \nTibetan music. Although this young man's time in Vermont was brief, the \npassion he threw into his work to preserve endangered Tibetan culture \ngained him a large following in my state. His case is of the highest \npriority for me and the other members of Vermont's congressional \ndelegation. Senator Leahy has joined me in offering an amendment to \nthis legislation to ensure that the Tibetan Exchange Program continues \nin fiscal year 2000.\n  I hope that in conference the necessary changes will be made to \nensure adequate funding for our most important exchange \nprograms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/22/senate-section/article/S9110-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ON THE PASSING OF COACH RALPH TASKER\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the life \nof a legendary figure in New Mexico sports history.\n  Ralph Tasker, the dean of New Mexico high school boys basketball, \ndied earlier this week at the age of 80.\n  In New Mexico, you didn't have to refer to Ralph Tasker by name; you \nonly had to say ``Coach'' and everyone knew who that was.\n  He coached in Hobbs for decades, and was known throughout our state \nas a superb teacher of the game of Basketball.\n  Ralph Tasker leaves behind an enduring legacy forged with the Hobbs \nEagles, coaching 52 seasons in Lea County.\n  During that time, he amassed 1,122 wins with only 291 losses. That's \nalmost an 80% winning record; a record difficult to achieve in any \nsport, at any level.\n  His teams won 12 state championships.\n  He was also recognized as the National Coach of the year.\n  He retired in 1998 as the third winningest head coach in the history \nof boys high school basketball in the United States and was elected to \nthe National High School Coach Association Hall of Fame.\n  With all those accolades, if you asked Ralph Tasker what he was most \nproud of, he would tell you he was most proud of the hard work, \ndedication, and educational achievements of the young men on his teams.\n  When opposing teams prepared to play a Ralph Tasker-coached team, \nthey knew they would face a disciplined and well-motivated team.\n  Coach Tasker knew the value of team work and inspired young men to \nrespect one another as they worked together toward a common goal.\n  Coach Tasker coached and stood for the kind of ideals that we as \nstate and country aspire as we work to motivate and teach young people.\n  I extend my condolences to his three children, Nancy, Diane, and Tim \nand to his four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.\n  New Mexicans appreciate Coach Tasker's life, and we will always \nremember his great achievements on and off the court.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/22/senate-section/article/S9110-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9110-S9111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF ROBERT TOBIAS\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nretirement of Robert Tobias, President of the National Treasury \nEmployees Union. I would like to take a moment to recognize the hard \nwork and accomplishments of Mr. Tobias who, during a career with the \nNTEU of 31 years, has served as a prominent advocate for the over \n155,000 federal employee members of the Union.\n  Under Bob's leadership, the NTEU has grown to become the nation's \nlargest independent federal employees union, representing workers from \n18 government agencies. Bob is one of the foremost authorities on \nfederal employee issues and has been a vital resource to those of us \nwho work on Capitol Hill, to the agencies he represents and throughout \nthe federal government. Bob is highly respected among labor relations \nspecialists as well. He has been instrumental in developing and \nenacting major legislation effecting federal employees including, \ncreation and implementation of the Federal Employees Retirement System, \npay parity issues, and he served as a member of the bipartisan National \nCommission Restructuring the IRS whose work was the basis for the \ncomprehensive IRS reform legislation passed in the 105th Congress.\n  Furthermore, Bob has been successful in numerous landmark legal \nbattles impacting employee rights in court and before various federal \noversight bodies, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board, the \nFederal Labor Relations Authority and the Office of Personnel \nManagement.\n  Again, I commend Mr. Tobias for his invaluable work on behalf of \nfederal\n\n[[Page S9111]]\n\nemployees, and I wish continued success for Mr. Tobias in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/22/senate-section/article/S9111-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               LYBA COHEN\n\n Mr. LEAHY.

She \nalso walked away with a nearly perfect GPA. Although Lyba Cohen speaks \nseven languages fluently, she considers the English language her \ngreatest love. She has an insatiable love of learning, and plans to \ncontinue her education next fall.\n  there is one detail that I have failed to mention regarding this \nrecent college graduate. Mr. President, Lyba Cohen is 82 years old. she \nwas born and raised in Estonia, became part of the Zionist movement \nafter high school, and was among the first people to settle the state \nof Israel. A woman who has worn many hats throughout her life, Mrs. \nCohen is a tribute to students and senior citizens alike. She relocated \nto Rutland two years ago, and I am proud to honor this fascinating \nVermonter. Mrs. Cohen has led a rich and fulfilling life,and at 82 she \nhas embarked on yet another journey. this unique student deserves \nrecognition, and I ask that the article from the Rutland daily Herald \nbe printed in the Record so that all Senators may read about this \nremarkable women.\n  The article follows.\n\n    A Lifelong Learner--Rutland Woman Earns College Degree at Age 82\n\n                           (By Cauley Greene)\n\n       Lyba Cohen is a great student. She's graduating with a sky-\n     high GPA and a bachelor's degree in English literature with a \n     minor in Italian.\n       Like other graduates, she looks forward to a summer of rest \n     before deciding whether to delve back into academia.\n       But unlike most college graduates, Cohen is 82 years old.\n       She'll be accepting her diploma from Lehman College in the \n     Bronx, N.Y., on Friday with the rest of the class of 1999.\n       The more than 60 years between her high school diploma and \n     her bachelor's degree have been packed full with feats that \n     make her latest accomplishment seem more like a brief stop \n     along the way than a final destination.\n       She has been a pioneer, a working mother and, most \n     recently, a student.\n       Although her life as a traditional student began 10 years \n     ago at a non-traditional age, Cohen has been something of a \n     student all her life, learning as she went along.\n       Born and raised in Estonia, Cohen ventured off the beaten \n     path early.\n       ``When I graduated from high school I joined a group of \n     friends that I had in a Zionist youth organization,'' she \n     said. For two years the group trained for a life in \n     agriculture, to be among the first to settle what is now \n     Israel.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       When war broke out in 1948, Abraham traveled back and forth \n     to Israel while Lyba stayed in New York, helping her father-\n     in-law with the family bakery. After the war ended her \n     husband returned and took over the bakery. Cohen helped run \n     the business until their two sons were out of school.\n       In 1970, she took the civil service test and took a \n     position with the New York City Human Resources \n     Administration, where she worked for 17 years, living in the \n     Bronx. Widowed in 1973, Cohen lived and worked in the Bronx \n     by herself. She retired in 1987.\n       Restless and driven by what she described as a love of the \n     English language, she enrolled at Lehman College a year after \n     she retired. An interest in English, sparked when Cohen was \n     in high school, guided her toward a concentration in \n     literature and modern language.\n       ``I just fell in love with the English language,'' she said \n     of her high school years.\n       She has been taking college classes since 1988, averaging \n     two courses a semester.\n       ``It took me a very long time because of health problems \n     and hospital says,'' she said. Her health and other factors \n     prompted her move from the Bronx to Ruthland in December \n     1997, but she stayed in school.\n       ``I didn't give up,'' she said.\n       She now lives across the street from her son, Barry Cohen. \n     Her other son, Boaz, who lives in Warren N.J., will join the \n     family as they watch her accept her diploma.\n       The move made finishing her degree more difficult, but Lyba \n     Cohen said she's glad she came north.\n       ``I love it here, it's a wonderful place . . . I wish I had \n     come here earlier,'' she said.\n       Her love of language is greater. She speaks seven different \n     tongues, and when she speaks it seems every word she uses has \n     been carefully chosen. She cites the same discrimination in \n     her favorite author, Vladimir Nabokov, who also learned \n     English as a second language.\n       ``I like him, I like his linguistic proficiency,'' she \n     said.\n       Cohen's love of language has also translated into academic \n     success. She has received grades higher than an ``A'' in her \n     last two semesters, and was told by her professor that three \n     papers on author Toni Morrison she had recently done were \n     written on a graduate level. Cohen's GPA is also very high, \n     but she said that it doesn't really matter to her.\n       ``It's close to 4.0, I think . . . It's really of no \n     importance to me at all. The fact is I've acquired a lot of \n     knowledge, she said.\n       Which begs the question: what will she do with her degree? \n     Her answer probably echoes that of graduates 60 years her \n     junior.\n       ``After the summer I'm going to think about taking some \n     courses . . . but I have the summer to think about it,'' she \n     said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/22/senate-section/article/S9111-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9111-S9112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN HONOR OF JOE REDINGTON SR.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in the winter of 1973, when I \nwas a commercial banker in Fairbanks, AK, pioneer Joe Redington, Sr., \ncame into our offices with an interesting proposition. He was seeking a \nbank loan to start a sled dog race to commemorate the infamous \ndiphtheria serum run that left Nenana in 1925 to deliver 20 pounds to \nserum to Nome to stop a deadly outbreak of the disease.\n  Joe worked as a commercial fishermen and miner and had no collateral \nto speak of--and no real chance of getting the $50,000 loan. He \ncouldn't accurately predict the costs of the race of forecast the \nsponsor interest, and he couldn't even guarantee that any mushers would \nreach the finish line in Nome.\n  But Joe Redington had a dream. More importantly, Redington was a many \nyou knew would accomplish anything he set his mind to. His infectious \nenthusiasm and ``can-do'' attitude prompted me to take a chance and \nmake a loan to help fund the world's longest sled dog race--the \nIditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.\n  Joe Redington got the loan and paid ti back. I do regret however, \nhaving to come to the Senate floor today to note the passing of Joe \nRedington, Sr., a true giant of Alaska, who died June 24, at age 82 at \nhis home in Knik. Alaska.\n  Redington's life is really a microcosm of Alaska's modern history. \nBorn February 1, 1917, in rural Oklahoma, his family wandered the \ncountry looking for farm work until they settled in Bucks County, \nPennsylvania in the late 1920s. In 1948 after a stint in World War II, \nRedington and wife, Vi, drove two Jeeps to Alaska and never looked \nback.\n  During territorial days and the early years of statehood, Joe \nRedington helped turn dog mushing--then a transportation necessity in \ncentral and rural Alaska--into the state's official sport. Redington \nand his wife, Vi, were dedicated breeders for nearly four decades. \nOffspring of their dogs have filled many kennels in Alaska and the \nLower 48 with racing pups.\n  In 1967 he and the late Dorothy Page teamed to promote a Centennial \nIditarod Sled Dog Race in honor of the 100th Anniversary of Alaska's \npurchase from Russia. The 56-mile race around the Big Lake--Wasilla \narea was a great success. The Centennial's success spurred the idea for \nthe Iditarod.\n  But Redington's Iditarod dream was realized when 34 mushers left \nAnchorage on March 3, 1973 for the inaugural Iditarod Trail Sled Dog \nRace. The 1,100-mile race took the adventurous mushers across some of \nthe roughest terrain in Alaska. Twenty-two mushers crossed the finish \nline in Nome on April 3 with the top finishers sharing the $50,000 \npurse. In 1976, Redington's determination and dedication to the \nIditarod race, led Congress to designate the Iditarod Trail as a \nNational Historic Trail. The race has been run every March since 1973.\n  Joe Redington Sr., at age 57, ran his first Iditarod in 1974 and ran \nin every race until 1992. At age 80, Redington ran in his 19th and \nfinal Iditarod in 1997 where he finished a very respectable 36th. His \nfinish time was 13 days, 4 hours and 18 minutes--nearly 17 days faster \nthan\n\n[[Page S9112]]\n\nthe winners time of the first Iditarod in 1973. While Redington never \nwon the Iditarod, he did finished in fifth palace, four times--in 1975, \n1977, 1978 and 1988. And he was among the top 10 finishers, seven \ntimes.\n  Joe was remarkable off the race course, as well. At age 62 he scaled \nAlaska's Mount McKinley, keeping up with then 20-year-old musher, and \nfour-time Iditarod champion, Susan Butcher. Redington made it to the \npeak of the 20,230 foot peak, a monumental task for a person of any \nage.\n  After hearing of Redington passing, fellow musher DeeDee Jonrowe was \nquoted in the Fairbanks News Miner as saying, ``Joe never thought \n(anything) wasn't possible. If you had a dream, he was about making it \nhappen for you. He wasn't about telling you the pitfalls.''\n  Joe Redington, Sr. was a good, kind and gentle soul. He was soft of \nvoice, but had a big heart--he was a fitting recipient of the Alaskan \nof the Year Award in 1995. Joe came down with esophagus cancer in 1997, \nbut until a month ago he was still planning to complete in the year \n2000 Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.\n  While Joe Redington, Sr, won't be racing in the 2000 Iditarod, his \nspirit surely will light the way to Nome for mushers each March. More \nimportantly, his legacy of hard work and never giving up will be with \nall Alsakans as we continue our efforts to improve the land that we \nlove. . . . The land of The Last Fontier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/22/senate-section/article/S9112-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF COLORADO D.A.V. CHAPTER 26\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor \nthe 50th anniversary of Colorado Chapter 26 of the Disabled American \nVeterans.\n  July 26, 1999 is the anniversary of this distinguished group. Chapter \n26 consists of over 2,000 veterans, making it the largest chapter in \nColorado. Not only did these men and women serve their country in a \ntime of war, but they came home and continued to demonstrate their \nrespect for America. Colorado Springs, El Paso County, and the State of \nColorado have seen and felt their numerous contributions first hand in \nthese times of peace--a peace which they helped to provide.\n  The Veterans of Chapter 26 have never forgotten their duty to serve \nand defend, whether it be overseas or at home. Their un-relinquishing \nduty to America should be recognized.\n  Reaching fifty years of service and dedication is a milestone in the \nlives of these men and women who served in the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States of America and became members of Chapter 26. These \nmembers offered their lives to protect our country. They survived the \nperils of war, not unscathed, to come home and continue to serve as \noutstanding citizens. They have shown a love that has been unwavering \nfor fifty years towards this country that they sacrificed so much to \npreserve. They are models of patriotism, citizenship, and dedication to \nthe freedoms cherished in these United States. And they continue to \nserve America with all of the pride and honor that they showed fifty \nyears ago when they sacrificed their time and bodies for the freedom of \nothers.\n  So on July 26th 1999 the Colorado Chapter 26 of the United States \nDisabled American Veterans should be recognized and honored for the \nfifty years of unwavering pride and service--the ideals which America \nwas built upon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

INTERAGENCY CONSULTATION.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--It is the intention of the Congress that the \n     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as the \n     umbrella supervisor for financial holding companies, and the \n     State insurance regulators, as the functional regulators of \n     companies engaged in insurance activities, coordinate efforts \n     to supervise companies that\n\n[[Page S9161]]\n\n     control both a depository institution and a company engaged \n     in insurance activities regulated under State law. In \n     particular, Congress believes that the Board and the State \n     insurance regulators should share, on a confidential basis, \n     information relevant to the supervision of companies that \n     control both a depository institution and a company engaged \n     in insurance activities, including information regarding the \n     financial health of the consolidated organization and \n     information regarding transactions and relationships between \n     insurance companies and affiliated depository institutions. \n     The appropriate Federal banking agencies for depository \n     institutions should also share, on a confidential basis, \n     information with the relevant State insurance regulators \n     regarding transactions and relationships between depository \n     institutions and affiliated companies engaged in insurance \n     activities. The purpose of this section is to encourage this \n     coordination and confidential sharing of information, and to \n     thereby improve both the efficiency and the quality of the \n     supervision of financial holding companies and their \n     affiliated depository institutions and companies engaged in \n     insurance activities.\n       (b) Examination Results and Other Information.--\n       (1) Information of the board.--Upon the request of the \n     appropriate insurance regulator of any State, the Board may \n     provide any information of the Board regarding the financial \n     condition, risk management policies, and operations of any \n     financial holding company that controls a company that is \n     engaged in insurance activities and is regulated by such \n     State insurance regulator, and regarding any transaction or \n     relationship between such an insurance company and any \n     affiliated depository institution. The Board may provide any \n     other information to the appropriate State insurance \n     regulator that the Board believes is necessary or appropriate \n     to permit the State insurance regulator to administer and \n     enforce applicable State insurance laws.\n       (2) Banking agency information.--Upon the request of the \n     appropriate insurance regulator of any State, the appropriate \n     Federal banking agency may provide any information of the \n     agency regarding any transaction or relationship between a \n     depository institution supervised by such Federal banking \n     agency and any affiliated company that is engaged in \n     insurance activities regulated by such State insurance \n     regulator. The appropriate Federal banking agency may provide \n     any other information to the appropriate State insurance \n     regulator that the agency believes is necessary or \n     appropriate to permit the State insurance regulator to \n     administer and enforce applicable State insurance laws.\n       (3) State insurance regulator information.--Upon the \n     request of the Board or the appropriate Federal banking \n     agency, a State insurance regulator may provide any \n     examination or other reports, records, or other information \n     to which such insurance regulator may have access with \n     respect to a company which--\n       (A) is engaged in insurance activities and regulated by \n     such insurance regulator; and\n       (B) is an affiliate of an insured depository institution, \n     wholesale financial institution, or financial holding \n     company.\n       (c) Consultation.--Before making any determination relating \n     to the initial affiliation of, or the continuing affiliation \n     of, an insured depository institution, wholesale financial \n     institution, or financial holding company with a company \n     engaged in insurance activities, the appropriate Federal \n     banking agency shall consult with the appropriate State \n     insurance regulator of such company and take the views of \n     such insurance regulator into account in making such \n     determination.\n       (d) Effect on Other Authority.--Nothing in this section \n     shall limit in any respect the authority of the appropriate \n     Federal banking agency with respect to an insured depository \n     institution, wholesale financial institution, or bank holding \n     company or any affiliate thereof under any provision of law.\n       (e) Confidentiality and Privilege.--\n       (1) Confidentiality.--The appropriate Federal banking \n     agency shall not provide any information or material that is \n     entitled to confidential treatment under applicable Federal \n     banking agency regulations, or other applicable law, to a \n     State insurance regulator unless such regulator agrees to \n     maintain the information or material in confidence and to \n     take all reasonable steps to oppose any effort to secure \n     disclosure of the information or material by the regulator. \n     The appropriate Federal banking agency shall treat as \n     confidential any information or material obtained from a \n     State insurance regulator that is entitled to confidential \n     treatment under applicable State regulations, or other \n     applicable law, and take all reasonable steps to oppose any \n     effort to secure disclosure of the information or material by \n     the Federal banking agency.\n       (2) Privilege.--The provision pursuant to this section of \n     information or material by a Federal banking agency or State \n     insurance regulator shall not constitute a waiver of, or \n     otherwise affect, any privilege to which the information or \n     material is otherwise subject.\n       (f) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the \n     following definitions shall apply:\n       (1) Appropriate federal banking agency; insured depository \n     institution.--The terms ``appropriate Federal banking \n     agency'' and ``insured depository institution'' have the same \n     meanings as in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Act.\n       (2) Board; financial holding company; and wholesale \n     financial institution.--The terms ``Board'', ``financial \n     holding company'', and ``wholesale financial institution'' \n     have the same meanings as in section 2 of the Bank Holding \n     Company Act of 1956.\n\n     SEC. 310.

GENERAL APPLICATION.\n\n       This subtitle shall only apply to a mutual insurance \n     company in a State which has not enacted a law which \n     expressly establishes reasonable terms and conditions for a \n     mutual insurance company domiciled in such State to \n     reorganize into a mutual holding company.\n\n     SEC. 312. REDOMESTICATION OF MUTUAL INSURERS.\n\n       (a) Redomestication.--A mutual insurer organized under the \n     laws of any State may transfer its domicile to a transferee \n     domicile as a step in a reorganization in which, pursuant to \n     the laws of the transferee domicile and consistent with the \n     standards in subsection (f), the mutual insurer becomes a \n     stock insurer that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of a \n     mutual holding company.\n       (b) Resulting Domicile.--Upon complying with the applicable \n     law of the transferee domicile governing transfers of \n     domicile and completion of a transfer pursuant to this \n     section, the mutual insurer shall cease to be a domestic \n     insurer in the transferor domicile and, as a continuation of \n     its corporate existence, shall be a domestic insurer of the \n     transferee domicile.\n       (c) Licenses Preserved.--The certificate of authority, \n     agents' appointments and licenses, rates, approvals and other \n     items that a licensed State allows and that are in existence \n     immediately prior to the date that a redomesticating insurer \n     transfers its domicile pursuant to this subtitle shall \n     continue in full force and effect upon transfer, if the \n     insurer remains duly qualified to transact the business of \n     insurance in such licensed State.\n       (d) Effectiveness of Outstanding Policies and Contracts.--\n       (1) In general.--All outstanding insurance policies and \n     annuities contracts of a redomesticating insurer shall remain \n     in full force and effect and need not be endorsed as to the \n     new domicile of the insurer, unless so ordered by the State \n     insurance regulator of a licensed State, and then only in the \n     case of outstanding policies and contracts whose owners \n     reside in such licensed State.\n       (2) Forms.--\n       (A) Applicable State law may require a redomesticating \n     insurer to file new policy forms with the State insurance \n     regulator of a licensed State on or before the effective date \n     of the transfer.\n       (B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a redomesticating \n     insurer may use existing policy forms with appropriate \n     endorsements to reflect the new domicile of the \n     redomesticating insurer until the new policy forms are \n     approved for use by the State insurance regulator of such \n     licensed State.\n       (e) Notice.--A redomesticating insurer shall give notice of \n     the proposed transfer to the State insurance regulator of \n     each licensed State and shall file promptly any resulting \n     amendments to corporate documents required to be filed by a \n     foreign licensed mutual insurer with the insurance regulator \n     of each such licensed State.\n       (f) Procedural Requirements.--No mutual insurer may \n     redomesticate to another State and reorganize into a mutual \n     holding company pursuant to this section unless the State \n     insurance regulator of the transferee domicile determines \n     that the plan of reorganization of the insurer includes the \n     following requirements:\n       (1) Approval by board of directors and policyholders.--The \n     reorganization is approved by at least a majority of the \n     board of directors of the mutual insurer and at least a \n     majority of the policyholders who vote after notice, \n     disclosure of the reorganization and the effects of the \n     transaction on policyholder contractual rights, and \n     reasonable opportunity to vote, in accordance with such \n     notice, disclosure, and voting procedures as are approved by \n     the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile.\n       (2) Continued voting control by policyholders; review of \n     public stock offering.--After the consummation of a \n     reorganization, the policyholders of the reorganized insurer \n     shall have the same voting rights with respect to the mutual \n     holding company as they had before the reorganization with \n     respect to the mutual insurer. With respect to an initial \n     public offering of stock, the offering shall be conducted in \n     compliance with applicable securities laws and in a manner \n     approved by the State insurance regulator of the transferee \n     domicile.\n       (3) Award of stock or grant of options to officers and \n     directors.--For a period of 6 months after completion of an \n     initial public offering, neither a stock holding company nor \n     the converted insurer shall award any stock options or stock \n     grants to persons who are elected officers or directors of \n     the mutual holding company, the stock holding company, or the \n     converted insurer, except with respect to any such awards or \n     options to which a person is entitled as a policyholder and \n     as approved by the State insurance regulator of the \n     transferee domicile.\n       (4) Contractual rights.--Upon reorganization into a mutual \n     holding company, the contractual rights of the policyholders \n     are preserved.\n       (5) Fair and equitable treatment of policyholders.--The \n     reorganization is approved as fair and equitable to the \n     policyholders by the insurance regulator of the transferee \n     domicile.\n\n     SEC. 313. EFFECT ON STATE LAWS RESTRICTING REDOMESTICATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Unless otherwise permitted by this \n     subtitle, State laws of any transferor\n\n[[Page S9162]]\n\n     domicile that conflict with the purposes and intent of this \n     subtitle are preempted, including but not limited to--\n       (1) any law that has the purpose or effect of impeding the \n     activities of, taking any action against, or applying any \n     provision of law or regulation to, any insurer or an \n     affiliate of such insurer because that insurer or any \n     affiliate plans to redomesticate, or has redomesticated, \n     pursuant to this subtitle;\n       (2) any law that has the purpose or effect of impeding the \n     activities of, taking action against, or applying any \n     provision of law or regulation to, any insured or any \n     insurance licensee or other intermediary because such person \n     has procured insurance from or placed insurance with any \n     insurer or affiliate of such insurer that plans to \n     redomesticate, or has redomesticated, pursuant to this \n     subtitle, but only to the extent that such law would treat \n     such insured licensee or other intermediary differently than \n     if the person procured insurance from, or placed insurance \n     with, an insured licensee or other intermediary which had not \n     redomesticated;\n       (3) any law that has the purpose or effect of terminating, \n     because of the redomestication of a mutual insurer pursuant \n     to this subtitle, any certificate of authority, agent \n     appointment or license, rate approval, or other approval, of \n     any State insurance regulator or other State authority in \n     existence immediately prior to the redomestication in any \n     State other than the transferee domicile.\n       (b) Differential Treatment Prohibited.--No State law, \n     regulation, interpretation, or functional equivalent thereof, \n     of a State other than a transferee domicile may treat a \n     redomesticating or redomesticated insurer or any affiliate \n     thereof any differently than an insurer operating in that \n     State that is not a redomesticating or redomesticated \n     insurer.\n       (c) Laws Prohibiting Operations.--If any licensed State \n     fails to issue, delays the issuance of, or seeks to revoke an \n     original or renewal certificate of authority of a \n     redomesticated insurer immediately following redomestication, \n     except on grounds and in a manner consistent with its past \n     practices regarding the issuance of certificates of authority \n     to foreign insurers that are not redomesticating, then the \n     redomesticating insurer shall be exempt from any State law of \n     the licensed State to the extent that such State law or the \n     operation of such State law would make unlawful, or regulate, \n     directly or indirectly, the operation of the redomesticated \n     insurer, except that such licensed State may require the \n     redomesticated insurer to--\n       (1) comply with the unfair claim settlement practices law \n     of the licensed State;\n       (2) pay, on a nondiscriminatory basis, applicable premium \n     and other taxes which are levied on licensed insurers or \n     policyholders under the laws of the licensed State;\n       (3) register with and designate the State insurance \n     regulator as its agent solely for the purpose of receiving \n     service of legal documents or process;\n       (4) submit to an examination by the State insurance \n     regulator in any licensed state in which the redomesticated \n     insurer is doing business to determine the insurer's \n     financial condition, if--\n       (A) the State insurance regulator of the transferee \n     domicile has not begun an examination of the redomesticated \n     insurer and has not scheduled such an examination to begin \n     before the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date of \n     the redomestication; and\n       (B) any such examination is coordinated to avoid \n     unjustified duplication and repetition;\n       (5) comply with a lawful order issued in--\n       (A) a delinquency proceeding commenced by the State \n     insurance regulator of any licensed State if there has been a \n     judicial finding of financial impairment under paragraph (7); \n     or\n       (B) a voluntary dissolution proceeding;\n       (6) comply with any State law regarding deceptive, false, \n     or fraudulent acts or practices, except that if the licensed \n     State seeks an injunction regarding the conduct described in \n     this paragraph, such injunction must be obtained from a court \n     of competent jurisdiction as provided in section 314(a);\n       (7) comply with an injunction issued by a court of \n     competent jurisdiction, upon a petition by the State \n     insurance regulator alleging that the redomesticating insurer \n     is in hazardous financial condition or is financially \n     impaired;\n       (8) participate in any insurance insolvency guaranty \n     association on the same basis as any other insurer licensed \n     in the licensed State; and\n       (9) require a person acting, or offering to act, as an \n     insurance licensee for a redomesticated insurer in the \n     licensed State to obtain a license from that State, except \n     that such State may not impose any qualification or \n     requirement that discriminates against a nonresident \n     insurance licensee.\n\n     SEC. 314. OTHER PROVISIONS.\n\n       (a) Judicial Review.--The appropriate United States \n     district court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over \n     litigation arising under this section involving any \n     redomesticating or redomesticated insurer.\n       (b) Severability.--If any provision of this section, or the \n     application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held \n     invalid, the remainder of the section, and the application of \n     such provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not \n     be affected thereby.\n\n     SEC. 315.
