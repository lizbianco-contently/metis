This Nation, this Senate, the women and men who serve as \nSenators, and all of us who work with them and for them belong first \nand foremost to You. You are our Judge. We are accountable to You. \nForgive us when we trade political greatness for petulant gamesmanship, \nwhen words are used to criticize others rather than communicate truth \nabout issues, when party spirit is more important than being party to \nYour Spirit, when winning the election in November becomes more crucial \nthan nonpartisan winning of what's best for our Nation in the votes to \nbe cast in the Senate. Bless the Senators in this busy season. Fill \nthis Chamber with Your sovereign presence, the Senators' minds with \nYour wisdom, and their hearts with concern for each other. May debate \ngreater expose truth and votes coincide with both conscience and \nconviction. This is the day You have made; we will rejoice and glorify \nYou in it.

Mr. President, first, I would like to welcome all of my \ncolleagues and our staff back from the August period when we had time \nto be with our families and our friends and our constituents. We are \ninspired by the Chaplain's prayer and ready, I am sure, for a lot of \ngood work. As I have visited with some of my colleagues already, I see \nthat they look mighty rested and ready for a busy legislative period, \nand I think they are probably going to need to be. We still have to \ncomplete action on five appropriations measures, as well as conference \nreports as they become available.\n  In addition, there are a number of other legislative matters we hope \nto finish as we move toward the adjournment period of the Congress. We \nhave some bills we hope to take up freestanding in the Senate, and, of \ncourse, we have some conference reports other than appropriations bills \non which we will be working. So we have a lot of work we are going to \nneed to consider.\n  Today, the Senate will have a period of morning business prior to the \n12:30 p.m. recess for weekly party conferences and meetings. When the \nSenate reconvenes at 2:15 p.m., it will begin postcloture debate on the \nmotion to proceed to the China PNTR legislation. Those Senators who \nwish to make statements are encouraged to notify the bill managers. \nHopefully, a lot of Senators who wish to speak on the China trade issue \nwill take advantage of the time today, and we will go to as late as \npossibly 6 p.m., although we may be prepared to go a little bit earlier \nthan that if our colleagues have made their statements and we can get \nagreement to do that. But at least at 6 p.m. the Senate will begin \nconsideration of the energy and water appropriations bill with \namendments in order.\n  As a reminder, we will be considering these two bills on a dual track \nthroughout the week with the motion to proceed to the China trade bill \nbeing considered during the day and the appropriations bill or bills \nbeing considered at night. So votes could still occur if we move toward \nthe time when we could need to have a vote today, but certainly during \nthe day on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and possibly Friday morning we \nwill be having votes on the appropriations amendments that are offered \nat night or on China PNTR when amendments become available.\n\n[[Page S7960]]\n\n  So there will be long days, but we will do our best to keep Senators \nadvised after communicating with the leadership on both sides of the \naisle what the schedule will be. I hope we can make good progress and \ncomplete this appropriations bill and move to another one later on this \nweek or early next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S7960-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMEASURES PLACED ON CALENDAR--H.R. 728, H.R. 1102, H.R. 1264, H.R. 2348, \nH.R. 3048, H.R. 3468, H.R. 4033, H.R. 4079, H.R. 4201, H.R. 4923, H.R. \n          4846, H.R. 4888, H.R. 4700, H.R. 4681, H.J.

Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to have a \ndiscussion as to where we are going in these remaining, I guess, less \nthan 20 days we have before us. Certainly, we have a great deal to do, \nas the leader has pointed out. We have 13 appropriations bills and just \n2 that have been passed. So we have the responsibility, probably first \nof all, to deal with that to keep the Government moving forward in \ndoing the kinds of things we must do to ensure that programs in place \nnow are funded.\n  There are a number of other things, of course, that will be talked \nabout, a number of issues each of us, I suppose, have heard a great \ndeal about when we were in our States. I come from a State in which \nnearly half the land belongs to the Federal Government. So you can \nimagine a good many of the things I heard about, and I am sure my \npartner in the Chair heard about, have to do with the public lands \nissue, the idea of access, multiple use.\n  We, of course, have had the great unfortunate experience during this \ntime of lots of forest fires, which, of course, have been very \ndestructive. We need to take a long look at that, starting, of course, \nin commending the people who have worked so hard and risked so much to \nbe able to control those fires and have done the very best job that \ncould be done.\n  On the other hand, we have to take a look at the policy that has to \ndo with the control and the management of resources, in this case \nparticularly the management of forests. I submit to you there does need \nto be management; unless we want nature's way of reducing forests by \nfire, then we have to do it in some other ways that can be used. So I \ndo hope we will have an opportunity there, of course, to not only take \na look at the necessary funding that will be required in order to give \nthe utmost protection to those activities, but also to seek to avoid \nthis kind of repetition in the future.\n  We will be talking, of course, about normal trade relations with the \nPeople's Republic of China and additionally, shortly thereafter, WTO \nentry for Taiwan. I hope both of those things can happen, and happen \nshortly. We have postponed this activity for a very long time.\n  I think most people understand that if we are going to move forward \nin today's world, we are going to have to move forward to seek to make \nsome changes in mainland China. The best way to do that is to have some \nrules laid out for them to be part of a world organization, such as the \nWTO, and begin to move forward to increase the number of changes that \nhave, indeed, been made there.\n  I think that is very important. It is very important for our economy, \nbut probably more so, it is important for the kinds of things we would \nlike to have take place in China with regard to human rights, with \nregard to economic freedom, which are things we want to have happen \ntoday. So we will be moving forward certainly on that.\n  We will have an opportunity to take another look at tax reductions \nfor the taxpayers of this country in a couple of areas that seem to me \nto be largely based on fairness. For example, the marriage penalty, it \nis really very difficult to understand how we can be opposed to making \nthat fair. Two people who are single, if you combine their incomes, are \nat a certain level, but if they were married, with the same level of \nincome, they would pay more income taxes. That does not seem to be \nright. Fairness ought to be one of the areas vital to taxation.\n  The same could be applied to the estate tax. As I suggested, our \nState of Wyoming has lots of small businesses, lots of farm and ranch \nfamilies who have spent their lives--as did their predecessors--\ndeveloping these kinds of assets. Under present law, when those assets \nare subject to the death tax, we find they have to sell those lands in \norder to make it work out.\n  Mr. President, I sense that you are about ready to rap the gavel, as \nyou should. I just end by saying I hope we can address ourselves to the \nissues that are out there and not put ourselves off creating issues \nrather than resolving them. It seems to me that is our challenge. We \nhave the opportunity to do that in the next several weeks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my colleague, the Senator from Wyoming, \nsaid we have a lot to do. He is certainly correct, we have a lot to do \nin about a 5-week sprint to the end of this 106th Congress.\n  I think all of us aspired to come to this Chamber because we want to \nget things done for the American people. We want this country to be \nsuccessful and to grow and prosper. We want to address real problems.\n  My hope is that we can find ways, between the political aisles, where \nRepublicans and Democrats can agree that there are things that need to \nbe done in this country and that we can do them together. I think that \nwould be a refreshing thing for the American people to see.\n  In the final 5 or 6 weeks of this Congress, we could probably take \nsome advice from the Robert Frost poem, ``Stopping By Woods On A Snowy \nEvening,'' where Robert Frost says:\n\n       The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,\n       But I have promises to keep,\n       And miles to go before I sleep,\n       And miles to go before I sleep.\n\n  We have miles to go before we put this 106th Congress to bed.\n  What are these issues that we must deal with before we finally \nadjourn this Congress?\n  A Patients' Bill of Rights. We have had so much discussion about the \nPatients' Bill of Rights in this Congress, and yet the Patients' Bill \nof Rights languishes in a conference. Month after month after month, \nnothing gets done. I know people have come to the floor of the Senate \nand have said: Gee, we are making progress. But I say the difference \nbetween this conference committee and a glacier is at least a glacier \nmoves an inch or so every decade. This conference committee is not able \nto make progress on a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  It seems to me, in the Senate and the House we must say to this \nconference: We want to have a real Patients' Bill of Rights brought to \nthe floor of the Senate and the House and passed.\n  I have told stories in relation to this on the floor of the Senate. \nIt is probably useful to recount at least one story again as an example \nof why we need a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  A woman fell off a cliff in the Shenandoah mountains. After having \nfallen off the cliff, she was rendered unconscious, with broken bones, \nwith a concussion. Being unconscious, she was\n\n[[Page S7961]]\n\ntaken by ambulance to an emergency room in a hospital. She was rolled \nin on a gurney, unconscious. She survived. She had very significant \ninjuries, but she survived.\n  Following that ordeal, she was released from the hospital to be told \nthat her emergency room expenses would not be covered by the managed \ncare organization because she did not have prior approval for emergency \nroom treatment.\n  This is someone who was hauled into the emergency room on a gurney, \nunconscious. She was in a coma. She was told by the insurance company: \nYou did not have prior approval for emergency room treatment.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights is very simple. It says: A patient ought \nto have the right to know all of their medical options for treatment, \nnot just the cheapest. A patient ought to have the right to emergency \nroom treatment when they have an emergency. There are a whole series of \nrights that patients ought to have when dealing with their managed care \norganization.\n\n  There was the woman who cried one day at a hearing that I held with \nmy colleague from Nevada as she held up a picture of her 16-year-old \nson who had died. She told us that on her son's deathbed he said to \nher: Mom, how can they do this to a kid like me? Through tears, she \nheld up the picture of her young son who had died who had said: Mom, \nhow can they do this to a kid like me?\n  That situation had forced this kid and his family to fight the \ninsurance company to get the treatment he needed. They failed. He died. \nThis was a kid who was told to fight cancer and fight the insurance \ncompany at the same time. That is unfair. That is not a fair fight.\n  You ought not have to fight cancer and your managed care organization \nto get the treatment you need. That is the point. We need to pass a \nreal Patients' Bill of Rights. We have not done that. There are lots of \nexcuses for it, but we need to get it done. We need to get it done now.\n  We need to add a prescription drug benefit for senior citizens on the \nMedicare program. We all know that. If we were to write the Medicare \nprogram today, there is no question we would have a prescription drug \nbenefit in the program. But 30 years ago, 40 years ago when the \nMedicare program was created, most of the lifesaving drugs we have \ntoday did not exist. They do now. Each senior citizen needs access to \nthose drugs.\n  Last year, the cost of prescription drugs increased 16 percent in \nthis country. All too often the prescription drugs--the miracle drugs--\nthey need are out of their reach because of their inability to pay for \nthem. We need to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare \nprogram. We can do that, and should do that.\n  We ought to raise the minimum wage. The folks at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder in this country have not kept up. We need to help them \nas well. Increasingly, they are women trying to raise families in \nsingle-parent households. We need to increase the minimum wage. We \nshould do that. We can do that.\n  We ought to write a new farm bill. Everybody understands the current \nfarm bill has failed. My feeling is, if we have the opportunity--and we \nshould have the opportunity--in this Congress to write a new farm bill, \nwe ought to be able to provide a decent safety net for those out there \non America's farms who are struggling to make a living.\n  These issues and others--school modernization, fixing what is wrong \nin education--all of these things we can do, and should do. We only \nhave 5 or 6 weeks remaining. I hope all of us, in the spirit of \nbipartisanship, can decide these are the issues, these are the things \nthat are important to the American people, these are the things that \nwill strengthen our country.\n  Yes, we have miles to go before we sleep, but we have the \nopportunity, in this setting, in this democracy, to make these \ndecisions for the benefit of the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

AUBURN\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is good to be back in the Chamber again. \nI have enjoyed a month of traveling around Wyoming. I know that our \nentire delegation was there on a number of occasions. We met at \ndifferent places across the State as we listened to the people of the \nState to see what sorts of things they felt were important to our State \nand our Nation.\n  I have to mention that at the end of that trip, of course, there was \nsome football. We are back in that season again. I have to explain the \ntie that I am wearing today. It is probably bright enough for anybody \nin the Chamber to be able to read it. Last Thursday night, the opening \ngame for the University of Wyoming Cowboys and the Auburn War Eagles \ntook place on ESPN. Many people might have seen it. I have to say that \nthe Auburn Tigers--now called the War Eagles--were extremely \nimpressive. It, obviously, is an educational institution of higher \nlearning, and they did teach Wyoming a few lessons. At the end of the \ngame, Wyoming almost came back. They got a little overconfident and \nthey got one touchdown behind and wound up losing. Therefore, today, I \nwill be wearing an Auburn tie and making some comments about the fine \nprogram they have at Auburn.\n  I did get to teach part of an MBA class for executives who came in \nfrom all over the United States to learn about the business of this \ncountry and how to better perform in business. It is a rather unique \nclass. It has wider participation than most, and people are required to \nhave 8 years of experience before they can take the class. So it was a \ndifferent level of master of business administration candidates than a \nperson normally gets to talk to--again, absorbing some of the lessons \nthey are learning through the questions that they ask.\n  I was very impressed with the university and the special programs \nthey are offering. Of course, I had to be very impressed with their \nteam. I am now one of the biggest supporters of Auburn outside of the \nState of Alabama, hoping they go undefeated in the rest of the season, \nhelping Wyoming in their power index and, of course, I hope Wyoming \ndoesn't lose another game this year. I am confident, because of the \nlevel of competition involved in this game, that that will be the case. \nI am proud of the players at the University of Wyoming, and I look \nforward to a very entertaining year, as well as one of great production \nas they learn their lessons so they can be the ones who take over the \njobs of this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S7961-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7961-S7962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMPLETING THE WORK OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have to add a few comments to what was \npreviously said about needing to move forward because I sincerely \nbelieve we need to move forward with the work of the Senate.\n  The biggest work we have before us is finishing the appropriations \nbills--$1.7 trillion of spending--and we ought to spend a few minutes \ndebating that. If you will recall, before we left, one of the \ndifficulties we were having was even getting the opportunity to debate \nthose bills; There were filibusters prohibiting the right to debate the \nbills--extremely long filibusters. That was debate in itself, but it \ndidn't allow the work of the Senate to proceed to appropriate the $1.7 \ntrillion. We need to pass the bills, get them brought up; we need to \nhave them discussed and have relevant amendments put on the bills. We \nneed to get that work out of the way first.\n  I can't help but comment a little on the Patients' Bill of Rights. \nThe conference committee has been working on that. They were making \ngreat progress until it looked as if it might not be an issue anymore. \nThen it was brought up for a vote again and again using the original \nversion, not the\n\n[[Page S7962]]\n\ncompromise version that had been worked out over a long period of very \ndifficult work.\n  So we have a choice: We can have issues or we can have solutions. It \njust takes the two sides getting together and moving forward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate and House will be returning to business this \nweek in Washington, DC. The important question is, What did we learn in \nAugust?\n  As we went home to our States and spoke to families across Illinois \nand other States represented in this body, the question was whether the \nMembers of the U.S. Senate will return with the resolve to do \nsomething.\n  You see, for the last several years, the Senate has done virtually \nnothing when it comes to the important issues facing working families \nacross America. The families I met in Illinois during the month of \nAugust were, I guess, almost unanimous in their belief that this \nCongress should waste no time in enacting a meaningful prescription \ndrug benefit under Medicare. I no longer have to give the speech about \nMedicare and prescription drugs. The audience gives it to me. They say: \nSenator, did you know if you cross the border and go into Canada, you \ncan buy the same drugs at half the price? I say: Yes, I was about to \ntell you that. They say: Did you know people are paying more if they \nare elderly or disabled than virtually any other group in America? I \nsay: Yes, I was about to tell you that, too.\n\n  The audience gives you the speech before you can deliver it. Then \nthey ask the most important question: If you know all this, why haven't \nyou done anything? Why hasn't this Congress enacted a prescription drug \nbenefit under Medicare? The truth is that the pharmaceutical companies \nhave come to the Congress with their special interests and powerful \nlobbyists and they have stopped us cold. The Republican leadership in \nthe House and the Senate has basically tried to keep the pharmaceutical \ncompanies happy and the insurance companies happy and have said they \nwill trust the insurance companies to provide protection to American \nfamilies. Well, I can't even say that with a straight face in Illinois \nbecause families there know that when you leave it up to insurance \ncompanies and it comes to medical care, you don't get the best \ndecisions; you get decisions driven by the bottom line for the profit \nmargin.\n  So those of us on the Democratic side want to give our friends on the \nRepublican side one last chance before the election to vote for a \nmeaningful prescription drug benefit under Medicare that is universal, \nwhich will apply to everybody, as Medicare applies to everybody. \nInstead, of course, the Republicans want to talk about an estate tax \nbreak for the wealthiest Americans--a tax cut of a trillion dollars; \nand, 40 percent of it or more will go to those making over $300,000 a \nyear. After you have spent the trillion dollars on a tax cut for the \nwealthy, there is not much left to take care of prescription drug \nbenefits under Medicare. There is very little, if any, money left to \nhelp families pay for college education.\n  I was at several universities across Illinois talking about a \nproposal on the Democratic side--one that Vice President Gore \nsupports--to give a college tax credit or a deduction for families. \nThat is what families talk about.\n  ``It is a lovely baby. He looks like his dad. He has been sleeping \nall night. How are we going to pay for his college?'' That is what you \nhear when you go to a nursery and look at a new infant. It is a \nlegitimate concern.\n  We on the Democratic side of the aisle believe that if we are going \nto have any tax cuts, we should target them to the needs of American \nfamilies--the need to pay for college education and for training. The \ndeductibility of $12,000 a year in tuition and fees can have a dramatic \nimpact on families.\n  The Republican leadership just doesn't buy it. They think if there is \nto be a tax cut, it has to go to the wealthiest people in America. I \nthink it should go to the hardest working people in America--those who \ndeserve it the most, not the least. Those are the families who get up \nand go to work every day to try to put their kids through school and \nwho try to make this a better country.\n  That will be the debate you will hear over the next several weeks. If \nit sounds reminiscent of what you are hearing from the Presidential \ncampaign trail, it is because there is a clear difference between the \ntwo major candidates for President. There is a clear difference between \nthe parties on the floor.\n\n  We on the Democratic side are going to plead with the Republicans to \ngive us four or five votes so we can pass a prescription drug benefit \nunder Medicare, and targeted tax cuts to pay for college education \nexpenses so people can have a deduction--so when they have long-term \ncare for an aging parent, they can take care of that parent or \ngrandparent, and an additional tax credit for day care so people going \nto work can leave their kids in a safe environment.\n  These are the real family issues. The Republicans have not really \nlistened closely.\n  I hope that Republicans, as they left the Philadelphia convention in \nAugust and watched what happened in the national debate at the \nPresidential level, understand that we really face a serious need in \nthis country in helping families. It is not enough anymore to argue \nthat the wealthy are getting wealthier. Working families want help, \ntoo, so their parents and grandparents can pay for prescription drugs \nand take care of the necessities of life.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in these last few weeks of this Congress, \nthere is much to be done. I would like to focus this morning on our \nconstitutional responsibility to confirm judges.\n  Virginia is one of the five states covered by the Fourth Circuit for \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals. Today, one third of the seats on the Fourth \nCircuit are vacant. One seat on the bench has been vacant for ten \nyears--longer than any other seat in the country. The U.S. Judicial \nConference has called filling that seat a ``judicial emergency,'' and \nChief Justice William Rehnquist has warned that ``vacancies cannot \nremain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of \njustice that traditionally has been associated with the federal \njudiciary.''\n  One reason for the high number of vacancies on the Fourth Circuit is \nthe claim that the appellate court doesn't need any more judges. Those \nwho oppose filling the vacancies argue that having more judges will \nmake decision-making more cumbersome and difficult, and that keeping \nthe number small leads to more efficient deliberations.\n  The problem with this argument is that it substitutes ``efficiency'' \nfor ``justice'' in our judicial system. Certainly it would be more \nefficient to have criminal cases decided by one juror instead of \ntwelve, but our Founding Fathers wisely determined that a variety of \nviews in the jury room would be more likely to yield a result that was \n``right,'' and ``fair''. It's the same reason our Supreme Court is made \nup of nine jurists, instead of one. And it is difficult to believe that \njustice is being served fully in a circuit that hears oral argument on \nonly 23 percent of its\n\n[[Page S7963]]\n\ncases--the lowest percentage of any other circuit--and dismisses 87 \npercent of its appeals in brief, unsigned opinions according to the \nWashington Post. While efficiency is laudable, justice is the goal.\n  On June 30, 2000, the President nominated Roger Gregory to fill the \nvacancy on the Fourth Circuit that has been open for a decade. Roger \nGregory is a highly qualified and well respected attorney from \nRichmond, Virginia. He graduated summa cum laude from Virginia State \nUniversity and received his J.D. from the University of Michigan. He \nhas an extensive federal practice, is an accomplished attorney, and was \ndescribed by Commonwealth Magazine as one of Virginia's ``Top 25 Best \nand Brightest.''\n  When he is confirmed, Roger Gregory will fill the longest-standing \nvacancy in the nation. He will bring energy and insight to the Fourth \nCircuit. In addition, as an African-American, he will bring much-needed \ndiversity to the bench.\n  The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals does not look like America, and \nit never has. No African-American has ever served on the Fourth \nCircuit. In fact, it is the only circuit court in the nation without \nminority representation.\n  This should trouble all of us. Justice cannot be served without a \ndiversity of views and experiences expressed in the rooms where \ndecisions are made.\n  As the Supreme Court noted when it barred discrimination in the \nselection of juries, the exclusion of minorities or women from the \ndeliberative process removes ``qualities of human nature and varieties \nof human experience, the range of which is unknown or perhaps \nunknowable.''\n  The absence of minority representation on the Fourth Circuit is \nespecially troubling, however, since the Fourth Circuit has the largest \npercentage of African-Americans of any circuit in the nation. In our \ncircuit, twenty-three percent of our population is African-American. \nYet not one of the judges on the Fourth Circuit is African-American. \nMr. President, it's time for a change. In fact, it's past time.\n  There have been several efforts in the past to integrate this \ncircuit, but these efforts have been blocked. The Administration has \ntried since 1995 to integrate this circuit, but the ``blue slips'' for \nthese nominees simply weren't returned, effectively thwarting those \nnominees.\n  I have argued for years that Virginia deserves another seat on the \nbench. Finally late last fall, we in Virginia were given an opportunity \nto fill one of the vacancies. We seized the opportunity and after an \nextensive and thorough search and vetting process--including time-\nconsuming ABA screenings and FBI background checks--Roger Gregory was \nnominated by the Administration. We now have a chance to correct this \ngross inequity on the Fourth Circuit. Roger Gregory has the support of \nboth Senators from Virginia.\n  There is time to move this nominee. Immediately before we began our \nAugust recess, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing and three judges \nwere voted out of the Committee just six days after they were \nnominated. Of the last 12 judges confirmed by the Senate, 11 were \nconfirmed within three months of nomination.\n  In 1992, another presidential election year in which the White House \nwas controlled by one party and the Senate by another, Senate Democrats \nconfirmed 66 nominees to the federal bench. Eleven of those were \nCircuit Court judges, and six of the Circuit Court judges were \nconfirmed later than July of that year. Three were confirmed in August, \ntwo in September, and one in October.\n  And presidential candidate George W. Bush has called on the Senate to \napprove judicial nominees within 60 days. The sixty days for Roger \nGregory passed on August 30. It is time to grant Mr. Gregory the \ncourtesy of a hearing.\n  The late, renowned Judge Spotswood Robinson integrated the D.C. \nCircuit in 1966. He, too, came from Richmond, Virginia. It is time for \nanother Richmonder, Roger Gregory, to break another barrier. We have \nalready waited too long.\n  I urge the Judiciary Committee to move the nomination of Roger \nGregory, and grant him a hearing.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S7963-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, with deep respect, I ask unanimous consent \nto yield first to the distinguished chairman, Mr. Roth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina for his usual courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 4444 and to pass this legislation without \namendment. Our vote on normalizing trade relations with China will mark \nthe most significant vote we take in this Congress. Indeed, it will be \none of the most important votes we will take during our time in the \nSenate.\n  At the outset, I want to be clear--because of PNTR's significance and \nbecause we have so little time left before the 106th Congress adjourns, \nI will oppose all amendments to PNTR, regardless of their merit.\n  The House bill takes the one essential step that we must take to \nensure that American workers, American farmers and American businesses \nreap the benefits of China's market access commitments.\n  There is nothing that we can add to this bill that will improve upon \nits guarantee that our exporters benefit from the agreement it took \nthree Presidents of both parties 13 years to negotiate with the \nChinese.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in adopting this approach because the \nrisks of going to conference on this bill, in this political season, \nare too great. Bluntly, a vote to amend is a vote to kill this bill \nand, with it, any chance that U.S. workers, farmers, and businesses \nwill benefit from China's accession to the WTO.\n  The significance of this vote is due both to the economic benefits \nthat will flow from opening China's market to our exports and the \nbroader impact that normalizing our trade will have on our relationship \nwith China. I want to address each of those points in turn.\n  Let me clarify, first, what this debate is about. The vote on PNTR is \nnot a vote about whether China will get into the World Trade \nOrganization, as some have said. I assure you that China will get into \nthe WTO whether we vote to normalize our trade relations with China or \nnot.\n  What this vote is about, as I indicated at the outset, is whether \nAmerican manufacturers, farmers, service providers, and workers will \nget the benefits of a deal that American negotiators under three \nPresidents of both parties fought for 13 years to achieve. Or, will we \nsimply concede the benefits of that deal to their European and Japanese \ncompetitors for the Chinese market?\n  As I explained just prior to the August recess, my reason for \nsupporting this legislation is first and foremost because of the \nbenefits that normalizing trade with China will offer my constituents \nback home in Delaware.\n  China is already an important market for firms, farmers, and workers \nlocated in my state. Delaware's exports to China in many product \ncategories nearly doubled between 1993 and 1998. Delaware's trade with \nChina now exceeds $70 million.\n\n[[Page S7964]]\n\n  What China's accession to the WTO means to Delaware is a dramatic \nfurther opening of China's markets to goods and services that are \ncritical to Delaware's economy. China, for example, is already the \nsecond leading market for American poultry products worldwide.\n  Poultry producers in Delaware and elsewhere have built that market in \nthe face of both quotas and high tariffs. China's accession to the WTO \nwill mean that the tariffs Delaware poultry producers face will be cut \nin half, from 20 to 10 percent, and quotas that now limit their access \nto the Chinese market will be eliminated.\n  Normalizing our trade relations with China will also make a huge \ndifference to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries which make up \na significant share of my state's manufacturing base.\n  In the chemical sector alone, China has agreed to eliminate quotas on \nchemical products by 2002 and will cut its tariffs on American chemical \nexports by more than one-half.\n  Delaware is also home to two automobile manufacturing plants, one \nChrysler and one Saturn. Once in the WTO, China will be obliged to cut \ntariffs on automobiles by up to 70 percent and on auto parts by more \nthan one-half.\n  The agreement also ensures that U.S. automobile manufacturers will be \nable to sell directly to consumers in China and finance those sales \ndirectly as our auto companies do here in the United States.\n  What holds true for Delaware holds true for the country as a whole. \nIndependent economic analysis by Goldman Sachs suggests that the \npackage may mean an increase of as much as $13 billion annually in U.S. \nexports to China. That's right--$13 billion annually.\n  What that figure reflects is that China's accession to the WTO will \nbenefit every sector of the U.S. economy from agriculture to \nmanufacturing to services.\n  Agriculture tariffs will be cut by more than half on priority \nproducts life beef, pork, and poultry. China will also eliminate many \nof the barriers to sales of bulk commodities such as wheat, corn, and \nrice.\n  Industrial tariffs would be slashed across the board by more than \none-half--from an average rate of 24 percent to 9 percent. Equally \nimportant, American exporters will be able to sell directly to Chinese \nconsumers and avoid the restrictions imposed on their sales by the \nstate-owned enterprises they must currently use to distribute their \nproducts in China.\n  The deal will create broad new access for Americans services like \ntelecommunications, banking and insurance. In particular, I want to \nstress that China not only agreed to open its market to new ventures in \nthe banking and insurance areas but agreed to grandfather the existing \nhard-won market access that American financial service firms have \nalready achieved. I expect those obligations to be met fully by the \nChinese.\n  The agreement also provides unprecedented safeguards to American \nmanufacturers here at home. The agreement reached this past November \npermits the United States to invoke a country-specific safeguard \nagainst imports from China that may disrupt our markets. In addition, \nthe agreement allows the United States to apply special rules regarding \nunfair pricing practices by Chinese firms for 15 years after the \nagreement goes into force.\n  The agreement even addresses a concern that has been raised by many \nconcerned with the efforts of China to convert U.S. technology to \nmilitary uses. The WTO agreement specifically obliges China to end the \npractice of demanding that American firms cough up their manufacturing \ntechnology as a condition of exporting to or investing in the Chinese \nmarket.\n  Significantly, the agreement and China's accession to the WTO gives \nthe United States rights against Chinese trade practices that we do not \ncurrently enjoy. It also ensures that the United States has a forum in \nwhich it will benefit from the support of the rest of China's WTO \ntrading partners should disputes over China's obligations arise.\n  In the Finance Committee we devoted many hours to consultations with \nthe President and his representatives as the negotiations proceeded.\n  We devoted an equal number of hours to a review of the agreement \nfinally reached this past November. I believe I can speak for my \ncolleagues on the committee in saying that there was overwhelming \nsupport for the agreement so ably negotiated by Ambassador Barshefsky.\n  That support is warranted not only by the terms of the agreement but \nby the testimony we heard and the support expressed from a broad and \ndiverse spectrum of U.S. interests.\n  The agreement was supported not only by U.S. businesses, American \nfarmers, and groups representing virtually every sector of the U.S. \neconomy. The agreement garnered the support of Presidents from Gerald \nFord to George Bush, former Secretaries of State and Treasury, and an \nimpressive array of national security specialists from Richard Perle to \nGeneral Colin Powell all of whom underscored the importance of China's \naccession to the WTO and normalizing our trade relations with China as \ngood not only in economic terms but in strategic terms as well.\n  The testimony before the Finance Committee left little doubt that \nChina's reemergence as a world power presents challenges to the world \ncommunity and to U.S. interests. But, the testimony before the \ncommittee was unequivocal on one point--that our interests are best \nserved by drawing China into that community of nations, rather than \nisolating China from that community through restrictions on trade.\n  General Powell said it best in his public statement on PNTR, \nindicating that--\n\n       * * * from every standpoint--from the strategic standpoint, \n     from the standpoint of our national interests, from the \n     standpoint of our trading and economic interests--it serves \n     all of our purposes to grant permanent normal trading \n     relations to China.\n\n  Opponents of this legislation have often tried to downplay the \nimportance of normalizing our trade relations with China. They argued \nthat we are entitled to the benefit of the WTO agreement based on our \nbilateral trade arrangements with China dating back to 1979. They argue \nthat we will suffer no competitive disadvantage if we fail to take the \nsteps necessary on our end to comply with our own WTO obligations.\n  I want to lay that argument to rest. That argument was contradicted \nby Ambassador Barshefsky, by our own legal counsel, and by every trade \nexpert consulted by the Finance Committee.\n  However, just to make sure, my distinguished colleague and the \nranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator Moynihan and I, \ntogether with the chairman and ranking member of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee, specifically put that question to the General \nAccounting Office.\n  The GAO has had a team following the WTO negotiations with the \nChinese closely for several years. We asked them for their assessment \nof the terms of the agreement and whether we could rely on our 1979 \nagreement to obtain the benefits of China's accession to the WTO.\n  The GAO, in testimony before the committee and in a report it \nreleased prior to House passage of PNTR, concluded that the 1979 \nbilateral arrangement would not guarantee the rights three Presidents \nof both parties spent 13 years negotiating with the Chinese.\n  According to the GAO, the essential step in obtaining the benefits of \nChina's accession to the WTO was the passage of PNTR. Indeed, the GAO \nemphasized that failure to approve PNTR would ``put U.S. business \ninterests at a considerable competitive disadvantage'' in the Chinese \nmarket.\n  In other words, the single step we must take to obtain the benefits \nof the Chinese agreement to open their markets is the passage of H.R. \n4444.\n  In light of that fact, let me turn briefly to an explanation of the \nlegislation before us. The bill authorizes the President to normalize \nour trade relations with China when China has completed the WTO \naccession process provided that the terms of China's accession are \nequivalent to those negotiated this past November.\n  That action will assure that American firms, farmers, and workers \nwill receive the benefit of the bargain Ambassador Barshefsky struck \nwith China.\n  But, the House bill does considerably more to ensure that we get the \nbenefit of our bargain and more to address\n\n[[Page S7965]]\n\nmany of the concerns that opponents of this legislation have raised \nregarding China's human rights practices and more to encourage the \ndevelopment of political pluralism in China.\n  On the trade front, the House bill provides for the aggressive \nmonitoring of China's compliance with its WTO obligations and the \nenforcement of U.S. rights under the WTO agreement.\n  The bill would offer particular help to small- and medium-size \nbusinesses, and to workers, in making use of the remedies available \nunder U.S. law to address any violations of U.S. WTO rights or to \naddress any unfair Chinese trade practices.\n  In addition, the House bill implements the special safeguard \nmechanism that was a part of the November agreement. In effect, the \nbill provides the counterpart in domestic law to the provisions of the \nbilateral agreement that offer import-sensitive industries in the \nUnited States protection in any dramatic surge in imports from China \nthat disrupt U.S. markets.\n  The bill also addresses a concern that I am sure all of us share with \nrespect to Taiwan's economic future. Taiwan has applied for admission \nto the World Trade Organization and its accession process is \nessentially complete.\n  The House bill expresses the sense of Congress that the WTO should \napprove Taiwan's accession to the WTO at the same time that it approves \nChina's. As a matter of WTO rules, there is no need to debate Taiwan's \ndesignation or its relationship to China. The WTO rules permit the \naccession of Taiwan regardless of its designation.\n  China has long provided assurances that it would not stand in the way \nof Taiwan's accession at the same time China itself enters the WTO, and \nI expect China to live up to those assurances, just as the House bill \nmakes clear.\n  Apart from securing the trade benefits of China's accession to the \nWTO, the House bill represents an important step forward on the issues \nof human rights, internationally-agreed labor standards, and religious \nfreedom.\n  In an innovative approach, the bill would create a commission made up \nof members of both the Congress and the executive branch, modeled on \nthe successful domestic counterpart to the Helsinki Commission on human \nrights, to monitor Chinese practices in those areas, as well as the \ndevelopment of the rule of law and democracy.\n  One of the significant advantages of the approach adopted by the \nHouse bill is that it ensures a constructive, ongoing review of China's \npractices throughout the year, rather than what has become an \nunproductive once-a-year effort tied to a congressional vote.\n  More fundamentally, the commission will ensure that the United \nStates' concerns and our message to the Chinese leadership regarding \nChinese human rights practices is undiluted by a debate over whether to \nrenew China's trade status.\n  There are some who have suggested that the bill should have gone \nfarther. They suggest that the bill should have empowered the proposed \ncommission to address national security concerns as well.\n  Those concerns, however, have been mooted by the recent action taken \nby the Senate in the context of the Defense authorization bill. I \ncongratulate my distinguished colleagues, Senators Warner, Levin, and \nByrd, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the committee's \nranking member, and one of the most senior members of that panel, for \nproposing the creation of a separate commission to look at precisely \nthose issues of national security and the link between those issues and \nour expanding trade relationship with China.\n  In sum, the House bill preserves what we in the Finance Committee \nsought to do in the bill we reported out, which was to ensure that \nAmerican firms, farmers, and workers gain the benefits of the agreement \nreached this past November, and take additional steps to secure those \ntrade benefits and offers a new approach to addressing U.S. concerns \nregarding human rights practices in China.\n  I believe that H.R. 4444 not only merits our support, but that it \nstrikes a careful and appropriate balance of the interests we have in \nour broader relationship with China.\n  For that reason, I intend not only to support the legislation as \ndrafted, but, as I said at the outset, I will oppose any amendment to \nthe House bill no matter how meritorious the amendment might be \nstanding on its own.\n  That brings me to my final point. There are a number of my colleagues \nthat see this vote as an opportunity to link other issues to our \ntrading relationship with China.\n  I am certain that we will have the opportunity to debate amendments \non everything from the release of political prisoners to China's \nimplementation of a one-child policy to its recurring threats against \nTaiwan to issuers of weapons proliferation. I respect my colleagues' \npoint of view and recognize that these are serious issues that should \nremain a part of the broader dialog with China on our bilateral \nrelations.\n  What I fundamentally disagree with is the approach of linking \nprogress in those areas to our trade with China.\n  I do so for three reasons. First, the approach of linking progress to \nour trading relations with China has proved to be a failure. We have \ntried the approach of linking progress in other areas, such as human \nrights, to trade and it simply has not worked. It is time to try a \ndifferent approach.\n  Second, the threat of economic sanctions would only work if the \ntarget country believes that there is something fundamental at risk. \nHere, I want us to think through the logic of voting ``no'' on PNTR. \nThe net effect of a ``no'' vote on PNTR would be to cut off U.S. \nexports to China.\n  China already has access to our market. We do not enjoy reciprocal \naccess to China's market. That is what the WTO agreement provides. In \nvoting ``no'' on PNTR, we would only be voting to deny ourselves the \nbenefits of the WTO agreement to American firms, farmers, and workers.\n  Denying ourselves the benefit of the WTO agreement is simply no \nthreat to the Chinese. They will simply obtain the goods, services, and \ntechnology they want from other WTO members.\n  In other words, even if you accepted the logic of economic sanctions, \nvoting ``no'' on PNTR does not serve the objective of modifying China's \nbehavior or the views of its leadership.\n  Finally, there are some who decry the pursuit of profit when issues \nof human rights and human freedoms are at stake. While I share their \nconcerns for human rights conditions in China, I feel compelled to say \nthat they are wrong and their criticisms are misplaced.\n  In the end, human freedom is indivisible. It is not neatly divided \nbetween political freedom and economic freedom, as some suggest. \nEconomic freedom is freedom, pure and unadulterated. The reason is \nthat, absent economic freedom, no person has the wherewithal to defend \ntheir political rights.\n  What that means in practical terms in the context of modern China is \nthat we should do whatever we can to empower the Chinese people to \npursue their own course toward freedom.\n  One essential step toward that goal is to ensure that the Chinese \npeople are free to pursue their own economic destiny free from the \nheavy hand of the state. That is because the roots of political \npluralism lie in economic interests that differ from those of the \nChinese Communist Government and those of the Chinese leadership.\n  The noted Chinese human rights activist Fu Sheni, active in defense \nof Chinese human rights and political freedoms since the 1979 Democracy \nWall Movement, has made this point more eloquently than I can.\n  In a public statement on PNTR, Fu emphasized that:\n\n       The annual argument over NTR renewal exerts no genuine \n     pressure on the Chinese Communists and performs absolutely no \n     role in compelling them to improve the human rights \n     situation. . . . [I]mprovement of the human rights situation \n     and advancement of democracy in China must mainly depend on \n     the greatness of the Chinese people, in the process of \n     economic modernization, gradually creating the popular \n     citizen consciousness and democratic conscience and \n     struggling for them. It will not be achieved through the \n     action of the U.S. Congress in debating Normal Trade \n     Relations. . . .\n\n  Fu's point was echoed by the China Democracy Party, founded 2 years \nago, in its public statement on PNTR. In declaring its support for \nChina's accession to the WTO and for the normalization of our trade \nrelations with China, the Democracy Party stated:\n\n       We believe the closer the economic relationship between the \n     United States and\n\n[[Page S7966]]\n\n     China, the more chances to politically influence China, the \n     more chances to monitor human rights, and the more effective \n     the United States to push China to launch political reforms.\n\n  The Democracy Party's statement went on to say that the Communist \nleadership's power in China is ``planted in state ownership.'' A vote \nfor PNTR is a vote to end the Communist leadership's monopoly on power \nwithin Chinese society. A vote against PNTR would condemn the Chinese \npeople to work for the state-owned enterprises that are the Communist \nleadership's most effective means of political control.\n  That is why, beyond the economic benefits for my home state of \nDelaware and for our nation as a whole, I support normalizing our trade \nrelations with China. It is a vote for freedom and that is where I will \ncast my lot every time.\n  I thank my colleagues and urge their support for the motion to \nproceed and for passage of this essential legislation.\n  Once again, I thank my distinguished colleague from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from North Carolina is recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I say to my distinguished and long-time \nfriend from Delaware that I seldom disagree with him, but this time I \ndo, and it is a doozy.\n  Madam President, the pending bill, H.R. 4444, which proposes to give \npermanent most-favored-nation trading status to Communist China, is \nperhaps the most ill-advised piece of legislation to come to the Senate \nfloor in my 28 years as a Senator.\n  As the Senate considers this issue, the ultimate question is an \nominous one: Will granting permanent most-favored-nation status to \nCommunist China advance the foreign policy interests of the United \nStates?\n  My genuine conclusion is that by doing so, the United States Senate \nwill be making a mockery of common sense.\n  Now, there is no question that giving permanent most-favored-nation \ntrade status to China may advance the business interests of various \nsectors of the U.S. corporate community. But the Senate, amidst all the \nhigh pressure tactics, must not confuse business interests with the \nnational interest of the American people.\n  America's principal national interest, vis-a-vis mainland China, is \nto seek to democratize China, hoping that China will conduct its \nforeign relations in a civilized fashion, and stop behaving in a rogue \nfashion, as the Chinese Communists have done for the past 50 years.\n  We must dare to ponder the most realistic of questions--for example: \nWill granting permanent most-favored-nation trade status to Communist \nChina persuade its rulers to retreat from their threats to invade \nTaiwan if Taiwan does not negotiate reunification with the Communist \nmainland?\n  Will China all of a sudden cease its relentless military buildup in \nthe Taiwan Strait?\n  Will China halt its brazen land grabs in the Spratly Islands?\n  Will China stop its reckless proliferation of weapons among its \nfellow criminal regimes around the world?\n  Any Senator answering any such questions in the affirmative should \nwait around until the Sugar Plum Fairy dances down Lollipop Lane. The \nfact is, the United States has had normal trade relations with \nCommunist China for the past 20 years. Yet Communist China's behavior \nhas not improved one iota; it has worsened dramatically on every one of \nthese fronts during those two decades of normal trade.\n  Communist China has become more, not less, threatening to Taiwan \nduring the past 20 years. Twenty years ago Communist China was not \nmaking incursions across the maritime boundaries of the Philippines, \nbut today it is arrogantly doing so.\n  Two reports delivered to Congress by the CIA this year make crystal \nclear that China's weapons proliferation continues apace--flatly \ncontradicting testimony by the Clinton State Department in 1999 before \nthe Foreign Relations Committee of which I happen to be chairman.\n  Let's examine further this exotic pig in a poke.\n  As everyone knows--with the possible exception of anybody on a trip \nto the Moon for the past few years--Communist China dramatically \nlowered its threshold for using military force against Taiwan in its \nnotorious White Paper this past February. For years, China has assured \nthat it would invade Taiwan only if Taiwan declared independence. That \nwas preposterous on its face--but now, China says it will invade Taiwan \nif Taiwan merely delays reunification talks with China for too long.\n\n  That is not progress to me, Mr. President; it is instead clearly \ndangerous regression in China's policy toward Taiwan. And guess what. \nIt happened just 3 weeks before the President sent this legislation to \nCapitol Hill.\n  Angry threats against Taiwan have become more frequent and \nincreasingly venomous, both in the Chinese press and from the mouths of \nChinese leaders. Recent headlines in Chinese newspapers have talked of \nsmashing Taiwan and drowning Taiwan in a sea of fire. In a March 28 \narticle in the South China Morning Post, Chinese President Jiang Zemin \nwas quoted as saying ``If we were to take military action, it should be \nsooner rather than later.''\n  The Chinese have also directed those threats at us. China has \nrepeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons against American cities if \nthe U.S. comes to Taiwan's defense. As recently as April 11, an article \nappeared in another Hong Kong paper entitled: ``Nuclear War Will \nCertainly Break Out If The United States Gets Involved''--that is to \nsay, Taiwan.\n  If that attitude is the fruit of normal trade relations with China, \nthen by all means, it is indeed bitter fruit.\n  Lest anyone think that China is merely engaging in bluster, consider \nthis: the year 2000 will mark the 11th straight year that China's \nmilitary budget will increase by double digits. What is China doing \nwith all that money?\n  Well, one thing is a pair of Russian destroyers armed with the \nSunburn missile, which skims the sea at Mach 2.5--about 2,000 miles per \nhour--and has an effective range of 65 miles and can carry nuclear \nwarheads. In answer to a question I asked at a Foreign Relations \nCommittee hearing in February, the Secretary of State replied: ``The \nterminal flight path of the Sunburn makes it very difficult for any \nU.S. defense system, including Aegis, to track and shoot down the \nSunburn.''\n  China began shopping for this missile just after we sent carriers \nnear Taiwan in 1996; China has spent over $2 billion for two destroyers \nand at least thirty-two missiles.\n  Madam President, I doubt that the American people will be heartened \nto know that our $68 billion trade deficit with China helped pay for \nthis latest Chinese threat to American sailors.\n  And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Other Chinese weapons \npurchases (that the American taxpayers are financing through our trade \npolicies) include Russian advanced fighters, air-to-air missiles, and \nsubmarines. Most, if not all, of this weaponry is designed for a Taiwan \nscenario, helping to tip the balance of power in that region further \nand further away from democratic Taiwan and toward the Communists in \nBeijing.\n  This is yet another product of our let's trade-at-any-cost policy \nwith China.\n  That is the reason I am here today to speak against this piece of \nlegislation. It may pass, but it will never do it with my vote or my \nsupport.\n  Madam President, I earlier mentioned increased Chinese aggression in \nthe Spratly Islands. We must bear in mind that, in 1995, China seized \nsome small islands called Mischief Reef in the South China Sea. \nMischief Reef is just 100 miles off the coast of the Philippines and \nover 1,000 miles from the Chinese mainland. With this brazen land grab \nhaving gone unopposed, even verbally, by anyone other than our \nPhilippine allies, China reached out again in late 1998.\n  In October of that year, China began a crash construction project and \nby January of 1999, had replaced some ramshackle huts on Mischief Reef \nwith permanent structures that have been frequented by Chinese warships \nand are deemed as dual-use capable by military experts.\n  Twenty years of annual trade favors to China were not enough to ward \noff these blatant violations of international norms, but I, for one, \nawait with bated breath the day when China\n\n[[Page S7967]]\n\nwithdraws from Mischief Reef because of pressure from the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  Don't hold your breath, Madam President; it's not going to happen.\n  We can also see the absurdity of U.S. policy toward China by taking a \nlook at China's proliferation record. In 1998, President Clinton \ncertified that China could be trusted--let me repeat that.\n  He certified that China could be trusted with our nuclear materials, \npaving the way for the longstanding desire of some U.S. companies to \nexport nuclear reactors to China. Then, in testimony before the Foreign \nRelations Committee in March 1999, Assistant Secretary of State Stanley \nRoth gave China a clean bill of health on proliferation.\n  I am not kidding. That is so.\n  Mr. Roth stated that China had actually become part of the solution \nto proliferation problems.\n  It didn't take long for Assistant Secretary Roth's testimony to be \nexposed as--let me find a gentle word--maybe ``incomplete'' is the \nnicest word I can find. In April 1999, the Washington Times reported \nthat China was continuing its secret transfer of missile and weapons \ntechnology to the Middle East and South Asia. A follow-up story in July \ndetailed China's continuing shipments of missile materials to North \nKorea. These press reports were verified twice this year by none other \nthan the Central Intelligence Agency in its semi-annual proliferation \nreports to Congress.\n  But I guess we are supposed to believe that more trade will solve \nthat sort of problem.\n  But I am not convinced--not by my distinguished friend from Delaware, \nnot by all of the businessmen who have called on me, not by anybody.\n  In sum, Communist China's foreign policy behavior has become \nincreasingly antithetical to U.S. national interests during the past 20 \nyears of so-called ``normal'' trade relations. It is difficult to see \nhow making the status quo permanent will cause any improvement \nwhatsoever.\n  Of course, the direction of China's foreign policy will hinge largely \non whether the Chinese government democratizes and begins to treat its \nown people better than under the existing Communist regime.\n  All of us know the horror stories of things perpetuated against the \nChinese people by their own government. But here again, the record of \nengagement--or shall I state it more clearly, appeasement--has yielded \nmiserable results.\n\n  In fact, China was somewhat more inclined toward reform 15 years ago \nthan it is today. In the mid-and-late 1980s, China's leadership at \nleast express some sympathy for reform, and for the students and others \nwho were demanding it. But these reforms were ousted, replaced by \nhardline Stalinists who massacred the students and began a decade-long \ncampaign of brutal repression. You can't describe it any way otherwise. \nSenator Wellstone and I will have more to say about human rights in \nChina at a later time, but I believe the U.S. State Department's 1999 \nHuman Rights Report says it all.\n  This is not Jesse Helms. This is the State Department of the United \nStates of America. And the last time I checked it was under the purview \nof a fellow named Bill Clinton.\n  The State Department said:\n\n       The Chinese Government's poor human rights record \n     deteriorated markedly throughout the past year, as the \n     Government intensified efforts to suppress dissent.\n\n  Do you want to hear that again?\n  The State Department of the United States said: ``The Chinese \nGovernment's poor human rights record deteriorated markedly throughout \nthe past year, as the Government''--meaning the Chinese Government--\n``intensified efforts to suppress dissent.''\n  Many supporters of this legislation, if not most, insist that the way \nto improve this miserable situation is to reward Communist China with \npermanent most-favored-nation trade status. Madam President, I find \nabsolutely no evidence whatsoever to support such an assertion.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIdaho is recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, thank you very much.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Moynihan follow me to make his \nopening statement on PNTR, and that he use such time as he may consume \nfor that statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S7967-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7967-S7974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FOREST FIRES\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I asked for time in our schedule today so \nthat I might be joined with other Western Senators and those Senators \nconcerned about the catastrophic fires that have been sweeping across \npublic lands in the West for the last month and a half.\n  Coincidentally, today is the first day of school across our Nation. \nMany of our children in elementary schools are going to be asked by \ntheir teachers: What did you do during your summer vacation? For the \nnext few moments, I will suggest to you that this is my opening speech \nfollowing my summer vacation. Let me tell you what I did during my \nsummer vacation.\n  I went home to my beautiful State of Idaho and watched it burn--\nhundreds of thousands of acres of timberland, grassland, wild habitat, \nand environmentally sensitive land burned with catastrophic fires that \nwere too dangerous, too hot, and too powerful to put firefighters in \nthe face of to try to stop them and protect these beautiful natural \nresources.\n  In fact, I never thought I would return to Washington, DC, in search \nof clean air. But it is true. The air is cleaner over our Nation's \nCapital today than it is in my beautiful State of Idaho, or Montana, or \nthose Great Basin States of the West that are known for spaciousness, \nvistas, and clean air.\n  This year's fire season may well prove to be the worst in half a \ncentury. All of our 11 Western States, as well as Kansas, Arkansas, \nOklahoma, and Texas, are reporting very high and extreme fire danger \nlevels today.\n  As I speak, large fires are actively burning in California, Colorado, \nFlorida--a little less so in Idaho today because it rained during the \nnight, and it rained over the weekend. But it is true in Louisiana and \nMississippi--a little less true in Montana because of that same \nrainstorm--Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South \nDakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming.\n  The map I have to my left demonstrates the character and the \nwidespread nature of these fires. It isn't coincidental, nor is it \nunique, that most of these fires would be found on public lands--land \nmanaged by Federal land management agencies of this Government.\n  As of last week, the National Interagency Fire Center reports that 81 \nlarge fires are burning presently, covering nearly 1.7 million acres of \nland. The acres burned year to date exceed 6.5 million acres \nnationwide. That is over twice the 10-year average to date.\n  The reason I keep using the word ``to date'' is because we are now in \nthe early days of September, and normal fire seasons will run late into \nSeptember--and even later into October in California and other places \ndown toward and including the Southwest. The total number of fires on \npublic lands has surpassed 74,000. Let me repeat that: 74,000 fires on \npublic lands. That is almost 13,000 fires higher than the 10-year \naverage.\n\n  Nationally, wildfires this year have burned an area larger than our \nneighboring State to the District, Maryland. In other words, envision \nthe entire State of Maryland charred by fire. That is how many acres \nhave been consumed by fire in our Nation this year.\n  There are roughly 26,000 firefighters battling wildfires. We have run \nout of trained firefighters and are preparing 550 new Army troops to \nassist fire crews. This is in addition to over 2,000 soldiers already \ndeployed to fire crews nationwide, as well as firefighters from 3 \ndifferent foreign countries--Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. All of \nthe personnel fighting fires deserve our heartfelt thanks for their \nefforts and their dedication. And yes, we have also lost lives of \nfirefighters.\n  Current estimates suggest that nearly $120 million was spent in \nAugust alone fighting wildfires. The National Interagency Fire Center \nin Boise reports it is spending $18 million a day on fire suppression \nand related efforts. Last week, the Federal Government reported that it \nhas spent $626 million so\n\n[[Page S7968]]\n\nfar on suppression costs this year. The Forest Service budget director \nestimates that wildfire costs this year will exceed $1 billion in \ntotal. This estimate assumes that the fire season ends in the normal \nframework I have discussed. However, the fires that are currently \nburning probably will not be extinguishable by man. They will have to \nwait for the snow to fall this winter or late fall or for major storms \nto move in the normal winter cycle.\n  It is hard to believe that to be a true statement, but it is a true \nstatement that in the heartlands of our wilderness, our public lands \nwhere these fires will continue to smolder, to flare up during the hot \ndays of the late fall, it will take a snowstorm in the heart of Idaho \nto put out these kinds of fires.\n  On Wednesday, August 30, President Clinton granted Montana Governor \nMarc Racicot's request that Montana be declared a Federal disaster \narea. On Thursday of last week, my Governor, Dirk Kempthorne, asked \nPresident Clinton to declare Idaho a disaster area, and he has. And I \nexpect likely declarations coming soon from others.\n  In a fire season as bad as the one we are now experiencing, it is \nundeniable we would be seeing a significant area burn. Indeed, the \nGeneral Accounting Office has warned in a series of reports that there \nare 39 million acres of Federal lands at risk right now of uncontrolled \ncatastrophic wildfire. Therefore, the severity of this season should \nnot have been a surprise to anyone, nor should we have stood by saying \nthis is a natural situation.\n  Ten years ago, a group of foresters and renowned national \nsilviculturists met in Sun Valley, ID, to study the character of the \nforests of the Great Basin of the West. They said at that time that \nthose forests were in severe need of active management because they \nwere nearly dead or dying from disease and bug kill and that if we \ndidn't pursue an active management policy, these forests would be at \nrisk of catastrophic fire.\n  That was 10 years ago. Since that time, I and others have asked the \nGeneral Accounting Office to study the state of our forests, only to be \nreminded that what has happened this year would happen if we were not \nactively involved. However, over the last 3 weeks we have heard a \nseries of news stories that call into question whether the Federal \nfirefighting agencies have been adequately funded, staffed, and \nprepared to deal with the fire risk that we all knew existed and that \nwill still exist after this year. Notwithstanding differences in land \nmanagement policy--and there are differences between this \nadministration and me and other Members of the Congress--there is no \ndisagreement that the Federal land management agencies should be \nprepared to deal with fires when they occur.\n  Nevertheless, 3 weeks ago, USA Today reported that the Bureau of Land \nManagement fire preparedness budget request was reduced first by the \nDepartment of the Interior and then by the Office of Management and \nBudget. Current and former Bureau of Land Management employees \ncomplained in writing that the effect of these budget reductions would \nbe to reduce fire preparedness dramatically.\n  That story was followed by a Washington Times investigative piece \nthat reported that the money taken from the fire preparedness budget \nwas used to acquire new Federal lands as a part of this \nadministration's current land legacy initiative. I am sure that at the \ntime the President had money taken from these fire budgets he didn't \nunderstand that his land legacy would be millions of acres of charred \ntrees and lost wildlife habitat. Mr. President, that is the permanent \nflame that you may well have as your legacy.\n  At the same time, United Press International filed a story that the \nForest Service fire preparedness budget was similarly reduced either at \nthe Department of Agriculture or the Office of Management and Budget, \nor both. United Press International quoted representatives of the \nForest Service Employees Union complaining that, in downsizing, the \nadministration disproportionately reduced the number of lower grade GS \n5's and 9's and put the money with GS 14's. What does that equate to? \nIt said that it reduces people on the ground and puts them in the \nWashington, DC, office. Folks on the ground fight fires. People in the \nWashington office do not. Yet that is the kind of transition about \nwhich even the Forest Service Employees Union was talking. Those are \namongst a lot of things that this Congress will have to deal with in \nthe coming days.\n  Last week, I had a good conversation with Forest Service Chief Mike \nDombeck. We agreed on a series of steps for the agency and the Congress \nto take over the next few weeks to address the situation currently at \nhand. We are not going to see major policy shifts this year, but we \nclearly ought to outline in the Congressional Record why we are where \nwe are today and why 6.5 or 7 million acres of our public lands have \nbeen charred.\n  Clearly, it is important that we develop an emergency budget not only \nto pay the bills of firefighting that we have incurred, but also the \nkind of environmental restoration that is critical now so we will not \nsee continued catastrophic events occurring as a result of these fires, \nthe kind that could destroy wildlife habitat and watersheds, because we \nwere not able to move quickly in the kind of environmental restoration \nthat is very necessary. We also have private lands at risk and private \nproperty owners who deserve to be compensated because of the way the \nForest Service managed these fires in certain instances, or the \ncharacter in which these fires burned.\n  I will be working with my colleagues in the coming days to do just \nthat. First, we will hold hearings in the coming weeks regarding: Was \nthe Forest Service prepared this season to fight these fires? If they \nwere not, why were they not? Then we will begin to examine the current \npolicy and its impact on these 30-plus million acres at risk. I hope to \ntake colleagues with me, as chairman of the Forestry Subcommittee, to \nmy State of Idaho and into Montana and the Great Basin area of the West \nin the next few weeks as we talk to the citizens on the ground who have \nexperienced firsthand the risk of losing their homes, their property, \nand, yes, even their communities.\n  We have already dealt with the urban wildland interface as a result \nof the catastrophic fires in Los Alamos. But even with that, we have \nnot yet done enough. I hope the administration will bring forth a \npackage in the coming days to work with us to develop a program of \nactive management to try to save these environmentally sensitive areas, \nto improve the ability of these areas to deal with fire, and, most \nimportantly, to improve the ability of our Federal lands management \nagencies to deal with fire in coming years. If we are truly in the kind \nof environment that I believe we are in, or if we are at a time and \nplace of La Nina versus El Nino and ocean oscillations and seasonal \nchanges in the environment, then next year could be every bit as great \na fire year as this year. It is clearly important that we prepare now \nto do so.\n\n  I have had several of my colleagues join me on the floor who wish to \nspeak to this issue. Madam President, I ask how much time is left of \nthe hour that I requested?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 46 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CRAIG. At this time I yield to Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming \nfor such time as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Idaho, who has \nbeen a leader for a very long time in this area--not only on fires, of \ncourse, but the management of forests, which is really the issue we \nwill finally have to get to here. I thank him for what he is doing and \ncertainly for the hearings he will have in his committee, which I think \nwill be extremely important and are now extremely appropriate.\n  Wildfires are a very serious thing. They are very scary. They are \ndamaging. They threaten not only the forest itself but, of course, \nfacilities and homes in the forests. I grew up right next to the \nShoshone forest next to Cody, WY, between Cody and Yellowstone and, as \na matter of fact, participated on two occasions in fighting forest \nfires. It really is something you can hardly imagine, particularly if \nyou are on a steep mountainside and the forest fire itself releases \nboulders that roll down. There are lots of scary things about it.\n  As my colleague and most of us know now, wildfires in the West of the \nUnited States have ravaged literally\n\n[[Page S7969]]\n\nthousands of acres this year, the worst experience we have had in \nforest fires for a very long time. Hopefully, that is now under \ncontrol. There has been some change in the weather--snow, as a matter \nof fact, in some places. There has been some change also in the climate \nitself. We have had a very dry year in the West which has made it even \nmore difficult.\n  In my home State of Wyoming, we have had thousands of acres \ndevastated. Let me share some of the actual numbers that I think are \nfairly startling. This is from the National Fire News. The National \nInteragency Fire Center puts this out from Boise, ID. They have a 13-\nyear comparison of the losses that have taken place as of September 4, \nfor the year 2000.\n  The loss has been 6,566,000 acres this year. This year, of course, is \nnot completed. There are always losses. Last year, in 1999, there were \n4.4 million acres burned; the year before, 2 million, and 1 to 2 \nmillion has been the more common amount, although in 1996 it was 5.7 \nmillion acres that were destroyed.\n  I guess the message is that we know there is going to be some burn. \nThe burn, of course, is the natural way. There are those who argue: Let \nnature take its course. However, things are not the way they were 300 \nyears ago or 200 years ago. There has to be some kind of different \napproach.\n  In the States, of course: California, 214,000 acres; in Florida--\nFlorida which is outside the West--183,000; Idaho, being the hardest \nhit at this point, 1.2 million acres burned in Montana, nearly a \nmillion--900,000 acres. New Mexico had almost half a million acres \nburned. So it has been very devastating. Certainly our first obligation \nis to fund and do what we can now to stop the fires and to repair the \nimmediate damages.\n  I think it is interesting that in the long term, the total this year \nis 6.5 million acres burned, and burned for the last 10 years, 2.9 \nmillion--less than half. So we have had a very difficult experience \nthis year.\n  I ask unanimous consent a complete table of wildfire statistics be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n THIRTEEN-YEAR WILDLAND FIRE COMPARISON STATISTICS YEAR-TO-DATE FOR THE\n                              UNITED

I think we need to recognize and thank the people on the \nground, the agencies, the firefighters, for all they did. This is tough \nwork. This is dangerous work. So I am very grateful for what has been \ndone.\n  I was out in the midst of it, out in Yellowstone during this last \nAugust. Certainly some of the problems were that there were not enough \nfacilities; there were not enough airplanes; there were not enough \nfirefighters; there was not enough equipment to deal with all these \nthings that happened. Again, I am not blaming anyone for that, but it \ndid make it much more difficult.\n  In the appropriations bill with which we are now dealing, I have \nrequested some additional funds for wildlife and fire management this \nfiscal year. I am very concerned, as the Senator from Idaho pointed \nout, that in many of these cases--not only firefighters but also \nmaintenance and other kinds of things--this administration has put more \nemphasis on acquisition and purchase than they have on the management \nof the resources we have now. I think we need to take a look at that. I \nam chairman of the parks subcommittee. All of us know there are $4 \nbillion or $5 billion in infrastructure repairs and maintenance needed. \nBut that is not where this administration put the money.\n  This land legacy thing was the one that had the emphasis. So there \nare some tough questions, I think, certainly not of motives but tough \nquestions in terms of management, as to what our responsibility ought \nto be. I really am looking forward to the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee's oversight hearings when we can take a real, honest look at \nwhat we ought to do.\n  What do the roadless areas we are talking about have to do with the \nability to control fires? I think it has something to do with it. We \nhave wilderness areas and parks, of course, that are managed \ndifferently. It is true that in a wilderness area you are not going to \nhave roads. You have to deal with it another way. Most of these fires \nare not in the wilderness. If we had access to the fires early on, I \nthink it would be helpful. Certainly harvesting, clearing out the \nunderbrush, clearing out the fuel as it builds up, as it naturally does \naround mature trees--I have been in some places that are very nearly \nwilderness, again up around Cody, WY. When selective timbering is done, \nyou go through and you hardly notice it having been harvested. But I \ntell you, there is much less likelihood of an uncontrollable fire in \nthat area than in the condition in which it had been.\n  Of course, the administration is quick to say it has properly managed \nthe fires. This may not be the case, both from the standpoint of being \nas prepared financially as we should have been, and, of course, having \nsome management techniques which many of the forest people, many of the \npeople who are actually on the ground, recommend. They know there are \nthings that can be done.\n  I think this is an area we need to talk about. We need to talk about \nit now. Our focus, of course, has to be on the future and what we can \ndo to limit the kinds of losses in our resources we had this year. I am \nvery pleased to be able to work with my colleagues here, particularly \nthe Senator from Idaho. I am looking forward to doing what we can to be \nprepared so in the future we will have less of a tragedy than we had \nthis year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague from Wyoming. Let me especially echo \nthe point he made well just a few moments ago. We have had thousands of \nmen and women out there on the fire lines risking their lives over the \nlast month and a half. Clearly, a special thanks is needed to them for \nthe work they have done. I think that is most appropriate as we assess \nnow where we are and what we might be able to do, both short term and \nlong term, in the packages that are put together and the policy changes \nthat are made. The administration has said they will be coming forth \nwith some proposals. We will take a very serious look at them as they \ncome, to work with them in the immediate sense as we look at long term.\n  Now, let me yield 10 minutes to the other Senator from Wyoming, Mr.\n\n[[Page S7970]]\n\nMike Enzi. I am pleased he joins us today to discuss this critical \nsituation in the West.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise to join in this elaboration on the \ndamage and devastation that is going on in the West. It has been a \ntradition in the Senate that when disasters happen, Senators come to \nthe floor and they ask emergency measures be taken, both to stop what \nis happening and to make up for some of the economic loss that is a \nresult of the emergency.\n  That is what we are doing today. Just as importantly, we are here \ntoday suggesting that there are changes the Federal Government can make \nso that we do not have these problems again. Prevention is better than \npain. Prevention is better than the pain that is caused by the forest \nfires that devastate homes, jobs, and recreation.\n  Senator Thomas and I have been traveling around Wyoming. We are \ndownwind from Idaho. We are downwind from Washington. We are downwind \nfrom Montana. In the daytime, one cannot see the mountains or the fires \nfor the smoke. At night, you can see the fires as you drive down the \nroads, and people prepare their evacuation plans to get out of their \nhomes, to abandon their homes to flames. It is a terrible situation.\n  It can be prevented, but we are going down the wrong road right now. \nI rise to express my deep concerns over the mismanagement of the \nNational Forest System that has led to one of the worst fire seasons in \nthe history of the United States of America.\n  There is no question that fire is a part of the natural world. No one \nknows this better than the men and women in the Western United States \nwho have risked their lives during the last 4 months to protect and \nsave homes, lives, property, and the environment from the terrible \nthreat of the catastrophic wildfires.\n  As of September 4, the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, ID, \nreports that 6.6 million acres of Federal public lands have been burned \nthis year alone. In comparison, in 1996, we suffered what was up until \nthen the worst year on record for fires in the continental United \nStates. At that time, we lost 5.8 million acres. We have already \nexceeded that loss by almost 800,000 acres, and it is growing.\n  What makes this tragedy so terrible is that most of this threat could \nhave been prevented had our Federal land management agencies not been \nstymied by the Washington, DC, one-size-fits-all-based policies that \nsacrificed forest health for political gain. Rather than implement \npolicies that would have made our forests more fire resilient and would \nhave made forest communities safer from the threat of catastrophic \nwildfires, these agencies, such as the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau \nof Land Management, the National Park Service, and the Fish and \nWildlife Service, have adopted practices from Washington that have \nallowed our forests to grow denser and denser without establishing the \nproper safeguards, such as defensible fuel profile zones and \nmechanically thinned forests that can incorporate fires into the \nnatural management.\n  For more than 60 years, our Nation has placed an emphasis on \naggressive fire suppression programs which have removed fire as a \nmitigating factor in maintaining forest health. As a result of these \nwell-meaning efforts, many of our forests now suffer from an unnatural \naccumulation of vegetation on the forest floors. Dense undergrowth, \ncombined with increasing taller layers of intermediate vegetation, has \nturned Western forests into deadly time bombs.\n  Unlike healthy fires of the past that thinned out the underbrush and \nleft the large trees to grow larger, modern wildfire quickly claims the \ndense vegetation like a ladder until it tops out at the uppermost, or \ncrown, level of the forest and races out of control as a catastrophic \nfire. Because of their high speed and intense heat, these crown fires \nleave an almost sterile environment in their wake. After a crown fire, \nnothing is left behind--no trees, no wildlife, and no habitat--with few \nmicro-organisms left to rebuild the soil.\n  Vegetation manipulation, including timber harvests, is therefore \nnecessary to restore our forests, particularly in the West, to \nconditions that are most resistant to catastrophic disturbance and that \nare within acceptable ranges of variability. Good stewardship, \nscientific studies, including the Sierra Nevada ecosystem project \nreport, state that timber harvest is a tool that can be used to enhance \noverall forest resilience to disturbance. The SNEP report states, for \nexample, that ``logging can serve as a tool to help reduce fire hazard \nwhen slash is treated and treatments are maintained.'' If conducted on \na large enough scale and in a controlled manner, timber harvests can \nrestore our national forests to a point where large catastrophic fires \nare much less likely. In other words, we can harvest the trees instead \nof burning them down. We can make them into boards that will keep that \nCO2 they have absorbed over a lifetime intact in a home \ninstead of going up in smoke as CO2.\n  The Forest Service has recognized this threat and in April of this \nyear stated that ``Without increased restoration treatments . . . \nwildfire suppression costs, natural resources losses, private property \nlosses, and environmental damage are certain to escalate as fuels \ncontinue to accumulate and more acres become high risk.''\n  The Clinton-Gore administration, however, has chosen to ignore its \nown experts and has proposed new programs that would combine with \ncurrent planning efforts, such as the Sierra Nevada framework, Interior \nColumbia Basin ecosystem management project, the roadless initiative, \nand the Federal monument proclamations, will only make the situation \nworse by removing our access to forests and by taking away some of our \nmost effective forest management tools. Instead, the administration \nwants to rely on the extensive use of prescribed fire which will \nfurther exacerbate the risk of catastrophic wildfires on the Federal \nland throughout the West and proposes to prohibit all forms of \ncommercial timber harvest, regardless of the objective.\n\n  Those prescribed fires get out of control, as I am sure the Senator \nfrom New Mexico will point out in a little while, in one of those \ndamaging winds. In Wyoming, prescribed burns get out of control, and if \nyou cannot get to the fire, you cannot put out the fire. We are talking \nabout a roadless initiative in the United States right know.\n  This is a map that shows the forest system in Wyoming--not the \ngrasslands, not the Bureau of Land Management-controlled lands--the \nforest system. Wyoming has about 400 miles on a border. If we take away \nthe roads in any of those colored areas, how do we get in to fight the \nforest fire while it is still a small fire? That is when we want to \ntake them on. That is when we need to be able to get to them. If we \nwipe out the roads--and they are referred to sometimes as ghost roads \nbecause they are not roads one takes a normal car over, but they are \nroads from which fires can be fought.\n  Madam President, I draw your attention to another sign that has \nappeared in Montana. This is actually addressed to all of us, but it is \na little more pointed than that:\n\n       To the firefighters: Thank you for all your efforts.\n       To the U.S. Forest Service: Everything that we love is gone \n     . . . up in smoke. The mismanagement of our forests has \n     turned our beautiful valley into an ash heap.\n       To Bill Clinton and Al Gore: Because of your environmental \n     policies, the jobs are gone, the way of life is gone, and now \n     the beauty is gone. What's next? Shame on you.\n\n  If we do not do anything about it, shame on us.\n  In the interest of protecting the integrity and posterity of our \nforest and wild lands, wildlife habitat, watershed--if there is a \nforest fire and it wipes out all the trees, next year North Dakota will \nhave more floods because more water will make it into the stream--air \nquality, human health and safety, and private property, the U.S. Forest \nService and other Federal land management agencies must immediately \nenact a cohesive strategy to reduce the overabundance of forest fuels \nwhich place these resources at high risk of catastrophic wildfire.\n  While this strategy must include increased timber sales, however, \nthere is no reason these sales cannot be structured to improve forest \nhealth by including in the terms of the contracts a requirement to thin \nout the underbrush and leave our forests in a healthier, more \nsustainable condition.\n\n[[Page S7971]]\n\n  I have concentrated on forest fires. There are grassland fires \nhappening on BLM lands, private lands, and there are some lessons to be \nlearned on taking care of those, too. It is not as dramatic to talk \nabout a grass fire as a timber fire, but on those lands where there is \ngood stewardship, the fires will stop. Where there is bad stewardship, \nthe fires will blow across at a rate animals cannot even run.\n  The catastrophic wildfires not only cause damage to forest and other \nlands but place the lives of firefighters at risk, pose threats to \nhuman health, personal property, sustainable ecosystems, and air and \nwater quality.\n  We must call to task the failed policies and move forward with better \nproactive policies that protect the West and the United States from the \noverriding threat of catastrophic wildfire.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his \ncomments. He has made a very critical statement as it relates to some \nof the initiatives that are before us today, as it relates to roadless \ninitiatives, roadless areas, accessibility to these areas, and the risk \nof catastrophic fire.\n  Last week, I sent to the President a letter indicating we had \ndiscovered that the administration, in their roadless area initiative, \nwas not using the current reports on catastrophic fire as it related to \ntheir initiative. We would ask them to go back and review that before \nthey attempted, by regulation, to lock up another 10, 15, 20, 30 \nmillion acres of land. It ought to be examined against the current \nfuel-loading on that land and the risk of catastrophic fire.\n  Now I will yield to the Senator from New Mexico who has just gone \nthrough a catastrophic fire in his State that nearly wiped out one of \nour great National Laboratories. It certainly wiped out a beautiful \narea in the mountains of New Mexico near Los Alamos where it took \nhundreds of homes and may well end up costing the taxpayers of this \ncountry over $1 billion to repair bad policy and bad decisionmaking \ncoming together that created the Los Alamos fire.\n  I yield to my colleague from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I recall coming to the floor when we \nconsidered the military construction appropriations bill. My friend, \nthe Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, recalls that. The military \nconstruction bill came to the floor and we told the Senate how we \nworked for over a month, in a bipartisan manner, to provide the \nadministration with tools to improve fuel reduction in the wildland and \nurban interface; that is, urban interface areas for communities that \nare at risk.\n  I understand the distinguished Senator, Mr. Kyl from Arizona, has \nsome very excellent portrayals of what happens to forests that are \nattended to and cleared as compared with those we leave unattended and \nthen have a fire. Unfortunately, the administration threatened to veto \nthe legislation we worked on because they found some of the suggestions \ntoo hot to handle. However, my colleagues found the suggestions very \nprudent, and later accepted my amendment to the Interior appropriations \nbill, which is where we finally were able to offer it. It was offered \nthere as an emergency measure and received huge bipartisan support.\n  Throughout the United States, there is an increasing amount of land \nin what natural resource scientists and firefighting experts call \nwildland-urban interface. This is very important because if that burns, \nnot only do we lose forests, but we lose communities, we lose villages, \nwe lose watersheds right close to cities which have a propensity to \ndestroy the water supply as the trees in the watershed burn.\n  Many millions of acres--according to the General Accounting Office \nestimate, 39 million acres or more--of national forests are at high \nrisk of wildfires.\n  Over August--it was not a luxury; normally visiting my State is a \nprivilege and a luxury--I had to go there to visit fire-devastated \ncommunities, and in particular one, Los Alamos, but also some smaller \nones. One of the communities is named Weed, where a couple hundred \npeople came with their concerns because they are so frightened about \nwhat is happening to the forests on which they live, work, and from \nwhich they used to make a living.\n  As of today, there are over 52 fires burning over 1,000 acres each \nacross this country.\n  The total number of acres burned this year is 223 percent of the 10-\nyear-to-date average.\n  On Labor Day, almost 17,000 acres burned--on that one day.\n  Close to half a million acres have burned in my State this year; many \nmore in other States, including the States of Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, \nMontana, and others.\n  When we first started working on this measure, the administration \nbelieved there was too much national environmental special interest \ngroup opposition to my mild fuel-reduction amendment. But I wanted to \nensure that we did not just throw money at the problem and say we \nsolved the threat to our communities.\n  We gave them, in that amendment, $240 million in emergency funding to \nwork on hazardous fuel reduction. Actually, since that amendment, which \nwill be in conference under the chairmanship of Senator Gorton, there \nhave been many more fires that have occurred. Much more evidence has \nbeen discerned with reference to communities that are right up next to \nforests that are loaded with kindling on the ground, ready to make a \nsmall fire into a monstrous fire.\n  The language in that amendment provides the land management agencies \nadditional authority that they now lack to do some of this fuel \nreduction work. We asked them, at their sole discretion, to do this \nwork in a way that would provide jobs to local people, opportunities to \nprivate, nonprofit, or cooperating entities, such as youth conservation \ncorps, and opportunities for small and micro businesses.\n  We asked the two Secretaries involved to identify those communities \nwhere hazard reduction activities were already underway or could be \ncommenced by the end of the calendar year. We further asked the \nSecretaries to describe, by May of the coming year, the roadblocks to \nbeginning hazardous fuel reduction work in the remaining communities at \nrisk.\n  I can tell you about some of the communities in my State because our \nState forester had no hesitation to find out this information. He went \nout to find it. We have an excellent State forestry department and an \nexcellent State forester.\n  They found the Ruidoso area, an area many people visit, has a very \nserious threat in terms of heavy pine scattered throughout the areas \nand residue on the ground of a very high kindling nature.\n  In Santa Fe, the water supply is in immediate jeopardy.\n  The growing East Mountain communities of Albuquerque are facing \nsignificant fire hazards.\n  The Middle Rio Grande Bosque--a green area, a greenbelt along our \nriver, the Rio Grande--and the Espanola area, increasingly face the \nthreat of out-of-control fire; that is, federal forests that are not \ncleaned up, forests that have not been paid any attention to in terms \nof management.\n  Los Alamos was deeply impacted by the Cerro Grande fire and will have \nthe continued threat in unburned canyons.\n  We have all seen on television the terrible pictures of personal \ndevastation from that area where more than 400 people were left without \nresidences. Some were in duplexes that were burned to the ground. We \nhave to pay for those because that fire was started by a Park Service \nemployee who made a very serious mistake. I think we are all aware of \nthat. That actually happened.\n  I want to summarize my remarks by suggesting that it is still very \ninteresting to me how the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Babbitt, can \ncome out to the West and say some of the things he does. President \nClinton's Interior Department has been in charge of many federal \nlands--along with Agriculture Department, in charge of the forests for \nas long as Clinton has been President. I say to my friend from the \nState of Arizona, soon that will be 8 years. They have been in control \nof: How should we manage? What should we cut? What should we do with \nthese forests? It is interesting that Mr Babbitt\n\n[[Page S7972]]\n\nwould come out West and say: This administration is not responsible for \nany of this; it comes from administrations before this one.\n  Frankly, how many years would it take this administration to fix the \nproblems in the management of the forests? I have listened to my good \nfriend, the chairman of the subcommittee that handles this issue in the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee. I heard him talk about what the \nFederal Government has done and not done.\n  I have not heard anything about a major effort to clean up the \nforests. In fact, I think it has been to the contrary. I think there \nhas been a fear that if you clean this up, you are logging. If you \nclean up the stuff on the ground so it will not burn, you are putting \npeople to work in rural areas; and you are supporting this idea that \nthere are many uses for forests, you are making it a reality--where \nthis administration wants to push more to only public use rather than \nany private use.\n  I say to the Secretary of the Interior--and I certainly have not \nheard Secretary Glickman say this--but for him to come out West and say \nthis didn't happen on their watch seems to me to be skating on very \nthin ice in terms of the reality of things.\n  What do we have now? What we have now is a Presidential election. \nVice President Gore is running, and many of us think most of these \npolicies were run through his staff for their ``environmental'' \nvalidity.\n  I think it would be nice to know, since the Secretary of the Interior \ndenies that this administration and our Vice President, who many know \nwas in charge of a lot of environmental policies--where was he on all \nthese fire danger issues? More importantly, where will he be if he is \nelected? I cannot believe that if a set of questions were put to him--\nand we can't do that--he will answer them only if he wants to and only \nif they write them up a certain way. What did you do during your 8 \nyears with reference to this problem, and if you are elected, what will \nyou do during the next 4 years? Be very specific. Wouldn't it be \nsomething if you asked: Do you support a policy saying you can not put \na road in the forest, even to stop the fire? I don't know if he would \nanswer that.\n  The policy in this country now appears to be not to put any roads in. \nIn my State they have told me that in the overgrown Santa Fe watershed, \nthey don't believe they are allowed to put a road a half mile up--even \na temporary one--to thin a rather steep slope, which you cannot get to \nfrom the main road. There are many frustrating stories like that. We \nhear stories about the federal land management agencies concerned with \n``protecting'' certain things on the ground before you use a \nCaterpillar to stop a fire.\n  Frankly, to me, the results make that policy an adversity, because in \norder to save some resources, the result is ironically thousands and \nthousands of acres of burned forests and damaged resources. So which is \nthe more prudent policy? To try to stop the fire early on at a quarter \nof its entirety using mechanized equipment, or let the whole thing burn \nand look back on it and say we didn't touch any of the ground with a \ntractor or any equipment, but we sure burned the forest down? These are \nvery important issues. Where do we go next?\n  I submit that Congress is going to see--even in the few days it has--\nthat that $240 million as an emergency comes out of that conference. I \nthink some Senators are getting some estimates about the environmental \nrestoration cost for some of these forests that burned in the State of \nSenator Kyl, and certainly in the distinguished chairman's State, and \nin the State of Montana and others. What will it cost to go back and \nrehabilitate and make them grow again? That surely is a great American \nemergency.\n  Do we want to leave these millions of acres with only the stark \nreality of a fire? Millions of trees are standing that are burned. Do \nwe want to leave them all there until they rot away? Don't we want to \nsay that as part of a rehabilitation plan, we ought to remove some of \nthem?\n  Frankly, I will give you one example. We have a little community in \nOtero County called Alamogordo. It had one nice lumber mill, which just \nclosed. Do you know what is around it? A very big fire that we reported \nhere on the floor. Around the small town of Weed, near that closed \nsawmill, stands millions of burned trees with about 25 percent of their \nutility gone. We have not yet decided to remove one of those trees and \nto put somebody back to work in that lumber mill because of the \npolicies the Senator from Idaho was speaking of.\n  We need plans. I agree. But we also need to put the money up so the \nplans and the work be done quickly, in my opinion. One of the biggest \nand most important things we can do in the coming weeks is to provide \nthis to the administration and say, ``Get started.'' Clearly, they \nwon't accomplish a great deal, but the sooner we get started the \nbetter.\n  I understand Senator Kyl has an expert in his State who has worked on \nthe issue of how much good can we do in cleaning up the forests, so \nthat we have some fire prevention, instead waiting around and then \ntrying to put out a devastating fire.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Before I yield to the Senator from Arizona, I thank the \nSenator from New Mexico for his most appropriate statement. He \nexperienced this firsthand earlier in the year before Idaho and Montana \nexperienced it--the kind and the character of truly intensive and \ncatastrophic fires, burning thousands of degrees hotter than a normal \nfire in a normal forest setting.\n  He is right. Over the course of the next several weeks, as chairman \nof the authorizing subcommittee, I am going to work very hard to come \nup with figures and amounts that we can build into an emergency package \nand hopefully include it in the Interior appropriations bill, which \nwould fit the kind of environmental restoration necessary on the acres \nthat have already burned, but also the kind of urban interface \nstewardship programs that will bring about the fuel reduction that our \ncolleague from Arizona will speak to in a moment. He and people in his \nState have done some very interesting and extremely valuable pioneering \nwork on the Ponderosa Forest of northern Arizona, which is important \nfor this Congress, and hopefully this administration, to take into \nconsideration as a part of the way we deal with these forest lands that \nnow have literally tens of thousands of gallons of gasoline-equivalent \nfuel on the ground, which burns explosively under the right \ncircumstances, as we have just experienced.\n  Let me yield to my colleague from Arizona, Senator John Kyl, to speak \nto this issue and the experiments going on in his State.\n  (Mr. ENZI assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Idaho for bringing \nthe attention to this issue to the Senate floor, to our colleagues \nhere, as well as to people around the country. To my colleague from New \nMexico with whom I have been visiting about this matter for 5 or 6 \nyears now, a real thanks for his efforts to bring a $240 million \nsupplemental appropriation which will only begin to scratch the surface \nof the needs we have. Half of that money goes to the Department of \nAgriculture's U.S. Forest Service and the other half goes to the \nDepartment of the Interior for the BLM because in our public forests \ntoday we have them spread both in the National Forest System, as well \nas the Department of the Interior-administered lands of the BLM. \nArizona and New Mexico have the largest pine forests in the world.\n  Senator Craig pointed out that we have done some pioneering here. For \nthe last decade or so, Northern Arizona University's School of Forestry \nhas been working on techniques to return the forest to the rather \nparklike, very natural condition that it was in at the turn of the \ncentury, 100 years ago, when you had very broad stretches of grassland \nwith few trees per acre--maybe 100 trees per acre. Big beautiful trees, \nponderosa pines, are a little bit reminiscent of a sequoia, for \nexample--very large, yellow bark, a beautiful huge tree. When they are \nspaced out a fairly large distance from each other in a rather parklike \ncondition, I don't think there is anything prettier.\n  More to the point, there is nothing more beneficial for the flora and \nfauna in the area. Lush grass feeds the deer and elk and other \nbrowsers. We have a healthy environment for birds and other species \nand, frankly, the entire ecological situation is the way that God \ncreated it to be.\n\n[[Page S7973]]\n\n  Then along came man, and through a series of mistakes we mismanaged \nthe forests to the point that today most of the forest is clogged and \ngnarled into what they call a ``dog hair trimmer,'' meaning that a dog \ncan't run through it without leaving half of his hair behind on the \nunderbrush that has been growing up.\n  What happens is that, first of all, all of this underbrush competes \nfor the nutrients and the water in the soil so none of the trees grow \nto be the big, beautiful trees we all love, and none of the grass can \ngrow so that the browsers--the deer, elk, and animals such as that--\ndon't come into the area. And because every bit of nature depends on \nsomething else, most of the species simply vanish. Nothing can really \nsurvive there.\n  You create two other conditions: disease-prone because they are weak; \nsecondly, fire-prone, where a spark of fire here is like setting off \ntinder with a larger box around it to burn. Because of the undergrowth \nand fuel on the ground, as soon as the fire starts, it quickly spreads \nto the lower branches and then the upper branches of the trees, and \nthat is why you see this almost explosion of fire as it crowns out; it \ngoes right up through the top of these huge, magnificent trees and \nexplodes the trees in the process. What happens is that the soil is \nbaked to a temperature that is unhealthy for regeneration. Ordinarily, \nnature-caused fire will burn along the ground and burn a little bit of \nthe underbrush that is there but never crown out. As a result, it is \nnot the timber fire that you get here. This literally sterilizes the \nsoil. For years, nothing can regenerate. Perhaps devastatingly, erosion \nresults very quickly--destroying streams, rivers, and lakes. It takes \nthe topsoil that has taken millions of years to be created so things \ncan grow, and wipes that out. It drains all of it right down into the \nrivers and streams and clogs them up.\n\n  What is the environment for the flora and fauna? There is nothing. We \ntalk about endangered species. Goodbye species.\n  We had a fire around Four Peaks in Arizona which destroyed about \n75,000 acres. I learned that this was the heaviest concentration of \nblack bear habitat in the country and perhaps the world. What happened \nto all of these black bears? Many of them did not survive. Many of the \nother animals did not survive. The trees are gone. We have a very large \nbird population in Arizona. Amazingly enough, many of those birds had \nnowhere else to go.\n  The point is that when you have this kind of catastrophe, you are not \naiding nature; you are destroying it. All of the environment is \ndestroyed in the process--not to mention the waste and the cost. We \nhave now spent about $1 billion this year to fight these fires. That \nmoney could have gone a long way toward managing the forests and \npreventing the fires in the first place. You are not simply saving \ntimber; you are not simply preserving a nice view for people. You are \nsaving the environment for the flora and fauna--preventing erosion, \npreventing the sterilization of the soil, and all of the rest.\n  As I started to say, work has been done around the country, but most \nimportantly in Northern Arizona University, pioneered by Dean Garrett, \nand most recently by Dr. Wally Covington at Northern Arizona \nUniversity. Secretary Bruce Babbitt is a friend of Wally Covington and \nfully supports the work that he has been doing at Northern Arizona \nUniversity. In some small projects in northern Arizona, we have been \nable to acquire funding to do this forest restoration and demonstrate \nthe efficacy of the treatment.\n  The problem is the administration has not carried that on to a larger \ntreatment area. I don't know why because science proves it out. \nSecretary Babbitt understands that it is the right thing to do. But I \nthink, frankly, it is a fear that the radical environmentalists, which \nthis administration relies upon for a great deal of its support, will \nobject. Indeed, after putting together a wonderful program with the \nsupport of Secretary Babbitt, Dr. Covington, the Grand Canyon Trust, \nand other environmental groups, all of whom were working together to \nmake the area around Flagstaff, AZ, safer, to improve the environment, \nand to restore the forests to a healthy condition, radical \nenvironmental groups sued to stop the process and delayed it for an \nentire year--to no effect because the project will go on. But it will \nbe delayed a year.\n  The GAO reports that we have 39 million acres to treat in this \ncountry. Strike that. With 6 million acres having burned this year, we \nare now down to 33 million acres. We have to do this within a 20-year \nperiod if we are going to save these forests. That is going to require \na commitment of the next administration. If the current administration \ncan't do the job, maybe the next one can.\n  Finally, I am holding a document put out by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture Forest Service, Southwestern Region, called ``Arizona's \nWild Land Urban Interface.'' To summarize what is in this document, you \nsee areas that haven't been treated that are severely burned. Then you \nsee what happens when they treat the areas. You find, for example, in \nthe Coronado National Forest a before-and-after picture where you see \nthis clogged-up condition of undergrowth. It is not pretty, it is not \nenvironmentally sound, and the number of trees per acre are reduced to \nabout 300. Whereas they had about 1,500 before, they are trying to get \nit down to about 150 per acre. When you do that, you have a beautiful \npark-like condition that is healthy.\n\n  I can tell you, having visited the treatment areas around Flagstaff, \nthat after about 3 years you see the pitch content of the trees \nsignificantly improved. That prevents the bark beetles from attacking \nthe trees. The protein content of the grass is an order of magnitude \nhigher. All of the elk, deer, and other animals are coming in to \nbrowse. Everything about the forest is healthier when you can go in and \nthin out this underbrush and hopefully follow up with a prescribed burn \nwhich simply burns along the ground and burns any of the residue. It \ndoesn't crown out. After that, you can let nature take its course \nbecause then you have a healthy forest with larger diameter trees. If \nlightning strikes, not one of those trees catches fire. It starts with \nthe grass on fire around it. It may burn the grass for several acres. \nThat is all right. That will regenerate in just 1 year. That is \nacceptable. But it doesn't crown out and destroy the rest of the \nforest. That is what we have to commit to do in all of our Nation's \nforests.\n  I commend the small first step that Senator Domenici has taken here \nwith appropriations. I commend the administration to create a budget \nthat will begin to spend, frankly, billions of dollars that are \nnecessary to treat the forests of our country, not just in the \nsouthwest but all over the western United States which so desperately \nneeds this new forest management to save our Nation's forest.\n  I appreciate the fact that Senator Craig has offered me the \nopportunity to speak to this today, and I look forward to continuing to \ntalk about this issue because, unfortunately, like some of the other \nthings, it takes a catastrophe to finally bring out what has to be \ndone. While all of us lament the catastrophe, at least perhaps it will \njolt us into doing what is right to save our wonderful forests in the \nU.S.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kyl for what I think is a \nvery clear explanation of what happens when you have this massive fuel-\nloading that has occurred on the floors of our public land forests in \nthe Nation. When he talks about active management, he is not talking \nabout wilderness areas. He is not talking about wildlife preserves. He \nis talking about the millions and millions of acres of land that we \ncall multiple-use lands or lands that are classified within this \nroadless area that this administration is currently examining and is \nconsidering keeping roadless and undisturbed.\n  The question becomes very clear. Can you do this kind of active \nmanagement by righting the wrongs of past actions we have taken on our \npublic lands to restore forest health and to allow fire then to be a \nparticipant in the ecosystem in a way that is not catastrophic or stand \naltering or wildlife destroying? Those are very real changes with which \nall of us have to grapple. We ought to start. I will start with \nhearings in the next few days that will deal with that. Some of \nour environmental friends recognize this. One of them happens to be \nfrom New Mexico. The Forest Guardian Group is\n\n[[Page S7974]]\n\nquoted as saying that wildfires are getting bigger, burning hotter, and \nthe effects are more devastating.\n\n  It is clear that we will have to take mechanical steps to thin \nforests before we can use fire to restore these forests to their \nnatural regimes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator allow me a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I hope he will make available more of the research that \nhas been described so carefully by himself and the Senator from \nArizona. This is new to an easterner but not too new. Two-thirds of the \nState of New York is covered by hardwood forests and some cedar and \npine. But these are important propositions that should be listened to \nintensively. I surely wish to be one who will do so, and I look forward \nto supporting the efforts that are indicated.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from New York for saying so. Yes, it \nis true that some of these ideas are new. Some of them have been \nbuilding over the last decades as we have recognized the current state \nof the health of our forests. My time is up.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am sure the chairman would wish us to \nyield such time as the Senator from Idaho needs to conclude.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me conclude because the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee has just brought a very critical issue to the floor. I \nappreciate the opportunity to kind of sandwich ourselves in between the \nopening remarks of the chairman and the opening remarks of the ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee as it relates to China and PNTR, which \nis the most important issue before this Senate. But it is important \nthat Senators be given an opportunity to hear the concerns that are now \nout there about our public lands and some remedial action that we can \ntake in the short term as we look at long-term policies working with \nthis administration and future administrations to resolve this kind of \ncritical issue.\n  I thank you very much for the time and the time my colleagues have \nused in joining me to bring out some of the necessary and important \nfacts about the events that are occurring out there as we go through \nthis most devastating fire season.\n  Let me conclude once again with this thought. Six and one-half \nmillion acres of public land have now burned. For those who might be \nlistening and who do not understand what 1 acre of land represents, or \n1 square mile of land, let me suggest that it is the entire State of \nMaryland charred to the ground, with piles of ash, with snags of \ntimber, standing dead trees, nothing left, with the risk of siltation \nand soot and ash moving into the watershed, into the streams, and into \nthe valuable aquatic habitat. No wildlife can live there. Much of the \nwildlife having been destroyed, no trees can provide the productiveness \nto build a home and provide fiber for our country except in charred \nsnags. An area the size of the State of Maryland has now \nburned. Thousands and thousands of acres continue to burn. I believe \nthat is a national crisis. It is a crisis on which all Members must \nfocus. If it had been a hurricane that just wiped out the State of \nMaryland, we would all be rushing to save that State.\n\n  Fire, too, is a part of Mother Nature's disaster or catastrophic \nscheme. I hope our colleagues will work with us and that the Nation \nwill begin to understand that active management on these timbered \npublic lands in the appropriate and designated areas is not only \ncritical; it is necessary to save our forests.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S7974-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7974-S7978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TO AUTHORIZE EXTENSION OF NONDISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT TO THE PEOPLE'S \n            REPUBLIC OF CHINA--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nNew York is recognized for such time as he may consume.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank my revered chairman for this \nopportunity to discuss the most important issue we will deal with in \nthis portion of this session of Congress.\n  At the Finance Committee's final hearing on China this spring, on \nApril 6, our last witness, Ira Shapiro, who was formerly the chief \nnegotiator for Japan and Canada at the U.S. Trade Representative's \noffice, closed his testimony with these words.\n\n       . . . [this vote] is one of an historic handful of \n     Congressional votes since the end of World War II. Nothing \n     that Members of Congress do this year--or any other year--\n     could be more important.\n\n  I rise to suggest, sir, that he is not wrong, and to explain at some \nlength, if I may be indulged, the reasons therefor.\n  The United States has a long history of commercial ties with China, \nbeginning at a time when we exported raw materials, medicinal herbs and \nsuch like products, in return for sophisticated manufactures.\n  The first American ship to visit China, the Empress of China, cleared \nNew York harbor more than 216 years ago on February 22, 1784. It \ncarried a cargo of 300 tons of ginseng, a wild root found in the \nuplands of States such as New York, where it is gathered to this day \nand is known as shang. The cargo included wool, cloth, lead, cotton, \nand pepper--pepper, I take it, to be a transshipment of pepper received \nfrom South Asia. She reached Canton 7 months later, on August 23, 1784, \nand returned to New York the following May where the vessel created a \nsensation with its exotic cargo of manufactures: porcelain, umbrellas, \nfans, and then some tea and spices.\n  By the 1830s American commercial interests in China had grown \nconsiderably despite China's restrictions on trade. But American \ntraders lagged far behind their British counterparts--one might say the \nPortuguese, as well, who were the first in the Far East--and when the \nBritish secured additional trading rights by the Treaty of Nanjing, \nconcluded in 1842 after the first Opium War, as it was known, the \nmerchants of Boston became especially fearful that American traders \nwould suffer discrimination.\n  In the context of today's debate, it is worth recalling that the U.S. \nresponse a century and a half ago to the fears that we were being \nlocked out of the China market was just what we are talking about \ntoday. We sent a special emissary to ask the Chinese to grant the \nUnited States what is in effect normal trade relations status. Congress \nvoted $40,000--some Members thought it to be an exorbitant sum--for a \nspecial diplomatic mission to China. Congressman Caleb Cushing of \nMassachusetts was dispatched as minister plenipotentiary. His \ninstructions stated that his primary object was to secure for the \nUnited States the same commercial privileges that had just been won by \nthe British.\n  On July 3, 1844, Cushing signed the United States' first treaty with \nChina. It was called the Treaty of Wanghia, named after a village near \nMacao which was a Portuguese settlement. Its centerpiece was ``a most \nfavored nation clause.'' That was the 17th century term used at the \ntime. The meaning is that you will get the same treatment as that \nnation which has the most favored treatment, which in effect means \nequal treatment for all, or what we call normal trade relations. Just \nequal treatment for all, ensuring that the American merchants would \nhave the same terms of trade and negotiation as did the French and the \nEnglish traders.\n  A century and a half later, we are still grappling with these very \nsame concerns. Thus, we find ourselves on September 5, 2000, debating \nthe merits of establishing permanent normal trade relations with China, \nthat term, ``normal trade relations,'' having been changed, having been \nadopted in the Finance Committee. We are very proud of our chairman in \nthis regard, to have succeeded in changing the 17th century term ``most \nfavored nation,'' which gave altogether the wrong impression to any but \nskilled trade negotiators and merchants.\n  Our purpose is to ensure that Americans are not disadvantaged in the \nChinese market and the Chinese not disadvantaged in ours.\n  We begin the debate on a high note and with great expectations. Just \nas we left for the August recess on July 27, an overwhelming majority \nof Senators voted, 86-12, in support of the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe motion to proceed to this bill. That is what we are doing now. It \nwas almost exactly proportionately divided: 45 Republicans and 41 \nDemocrats voted for cloture.\n  The vote followed an unquestionably impressive and somewhat \nsurprising\n\n[[Page S7975]]\n\nvote in the House of Representatives on May 24. A margin of three or \nfour votes had been predicted, with a 10-vote margin the most \noptimistic projection.\n  In the end, the measure passed decisively: 237 yeas to 197 noes. The \nFinance Committee also has wholeheartedly endorsed the bill, on a \nbipartisan basis. On May 17, the committee ordered reported a very \nsimple two-page bill, S. 2277. It is not a complicated matter, two \npages states it all, to extend permanent normal trade relations to \nChina. The vote was near to unanimous, 19-1.\n  I remind my fellow Senators on this side of the aisle that all \nDemocratic members of the Finance Committee voted in support of the \nbill.\n  The House saw fit to add several provisions designed to implement \nelements of the November 15, 1999, U.S.-China bilateral World Trade \nOrganization agreement to address several other facets of U.S.-China \nrelations. Thus, the House bill, H.R. 4444, includes an import surge \nmechanism which codifies a provision of the November agreement, \nnegotiated by our Trade Representative, to deal with that possibility \nin trade. It creates a human rights commission loosely modeled upon the \nCommission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Helsinki \nCommission, and it authorizes appropriations for the Departments of \nCommerce, State, and Labor and the U.S. Trade Representative's office \nto monitor China's compliance with its World Trade Organization \ncommitments--nothing major, nothing troubling.\n  On June 17, the Finance Committee examined the House-passed bill in \nexecutive session. It was the near unanimous view of the committee that \nwe simply ought to take up the House bill, pass it, and send it to the \nPresident, who has committed to signing it. It, after all, represents \nan enterprise that has been afoot through many administrations, and \ncame to a successful conclusion in his when the World Trade \nOrganization was created and the trade agreement was negotiated. And, \nso, the sooner the better.\n  We all need some reminding of our history. China's accession to the \nWorld Trade Organization is consistent with longstanding U.S. trade \npolicy and allows China to resume the role it played 50 years ago. \nThere can be no doubt that passage of this legislation is in the \ninterest of the United States. This is true whether we view the matter \nfrom the overarching perspective of our broad trade policy goals or \nlook more narrowly at the benefits that China's accession to the World \nTrade Organization will bring to American farmers, industry, and \nworkers.\n  Let me make the case from both vantage points. In a very real sense, \nAmerica's trade policy over the past 66 years--two-thirds of a century, \never since Cordell Hull created the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Program \nin 1934 in the depths of the Great Depression--ever since then we have \npursued policies that have brought us to this moment of extraordinary \ncompletion. With its accession to the World Trade Organization, China \nmerely resumes the role that it played half a century ago when it was \ninstrumental in United States-led efforts to build a multilateral \ntrading system from the economic rubble generated by us in the Smoot-\nHawley Tariff Act of 1930. If you were to make a short list of five \nevents that led to the Second World War, sir, Smoot-Hawley would be one \nof them.\n  Tariffs in that act of 1930 increased to unprecedented levels--on \naverage 60 percent. As predicted, imports dropped by two-thirds in \nvalue terms. But what had not been predicted was that there was a \ncorresponding and almost precisely equal drop of two-thirds in the \nvalue of exports which materialized when our trading partners responded \nin kind and hiked their tariffs just as the United States had done.\n  The result was ruinous, not only for the United States but for our \ntrading partners. The British abandoned free trade and adopted \nCommonwealth preferences. The Japanese began the Greater East Asian Co-\nProsperity Sphere. In 1933, with unemployment at 33 percent, Hitler was \nelected Chancellor of Germany.\n  It took the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 to get the trade \npolicy of the United States back on track. The impetus behind the \nReciprocal Trade Agreements program was predicated on the view that the \nrecovery of the U.S. economy depended on finding outlets for our \nproduction--that is, opening and developing export markets--and that \nthe only way to accomplish this was to negotiate reciprocal reductions \nin tariffs.\n  If I may be permitted a personal note, I was taught, after returning \nfrom the Navy in World War II--I was taught this subject by Harry \nHawkins, a great State Department official who Cordell Hull, in his \nmemoirs, observes handled reciprocal trade. This was not to them a mere \neconomic issue--prices, trading and such like. This was an issue that \nhad led the world to the brink of destruction in World War II. It was \nhoped that would never happen again.\n  This is what we are talking about now, at a more attenuated level. \nBut the belief that has driven American policy for two-thirds of a \ncentury is still alive and happily and importantly so.\n  We did this initially on a country-by-country basis. From 1934 \nthrough 1947, the United States negotiated separate agreements with 29 \ncountries. That is a large number. I believe the initial membership of \nthe United Nations was in the neighborhood of 55 countries. So half the \ncountries in the world had entered agreements by this time.\n\n  With the conclusion of the Second World War, trade assumed an \nimportant role in postwar economic reconstruction plans, and the \nconviction emerged that multilateral trade agreements were more \nefficient and ultimately a more trade liberalizing means of spurring \neconomic growth than a web of bilateral agreements, having all the \ncountries involved reach the same agreement in the same setting.\n  China played a central role in that thinking and planning from the \nbeginning. China was one of the 44 participants in the Bretton Woods \nConference of July 1 to 22, 1944. We saw the war coming to an end, and \nwe were preparing for the aftermath. Bretton Woods established the \nInternational Monetary Fund down on Pennsylvania Avenue and the \nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which we know as \nthe World Bank, again not 20 blocks away.\n  A multilateral trade agreement was expected to complement these \ninstitutions. There were three in mind: the fund, the bank, and the \ntrade organization. Postwar planners did not turn their attention to \ntrade until 1946. That year, China was appointed to the preparatory \ncommittee of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment, \nwhich was charged with drafting the charter for the International Trade \nOrganization, the ITO. Thus, it was that China became one of the \noriginal 23 contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and \nTrade which was but one of the chapters of the ITO charter. It came to \nbe known by its initials, the GATT, and it was put into effect in 1948 \nas an interim arrangement until the charter had been ratified. It was \njust a very small office in Geneva. A British Treasury official, Eric \nWyndham White and three secretaries, as I recall from those days, in a \nsmall house above Geneva ran it all and ran it wonderfully waiting for \nthe ITO.\n  The ITO never came to pass or did not come to pass at that time. It \ndied in the Senate Finance Committee. The GATT survived. China remained \na part of the GATT until March 8, 1950, when the Republic of China, by \nnow located on Taiwan, notified the GATT that China would withdraw.\n  I note, and I do not want to insist as my history is not that clear, \nbut it was the Government of China of Chiang Kai-shek on Taiwan that \nwithdrew. I do not believe we have any record of the PRC, the People's \nRepublic, as such having done it. It would not have mattered, but \neffectively China was out. It is to be noted--I am subject to \ncorrection--but it is to be noted.\n  It was not until 1986 that the People's Republic of China became \nsufficiently interested in the subject of GATT to try to reclaim its \nseat, and the accession negotiations began. Indeed, China had hoped to \nbecome a founding member of the World Trade Organization which came \ninto effect on January 1, 1995, only 5 years ago, and, in effect, \nincorporated the GATT and succeeded it, the GATT having been originally \na part of the ITO.\n  The negotiations with China proved too complex to meet that deadline, \nbut\n\n[[Page S7976]]\n\nthey continued. Today after 14 difficult years in negotiation with the \nwhole international community--not with our Trade Representative--China \nis within striking distance of becoming the 138th member of the WTO. It \nseems elemental that China, the world's 9th largest merchandise \nexporting nation in 1999 and the 11th largest importer--these are WTO \nstatistics--ought to be in the World Trade Organization, and this is \nuniversally agreed. Agreed elsewhere, not unanimously agreed in the \nUnited States, but here we are with an 86-12 vote saying, ``Let's do \nit.''\n  It is equally obvious that it is in the United States' interest to \nhave such a commanding player in a rules-based system that is largely \nthe design and certainly is entirely the inspiration of the United \nStates with the assent at that time of the United Kingdom and the \nparticipation of China and, I must grant, the U.S.S.R. and France.\n\n  This brings me to a second broad observation. The economic case for \npermanent normal trade relations is, I would think, unassailable. \nAmbassador Barshefsky negotiated an outstanding market access \nagreement. That much is not in dispute. It was China and not the United \nStates that had to make significant and wide-ranging market access \ncommitments.\n  Take just a few of the products that are of great importance to my \nState of New York. In 1998, New York's direct exports to China totaled \n$596 million, $1 billion all told if shipments to Hong Kong are taken \ninto account as now they ought to be. New York's exports are no longer \nprincipally ginseng, although I would note that in 1999, the United \nStates exported just over 512 tons to China and Hong Kong.\n  Almost 90 percent of New York's exports are manufactured goods. On \naverage, tariffs on such products under the agreement before us will \nfall from 25 percent to 9 percent by the year 2005. We are a leading \nproducer of information technology, paper, optical fibers, photographic \nequipment, and photocopier parts. China will eliminate its tariffs on \ninformation technology products and photocopier parts. It is not in \ntheir interest to charge themselves more for the products that they \nwant.\n  China has promised deeper cuts on other products. Of particular \ninterest, the tariff on digital cameras will fall from 45 percent to \nzero. Tariffs on wood and paper fall not to zero but to very low rates, \nin the 5 to 7.5 percent range.\n  The opportunities for New York's financial services industry are \nstaggering. Take insurance. Currently, the Chinese insurance market is \nvalued at $10 billion a year and is estimated to be growing 20 percent \nannually. Twenty percent annually doubles every 4 years. At present, \nper capita spending on insurance in China is under $8, compared to a \nworld average of $431. The market is there.\n  Under its WTO agreement, China will eliminate current requirements \nthat restrict foreign insurance companies to a handful of cities. China \nwould also allow insurers to offer different types of policies--health \ninsurance, group insurance, and the like.\n\n  Again, to keep in the Senate tradition of speaking first of my own \nState, while this is not well appreciated, New York is still a major \nagricultural State. We are the Nation's second largest producer of \napples and third largest producer of dairy products, grapes, and wine. \nOur agricultural exports are well above a third of a billion dollars. \nThis agreement reduces tariffs on apples and pears and cherries from 30 \npercent to 10 percent, and on wine from 65 percent to 20 percent.\n  I must not fail to mention that the Chinese will also cut their \ntariff on ginseng from 40 percent to 10 percent.\n  New York is by no means the only State that will benefit. The \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee pointed out on July 27, \njust before we broke for the August recess, how China's accession to \nthe WTO will benefit the State of Delaware, which is a major \nmanufacturer, producing automobiles in abundance, chemicals beyond the \nimagination of most of us, and with a two-century tradition thereof. We \ngrow ginseng; you produce chemicals--a pattern that I do not know if we \nwant to maintain entirely, but there it is.\n  California, which exported $2.5 billion in goods to China in 1998, \nwill surely gain from China's commitments to eliminate tariffs on \ninformation technology products. What we think of in Silicon Valley, \nthat is what we are talking about. There will be no tariffs on those \nproducts.\n  Minnesota's exports to China more than doubled from 1993 to 1998--\ndoubled, sir--increasing from $119 million to $316 million. China will \ncut in half its tariff on scientific instruments--which Minnesota is \nprobably internationally acclaimed for--cut them down to 6.1 percent, \nwhich is a derisory number, as any international trade expert will tell \nyou.\n  Minnesota's farmers will gain. China is already the world's largest \ngrowth market for soybeans and soybean products. I can remember as a \nboy in the 1930s reading--and for some reason I can remember--an \narticle in the Reader's Digest telling us about the soybean, this \namazing product that was grown in China that had such enormous \npotential for the rest of mankind. Indeed it did. Indeed it came here. \nAnd now we are sending it there.\n  That is a pattern and point of fact that is well established in \ntrade. We think of it mostly in terms of manufacturers. But it can \nobviously apply to agricultural products, too. Raymond Vernon, at \nHarvard, described this as the product cycle theory of international \ntrade. A country begins to produce a certain product. It then begins to \nsell the product overseas. The product begins to be produced overseas. \nAnd then it begins to be sold back to the original nation, the nation \nwhere it was originally produced.\n  We have seen this in automobiles, going from the United States to \nAsia, or Europe, and then coming back. I observe, sir, that we see it \nwith soybeans. They came first from China. We consumed them, then \nproduced them, and now we are sending them back to China. That is the \nfelicity of trade and the importance of it.\n  It can be said with certainty that every State in the Union will \nbenefit from China's accession to the World Trade Organization.\n  Permanent normal trade relations for China is necessary to realize \nthe full benefits of China's accession to the WTO. Here is the rub: Our \nproducers and workers and companies will not be guaranteed the full \nbenefits of China's concessions until we grant China permanent normal \ntrade relations status. The welfare of our workers, our manufacturers, \nour farmers, our lumbermen, our fishermen is at issue here.\n  This is because the World Trade Organization requires that member \nstates extend to each other unconditional normal trade relations. This \nprinciple is enshrined in the World Trade Organization--in the World \nTrade Organization's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of 1994, \nthe General Agreement on Trade in Services, and the Agreement on Trade-\nRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights--a matter of increasing \nimportance to the United States. It is an absolute requirement, and \nshould be.\n\n  That is what we had in mind at Bretton Woods in 1944, what we put in \nplace, as we hoped, in 1946 with the International Trade Organization, \nwhich never came into being--or did not come into being until now. Sir, \nit is the very same principle that the United States sought to \nestablish in our first trade treaty with China in 1844.\n  We do not meet this requirement today since the U.S. law requires \nthat China's trade status must be renewed annually, based on a review \nof China's immigration policies, to which I will address myself in a \nmoment.\n  But, sir, as we well know, this legislation was created during the \ncold war, was directed against the Soviet Union and the satellite \nstates, and had nothing whatever to do with China. H.R. 4444--that is \nthe bill before us--will put us into compliance with our WTO \nobligations with respect to China and allow us to gain--in full--the \nconsiderable benefits that Ambassador Barshefsky negotiated in the \nNovember 1999 agreement.\n  There are those who argue that granting permanent normal trade \nrelations is not necessary and that we will still reap at least some of \nthese hard-fought gains by virtue of our previous trade agreements. I \nbeseech the Senate, do not be lulled by this argument.\n  First, it is contradicted by nearly all experts who have examined it \nin detail--the administration, the General Accounting Office, the \nCongressional Research Service, and others.\n\n[[Page S7977]]\n\n  Second, our competitors will not be similarly hamstrung. They will \nbenefit from all of the concessions that China made without restriction \nor question. They will prefer this situation from which we are \nexcluded, and they will necessarily and legitimately seek to maintain \nit. We will have done ourselves the injury. No others can be blamed.\n  More important--much more important, sir--China will view failure to \nenact this legislation as an unfriendly act, at the very least. The \nconsequences could be severe, and they could endure. I would expect \nthat they will because, sir, we have a long and troubling history of \nantipathy toward the Chinese. It is a strong term. I use it on this \nfloor because it has been stated on this floor for a century and \nmore; it is time to reverse it.\n\n  Opposition to this measure--permanent normal trade relations--will be \npuzzling to many. But, sir, there is a long and rueful history in the \nUnited States of our racial antagonism toward Chinese emigration to \nthis country, which now appears as an antagonism to the arrival of \nChinese goods.\n  It is not a pleasant history and it is painful to recount it. But it \nis necessary. It begins in California--which is understandable--where \nthe movement to put an end to Chinese immigration into this country \nbegan in the late 1850s.\n  By way of background, the Immigration and Naturalization Service \nreports that only 46 Chinese emigrated to the United States in the \nthree decades between 1820 and 1850. The Chinese immigration explosion \nbegan in the 1850s, fueled by the California gold rush and the \nconstruction of the Transcontinental Railroad. From 1851 to 1880, \n228,899 Chinese emigrated to the United States. By 1880, Chinese \nimmigrants in California alone numbered 75,000, more or less--about 9 \npercent of the State's total population.\n  Such was the demand for Chinese labor that the United States \nreinforced its ``open door'' policy by treaty: The Burlingame Treaty of \n1868 guaranteed to the Chinese Government the unrestricted immigration \nof its citizens to the United States. The State of California applauded \nthe arrangement at the time.\n  But there was an almost immediate backlash from workers in California \nwho had organized themselves into so-called ``anti-coolie'' \nassociations beginning in the mid-1850s.\n  In the 1870s, the anti-Chinese movement gained momentum in the face \nof an economic downturn and the near completion of the Transcontinental \nRailroad. In 1876, a special committee of the California State Senate \nexamined the problem and issued a report to the U.S. Congress entitled \n``An Address to the People of the United States upon the Evils of \nChinese Immigration.''\n  And in July 1876, the United States Congress established a Joint \nSpecial Committee to Investigate Chinese Immigration, chaired by \nSenator Oliver Morton of Indiana. The joint committee held 18 days of \nhearings in San Francisco in October and November 1876, and issued its \nfinal report in February 1877. A statement presented to the joint \ncommittee on October 26, 1876, on behalf of the ``Labor Union of San \nJose, CA,'' was typical:\n\n       Do they [the Chinese] prevent white immigration? We know \n     that most assuredly they do, as of our personal knowledge we \n     know numbers of laboring men during the past year that have \n     come to the coast, and have had to leave the coast for lack \n     of employment, in consequence of their inability to compete \n     with Mongolians, and thus sustain a loss, through their \n     influence, when they return to their old homes, not yet \n     cursed by the presence of the Chinese.\n\n  This will be found in the report of the Special Committee to \nInvestigate Chinese Immigration in Senate Report Number 689, 44th \nCongress, second session, page 1172, in the year 1877.\n  Please note that this was written years before the establishment of \nthe American Federation of Labor, which has had no such views; to the \ncontrary. Still it was heard.\n  The joint committee's final report makes painful reading, and I \nquote, Mr. President:\n\n       To anyone reading the testimony which we lay before the two \n     Houses it will become painfully evident that the Pacific \n     coast must in time become either American or Mongolian. There \n     is a vast hive from which Chinese immigrants may swarm, and \n     circumstances may send them in enormous numbers to this \n     country. These two forces, Mongolian and American, are \n     already in active opposition. . . . The American race is \n     progressive and in favor of a responsible representative \n     government. The Mongolian race seems to have no desire for \n     progress, and to have no conception of representative and \n     free institutions. . . .\n       It further appears from the evidence--and I continue to \n     read from the report of the Joint Committee of Congress--that \n     the Chinese do not desire to become citizens of this country, \n     and have no knowledge of or appreciation for our \n     institutions. Very few of them learn to speak our \n     language. . . . To admit these vast numbers of aliens to \n     citizenship and the ballot would practically destroy \n     republican institutions on the Pacific coast, for the \n     Chinese have no comprehension of any form of government \n     but despotism, and have not the words in their own \n     language to describe intelligibly the principles of our \n     representative system.\n\n  That is in the report of the Joint Special Committee to Investigate \nChinese Immigration, to be found in Senate Report 689, 44th Congress, \nsecond session at pages Roman V to Roman VII.\n  The joint committee's report paved the way for the Chinese Exclusion \nAct of 1882, which suspended immigration by Chinese laborers for 10 \nyears. The scope of the act was expanded in 1888, and renewed for \nanother 10 years in 1892. And then, in 1902--the century we are still \nin if we count the numbers--Congress indefinitely renewed the Chinese \nExclusion Acts.\n  We handled these things somewhat more diplomatically with Japan. When \nthe San Francisco Board of Education passed an order requiring all \nOriental pupils--there were 93 at the time--to attend a public school \nspecially set aside for them, President Theodore Roosevelt averted a \nforeign policy crisis by persuading the Board to rescind its order in \nexchange for his commitment to negotiate a ``gentlemen's agreement'' \nwith Japan. The agreement of 1907-1908 was actually a series of \ndiplomatic notes in which the Government of Japan voluntarily pledged \nto issue no more passports to coolies going to the mainland of the \nUnited States--coolies being the term for common laborers.\n  The Chinese Exclusion Acts were not repealed until 1943.\n  It was not until 1943 when Chinese immigrants were, for the first \ntime, allowed to become naturalized American citizens. No other group \non Earth has faced this discrimination. In the middle of the Second \nWorld War, we were allies. We were one year from the Bretton Woods \nagreement where China would sit with us and plan the postwar \ninstitutions of the world. Only then did we repeal that exclusion--not \njust in country but from the right of citizenship.\n  Pay heed: This animus continued for the longest while, and sometimes \nfrom the most unexpected places. The term ``coolie labor'' became a \nterm of opprobrium and hostility extending the globe over.\n  Thus, in this past Sunday's New York Times book review came the \nreview of the book, It Didn't Happen Here: Why Socialism Failed in the \nUnited States, by our preeminent political sociologist Seymour Martin \nLipset and Gary Marks, describing how one of the great socialist \nleaders of the early 20th century, a man esteemed in our history and a \nMember of the House of Representatives, had this to say on the floor of \nthe House. I quote the review by David Glenn.\n\n       Milwaukee's best-known Socialist leader, Victor Berger \n     (himself an Austrian Jewish immigrant), delivered a racist \n     harangue on the floor of Congress in 1911 against the \n     immigration of ``modern white coolies . . . Slavians [sic], \n     Italians, Greeks, Russians and Armenians.''\n\n--this from a man who inspired the brotherhood of workers the world \nover.\n  Allow me to quote Representative Berger's statement more fully, as \nreported in the Congressional Record of June 14, 1911.\n\n       While the products of our factories are highly protected, \n     sometimes as highly as 200 percent, the producers of these \n     products are not protected at all. On the contrary, during \n     the last 20 years Slavonians, Italians, Greeks, Russians, and \n     Armenians have been brought into this country by the million. \n     Simply because they have a lower standard of living they have \n     crowded out the Americans, Germans, Englishmen, and Irishmen \n     from the workshops, factories, and mines of our highly \n     protected industries.\n\n  He goes on to compare the wage rates that he believed to have fallen \nin the aftermath of white immigration. As I have said, one of the most \nenlightened\n\n[[Page S7978]]\n\nmen of that age used the term ``modern white coolies.'' That is a part \nof our history. It is time we moved on. I will move on in conclusion to \ntwo points.\n  First, the macroeconomic implications of our trade policy.\n  Discussions of trade policy would be incomplete without mention of \nthe macroeconomic implications of trade policy and the Nation's \npersistent balance of payments deficit--an issue addressed by Wynne \nGodley in ``Drowning In Debt'' a Policy Note recently published by the \nJerome Levy Institute. The issue is somewhat complicated and centers \naround some complex economic interactions. But certain simple \npropositions warrant revisiting.\n  First, the large and persistent balance of payments deficit reflects \nan imbalance between domestic saving and domestic investment. Simply \nput our Nation is not saving enough. The improvement in government \nfinances--moving from deficits of more than 4 percent of GNP to \nsurpluses of more than 2 percent of GNP--have been partially offset by \na decline in private savings. At the same time, an investment boom has \nrequired even more saving. In the short-run, this is not a problem, \nparticularly since the investment boom will yield some dividends in the \nform of higher economic growth.\n  Second, in the long-run, this imbalance cannot continue, particularly \nas we approach the retirement of the baby boom generation. Indeed, it \nwould be more prudent to now run balance of payment surpluses, \nreflecting an abundance of domestic savings, which so to speak can be \ncashed in when the baby boom generation retires.\n  Third, trade policies, such as approving PNTR for China will increase \neconomic efficiency, but may or may not reduce the balance of payments \ndeficit. Only sound domestic policies can do that, for example a \nresponsible fiscal policy that encourages domestic saving including \nbudget surpluses, can reduce the balance of payments deficits.\n  Allow me to close on a personal note. In January 1975, returning from \na posting at U.S. Ambassador to India, I had the great pleasure of \nvisiting Peking--as it then was--as a guest of George and Barbara Bush, \nwho then represented the United States at the capital in a less than \nambassadorial capacity. We had not yet exchanged ambassadors with the \nCommunist regime. I was struck by a number of seeming contradictions. \nThe great Tiananmen Square was dominated by two vast flag poles. At the \ntop of the first were two massive portraits of 19th century hirsute \nVictorian gentlemen, Marx and Engels. The other had portraits of a \nsomewhat mongol looking Stalin and, finally, Mao Zedong, who died in \n1976. The Great Hall of the People, as I wrote later, maintained \nthroughout my visit ``the inert external manner of a post office on \nSunday morning.'' In fact that very week, some 2,864 delegates had \nassembled there for the Fourth Party Congress. A new Constitution was \nadopted, Zhou Enlai was confirmed as Premier. And he declared that \nworld war was inevitable.\n  But that was not the impression one carried away. I have some \nconfidence in what I say as two weeks later I wrote a long ``Letter \nfrom Peking'' for the New Yorker magazine. China, I wrote, ``is a huge \nindustrializing nation.'' Its products were not at that point \noverwhelmingly impressive: ``In sum, Stalinist art and Meiji \nmanufacture.'' Even so, Premier Zhou had predicted that by 1980 China \nwould have a ``relatively comprehensive industrial and economic \nsystem,'' and that by the end of the century this, combined with \nscience and technology, would put her ``in the front ranks of the \nworld.'' Here we are at the end of that century.\n  I came away from Peking convinced that the regime had broken its ties \nwith Moscow. No one with an elementary sense of Eurasian history could \nbelieve they would last much longer. None you might say other than our \nintelligence agencies. Now the cult of Mao has receded. Some years ago \nI was back in what was now Beijing on a CODEL headed by much-loved \nRepublican leader Bob Dole. The portraits atop the flag poles had \nvanished. Mao was consigned to a smallish portrait above an entrance to \nthe Forbidden City on one side of the square. Industry and business \nmoving forward regardless of ideology. At Shanghai the old European \nbanks on the Bund were nominally empty--no exterior signs of any \nactivity within--but were in fact bustling within, banking, as they had \nbeen 60 years earlier.\n  No one should think of the People's Republic as a ``normal'' nation. \nIt has a century of revolutionary past to accommodate to a more settled \nfuture. The potential for estrangement and worse is still there. To the \nextent that trade moderates international tensions, surely we will do \nso; indeed, insist on doing so. Too much is at stake not to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my colleagues on the floor. I note \nthat my colleague from New Mexico was here waiting before I came to the \nfloor and before my friend from Iowa arrived. I know he has an \nimportant short subject matter. He has not been recognized in the \nconsent agreement, and I want to accommodate all.\n  I believe I am entitled to 30 minutes; I expect to be able to \ncomplete my remarks in a shorter period. I want to accommodate the \nSenator from New Mexico. I will speak 20 minutes, and then yield to the \nSenator from Iowa. I ask unanimous consent to follow that outline, if \nit is agreeable to the Members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, this afternoon, we are considering \nwhether to proceed to legislation to establish permanent normal trading \nrelations with China. That's an important issue, and it should be \ndebated.\n  But in the short time remaining this year, we also must answer the \ncall of the American people for real action on key issues of concern to \nworking families. I want to mention briefly and then talk for the few \nmore moments that I have about three specifically.\n  We must raise the minimum wage--with no gimmicks, no poison pills, \nand no bloated tax breaks for the wealthy. We are willing to consider \nsome tax relief for small businesses to offset any burden of raising \nthe minimum wage. But the minimum wage should be the engine for relief \nfor low-wage workers, not the caboose on a massive train of tax breaks \nand antiworker legislation.\n  The latest Republican scheme may raise the minimum wage. But it also \nreduces overtime payments for all workers. Workers all over America are \nsaying that employers are requiring them to work too much overtime. \nUnder the Republican scheme, not only can employers require workers to \nwork more overtime, but employers can pay them less for that overtime.\n  We must pass a real Patients' Bill of Rights--true HMO reform in \nwhich all Americans in managed care plans are protected--not just some, \nas our Republican friends propose.\n  We must strengthen our hate crimes laws. The Senate has passed such \nlegislation on the DOD authorization. It's now up to the Republican \nleadership to decide whether we stand up against hate and bigotry in \nAmerica, or will this Congress just take a pass.\n  We must invest in education in ways that will make a real difference \nfor our children. That means helping local schools hire more teachers \nso we can have smaller class sizes, and a quality\n\n[[Page S7979]]\n\nteacher in every classroom in America. It means partnering with local \nschools to modernize school buildings and build more schools. It means \nincreasing Pell Grants so more young Americans have a chance to go to \ncollege. It means more pre-school and after-school help for parents and \nschools.\n  We must adopt sensible gun controls that keep our communities and our \nschools safe. We should require child safety locks on all guns, and we \nmust close the gun show loophole.\n  We must adopt urgently needed immigration reforms. We must expand the \nvisa quota for skilled workers--the so-called ``H-1B visa.'' And we \nmust adopt new laws to ensure equal treatment under our immigration \nlaws for Latino and other immigrants.\n  Last but not least, we must enact a prescription drug benefit as part \nof the Medicare program. Whenever a senior citizen signs up for \nMedicare, a comprehensive prescription drug benefit should \nautomatically come with it. Senior citizens shouldn't have to battle \nHMOs and insurance companies to get the prescription drugs they need. \nYet, that is what our Republican friends propose.\n  Let's do it right--and do it now. Let's pass a prescription drug \nbenefit as an integral and normal part of the Medicare program, just \nlike hospitalization and doctors' visits.\n  This summer, Congress voted tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans \nand a pay raise for itself, but the Republican leadership has continued \nto block efforts to raise the salaries of America's most underpaid \nworkers--those earning the minimum wage.\n  While Members of this Republican Congress are quick to find time to \nincrease their own salaries and cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans, \nthey have not yet found the time to pass an increase in the minimum \nwage to benefit those hard-working, low-wage Americans. The Republican \nleadership has insisted on doing nothing for those at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder. It is an outrage that Congress would raise its own pay \nbut not the minimum wage.\n  I was pleased to hear during the recess that House Republicans are \nfinally coming around to our way of thinking. Last week, after three \nyears of foot-dragging, Speaker Hastert offered the President a plan to \nraise the minimum wage. This is a positive development, and it gives us \nreal hope that we can raise the pay of the lowest paid workers this \nyear.\n  These low income working families deserve a raise. Their pay has been \nfrozen for three years. Since January 1999 alone, minimum wage workers \nhave now lost $3,000 due to the inaction of Congress. If we fail to \nincrease the minimum wage this year, it will lose all of the value \ngained by the last two increases. Minimum wage earners should not be \nforced to wait any longer for an increase.\n  But we can't use this as an excuse to cut workers' overtime pay, as \nSpeaker Hastert proposes. We can't raise the minimum wage on one hand--\nand cut overtime pay for millions of Americans on the other hand.\n  The typical American family is working more and more hours, according \nto a study released for Labor Day by the Economic Policy Institute \ncalled ``The State of Working America 2000-2001.'' Employees have \nincreasingly been forced to work mandatory overtime--time they would \nrather be spending with their families--and they should be fairly \ncompensated for that work.\n  Several new studies further prove how important a minimum wage \nincrease is. A recent report released by the Economic Policy Institute \nentitled ``The Impact of the Minimum Wage: Policy Lifts Wages, \nMaintains Floor for Low-Wage Labor Market'' reveals that 63 percent of \ngains from a $1 increase in the minimum wage would go to families in \nthe bottom 40 percent of the income distribution. The study also finds \nthat the higher wage raises the incomes of low-wage workers, with no \nevidence of job loss. In addition, the study reports that, among people \nwho will benefit from an increase in the minimum wage, 1.75 million \nworkers are parents with earnings below $25,000 a year.\n  A June 2000 Conference Board report, ``Does A Rising Tide Lift All \nBoats? America's Full-time Working Poor Reap Limited Gains in the New \nEconomy,'' found that poverty has risen among full-time, year round \nworkers since 1973. Lower skilled workers have profited much less from \nthe current economic boom. They have yet to recover from the serious \nerosion of their earnings from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s. The \nnumber of full-time workers in poverty has doubled since the late \n1970s--from about 1.5 million to almost 3 million by 1998. Millions of \npoor children are dependent upon these full-time workers.\n  ``Minimum Wage Careers?'', an August 1999 study by two government \neconomists, found that 12 percent of all workers have spent the first \nten years of their careers within $1 of the minimum wage. 8 percent of \nworkers, predominantly women, minorities, and the less-educated, spend \nat least 50 percent of their first ten post-school years in jobs paying \nless than $1 above the minimum wage. This research demonstrates that \nmillions of workers stay at or near the minimum wage long after their \nentry into the workforce. The minimum wage is not just an ``entry \nlevel'' wage. As the study concludes, ``minimum wage legislation has \nnon-negligible effects on the lifetime opportunities of a significant \nminority of workers.''\n  Raising the minimum wage is not just a labor issue. The minimum wage \nissue is also a family issue. Forty percent of minimum wage workers \nhave families. Parents are spending less and less time with their \nfamilies. Listen to this: 22 hours less a week than they did 30 years \nago, according to a study last year by the Council of Economic \nAdvisers. As reflected in a report released by the Economic Policy \nInstitute last week, an average middle-class family in 1998 spend 6.8 \npercent more time at work then it did in 1989. These extra hours at \nwork mean that parents have less time to spend with their children.\n  Raising the minimum wage issue is also a children's issue. Thirty-\nthree percent of minimum wage earners are parents with children under \n18. Over 8 million children living in poverty live in working poor \nfamilies. The Children's Defense Fund recently released a report called \n``The State of America's Children 2000.'' A chapter on Family Income \nexplains that if ``recent patterns persist, one out of every three \nchildren born in 2000 will have spent at least a year in poverty by his \nor her 18th birthday.'' The inadequate pay of these workers is the \nreason why 33 percent of all poor children, or 4.3 million children, in \n1998 were poor despite living in a family where someone worked full-\ntime, year-round. Children who grow up in poor families face a much \nhigher risk of poor health, high rates of learning disabilities and \ndevelopmental delays, and poor school achievement and they are far more \nlikely to end up in poverty themselves.\n  Raising the minimum wage is also a civil rights issue. A \ndisproportionate share of minorities will be affected by an increase in \nthe minimum wage. While African Americans represent 12 percent of the \ntotal workforce, they represent 16 percent of those who would benefit \nfrom a minimum wage increase. Only 11 percent of the workforce is \nHispanic, but 19 percent of those who would directly affected by an \nincrease in the minimum wage are Hispanic.\n  Raising the minimum wage is also a women's issue. Sixty percent of \nminimum wage earners are women. The workers affected by an increase in \nthe minimum wage are concentrated in female-dominated occupations.\n  Above all, raising the minimum wage is a fairness issue. Minimum wage \nearners, such as waitresses and teacher's aides, childcare workers, and \nelder care workers, deserve to be paid fairly for the work that they \ndo. They should not be forced into poverty for doing the work that is \nso important to the citizens of the Nation.\n  In this period of unprecedented economic prosperity, the 10 million \nworkers at the bottom of the economic ladder who will benefit from \nraising the minimum wage should not be forced to wait any longer for \nthe fair increase they deserve.\n  Each day we fail to raise the minimum wage, families across the \ncounty continue to fall farther behind. Two facts tell the story. The \nminimum wage would have to be $7.66 an hour today--instead of its \ncurrent level of $5.15--to have the same purchasing power it had in \n1968. If wages had kept pace with worker productivity gains\n\n[[Page S7980]]\n\nover the last twenty-five years, the minimum wage would have to be \n$8.79 today.\n  We heard a great deal about opposition to the increase in minimum \nwage because we are not getting increases in productivity. No economy \nhas ever had the dramatic increases in productivity as we have had, Mr. \nPresident. If we tied those increases in productivity to where the \nminimum wage should be, it would be at $8.79 instead of $5.15.\n  These disgraceful disparities show how far we have fallen short in \nguaranteeing that low-income workers receive their fair share of the \nnation's prosperity. No one--no one--who works for a living should have \nto live in poverty.\n  We are not going to go away or back down. We have bipartisan support \nfor this increase. It is long past time for this Congress to pass a \nfair minimum wage bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S7980-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7980-S7981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      PROTECTING AGAINST HMO ABUSES AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BENEFIT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we enter the final weeks of the 106th \nCongress and the home stretch of the Presidential campaign, two health \nissues demand immediate action--protecting patients against the abuses \nof HMOs and other health insurance plans and providing coverage of \nprescription drugs under Medicare for senior citizens. The American \npeople deserve action on each of these issues from this Congress. The \nposition of the two Presidential candidates on these issues has become \na key factor in determining whether they are truly committed to serving \nthe needs of the American people, and the position of every member of \nCongress on these issues is important for the same reason.\n  With regard to the Patients' Bill of Rights, last week, ABC began to \nair a documentary series--``Hopkins 24/7''--that vividly illustrates \nonce again the need for prompt action to end HMO abuses. Hopkins 24/7 \nis a documentary on life at one of the nation's finest hospitals--Johns \nHopkins. The documentary is the result of three months of intensive \nfilming. The first segment, shown on August 30, showed American \nmedicine at its best, and the abuses by managed care at their worst.\n  A 14-year-old girl, Tiffanie Salvadia, sought care from Johns Hopkins \nfor her cancer of the uterus. The diagnosis had been delayed for six \ncritical weeks because crucial tests were not ordered by her HMO \nphysicians. When Tiffanie finally reached Johns Hopkins, the cancer had \nspread from her uterus, raising the risk of this serious illness even \nfurther. When Tiffany finally reached an institution capable of giving \nher the quality care she needed, the problems with her HMO were not \nover: Authorization for a vital test was needed, but the hospital was \nunable to contact the HMO for the authorization. Fortunately, Hopkins \nsimply went ahead and performed the test, and hoped that the hospital \nmight be able to obtain payment later.\n  Tiffanie ultimately received fine care from Hopkins, and her chances \nof recovery from the cancer now seem good. But her favorable prognosis \nis no thanks to her HMO. Here is what Dr. Paul Colombani, the \noncologist at Hopkins, had to say about Tiffanie's case and about his \nexperience with managed care generally.\n  On the difficulty in getting the test authorized, he said, ``I have \nto do the diagnosis codes and the procedure codes. And we have to \nsubmit them to the insurance company ahead of time. And they have to \nsay yea or nay. We're not going to do this. You have to do that. I \nthink it is ridiculous that a high school clerk should be telling me \nthat I can or cannot do an operation on a patient.''\n  On the delay in getting Tiffanie an accurate diagnosis and treatment, \nthe doctor said, ``We see delays in diagnosis because of the \ninadequacies of the managed care system all the time. And for . . . the \n.1 percent of patients where it turns out to be a life and death \nsituation, they just look at that as the price of doing business. It's \npathetic. In October or September, or whatever, that was the time to do \nthat surgery. Now we're playing catch up.''\n  Perhaps the most heart-rending comment came from Tiffanie's mother. \nIt is a comment that any parent who has ever had a child with a serious \nillness can understand. She said, ``My daughter has cancer. I want to \nconcentrate on her, and getting her better and not have to worry about \nif I have a referral for this or a referral for that.''\n  ``I want to concentrate on her.'' That should be the right of any \nparent whose child is seriously ill. But today, because of the abuses \nof the insurance industry, it is not a right--it is a privilege of the \nfortunate few.\n  Whether the issue is diagnostic tests, specialty care, emergency room \ncare, access to clinical trials, availability of needed drugs, \nprotection of doctors who give patients their best possible advice, or \nwomen's ability to obtain gynecological services--too often, in all \nthese cases, HMOs and managed care plans make the company's bottom line \nmore important than the patient's vital signs. These abuses should have \nno place in American medicine. Every doctor knows it. Every patient \nknows it. And in their hearts, every Member of Congress knows it.\n  Almost 11 months ago, the House of Representatives passed the \nbipartisan Norwood-Dingell bill to end these abuses. It is endorsed by \n300 groups of doctors, nurses, patients, and advocates for women, \nchildren, and families. It is supported by virtually every medical \ngroup in this country. It passed by an overwhelming bipartisan \nmajority. It should have sailed through the Senate of the United \nStates. But it continues to languish because the Republican leadership \ncontinues to put a higher priority on protecting industry profits than \non protecting patients.\n  We have come close to successful passage. On June 8th, the Norwood-\nDingell bill fell just one vote short of passage in the full Senate. It \nwas supported by every Democratic Senator--and only four Republican \nSenators.\n  The American people deserve action before this Congress ends. Every \nday we delay, more patients suffer. The Patients' Bill of Rights is one \nof the most important issues facing this Congress--facing every family, \ntoo. There is no question where Vice-President Al Gore stands. If \nGovernor Bush supported patients' rights and were willing to show the \nleadership that the American people have the right to expect in a \nPresidential candidate, this legislation would clearly pass the Senate. \nBut on this issue, Governor Bush has failed to show the leadership we \nneed.\n  I still believe that enactment of strong, effective legislation is \npossible this year. I am here to serve notice to the Senate today, that \nthere will be new votes on this issue before we adjourn. I am hopeful \nthat we will be successful. The American people are waiting for \nrelief--and we owe it to them to act.\n  On Medicare prescription drugs, the second major issue of health \nreform facing us is insurance coverage of prescription drugs under \nMedicare.\n  After a year of full-time campaigning, Governor Bush today has \nfinally offered a specific prescription drug plan for the consideration \nof the American people. Unfortunately, that plan is an empty promise \nfor senior citizens. It is not Medicare--and it is not adequate. It is \npart of a broad plan to make regressive changes in Medicare that will \nraise premiums, force senior citizens to join HMOs, and further a \nradical right-wing program of privatization. And drug benefits would \nnot even be available to most senior citizens for four years.\n  Senior citizens need a drug benefit under Medicare. They earned it by \na lifetime of hard work. They deserve it, and it is time for Congress \nto enact it. The clock is running out on this Congress, but it is not \ntoo late for the House and Senate to act. The Administration and Vice \nPresident Gore have proposed one. So have Democrats in Congress. And we \nintend to assure that the Congress will vote on a real prescription \ndrug program this month. The American people deserve action, and we \nintend to see that they get it.\n  Too many elderly Americans today must choose between food on the \ntable and the medicine they need to stay healthy or to treat their \nillnesses. Too many senior citizens take half the pills their doctor \nprescribes, or don't even fill needed prescriptions--because they can't \nafford the high cost of prescription drugs.\n\n  Too many seniors are paying twice as much as they should for the \ndrugs they need, because they are forced to pay full price, while \nalmost everyone with a private insurance policy benefits from \nnegotiated discounts.\n\n[[Page S7981]]\n\n  In the face of declining coverage and soaring costs, more and more \nsenior citizens are being left out and left behind. The vast majority \nof the elderly are of moderate means. They cannot possibly afford to \npurchase the prescription drugs they need if serious illness strikes.\n  The older they are, the more likely they are to be in poor health, \nand the more likely they are to have very limited income to meet their \nhealth needs.\n  Few if any issues facing this Congress are more important than giving \nthe nation's senior citizens the health security they have been \npromised. The promise of Medicare will not be fulfilled until Medicare \nprotects senior citizens against the high cost of prescription drugs, \nin the same way that it protects them against the high cost of hospital \ncare and doctor care.\n  Vice President Gore has been fighting for prescription drug coverage \nunder Medicare since 1993. President Bill Clinton has called for \nimmediate action in his last two State of the Union Addresses.\n  The Administration has put a solid program on the table for the \nconsideration of Congress--and their program is affordable for senior \ncitizens and also for the federal budget--because they do not use the \nsurplus for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the \nwealthy.\n  The Bush plan is not adequate and it is not Medicare. In fact, he has \nalso endorsed a regressive plan to change Medicare in a way that will \nraise premiums and force senior citizens to join HMOs.\n  That is not the kind of Medicare the American people want, and it's \nnot the kind of prescription drug benefit they want either.\n  Under Bush's version of Medicare reform, the premiums paid by senior \ncitizens for conventional Medicare could increase by as much as 47% in \nthe first year and continue to grow over time, according to the \nnonpartisan Medicare actuaries. The elderly would face an unacceptable \nchoice between premiums they can afford and giving up their family \ndoctor by joining an HMO.\n  Senior citizens already have the right to choose between conventional \nMedicare and private insurance options that may offer additional \nbenefits. The difference between what senior citizens have today and \nwhat George Bush is proposing is not the difference between choice and \nbureaucracy--it's the difference between choice and coercion--driven by \na right-wing agenda of privatization. On this ground alone, it deserves \nrejection, regardless of its provisions for covering prescription \ndrugs.\n  But the program to cover prescription drugs is equally flawed--so \nflawed that it is an empty promise for millions of senior citizens. To \nbegin with, the value of the Bush program to senior citizens is only \none-half of what Vice President Gore has proposed. The reason is \nobvious--after massive tax breaks for the wealthy, there is not room in \nthe Bush budget for adequate prescription drug coverage for senior \ncitizens.\n  The Bush plan provides little help to the vast majority of senior \ncitizens who are not poor, but are of modest means and cannot afford \nlarge drug expenses or large increases in Medicare premiums. Under the \nBush plan, these seniors have to pay three-quarters of the cost of \ntheir prescription drug coverage--and the coverage is not even \nadequate.\n  In the entire history of Medicare, senior citizens have never been \nasked to pay such a high share of the cost of the premiums for any \nbenefit.\n  The defects in the Bush plan go far beyond the inadequacy of the \nbenefits. It is a program that only a drug company executive could \nlove. For the first four years, there is no Medicare benefit at all, \njust a program of block grants to the states for providing coverage for \nlow income senior citizens. Senior citizens want Medicare, not welfare, \nand they deserve Medicare, not welfare.\n  When the Bush plan finally becomes available to all seniors, it does \nnot provide a real Medicare benefit--or any other adequate \nbenefit. Instead, it gives senior citizens what is, in effect, a \nvoucher--and it tells them to go out and buy their own coverage from a \nprivate insurance company. If the price is too high in the area in \nwhich they live, they are out of luck. If the drug company's list of \napproved drugs does not include the medicine they need, their only \nrecourse is a time-consuming appeal. There is no defined benefit--\nsenior citizens are not even guaranteed the same coverage in Missouri \nthat they would get in Mississippi. It is all up to the insurance \ncompany.\n\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that under \nthe similar Republican plan passed by the House of Representatives, \nbenefits would be so inadequate and costs so high that less than half \nof the senior citizens who need help the most--those who have no \nprescription drug coverage today--will even participate.\n  A prescription drug benefit that leaves out half of the senior \ncitizens who need protection the most is not a serious plan to help \nsenior citizens.\n  It is ironic that in offering this inadequate plan, Mr. Bush has \ncriticized Vice President Gore for a ``big-government, one-size-fits-\nall'' solution. The Gore plan covers prescription drugs under Medicare \nin exactly the same way that Medicare covers doctor and hospital costs. \nMr. Bush obviously feels this is a one-size-fits all solution. That is \nwhy he has endorsed an extreme restructuring of the Medicare program. \nHe may favor forcing the elderly into HMOs, but that is not what \nDemocrats in Congress support. That's not what Vice President Gore \nsupports. Most important, that's not what the American people support.\n  There is still time for Congress to enact a genuine prescription drug \nbenefit under Medicare. The Administration has presented a strong \nproposal. Let's work together to enact it this year. It is not too \nlate. The American people are waiting for an answer.\n  I am hopeful we will pass that legislation. Again, I am strongly \ncommitted, as I believe my colleagues, Senator Daschle and others are, \nto ensure we will have an opportunity to vote on that measure before we \nadjourn.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S7981-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7981-S7983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TO AUTHORIZE EXTENSION OF NONDISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT TO THE PEOPLE'S \n            REPUBLIC OF CHINA--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we started earlier today the initial \ndiscussion of what I call the China trade bill, the Senate by law \nratifying the agreement that has been worked out by this administration \nand the Government of China to level the playing field for trade \nbetween the United States and China.\n  In a simple form, the bill before us will give access for U.S. \nexporters--meaning manufacturing, services and agriculture--to China on \nthe same basis that China has had access to our markets for the last 15 \nto 20 years.\n  When you have an opportunity for our people to export to China, to \nsell to China, on the same basis that China has been able to do with \nthe United States, it is a win-win situation. My Midwestern common \nsense tells me this is a good situation for America. So that debate has \nstarted today.\n  We are on the question of the motion to proceed. I support this \nmotion. I hope we get to a final vote on the bill, because I think it \nwill pass by an overwhelming margin, not the very narrow margin that it \npassed in the House of Representatives. This will give us an enhanced \nopportunity to do business with 20 percent of the world's population.\n  There are many reasons I support this bill, which is probably one of \nthe most important matters to come before the Senate this session. But \ntoday, I would like to address just two reasons. The first is the issue \nof jobs, a very positive aspect to this legislation. The second is \nhuman rights, which some people view as a reason for being against this \nlegislation. I suggest to you that even though the human rights \nsituation in China is not good, trade gives us an opportunity to \nimprove that human rights situation.\n  In each case, I want to address concerns of real people in a \ncommonsense way. Too often, when we talk about major policy changes, we \ndo so in lofty terms, not connected to the people's concerns and their \ninterests, and what is important to everyday working Americans.\n\n[[Page S7982]]\n\n  Today, I would like to talk about how real people will be affected by \nmaking it possible for the United States to take advantage of China's \npending accession to the World Trade Organization.\n  Lowering protectionist tariffs and tearing down trade barriers that \ndiscriminate against American products will create many thousands of \nnew American jobs. A new era of free trade with China, under the WTO \nWorld Trade Organization disciplines, will help us continue to build \nthe tremendous prosperity that we enjoy as a direct result--a very \ndirect result--of the success of our postwar trading system; going back \nto 1947, as we have used the gradual freeing up of trade around the \nworld to expand the world economic pie. Because of free trade, with a \npopulation that is now about double what it was back then, we now have \nmore prosperity for more people. If we had not expanded the world \neconomic pie, we would, in fact, have less for our increased world \npopulation. So think in terms of the economic enhancement of \nindividuals and the political stability that comes from it.\n  In my State of Iowa, we know our economic interdependence with the \nrest of the world is not a policy choice; it is a fact. Trade means \njobs anywhere, but particularly in my State. In just 5 years, Iowa's \nmerchandise export to China has soared 35 percent.\n  In the Waterloo-Cedar Falls area--that is close to where I was born, \nand where I have lived my entire life--recent merchandise sales to \nChina have surged 806 percent. Iowa's trade-related jobs mean that a \nyoung couple can afford their first home. They can afford tuition for \nschool. They can afford to buy a car. They can afford to care for their \nfamilies, the way working people want to care for their families.\n  But unless we seize this moment, this opportunity will pass us by. \nWhen China enters the World Trade Organization, which it will do \nregardless of the outcome of this vote on the Senate floor--and if we \ndo not remove all of our current conditions on trade with China, which \nthis bill does--other countries will reap the rewards of a trade deal \nthat we helped negotiate. American companies then would be forced to \nsit on the sidelines as companies from the European Union or Asia or \nAfrica or elsewhere take our business and ultimately take our jobs \nbecause we have not assumed this opportunity of freer trade with China.\n  If we pass up this opportunity, America will be at the end of the \nline of the 137 other WTO countries, that will be standing in front of \nus, trading with China.\n  I want to give my colleagues two real-life examples from my State of \nIowa.\n  Tucker Manufacturing Company is a family-owned business in Cedar \nRapids, Iowa, that has developed a unique window-washing system which \nit makes and sells around the world. Tucker has made a few small sample \nsales to China and has found a distributor that would like to make a \nlarge order. Tucker knows that in the past state-owned distribution \ncompanies in China have dictated commercial terms that have often \nharmed exporting companies like Tucker. They would like to see China \nbecome a World Trade Organization member so that distribution rights \nare no longer strictly controlled by the state, meaning the country and \nGovernment of China, and so that any new transactions in China then are \nprotected by the rule of law, which is what the World Trade \nOrganization regime is all about--the rule of law, predictability in \ninternational trade, the resolving of disputes in international trade.\n  A second example from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, is the Diamond V Mills \nCompany, which I visited just last week. I had the opportunity to \npresent it with the Commerce Department's E-Star Award for excellence \nin exports. They had already received the E award, now they have the E-\nStar award that indicates they have been highly successful in \ninternational trade on an ongoing basis.\n  Diamond V Mills has exported its yeast culture feed ingredients to \nChina since 1996, but they did it by operating through a local \ndistributor. The company wants to sell directly to its end user but has \nnot been able to do so--until this agreement goes through--due to \nChina's current restrictions on a foreign company's rights to \ndistribute its products in China.\n  Under the WTO accession agreement, China has committed to opening its \nmarkets to the private distribution networks that Diamond V Mills of \nCedar Rapids needs. If Diamond V Mills can get access to new \ndistribution networks in China, it will generate more sales, earn more \nrevenue, provide more jobs in Iowa, create more opportunity and more \nprosperity for everybody.\n  These are only two examples of how Iowa's manufacturing sector will \nbenefit through expanded trade with China. There are many more. We have \nIowa's farmers and agricultural producers seeing tremendous benefits \nfrom this proposal as well because China's World Trade Organization \naccession agreement will dramatically lower agricultural tariffs and \neliminate many nontariff trade barriers. As a result, our farmers will \nsell more soybeans and more soy oil to China than ever before.\n  After the United States, China is the second largest consumer of corn \nand corn products in the world. As the distinguished Presiding Officer \nknows, my State is No. 1 in the production of corn in the United \nStates, as his State is No. 1 in the production of wheat.\n  China's WTO commitments will create a great export opportunity for \nIowa's corn growers and for corn growers across the United States.\n  Iowa State University professor Dermot Hayes recently told my \ninternational trade subcommittee that if China fully implements its WTO \naccession commitments we could see hog prices rise by as much as $5 per \nhead. That is a larger benefit than any of the Government support \nprograms we have heard about lately.\n  Unlike some of the proposals I have heard, we would not have to \nimpair our obligations under the WTO's subsidies agreement, or the WTO \nagriculture agreement, to do it.\n  Second, I want to discuss the issue of human rights and political \nfreedoms in China because this is a legitimate issue, even though I \ndisagree with the argument that killing this bill is going to help \nhuman rights in China. I wish to make it clear I don't find fault with \nthose who bring it up as part of this debate because I think wherever \nwe can try to say to China that they are going down the wrong road on \nhuman rights, they are hurting their country, not us.\n  Like all Americans, Iowans care deeply about the struggle for \nliberty. Many have family members who have given their lives in \nfreedom's cause, or they know someone who has. It hurts us to hear \nhorrible accounts of repression. We are rightly repelled. We don't \nunderstand why it happens, and we want it to change because we think \nfreedom is an innate right for the Chinese as well as for Americans. \nBut the fact is, we can never turn China into a model of constitutional \ndemocracy if we isolate them economically. However, we can help bring \nabout fundamental reform in China's economy and political structure \nthrough enforceable WTO rules that do not discriminate and are \nconsistent and are not arbitrary.\n  In addition, I have a firm conviction that regardless of how \nnecessary a political and rule of law environment is for trade to take \nplace and political leaders such as the President of the United States \nand other people negotiating with the Chinese, none of those efforts, \nas important as they are, can compare to the opportunities for \nadvancing political freedom and human rights that will come when \nmillions of American businesspeople interact with millions of Chinese \nbusinesspeople on a day-to-day basis. That is going to do more to \nimprove human rights than anything else.\n  When it comes to making decisions, the WTO applies the democratic \nprinciple of consensus rule. All of these principles--democratic \ndecisionmaking, nondiscrimination, nonarbitrary regulation--are also \nthe obvious, essential ingredients of political freedom. The process of \neconomic reform, guided by China's WTO commitments, will mean that \nChina will become more open. They will eventually become more free. We \nknow, perhaps better than any nation on Earth, that economic and \npolitical freedoms share deep roots.\n  That economic and political rights go hand in hand is at the heart of \nAmerica's constitutional heritage. Many in\n\n[[Page S7983]]\n\nChina know that economic and political reform are closely linked as \nwell. That is why many of China's military hardliners oppose China's \nentry into the World Trade Organization.\n  Perhaps it is this inevitable linking between economic reform and \npolitical freedom that has inspired the Dalai Lama, no stranger to \nChina's religious repression, to say:\n\n       I have always stressed that China should not be isolated. \n     China must be brought into the mainstream of the world \n     community. . . .\n\n  To those who doubt that economic reform has occurred in China, or \nthat it is significant, I ask them to consider how much has changed in \nthe last half century. You will remember that in 1952, China's \nCommunist government mounted a wide-ranging crusade to undermine \nprivate entrepreneurs, businesspeople were commonly condemned as \n``counterrevolutionaries,'' and many were assessed large fines and \nforced out of business.\n  In fact, by 1956, China required all private firms to be jointly \nowned and, in fact, run by the government. In practice, this meant that \nwe had state control of all private enterprise in China. It wasn't \nuntil the early 1980s that private enterprise began to reemerge in \nChina. More significantly, it wasn't until 1988 that the private \neconomy even had a defined legal status in China.\n\n  Today, 12 years later, China is a different country. Today, young \nChinese engineers who studied and worked in California's Silicon Valley \nare going back to China, lured by entrepreneurial opportunities that \ndidn't even exist a few years ago.\n  The number of individuals employed by the private sector in China has \nsoared by over 31 percent in the last 3 years. That is bad news for \nChina's state-owned enterprises. That happens to also be bad news for \nChina's People's Liberation Army, which depends on many state-run \nbusinesses for revenue and have opposed these reforms that are going on \nwithin China, including this agreement before the Senate.\n  But this development is good news for the cause of freedom. As the \nnumber of individuals employed in the private sector rises, the state \nwill have less and less direct control over how people think and how \npeople react to political change.\n  Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Edward Steinfeld is \none of our country's keenest scholars on what goes on in China. This is \nwhat he had to say about the meaning of China's World Trade \nOrganization concessions on China's direction as a country:\n\n       The concessions of 1999 represented a thorough reversal of \n     course. Instead of reform serving to sustain the core, the \n     core itself would be destroyed to save reform, along with the \n     growth, prosperity, and stability reform has brought to \n     China.\n       In the new view, instead of using market forces to save \n     state socialism, state socialism itself would have to be \n     sacrificed to preserve the market economy.\n\n  I agree with Professor Steinfeld. China's membership in the World \nTrade Organization will require it to reform a very large portion of \nits economy, and not only to comply with WTO rules, but to be able to \ncompete internationally.\n  With a ``yes'' vote on the motion to proceed and a ``yes'' vote on \napproving permanent normal trading status for China, we can help change \nthe world. China constitutes one-fifth of the world's population. We \ncan be on the right side of history. We ought to be on the right side \nof history. I urge a vote for this motion to proceed and a vote of yes \non final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I haven't had the opportunity yet today \nto welcome all of our colleagues back and to express my hope that we \nuse this next period as productively and as successfully as we can.\n  As have most of my colleagues, I had the opportunity to spend a good \ndeal of time at home in South Dakota for the last 3 weeks.\n  I especially want to commend the Forest Service for the extraordinary \njob they have done in fighting historically the most consequential fire \nwe have had in the State now, with 85,000 acres of timberland burned. I \nam grateful for the response we have had from people all over the \ncountry. I especially thank the Forest Service, the Governor of the \nState of South Dakota, William Janklow, for the remarkable job he has \ndone, the National Guard for their response, and the volunteer fire \ndepartments from all over the State of South Dakota and surrounding \nregion.\n  We are grateful for their extraordinary response, and we are grateful \nas well for the effort that has been made to contain the fire which is \nnow 85-percent contained.\n  I thank the volunteer ambulance personnel whom I met from all over \nthe State. We are experiencing what many of our colleagues are \nexperiencing with volunteer ambulance service. Many of them are on the \nverge of going out of business because of reimbursement schedules for \nMedicare and Medicaid. Without those, especially in rural areas, we are \nin a very serious set of circumstances involving the health and in many \ncases the lives of people who live in rural areas today.\n  I thank those in schools all over South Dakota who opened their doors \nand their offices to me in Kadoka, White River, Lemmon, and most of our \nIndian reservations in Belle Fourche. I thank them.\n  I thank those who especially were willing to meet with me on hospital \nreimbursement and appreciate very much their willingness to talk about \nhow serious the circumstances were with regard to Medicare \nreimbursement for hospitals and clinics throughout our State.\n  I must say, at virtually every one of our stops we had occasion to \ntalk about the unfinished agenda here in the Senate. I want to talk \njust briefly about that prior to the time we turn to another important \npiece of legislation, the energy and water bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S7983-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7983-S7985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNATTENDED LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there is great concern about unattended \nlegislation, legislation having to do with health care, education, \nmeaningful gun safety, and minimum wage. There is no legitimate reason \nwe could not have accomplished something on each of the issues I have \nmentioned and many more.\n  There is no legitimate reason this Congress couldn't have passed a \nreal Patients' Bill of Rights long before this.\n  There is no good reason we couldn't have added a voluntary Medicare \nprescription drug benefit.\n  There is no reason we couldn't have agreed by now to strengthen our \nchildren's schools. We have had many opportunities. There are those who \nsay that passing bills is hard work.\n  If you want to see real hard work, go to Murdo, South Dakota some \nday. Talk to Cathy Cheney and the five other members of her volunteer \nambulance squad.\n  They are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. When a call comes \nin--even if it's in the middle of the night--they drop whatever they're \ndoing, leave their jobs and families, and go. Most times, they are not \nback for at least 3 hours.\n  When they're not answering calls, they're studying for certification \ntests. And they don't get paid a dime for any of it. That is hard work, \nMr. President. And it is not just South Dakotans who face challenges \nlike this.\n  Go to any community in any state in America, and you'll find people \nwho are working hard--some of them are working two and three jobs--to \nmake a decent life for themselves and their families, and to give \nsomething back to their communities.\n\n[[Page S7984]]\n\n  You will find older people who worked hard for 40 and 50 years, who \nare retired now. They are not asking us to do the impossible.\n  They are not asking us to make unreasonable concessions. All they are \nasking is that we make a good-faith effort to solve the problems these \nfamilies are dealing with today and who face the challenging months and \nyears when they must examine, address, and answer problems in their own \nlives.\n\n  When the 106th Congress began, many of us had great hopes about what \nwe could accomplish.\n  We had had budget surpluses 2 years in a row and were on our way to a \nthird year--something that hadn't happened in 50 years. The economy was \nsetting record after record.\n  After years of having to downsize our dreams because of the deficit, \nAmericans were finally in a position to start hoping again, and \ntackling some of the big challenges facing working families.\n  Nearly 2 years later, almost none of those hopes has been met.\n  As we near the end of this Congress, it appears increasingly likely \nthat they will not be met. One reason for that is, frankly, our less \nthan ambitious legislative schedule. If we adjourn, as planned, on \nOctober 6, the Senate will have been in session for a total of just 115 \ndays this year. That is 115 out of 365.\n  By any objective measure, that is not exactly breaking a sweat. In \nfact, it is the lightest Senate schedule since 1956. It is only 2 days \nmore than the infamous do-nothing Congress of 1948. But the calendar is \nnot the only reason we have achieved so little.\n  A more significant, and troubling, reason for this Congress' inaction \nhas been the absolute refusal by Republican leaders in both houses to \npass the people's agenda.\n  For 2 years, majority leaders in both houses have used their \nnumerical advantage, and every parliamentary trick they could find, to \nprevent us from passing a real Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Despite the fact that there is an overwhelming majority in the \nCongress and an overwhelming majority of the American people who want \ncampaign finance reform, Republican leaders in both Houses have \nprevented us from passing the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  Despite pleas from the victims of the Columbine tragedy and more than \na million moms who came to Washington to petition Congress, Republican \nleaders have repeatedly refused to pass reasonable gun safety measures.\n  They oppose our plan for affordable prescription drug coverage. They \noppose our plan to strengthen our children's schools by making classes \nsmaller and schools safer and setting higher standards.\n  For 2 years, they even opposed raising the minimum wage by $1 over 2 \nyears. Now some of our Republican colleagues in the other body say they \nmight be willing to do this but only if we include tens of billions of \ndollars worth of tax cuts for the wealthiest in the country. Why can't \nwe just do the right thing? Why can't we just raise the minimum wage $1 \nan hour over 2 years without having to spend tens of billions of \ndollars on new tax breaks for people who need them the least?\n  Instead of working to pass a people's agenda, our Republican \ncolleagues have spent most of the last 2 years pursuing one goal: \nCutting taxes the wrong way, creating huge new tax breaks at the \nexpense of everything and everyone else.\n  This week we will lose more time and more opportunities because they \ninsist on trying to override the President's vetoes on their so-called \nmarriage penalty and estate tax bills. Never mind that 60 percent of \nthe cost of their marriage penalty has nothing to do with fixing the \nmarriage penalty. Never mind their estate tax bill benefits only the \nwealthiest 2 percent of estates. Never mind that neither bill will help \nmiddle-class families. In fact, they will hurt ordinary Americans by \neating up the expected surplus, money we need for other things.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle clearly think their tax \ncuts are good politics. They just hope the American people accept their \nspin and don't check the facts.\n  Despite the history of this Congress, my colleagues and I have not \ngiven up hope for its future. Five weeks is not a lot of time, but it \nis enough time. Even given the time we must spend on appropriations \nbills and the China trade legislation, there is still enough time for \nthis Congress to solve some of the problems real people talk about and \nworry about outside of Washington.\n  In 1948, Republicans held their Presidential nominating convention in \nPhiladelphia. At that convention they endorsed a platform filled with \nall kinds of measures a Republican Congress had spent the previous 2 \nyears blocking. Back then there was no September session of Congress. \nIt went from the convention to the campaign trail. President Truman was \nso amazed by what he heard in Philadelphia, he ordered Congress back \nfor a special session. He told Members: There is still time before the \nelection. If you really believe what you say, pass your platform and I \nwill sign it.\n  Last month, our Republican friends held another nominating convention \nin Philadelphia, the first time they have been back since 1948. Once \nagain, they claim to support all kinds of things Republicans in this \nCongress have spent the last 2 years fighting. We have a request for \nour friends across the aisle, right now, tonight. There are still 5 \nweeks left in this Congress. Let's use this time to do the things you \nsaid in Philadelphia you support. Let's pass a responsible budget that \npays down the debt, protects Social Security and Medicare, and invests \nin America's future. Let's cut taxes for working families. Let's \nstrengthen our children's schools and protect our children from gun \nviolence. Let's raise the minimum wage $1 an hour over 2 years. Let's \nfinally pass a prescription drug benefit and a real Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  We were pleased by what we heard in Philadelphia about prescription \ndrugs and a Patients' Bill of Rights. We are more pleased with the \ncommercial running in Rhode Island. That commercial, paid for by the \nRepublican Senate Committee, praised Senator Chafee for.\n\n       . . . voting against his own party and for a real Patients' \n     Bill of Rights . . . and a prescription-drug benefit that \n     gives seniors the drugs they need at a price they can afford.\n\n  Both of those plans referred to in that ad are our plans. We intend \nto give our colleagues a chance to make that record match the rhetoric \nbefore this Congress ends. We will start by offering the bipartisan \nNorwood-Dingell Patients' Bill of Rights the first chance we get. There \nis no reason the American people should have to wait until next \nCongress for a real Patients' Bill of Rights. It is time to stop \nstalling. It is time for an up-or-down vote in this Senate on the \nDingell-Norwood Patients' Bill of Rights bill. We also intend to give \nour colleagues the chance to support a voluntary affordable \nprescription drug benefit. If they really believe in these things, they \nwill have the opportunity to work with this side to pass them. Let's \nschedule the vote. We will support them, and the President will sign \nthem.\n  We spend far too much time in this Congress talking about things that \ndon't matter for working families and avoiding the problems that do \nmatter. The progress we had hoped to make at the beginning of this \nCongress is still within our reach. Let's not waste another day. Let's \nwork hard in these next 5 weeks on the issues I have mentioned, into \nthe night and through the weekends if we have to. Let's not give up \nuntil we have honestly said we have done what the American people sent \nus here to do.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes to comment on the \ncomments of Senator Daschle after a few brief remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, clearly I appreciate the distinguished \nminority leader's cooperation in getting this bill up. I appreciate the \ntone of his comments in that he desires apparently to get this bill and \nother bills passed. I hope that is true. I say to the Senate, I will do \nmy best to try to finish this bill tomorrow night. I don't know of a \nlot of real difficult amendments. There are some important amendments \nfor regions of the country and otherwise. Clearly, I have seen no \namendments thus far that attack the substance of this bill which I will \nexplain shortly.\n  Mr. President, what is not said by the minority leader, in an effort \nto analyze the entire Presidential election and\n\n[[Page S7985]]\n\nwhat is going on here in the Congress as of this moment, first, on tax \nreform measures that the Republicans have proposed, call them what you \nmay. Of course, the distinguished Senator, minority leader, chooses to \ncall them so-called marriage penalty reform.\n  Between 35 and 45 million American couples are affected by that bill. \nAffected how? Their taxes will go down for no other reason than we will \neliminate a penalty currently imposed just because they are married. \nWhether we have some other people covered in it or not, let me suggest \nwe know what it will cost in 5 years. We know what it will cost in 10 \nyears to the Treasury if we give back a little bit of money to the \nmarried couples in America who are getting taxed extra just because \nthey are married.\n  What else did we pass? We passed a 10-year phase-in of the death tax. \nSurely those on the other side know that by definition the only people \nwho pay a death tax--that is, a tax on death--are people who have \naccumulated some assets. So they could all be called rich. Essentially, \nthe current law of America says if, after your mother and father have \nworked their whole lives and have acquired four drugstores and own a \nhouse and have invested in a piece of property, if that ends up being \n$10 million--I am speaking to Americans who might have worked 40 \nyears--right now the Government can take as much as 65 percent of it \nupon their death.\n  That is the question. Is that right? Does America want that? Or \nshould we ask our President to sign a bill that phases that out over 10 \nyears?\n  I happen to have looked at numbers to see how they relate one to \nanother in this budget process. My estimates are as follows: Both of \nthose taxes combined cannot be risky to America.\n  Why can't they be? Because they amount to somewhere between 10 \npercent and 12 percent of the surplus--10 percent to 12 percent of the \nsurplus, the non-Social Security surplus which is $3.4 trillion.\n  The same people who say that is risky have on the table at least five \nnew programs that will spend more of the surplus than those two tax \ncuts. Are those programs therefore risky, because they spend more of \nthe Federal surplus than these two tax reform measures? No. But neither \nare the tax cuts, just because they are tax reform measures. They are \nnot risky just because they give people back some of their money. To \nthose on the other side and the Vice President, who is running for \nPresident, they must be risky because they give back to the American \npeople some real tax reform money.\n  If we want to go on to debate whether the Vice President even has a \nplan to give Americans back any of their tax money, we can do that at \nany time. I am not on the tax writing committee, but I will volunteer. \nI will be here. And I can tell you right up front, very little of what \nthe President proposes goes to taxpayers for tax relief. Almost all of \nit goes to Americans whom the Vice President chooses to give back \nmoney, by way of just giving them a check that matches or exceeds their \nown money, in a huge way. The largest transfer of wealth that we \nprobably have ever seen is tucked away in what the Vice President calls \ntax cuts for the American people.\n  Read the Washington Post editorial of 4 days ago. While they are \nquick to criticize Republicans, they have a very good paragraph in the \nmiddle of their editorial saying: Mr. Vice President, Democrats, why do \nyou insist on telling the taxpayers, including middle income taxpayers, \nhow they should spend the tax dollars you want to give them back? The \nWashington Post says: If you want to give them a tax cut give them a \ntax cut. They don't do that. They create some new targeted programs. If \nyou want to use them, you have to use it for college tuition. If you \nwant to use it, you have to use it for this, that, or the other.\n  Question: Don't some Americans have more concern about how to use it \nand where to use it, and would do that right, rather than to have the \nGovernment do that for you while making the Tax Code more complicated \nand claiming they are giving you tax relief?\n  Frankly, I could answer many more of the questions but I will just do \nthe issues raised by the minority leader, and I will only address one.\n  The President of the United States has never attempted to seriously \ndo a bipartisan Medicare prescription bill--never. He has sent us his \nown, but never has negotiated with Republicans. The one time we had a \nbipartisan committee, since you required a supermajority, he pulled his \nsupport so it would not have a supermajority--yet it had a majority, \nbipartisan, for a major reform and prescription drug bill. So one of \nthe reasons most of the things not getting done are not getting done is \nbecause they have become so partisan that the other side of the aisle \nsays, ``Our way or no way.'' The President says, ``My way or no way.'' \nThe Vice President says, ``I am running for President and here is what \nI propose. It will be that way or no way.''\n  That is what the American people will find out, I hope, as we debate \nthese issues in an effort in the next 5 weeks to resolve many of them. \nAnd I hope we do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S7985-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7985-S7991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the bill.\n  The bill clerk read the title as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4733) making appropriations for energy and \n     water development for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2001, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--and this has \nbeen approved by the other side--that the committee amendment to H.R. \n4733 be adopted and that the bill as amended be considered as original \ntext for the purpose of further amendments, provided that no points of \norder are waived by this request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Committee on Appropriations \nfavorably reported H.R. 4733 by a vote of 28 to 0 on Tuesday, July 18.\n  Senator Reid and I have worked very hard this year to put together a \nfair bill under extremely difficult circumstances. As reported by the \ncommittee, the recommendation would provide $22.470 billion in new \nbudget authority for fiscal year 2001. That total is broken out between \na defense allocation that is pretty good, and a non-defense allocation \nthat is extremely limited.\n  The Defense BA allocation is $13.484 billion. That is $400 million \nover the President's request and $1.384 billion over last year. The \ncommittee requested the additional money to address some very serious \nneeds in the nuclear weapons complex, defense environmental clean-up, \nand in ongoing international nonproliferation programs.\n  However, the BA allocation on the non-defense side of the bill is \nmuch more difficult--it provides $8.986 billion, which is $603 million \nbelow the President's request and $73 million below the current year \nlevel.\n  In order to accommodate some serious shortfalls in the President's \nrequest, and some very legitimate requests from Members, we have had to \ncut a significant amount more than the $603 million we are short from \nthe request.\n  The allocation has also forced the committee to make very difficult \nchoices, and we have tried to do that on as fair a basis as possible. \nWe have followed certain criteria. In the water accounts for example:\n  No. 1, we have tried to focus available funding, to the greatest \nextent possible, to ongoing studies and construction projects.\n  No. 2, we have included no new construction starts or new initiatives \nin fiscal year 2001, and only a very limited number of new studies or \nplanning projects.\n  No. 3, we have not included unauthorized projects or water and sewer \ninfrastructure projects contained in the Water Resources Development \nAct of 1999.\n  No. 4, numerous projects budgeted at or near the Corps' capability \nhave been reduced in order to pick-up funds for congressional \npriorities and to restore funding not requested by the administration \nfor flood control and inland navigation projects.\n  No. 5, given these constraints, we have been limited to accommodating\n\n[[Page S7986]]\n\nonly the highest priority requests of Members where possible.\n  Having said that, the recommendation for the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers totals $4.104 billion. This is $41 million above the budget \nrequest and $22 million below the FY 2000 enacted level. The following \nis a highlight of the recommendation of the Corps Budget for FY 2000:\n  General Investigations totals $139 million, down $23 million below \nthe current year.\n  Construction General totals $1.361 billion, down $24 million below \nthe current year.\n  Operation and Maintenance totals $1.862 billion which is $8 million \nover the current year.\n  Moving on to the Bureau of Reclamation, the recommendation before the \ncommittee totals $753 million. This is $48 million below the budget \nrequest and $13 million below the current year level. The \nrecommendation includes:\n  Six hundred and fifty-five million dollars for Water and Related \nResources which includes both construction and operation and \nmaintenance of Bureau projects. This is $50 million over the current \nyear level.\n  None of the $60 million requested for the California Bay-Delta \nRestoration program is provided in the bill, as the authorization for \nthis program expires in fiscal year 2000.\n  Thirty-eight million dollars for the Central Valley Project \nRestoration Fund a reduction of $4 million from the current year.\n  For the Department of Energy's non-defense accounts, we have proposed \nsome substantial reductions from the President's request. However, in \nmany cases, those reductions appear large only because the President \nproposed large increases we will not be able to accommodate, given our \nnon-defense allocation.\n  In other accounts such as Nuclear Energy R, the administration \nrequest was 4 percent below current year. Therefore, the committee has \ntried to balance the Department's research efforts by providing \nreasonable increases to these important research efforts.\n  For the Science programs at the Department of Energy, the committee \nrecommends $2.870 billion, an increase of $82 million over last year, \nbut still $292 million below the request.\n  Over half of the total proposed increase to Science was in one \nconstruction project, the Spallation Neutron Source in Tennessee. The \ncommittee strongly supports this project and has provided $240 million, \nan increase of $140 million over current year.\n  The allocation forced the committee into some very difficult \ndecisions regarding many otherwise outstanding programs and initiatives \nunder the Office of Science. For example, although the committee has \ntraditionally provided strong support to High Energy Physics, Nuclear \nPhysics and Fusion Energy, all are funded at below last year's level.\n  Within the defense allocation, we have been able to add significant \nfunds to some very pressing problems.\n  Within Weapons Activities, the committee has provided $4.883 billion, \nan increase of $244 million over the budget request. The committee is \nvery concerned about the state of the science based Stockpile \nStewardship Program. As it is now, the program is not on schedule, \ngiven the current budget, to develop the tools, technologies and skill-\nbase to refurbish our weapons and certify them for the stockpile. For \nexample, we are behind schedule and over cost on the production of both \npits and secondaries for our nuclear weapons. The committee has \nprovided significant increases to these areas.\n  Furthermore, DOE has failed to keep good modern facilities and our \nproduction complex is in a terrible state of disrepair. To address \nthese problems, the mark provides an increase of over $100 million for \nthe production plants in Texas, Missouri, Tennessee, and South \nCarolina.\n  But it is not just the physical infrastructure that is deteriorating \nwithin the weapons complex, morale among the scientists at the three \nweapons laboratories is at an all-time low. For example, the last two \nyears at Los Alamos have witnessed security problems that greatly \ndamaged the trust relationship between the government and its \nscientists. Additionally, research funds have been cut and punitive \nrestrictions on travel imposed.\n  As a result, the labs are having great difficulty recruiting and \nretaining America's greatest scientists. To help address this problem, \nthe bill has increased the travel cap from $150 million to $200 \nmillion, and increased Laboratory Directed Research and Development. \nAnd I intend to offer additional amendments to increase LDRD and \ntravel.\n  For security, the committee recommends $336 million for the \nDepartment's security office, an increase of $213 million over last \nyear. This is in addition to the $45 million for increased Cyber \nSecurity that was just enacted as part of the fiscal year 2000 \nSupplemental. In addition, the committee has made sure General Gordon, \nas the new head of the NNSA, will have the resources and the authority \nto take care of security throughout the weapons complex.\n\n  The Department has experienced tremendous difficulty in constructing \nits special experimental and computational facilities within budget and \nwithin schedule. The National Ignition Facility is only the most recent \nexample, and on that issue, Senator Reid and I have agreed to recommend \nat this time only the $74 million requested by the administration, \nrecognizing that much more money will be required this year if this \nproject is to continue.\n  Regarding accelerator production of tritium, the committee has \ncombined that with other programs to begin an exciting new program \ncalled Advanced Accelerator Applications. The committee recommendation \nincludes $60 million to continue the important work on a back-up \ntritium source for defense purposes, but will also fund important work \non accelerator transumutation of waste and other accelerator \napplications.\n  The committee continues its strong tradition of support for nuclear \nnonproliferation issues. We recommend $909 million, an increase of $43 \nmillion over the request, and $180 million more than last year.\n  For Defense Environmental Management, the committee recommends $6.042 \nbillion, a $326 million increase over last year. To the extent \npossible, we have tried to address the needs of Members with \nenvironmental management sites. We have provided increases at Savannah \nRiver and the Hanford site, and provided additional funds for \nenvironmental science and technology research at Idaho and other labs.\n  In summary, the recommendation before you is for $22.47 billion, a \nreduction of $225 million from the request. Within that amount, non-\ndefense programs are reduced $603 million while defense accounts \nincrease $400 million. This is going to be a difficult year, but I look \nforward to consideration by the full Senate.\n  It is our intention to work hard over the next few evenings to \ncomplete work on the bill. It is my intention to seek a unanimous \nconsent that all amendments be filed by noon on Wednesday. We will be \nhere all evening, and I urge my colleagues to bring any amendments they \nmay have to the floor so we can consider them. It is my intention, \nshortly after all amendments have been filed, to act on a package of \nmanagers amendments.\n  Before I yield back, I would like to thank Chairman Stevens for the \nstrong support he has given to the energy and water bill, particularly \non the defense funding side. I would also like to thank my ranking \nmember, senator Reid, for all the effort he has put forth in working \ntogether on this bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from New Mexico \nwill allow me to add a glowing statement about the bill he is about to \nspeak to?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased to do that even if it were not \nglowing but, since it is, I am delighted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the managers of \nthis bill for their commitment to renewable energy. I particularly want \nto thank Senator Harry Reid for his leadership in bringing additional \nfunding to advance the cause of clean energy in this nation.\n  Earlier this year the Senate renewable energy caucus, led by Senators \nRoth, Bingaman, Allard and myself, sent a letter to the bill managers \nasking that they put the U.S. Senate on\n\n[[Page S7987]]\n\nrecord in support of wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and other \nrenewable energy resources.\n  Mr. President, 54 of our colleagues signed that letter and they \nshould know that the bill before us today boosts funding for renewable \nenergy by $87 million over last years levels. This is a great \nachievement. And unlike in past years, I come to the Senate floor \nwithout the annual renewable energy funding amendment but with what \nwill hopefully be an annual effort praising the managers of this bill.\n  We thank you Senator Reid for your vision and commitment to reducing \nthis nation's reliance on foreign oil and advancing our investment in \nclean, domestic energy resources.\n  This increase puts our country back onto the path of a sustainable \nenergy policy.\n  In recent years, the U.S. trade deficit has soared. The number one \ncontributor to the trade deficit is imported foreign oil--and its \ncontribution has reached record levels.\n  Since the oil embargo of 1973-74, imports of foreign oil have risen \nfrom a little over 30 percent to 55 percent, and will hit 65 percent in \na decade. By then, most of the world's oil will come from potentially \nunstable Persian Gulf nations.\n  These imports account for over $60 billion. That is more than 36 \npercent of the U.S. trade deficit. These are U.S. dollars being shipped \noverseas to the Middle East when they could be put to better use here \nat home.\n  In 1976, myself and a number of freshmen Members of the House of \nRepresentatives proposed such a provision and nearly passed it to the \nexact same 10 percent. Unfortunately, that failed. But at that time we, \na number of us working together, did start the wind energy program, \nwhich is now blossoming, with Vermont being the leader in that field, \nand also, with a very good amendment I was able to get on, we started, \nreally, the solar voltaic program at that particular time. During the \nperiod since that time, a couple of times we have come very close to \nputting into a mandatory situation where we would decrease the \nconsumption of oil by 10 percent through renewables.\n  Now we are on our way, finally. Hopefully, this bill will pass.\n  We are lowering our balance of payments.\n  We are providing an invaluable insurance policy to enhance our \nnational security.\n  And we are protecting our environmental and reducing air pollution.\n  Federal support for renewable energy research and development has \nbeen a major success story in the United States. Costs have declined, \nreliability has improved, and a growing domestic industry has been \nborn.\n  Through this boost in the renewables budget, we are building upon our \nsuccesses. We are helping to develop industries which reduce our trade \ndeficit and boost national security. We are helping farmers, ranchers, \nrural communities, and small businesses.\n  The 54 Senators who signed this letter--and in particular--Senator \nReid, deserve a great deal of credit for protecting the environment, \npromoting job growth, and advancing America's future.\n  Again, I thank the two sponsors of the bill, Senators Reid and \nDomenici. I praise them for their efforts and helping in any way \npossible. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I can respond before the Senator from \nVermont leaves the floor, this has been a very difficult issue for \nSenator Domenici and me for a number of years. We acknowledge the \nleadership of the Senator from Vermont on this issue. But for him, we \nprobably would not be in the position we are now. I appreciate his nice \nwords and recognize his leadership on this issue over the many years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. \nReid, for what he has said, and I echo the compliments. I think the \nSenator from Vermont understands the delicate position we are in this \nyear in that the nondefense portion of this appropriations bill is \ninadequate to cover the nondefense research and water projects we ought \nto be covering in the bill.\n  I believe when we were able to almost match the Senator's and his \ncosponsors' request on solar and wind, they understand we are hopeful \nwhen we get to conference of getting some additional money from the \nbudget and the appropriators for the nondefense portion of this bill \nwhich will make it easier for us to keep this and hold it all the way \nthrough. I have been sure and careful to explain that to the Senator \nfrom Vermont. I am sure he is aware of it. I wanted to put it in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I agree with \nhim 100 percent, and I am going to do all I can to assist him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, while Senators are going to talk about \nprojects, programs, activities, and amendments to add $5 million here \nor $7 million there, I want to break this appropriations bill into two \nparts--I wish I had it on a chart, and maybe I will have it the next \ntime we are on this bill--so that when anybody offers an amendment that \ncosts money, if it is in the nondefense part, whatever it is for, maybe \nsome science research, maybe a water project that we did not fund, \nmaybe operation and maintenance for some part of the Mississippi, a \nlevy system, we are going to try to show you where we are really \nhurting for money is the nondefense part of this budget, the water \nprojects and the nondefense science.\n  As a matter of fact, the allocation is about $604 million below the \nPresident's request in the nondefense part of this appropriations bill. \nThat is $73 million less than last year's appropriations. It is not a \nquestion only of not being able to meet the President's request. We \nare, in essence, below last year's appropriated number, which many \npeople say isn't realistic unless you are prepared to take some \nprograms out of the Department--and we can hardly do that. That is a \nnegative $73 million.\n  Fortunately, on the defense side, we have talked our way through all \nthese different hurdles of how much defense money is available, and I \nam very appreciative of the fact that through the efforts of our \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, the appropriators who spend \ndefense money--that is the big defense bill, the smaller bill on \nmilitary construction and a very small bill on Commerce that spends \nsome money on defense--they have left, as part of the increase, \nsufficient money to cover the defense in this bill, which is $13.5 \nbillion.\n  I regret to say the problem we have is when we go to the House, we \nhave to raise the House's number because they are about $600 million \nbelow us on the defense side of their bill. It is a difficult problem.\n  I do believe the allocation that both chairmen of the House and \nSenate Appropriations Committees are going to ultimately come up with \nwill make us whole at the Senate level on defense. I just explained \nwhy. The money is there, and I hope before this is over, we will \nconvince everyone we are in an area where we have to be very concerned \nhow much money we are spending on the defense side because the morale \nand capability of our National Laboratories to maintain our nuclear \nweapons activities is getting very close as to whether it can continue \nin a manner we have expected over the years.\n\n  When somebody says it is only $7 million and I need it for a levy and \nI need to start a program even though we said no new starts, I want to \nkeep in front of everybody that we are $604 million below the President \non nondefense, and the House is $600 million below ours on defense, and \nwe are $500 million higher than the President's on defense. Those will \nbe put up here for everybody to see.\n  If anybody wants an interpretation of what is in this bill, I tried \nvery hard in a nonpartisan way to explain it in my earlier statement. I \nhave given full credit to the magic of bipartisanship when it comes to \nwriting a bill like this. We have to try to work together. Maintaining \nour nuclear capacity through science and research and nonproliferation \nshould not be a partisan issue. Thanks to Senator Reid, it is not. \nThere are a few disagreements he and I have. We will iron them out on \nthe floor.\n  I want to make sure everybody understands that right now, this day, 5 \nweeks before the new fiscal year, the nuclear defense laboratories, \nwhich essentially are made up of a piece of the\n\n[[Page S7988]]\n\nNational Laboratory in Tennessee called Oak Ridge, called Y-12, plus \nLos Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories in \nAlbuquerque and Livermore, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, \nare the laboratories that maintain our nuclear weapons activities that \nmeasure the performance and ability of our nuclear weapons, and their \nsafety and reliability.\n  Right now, they are fragile because the morale is low. Throughout \nthis short debate, I will keep mentioning to Senators that we better be \ncareful with reference to the scientists who have done the big defense \nwork who we must retain at these laboratories to perfect our Stockpile \nStewardship Program, which allows no weapons testing while we are still \ngoing to protect the reliability of our weapons. We need to retain the \nold heads who have done this work for so long. At Los Alamos there are \nabout 40 of them who are in the X division, including NEST or the \nNuclear Emergency Search Team.\n  Their morale is very low because, my colleagues will recall, that is \nthe area where that hard drive was found behind a machine, and they did \nnot know how it got there. They have now been under investigation for \n14 weeks. Fourteen weeks is a long time to have the very best \nscientists in the world who have maintained our nuclear capacity, some \nof them for 30 years, some for 25, some more 40, under investigation. \nWe do not want them to leave the laboratories, and we want to attract \nthe best new scientists to follow in their footsteps and have them \neducated by the other scientists. We are not succeeding at either.\n  The new recruits of the very best scientists are at an all-time low, \nand that is measurable. In other words, we know how many scientists we \ninvited to work and how many accepted. I will put that in the Record. \nIt is very low compared to 5 years ago. We also know how many are \nplanning to leave, and it is very high compared to other years.\n  Everybody knows I have a parochial interest. At least they would \nassume that. If one of my colleagues had a laboratory like Los Alamos \nin his or her State, I say to any Senator, I assume they would be \nconcerned about it. If they had a Sandia National Laboratory, which is \nthe engineering laboratory for nuclear weapons, I assume they would be \nconcerned.\n  I am concerned, and I have to try to convince the Senate that we have \nto put back some money in terms of morale builders, and we have to \nstart telling those great scientists that they have done a wonderful \njob for America.\n  So something got messed up. If you can't prove there is spying or \nespionage, pretty soon you ought to get off their backs and you ought \nto say to them: We are going to fix this administratively.\n\n  I could go on tonight and tell you how we are going to do that \nbecause we have a new administrative approach to running the nuclear \nweapons activities of America. We have a great man, General Gordon, \nheading it. Give him a chance. Give him a chance to restructure. At the \nsame time, let somebody who knows their problems lead this effort. He \nis about as knowledgeable as anyone we could get to head the NNSA, the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration. It is hard to remember that \nname, but it will not be hard in a couple years because this general is \ngoing to make sure we know about it.\n  He is already showing some real leadership in terms of our \nunderstanding what NNSA is. It is the entire package of activities for \nour nuclear safety as far as our weapons and nonproliferation. We know \nhe is going to fix this morale issue if we give him a chance.\n  For now we have to be very careful. For instance, the House limits \ntheir travel again, even lower than the President recommends. Does it \never occur to anyone that the great scientists travel? Was that ever an \nastonishing conclusion? If you did not know it, let me tell you: Great \nscientists travel. They love to go to conventions and conferences to \nshare ideas. And if you say to a young crop of the best scientists in \nAmerica: Come and work at Los Alamos, but you had better remember that \nyou can only make one trip a year--well, what they are telling us \nalready is: Hey, I have a company that doesn't limit me. They are \noffering me some stock options. They want me to come.\n  Pay isn't a problem. We pay our scientists pretty well at these \nlaboratories, as a matter of fact. I must tell you, if they like their \nwork they will stay there.\n  So my concern is a very serious one. We could not do what I think we \nmust do and live with the House number on defense in this bill. We are \n$600 million higher than the House. We tell the Senate that with much \npride because you have to give these laboratories what they need.\n  Let me give you just one area. The National Laboratory structure, \nwith reference to nuclear weapons, is in need of an entire new, let's \nsay, 10-year plan for rebuilding ancient buildings. I use the word \n``ancient'' because some of them are so old that if you could apply the \nhistoric preservation statutes in the State of New Mexico, some of them \nwould be untouchable because they are too old. That is how old they \nare. I do not want to tell you how old. But it is not very old to be \nlabeled ``old'' anymore if you are a building.\n  But we started a plan. We started an approach for $100 million in \nthis bill, to start some of that--for lack of a better word, we will \ncall it infrastructure. But it is buildings; it is equipment. We must \ngo on beyond that for a few years and get the nuclear weapons complex, \nso to speak, built up or decide we are going to have an inferior one. \nWe would not be able to tell Americans the best people work there.\n  The best brainpower of America is devoted to making sure our nuclear \nweapons are right and safe. As we lower the numbers--which we are going \nto be doing; that, we can all say--even with lower numbers, we know \nwhat we are doing. We do not have to have tests because we know they \nare safe.\n  If we do not, I am going to support people who come to the floor and \nsay: Let's start testing again. Have no doubt about it. We voted in the \nMark Hatfield amendment to start a moratorium. We are doing it \nunilaterally. They are saying: Why don't we sign the treaty? We are not \ndoing any testing by statute right now.\n  So these great scientists have to substitute brainpower and equipment \nfor what underground testing used to give them, with information about \nthe adequacy, the safety, the reliability.\n  Now we have to do it by computers, by new machines, new, fantastic x-\nray machines that look inside bombs. We had better have the very best \npeople in America working there, wouldn't you think? I would.\n  My distinguished friend from Nevada wants to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding the Senator from Maine wishes to \nmake a relatively short statement. I do not want to impose upon her \ntime because we have to be here anyway.\n  I believe the Senator from New Mexico wishes to be recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I had indicated I wanted to send an amendment to the \ndesk so we have one pending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4032\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4032.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Starting on page 64, line 24, strike all through page 66, \n     line 7.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The amendment removes from the bill an environmental \nprovision that I had put in there prior to a successful discussion of \nthe issues and termination of the issues temporarily in the State of \nNew Mexico. So I do not need the amendment. Senator Reid knows about \nit. That is what this amendment is.\n  Mr. REID. The amendment is pending; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe set aside so the Senator from Maine can speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7989]]\n\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4033\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico, the \nSenator from Nevada, and most particularly, the Senator from Maine for \nhelping arrange time so she and I can discuss the amendment that we are \nabout to send to the desk. I request its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from New Mexico and \nNevada for making time. I am proud to join with Ms. Collins, the \nSenator from Maine, in offering this amendment.\n  The amendment is a very simple one. It calls for a Presidential \ncommission to study and propose, hopefully, consensus recommendations \non how to deal with the impending crisis we have in energy.\n  The crisis is easy to document. U.S. inventories of natural gas, \ncrude oil, heating oil, and diesel fuel are all at or near 25-year \nhistoric lows. Motorists in my State of New York and throughout the \ncountry are paying gasoline prices that are hovering near record highs \nin absolute terms and are increasing at record levels.\n  The current price of heating oil is higher than consumers typically \npay in the dead of winter. Natural gas prices are at twice their \ntypical price and are the highest in history at a time when warm \nweather keeps demand for natural gas low.\n  We are on the precipice of the most serious, most expensive, and most \neconomically devastating energy crisis since spiraling prices sent our \neconomy into a tailspin in 1976, and, of course, in terms of \nelectricity as well. We have real problems with greater and greater \ndemand and not enough supply.\n  Alan Greenspan said last July that the high price of oil has been \nputting inflationary pressure on our economy and that any further \nmarket impact ``would pose a risk to America's economic outlook.''\n  With crude oil selling for more than $33 a barrel and natural gas \nselling for a record nearly $5 per billion cubic feet, we are at the \npoint that Chairman Greenspan warned about.\n  This is on top of a very expensive energy season where American \nconsumers spent more than $75 billion on energy costs over the previous \nyear.\n  Everyone has their own solution to the energy crisis. I have listened \nto the chairman of the Energy Committee and some on that side who say \nwe should simply pump more oil. And, in the opinion of others, we \nshould do that despite what we do to the environment.\n  I have heard many on this side say we have to do many things to \nreduce demand, such as raise CAFE standards and include SUVs and \nminivans under the designation of automobiles and raise the average \nmiles per gallon.\n  I have heard others talk about new types of energy sources and how we \nneed to explore them. Probably every one of the 100 Members in this \nChamber, particularly after the last 6 months, has an idea. There is \none problem. Our ideas are so fractured and so lacking consensus that \nwe have done nothing. This is not blame on the Democrats or \nRepublicans, on the White House or the Congress. Basically, there is \nenough blame to go around so that everybody can point a finger.\n  The bottom line is simple: Our demand for energy is increasing. Our \nsupply of energy, particularly domestic supply, is decreasing. Unless \nwe come to some kind of national consensus, the problems we faced last \nwinter with home heating oil and this early summer with gasoline will \ncause new problems.\n  I have a great deal of respect for the Secretary of Energy. I think \nhe has\n\n[[Page S7990]]\n\ndone a very good job under trying circumstances. I don't blame him. I \ndon't blame the President. I don't blame the majority leader. I don't \nblame the chairman of the energy committee. But we have a problem. Thus \nfar, we have been unable to deal with it.\n  The amendment Senator Collins and I have offered to the energy and \nwater appropriations bill will create a national energy commission. The \nenergy commission will be established jointly by the President and the \nmajority and minority leaders of the House and Senate and will bring \ntogether representatives from the energy producing States, energy \nconsuming States, oil and natural gas industries, consumer groups, \nenvironmental groups, and experts and analysts in the energy field. It \nis just the kind of group needed to bring about the consensus we so \nsorely lack. There may not be a consensus, but I believe we ought to \ntry.\n  I, for one, am dubious of many commissions. In this case it is needed \nbecause of the paralysis in Washington in terms of addressing this \nissue, because of the lack of consensus throughout the land in how to \ndeal with something that at the very least is going to cost Americans a \nlot more money and at its worst could take our fine economic recovery \nand send it into a tailspin.\n  The commission was designed by the Senator from Maine and myself to \nhave a broad consensus of parties, branches of government and views and \nconstituencies. It will conduct a study and provide a report to us on \nthe following: the status of inventories of our energy sources; the \ncause for and consequences of energy supply disruption and energy \nproduct shortages nationwide and in particular regions; ways in which \nthe United States can become less dependent on foreign oil supplies; \nways in which alternate energy sources can be used to reduce demand on \ntraditional energy sectors; ways in which the U.S. can reduce energy \nconsumption; and ways to improve refinery capacity, utilization, and \nstorage in the United States of natural gas, crude oil, and distillate \nfuel.\n  The commission shall provide a report within 6 months of enactment \nthat shall include an assessment of our problems and recommendations on \nhow to solve them.\n  In conclusion, last year New Yorkers and New Englanders paid more \nthan $2 a gallon for heating oil. Home owners paid up to $1,000 more to \nheat their homes in my State, not because of weather but because of \nshortages. Motorists, people going on vacation, people driving cars and \ntrucks for a living also paid hundreds if not thousands of dollars more \nout of their pockets this year.\n  As Chairman Greenspan warned, this is one of the few things that \nlooms on the near horizon that could throw our economy off kilter.\n  Let us not get caught unprepared again. This amendment is the start \nof an energy policy that will protect consumers and protect our \neconomy.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues from New Mexico and Nevada for \ntheir generosity and most particularly the Senator from Maine who is \nalways a pleasure to work with on these and other issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I first want to thank the managers of \nthis bill, Senator Domenici and Senator Reid, for bringing this \nappropriations bill to the floor in a bipartisan fashion and for making \nthis time available to us tonight.\n  I am very pleased to join with my good friend and colleague from the \nState of New York, Senator Schumer, in offering this important \namendment to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. As my colleague \nhas explained, this amendment is straightforward. It would establish a \nPresidential commission to help us develop a comprehensive, sustainable \nenergy policy. The time is long overdue for this Nation to have an \nenergy policy. Unfortunately, the current administration has failed to \ndevelop one.\n  Last year when the home heating oil crisis gripped the Northeast, the \nEnergy Secretary, Bill Richardson, was very forthright. He admitted \nthat the Federal Government had been caught napping and said that we \nsimply were not prepared.\n  Due largely to OPEC's anticompetitive manipulation of our oil \nmarkets, we have been experiencing dramatic price increases that have \nrippled throughout the four corners of this Nation. This year consumers \nhave paid 47 percent more for gasoline. Truckers have paid 46 percent \nmore for diesel fuel. And Northeasterners have paid 81 percent more for \nhome heating oil than they did just one year earlier.\n  In my home State of Maine, this problem is reaching crisis \nproportions. Seventy-five percent of all Maine households use home \nheating oil, consuming an average of 800 gallons per year. Last year, \nthe average Maine household spent $320 more than it did the previous \nyear simply to heat with oil. Of course, heating with natural gas \nprovided little relief as natural gas prices have also soared. And the \noutlook for this year is even worse.\n  Meanwhile, although OPEC countries sold 5 percent less oil in 1999, \ntheir profits were up by 38 percent.\n  Today, as a year ago, we find ourselves turning the corner toward \ncooler weather and another looming home heating oil price crisis. All \nsigns indicate that this one will be even worse than last year's. \nConsider that crude oil closed Friday at $33 per barrel, up from $22 a \nyear ago. Last week heating oil futures hit their highest level since \nOctober of 1990. At the same time, as my colleague has pointed out, \nhome heating oil and natural gas inventories are down. Indeed, \ndistillate stocks are roughly 10 million barrels lower than the \nadministration predicted just last month. In fact, stocks of crude oil, \ngasoline and heating oil in the United States have not been at levels \nthis low since the mid-1970s, when our economy was thrown into turmoil \ndue in large measure to a volatile oil market. Compounding the problem, \nthe demand for distillate fuel is predicted to increase significantly \nthis winter.\n  In short, the fast approaching winter looks bleak. And judging from \nthe most recent comments of OPEC officials, it is clear that we cannot \nexpect any real relief from the cartel.\n  As my colleague has pointed out, there is no consensus in the \nCongress or in the administration about what approach we should take in \ndeveloping a national energy policy. Policymakers differ on what can be \ndone to provide relief to American consumers.\n  My friend from New York and I have been advocating for some time that \nthe administration implement a responsible plan to swap oil from our \nwell-stocked Strategic Petroleum Reserve to satisfy market demand and \nprovide some price relief to American consumers. Others in this Chamber \nadvocate different approaches. But I believe we can all find common \nground with the notion that, in the long term, we need to conduct a \ncomprehensive study of our oil and natural gas industries in order to \ndevelop a strategy to stabilize fuel prices, to explore alternative \nenergy sources, and to reduce our reliance on foreign oil supplies. Our \namendment would take an important first step in accomplishing these \ngoals through the creation of a bipartisan energy commission.\n  I very much appreciate the fact that the managers have been working \nwith us on this legislation, which I hope they will accept. With that, \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and with the \nconcurrence of the minority leader, I ask unanimous consent that during \nthe consideration of the energy and water appropriations bill on \nWednesday, it be in order for the minority leader, or his designee, to \noffer an amendment to strike relating to the Missouri River. I further \nask consent that there be 3 hours for debate equally divided in the \nusual form on that amendment, and further, no amendments be in order to \nthe language proposed to be stricken by a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as soon as there is a unanimous consent \nagreement, it is my understanding that what we are going to try to do--\nthere appear to be no more amendments tonight. \nAs soon as there is something\n\n[[Page S7991]]\n\nfrom the staff putting us out tonight, I will withhold.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

I rise today to express reservations about S. 2869, the \nReligious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, and the \nlarger issue of the impact of religious liberty legislation in the \ncontext of prisons and the military.\n  One of the founding principles of our Nation involves the freedom to \nworship. I have always been a strong supporter of this most basic \nright. For example, for many years I have introduced a constitutional \namendment to permit prayer in public schools, and I would be very \npleased if we could pass that amendment.\n  In the closing hours of the Senate before the August recess, the \nSenate considered the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons \nAct, which is essentially an attempt to change the way the courts \ninterpret the Free Exercise Clause of the Constitution regarding \nprisons and land use regulations throughout the Nation. Ever since the \nSupreme Court held the Religious Liberty Protection Act \nunconstitutional as applied to the states, supporters of this \nlegislation have tried to reverse that decision. Just as the Religious \nLiberty Protection Act has been held unconstitutional as applied to the \nstates and its legality is still unclear regarding the federal \ngovernment, there are legitimate issues regarding whether S. 2869 is \nconstitutional. Moreover, there are serious questions about whether \nthis bill is good public policy, especially as it relates to the \nprisons and jails across America.\n  I first wish to note what this bill is not. It is not directed at \nlaws that intentionally discriminate against a particular religion or \neven all religions. We all recognize that laws that intentionally \ndiscriminate against religious groups cannot be tolerated, and the \ncourts already routinely invalidate such laws. Rather, this bill is \ndirected at laws that apply to everyone equally, but have the effect of \nburdening someone's exercise of his or her religion. It is this \nindirect impact that the supporters are trying to address. However, in \nthe process, the bill is entirely inconsistent with the principles of \nfederalism, and it creates significant problems in many areas.\n  I would like to specifically address prisons. The safe and secure \noperation of prisons is an extremely difficult and complex task. I fear \nthat establishing new legal rights for inmates through this law will \nonly make that job more difficult and more dangerous.\n  The Supreme Court under O'Lone and other cases established a \nreasonable standard for evaluating religious freedom claims in prison, \nbalancing the needs of inmates and the institution. Then, in 1993, the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act imposed a very difficult burden on \ncorrectional officials when prisoners made demands that they claimed \nwere based on their religious faith. Although R.F.R.A. was held \nunconstitutional a few years later, the bill will again upset the \nbalance.\n  Applying this legislation in prison has the real potential to \nundermine safety and security. Inmates have used religion as a cover to \norganize prison uprisings, get drugs into prison, promote gang \nactivity, and interfere in important prison health regulations. \nAdditional legal protections will make it much harder for corrections \nofficials to control these abuses of religious rights.\n  One example of a successful prisoner lawsuit before R.F.R.A. was held \nunconstitutional concerns an inmate who refused to take a tuberculosis \ntest in Jolly v. Coughlin. The New York prison system wished to prevent \nthe spread of T.B. to staff and inmates, so it implemented a mandatory \ntesting program to screen inmates for T.B. so the disease could be \ntreated before it became active and contagious. The plaintiff refused \nto take the test based on his religious beliefs, and won. The courts \npermitted the inmate to violate this very reasonable health policy. \nThis is a clear interference with prison safety and security. There is \nno excuse for courts to allow inmates to tell authorities what health \npolicies they will or will not follow.\n\n  This case is just an example of how S. 2869 has the potential to put \ncourts back in the business of second-guessing correctional officials \nand micromanaging state and local jails. There should be deference to \nthe expertise and judgement of prison administrators. These \nprofessionals know what is needed to protect the safety and security of \ninmates, staff, and the public.\n  The possibilities for inmate demands for religious accommodation \nunder S. 2869 are limited only by the criminal's imagination. As the \nAttorney General of Ohio said in a letter last year, ``We have seen \ninmates sue the states for the `right' to burn Bibles, the `right' to \nengage in animal sacrifices, the `right' to burn candles for Satanist \nservices, the `right' to certain special diets, or the `right' to \ndistribute racist materials.''\n  There was a large increase in prisoner demands and a rise in lawsuits \nbased on religious liberty while R.F.R.A. was in effect. The Solicitor \nof Ohio testified a few years ago that there were 254 inmate R.F.R.A. \ncases in the Lexis computer database during the three years the law \napplied to the states. This does not include cases that were not \nincluded in the database, and some of the cases listed actually \nincluded many inmates because the cases were class action suits.\n  Winning lawsuits will encourage inmates to challenge authority more \nand more often in day to day prison life, and S. 2869 will make it much \nmore likely that they will win. However, even if a prisoner's claim \nfails, it costs the prison much time and money to defend, at a time \nwhen prison costs are rising. The new legal standard will make it much \nharder to get cases dismissed before trial, greatly increasing the \ndiversion of time and resources.\n  As former Senator Alan Simpson said during the debate on R.F.R.A. in \n1993, applying this legislation to prisons will impose ``an unfunded \nFederal mandate requiring the State and local governments to pay for \nmore frequent, expensive, and protracted prisoner suits in the name of \nreligious freedom.''\n  Some have argued that the fact that S. 2869 must comply with the \nPrison Litigation Reform Act solves any problems regarding inmates. \nUnfortunately, as the National Association of Attorneys General has \nrecognized, this is incorrect. It is true that the P.L.R.A. has limited \nthe number of frivolous lawsuits inmates can bring. However, under this \nnew legislation, lawsuits that formerly were frivolous now will have \nmerit because this bill changes the legal standard under which \nreligious claims are considered. Because S. 2869 makes it much easier \nfor prisoners to win their lawsuits, the P.L.R.A. will be of little \nhelp.\n  Not all prisoners abuse the law. Indeed, it is clear that religion \nbenefits prisoners. It helps rehabilitate them, making them less likely \nto commit crime after they are released. In fact, it is ironic that S. \n2869 may actually diminish the quality and quantity of religious \nservices in prison. If R.F.R.A. is any indication, requests for \nreligious accommodation will rise dramatically for bizarre, obscure or \npreviously unknown religious claims. These types of claims divert the \nattention and resources of prison chaplains away from delivering \nreligious services. The great majority of inmates who legitimately wish \nto practice their religious beliefs will be harmed by this law.\n  I am pleased that the General Accounting Office will be conducting a \nstudy regarding the impact of religious liberty legislation in the \nprison environment. We must continue to review this important issue \nvery closely.\n  Additionally, I wish to discuss my concerns regarding the effect of \nreligious rights legislation in the military. While S. 2869 does not \ndirectly impact the Armed Services, the Administration considers the \npredecessor to S. 2869, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, to be \nconstitutional and binding on all of the federal government,\n\n[[Page S7992]]\n\nincluding the military. I strongly believe that the military should be \nexcluded from any legislation creating special statutory religious \nrights.\n  In discussing religious rights, it is important to note that the Free \nExercise Clause of the Constitution has never provided individuals \nunlimited rights. The Free Exercise Clause must be balanced against the \ninterests and needs of society in various circumstances.\n  Government interests are especially significant outside of general \ncivilian life, and the military is the best example. Here, governmental \ninterests are paramount for a variety of reasons that the courts have \nalways recognized. The courts have always been tasked with balancing \nthe rights of individuals against the interests of society. In this \narea, I believe the courts have struck a good balance.\n  In Goldman v. Weinberger, the key legal authority on this issue, the \nSupreme Court reaffirmed its long-standing position and made clear that \ncourts must defer to the professional judgment of the military \nregarding the restrictions it places on religious practices. The \nmilitary, not the courts, generally should decide what is permitted and \nwhat is not permitted.\n  This does not mean that soldiers have no religious rights under the \nConstitution, but the courts generally must defer to the professional \njudgement of the military on applying these rights in the military. \nThis is essential because of the military's need to foster discipline, \nunity, and respect in achieving its mission of protecting America's \nnational security.\n  As the court in Goldman explained, ``The military is, by necessity, a \nspecial society separate from civilian society. . . . The military must \ninsist upon a respect for duty and a discipline without counterpart in \ncivilian life. . . . The essence of military service is the \nsubordination of the desires and interest of the individual to the \nneeds of the service.''\n  The R.F.R.A. entirely rejected this approach. It put the courts in \nthe business of deciding what religious activities should be permitted \nin the military and what should not. It does this by establishing a \nvery high legal standard, called the strict scrutiny test, that must be \nmet before the government, including the military, may enforce a law or \nregulation that interferes in any person's exercise of their religious \nrights. Under this test, a restriction on religious practices is \npermitted only if it is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling \ngovernmental interest. This is a very difficult legal standard to meet \nand is an unrealistic and dangerous burden for the military. However, \nunder this law, the courts must treat all requests for religious \npractice under the same standard, whether it is the Armed Forces or \nanywhere else in society.\n  The R.F.R.A. does not in any way recognize the special circumstances \nof the military. This is a serious mistake. There is simply no reason \nwhy the courts should be in the business of second-guessing how the \nmilitary handles these matters.\n  In the past, the Department of Defense has recognized this problem. A \ncomprehensive Defense Department study of religion in the military in \n1985 concluded that the ``strict scrutiny'' test should not apply to \nthe military. It concluded that adopting this standard ``would be a \nstanding invitation to a wholesale civilian judicial review of internal \nmilitary affairs. . . . It would invite use of the results in civilian \ncases as a model for the military context when, in fact, the \ndifferences between civilian and military society are fundamental. \nAdoption of the civilian `strict scrutiny' standard poses grave dangers \nto military discipline and interferes with the ability of the military \nto perform its mission.''\n\n  The Armed Forces today fully accommodates religious practices. In \nfact, I have concerns about whether the Defense Department is too \ngenerous in what it is permitting on military bases today. For example, \nas reported last year in the Washington Post, Army soldiers who \nconsider themselves to be members of the Church of Wicca are carrying \nout their ceremonies at Fort Hood in Texas. The Wiccas practice \nwitchcraft. At Fort Hood, they are permitted to build fires on Army \nproperty and perform their rituals involving fire, hooded robes, and \nnine inch daggers. An Army chaplain is even present.\n  More recently, I read about an ongoing case where a Marine soldier \ndisobeyed a direct order against leaving his military base because the \ndate fell on the new moon, a holy day for Wiccas, and he said he needed \nto get copper sulfate to perform a ritual. This is just the type of \ncase that a soldier could win under R.F.R.A.\n  I do not believe that the Armed Forces should accommodate the \npractice of witchcraft at military facilities. The same applies to the \npractices of other fringe groups such as Satanists and cultists. Racist \ngroups could also claim religious protection. For the sake of the \nhonor, prestige, and respect of our military, there should be no \nobligation to permit such activity.\n  Members of some groups, such as the Native American Church and \nRastafarians, use controlled substances in their religious ceremonies. \nThe military today broadly allows the use of the drug peyote for \nsoldiers who claim to be members of the Native American Church. Peyote, \na controlled substance, is a hallucinogenic drug. According to a 1997 \nletter from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, peyote appears to \ncause an acute psychotic state for up to four hours after it is \ningested. The long term effects of its use, especially its repeated \nuse, are simply not known, including the possibility of flashbacks and \nmood instability. As part of the Authorization Bill for the Department \nof Defense, I am requiring that the Defense Department conduct a study \non this drug. It simply has no legitimate place within our Armed \nForces. This is an excellent example of the military going too far \ntoday in its efforts to accommodate religious practices.\n  Another problem from the military's efforts to accommodate fringe \ngroups is that it can harm recruitment. Last year, various religious \norganizations called for a boycott of the Armed Forces because of its \naccommodation of these fringe religious groups. The military is having \nsignificant difficulty today with recruitment for our all-volunteer \nforce, and the accommodation of groups such as the Wiccas further \ncomplicates this problem.\n  Without R.F.R.A., it is clear that the military could severely limit \nor prevent practices such as these if it wished. It is less clear \nexactly what limits the military can impose under R.F.R.A., to the \nextent that the law is constitutional as applied to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  When I have raised concerns about these matters with Defense \nDepartment officials, I have been told that the military will not \npermit soldiers to practice beliefs that pose a threat to good order \nand discipline. Unfortunately, that is not the legal standard the \nDepartment is faced with under R.F.R.A. Under religious liberty laws, \nthe courts make the decision based on whether the religious restriction \nis the least restrictive means to accomplish a compelling governmental \ninterest, not whether the restriction is based on good order and \ndiscipline.\n  Religious liberty legislation could cause many problems for the \nmilitary that have not been considered. Although there have been few \nclaims under R.F.R.A. in the military to date, this could easily change \nin the future. Soldiers who adhere to various faiths, including many \nestablished religions, could make claims that violate important, well-\nestablished military policies. For example, soldiers who are \nRastafarian can claim protection to wear beards or dread-locks, and \nNative Americans can claim protection for long hair. Also, Rastafarians \nmay claim an exemption from routine medical care that require \ninjections, such as immunizations. Although it is my understanding that \nthe military does not accommodate exemptions from grooming standards or \nreceiving health care, soldiers could bring such claims and likely win. \nTo date, inmates or guards in prisons have won cases similar to these \nin court, and there is little reason to expect that cases brought by \nsoldiers would turn out any differently.\n\n  Soldiers brought lawsuits in the 1960s seeking exemptions from \nimmunizations and exemptions from work on certain days based on \nreligious practices, but these claims failed under the deferential \nstandard. However, under R.F.R.A., there are endless opportunities for \nreligious practices to interfere\n\n[[Page S7993]]\n\nin important military policies and practices, and it is much more \nlikely that such cases would be successful.\n  One such matter arose during the Persian Gulf War. At the time, the \nmilitary imposed restrictions on Christian and Jewish observances and \nthe display of religious symbols for soldiers stationed in Saudi \nArabia. This was important so that our troops would not violate the \nlaws and religious decrees of the host nation. There was some talk of \nlawsuits against our military because of these restrictions. Although \nthis matter arose before R.F.R.A. was enacted, such a lawsuit is much \nmore likely to be successful today.\n  In short, it is not in the best interest of our nation and national \nsecurity for religious liberty legislation to apply to our Armed \nForces. Decisions about religious accommodation should be left to the \nmilitary, not the courts.\n  I will continue to monitor this most serious matter. It is my sincere \nhope that the next Administration will recognize the seriousness of \nthis issue and support excluding the military from legislation that \ncreates special religious rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S7993-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, on July 24, the chairman of the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, brought before the Senate a \nreport on payments made by the Project on Government Oversight, a \npublic interest group commonly called ``POGO,'' to two federal \nemployees. Unfortunately, the chairman referred to the report in his \nremarks as a ``committee report.'' It is not, and I think we need to \nset the record straight on that point.\n  The rules of the Senate give the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, like all our standing committees, broad authority to ``make \ninvestigations into any matter within its jurisdiction.'' But the power \nto make investigations rests with the Committee\n\n[[Page S7994]]\n\nas a whole. It is not vested in the chairman or any one Senator.\n  In January, at the chairman's request, the Comptroller General \ndetailed an employee of the General Accounting Office, Mr. Paul \nThompson, to the committee to conduct a ``preliminary inquiry'' into \nthe payments. In February, the chairman informed the committee that the \ninquiry was underway and that he would ``make recommendations'' to the \ncommittee ``as soon as we have something tangible.''\n  The chairman has leapt from ``preliminary inquiry'' to a final report \nwithout any intervening action or consideration by the committee. The \ncommittee never authorized Mr. Thompson's investigation and it never \napproved his report. I first learned about it after the chairman posted \nit on the Internet.\n  Nor was the report written or approved by the General Accounting \nOffice. Although Mr. Thompson is a GAO employee, he was detailed to the \ncommittee. So far as I can tell, no one at the General Accounting \nOffice participated in the investigation or in writing the report. Mr. \nThompson's activities were not subject to the professional standards of \nconduct that govern GAO investigations, and his report was not subject \nto review and approval by senior GAO officials.\n  If the chairman had asked the committee to approve Mr. Thompson's \nreport, I would have voted against it. If a majority of the committee \nhad agreed to adopt the report as its own, I would have filed minority \nviews. Since I was not given that opportunity, I will state my views \nfor the Record.\n  POGO's payments to Mr. Berman and Mr. Speir cannot be understood in \nisolation. They must be viewed in the larger context of the ongoing \ncontroversy over federal oil and gas royalties.\n  Oil companies that produce oil on federal land are, by law, required \nto pay royalties to the Federal Government based on the value of the \noil they produce from federal leases. Many of the major oil companies \nhave been accused of undervaluing and, thus, underpaying the royalties \nthey owe to the American people. The alleged underpayments total many \nhundreds of millions of dollars.\n  A few years ago, POGO and various private individuals sued the oil \ncompanies under the False Claims Act. The False Claims Act allows a \nprivate citizen to sue anyone who has defrauded the Government. If \nsuccessful, the person bringing the suit, known as a ``relator,'' is \nentitled to a share of the money recovered by the Government as a \nresult of the suit.\n  The essential facts surrounding the POGO payments are not in dispute. \nPOGO asked Robert A. Berman, an employee at the Department of the \nInterior, and Robert A. Speir, an employee at the Department of Energy, \nto join its False Claims Act suit. Neither man agreed. POGO then \noffered to share any money it received from its suit with the two men \nand they agreed. In January 1998, they put their agreement in writing. \nIn August 1998, Mobil Oil Corporation settled the claims against it by \npaying the Government and the relators a total of $45 million. In \nNovember 1998, POGO got about $1.2 million from the settlement and it \npaid Mr. Berman and Mr. Speir $383,600 apiece out of its share.\n  The current dispute centers on why POGO made those payments. POGO \ncharacterized the payments as ``awards'' for the two men's ``decade-\nlong public-spirited work to expose and stop the oil companies' \nunderpayment of royalties for the production of crude oil on federal \nand Indian lands.'' POGO's opponents believe POGO had sinister motives.\n  Mr. Thompson's report attempts to substantiate the opponents' \nsuspicions. I am troubled by Mr. Thompson's report for several reasons.\n  First, I am troubled by the very nature of Mr. Thompson's report. In \nhis letter of transmittal to Chairman Murkowski, Mr. Thompson makes \nvery serious charges against POGO; its chairman, Mr. Banta; its \nexecutive director, Ms. Brian; and the two federal employees who \nreceived the payments, Mr. Berman and Mr. Speir. He accuses POGO of \npaying the two men ``to influence the Department [of the Interior] \ntoward taking actions and adopting policies'' benefiting both POGO and \nthe two employees. Without saying so directly, Mr. Thompson's report \ninsinuates that POGO and the two employees may have broken federal \ncriminal laws against bribery, the payment and acceptance of \ngratuities, and the payment and acceptance of private compensation for \ngovernment service.\n\n  Yet nowhere in his 42-page report does Mr. Thompson present the \nevidence necessary to back up his charges. In place of evidence, he \noffers only theories, speculation, suspicions, circular reasoning, and \nhis personal conviction that all assertions of innocence from Ms. Brian \nand Messrs. Banta, Berman, and Speir are untrustworthy.\n  Second, I am troubled by the report's lack of a coherent theory of \nthe case. Mr. Thompson laboriously rebuts the explanations offered by \nPOGO, but never meets his own burdens of production and persuasion.\n  Part of his problem may stem from the fact that the chairman never \ndefined the scope of the inquiry. Mr. Thompson states that the ``chief \nconcern'' behind the inquiry was ``whether the payments represent an \nimproper influence upon the Department of the Interior's development of \nits new oil royalty valuation policy,'' but his report focuses little \nattention on this issue.\n  Whether the payments improperly influenced the Department of the \nInterior's oil valuation rule is, of course, a legitimate concern of \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. In his transmittal \nletter, Mr. Thompson concludes that the rule ``may have been improperly \ninfluenced by'' the payments. Yet his own report fails to support that \nconclusion. The report states that the two men's involvement in the \nrulemaking ``terminated'' around December 1996, before the Department \nof the Interior published its proposed rule in January 1997. After Mr. \nBerman and Mr. Speir stopped working on the rule, it was substantially \nrevised over the course of 8 public comment periods, 20 public meetings \nand workshops, the review of thousands of pages of testimony, and close \ncongressional oversight. Mr. Thompson's assertion that POGO's payments \nmay have ``improperly influenced'' the final rule simply is not \nsupported by the rulemaking record.\n  The bulk of Mr. Thompson's report is devoted to his search for an \nimproper motive for the payments. I do not believe that this is an \nappropriate use of the committee's investigative powers. The matter is \nnow under investigation by the Inspector General of the Department of \nthe Interior and the Public Integrity Section of the Department of \nJustice--as it should be. The appearance of impropriety created by the \npayments warrants investigation, but by the proper authorities. It is \nfor the appropriate law enforcement agencies and, ultimately, the \ncourts, not the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, to decide if \nany laws were broken.\n  This is particularly the case where, as here, the targets of the \ncommittee's investigation are not senior policy officials, but private \ncitizens or low-ranking civil servants, and where, as here, the \ncommittee has shown a strong bias against the targets of its probe. The \nchairman of the Energy Subcommittee publicly declared the payments to \nbe ``grossly unethical'' soon after they came to light in May 1999, and \nthe chairman of the full committee publicly declared them to involve \n``apparent gross impropriety'' only a month after Mr. Thompson began \nhis investigation.\n  The Framers wisely kept law enforcement and judicial powers out of \nCongress's hands, because, as Alexander Hamilton said, ``of the natural \npropensity of [legislative] bodies to party divisions,'' and their fear \nthat ``the pestilential breath of [party] faction may poison the \nfountains of justice.'' The strong political feelings recently \ndisplayed in the House Committee on Resources over this matter bear \nthis out.\n  Over two centuries ago, Benjamin Franklin observed that ``There is no \nkind of dishonesty into which otherwise good people more easily and \nfrequently fall than that of defrauding the Government.'' All too \noften, otherwise good people are tempted to cheat their Government \nbecause they think they can get away with it. All too often, they do, \nbecause most fraud against the Government goes unreported. Most federal \nemployees are reluctant to report fraud because they believe nothing\n\n[[Page S7995]]\n\nwill be done if they do report it, or because they are afraid of \nreprisal.\n  For this reason, Congress amended the False Claims Act in 1986, in \nthe words of the Judiciary Committee, ``to encourage any individual \nknowing of Government fraud to bring that information forward.'' The \n1986 amendments offer large rewards to whistleblowers who bring a \nsuccessful false claims action and afford new protections against \nemployer retaliation. While the amendments do not expressly authorize \nfederal employees to file whistleblower suits, the courts have \ngenerally read the amended law to permit them to, since the courts \nrecognize that federal employees are often in the best position to \nuncover and report government fraud.\n  What happened here seems fairly clear. Two federal employees had \ninformation they believed showed that oil companies were defrauding the \nGovernment. They brought it forward to their agencies. They also, it \nseems likely, may have shared some of that information with POGO. They \ncould have openly joined POGO's False Claims Act suit but, for whatever \nreason, they chose not to. They chose instead to become, in effect, \nsilent partners in POGO's suit. POGO generously, if foolishly, shared \nits windfall with them.\n  Probably all concerned would now agree that this arrangement was a \nserious mistake. POGO has handed its opponents a powerful weapon with \nwhich to wound its credibility and its effectiveness. It has not only \nbrought down a world of trouble on itself, Mr. Berman, and Mr. Speir, \nbut it has deflected attention away from the question of whether the \noil companies defrauded the Government to the matter before us.\n  At the very least, the payment of large sums of money by an outside \nsource to a federal employee for work related activities creates an \nappearance of impropriety. If the appropriate authorities ultimately \ndetermine that the payments to Mr. Berman and Mr. Speir were \nnot unlawful, then Congress may need to tighten the conflict of \ninterest laws to more clearly bar federal employees from accepting such \npayments in the future, or to amend the False Claims Act to prevent \nfederal employees from aiding or benefiting from False Claims Act \nsuits. Crafting a legislative solution that would prevent a recurrence \nof this problem in the future would, in my view, be a more \nconstructive--and far more appropriate--use of the Senate's time and \nenergy than trying to build a case against POGO and Messrs. Berman and \nSpeir.\n\n  Any changes in the current laws should, however, be carefully drawn \nto avoid shutting off the legitimate flow of allegations and \ninformation about government fraud and corruption from federal \nemployees to organizations like POGO. These organizations play a \nvaluable role in exposing government fraud and corruption. They offer a \nsafe harbor to federal employees who may be unable or unwilling to come \nforward publicly on their own. We may not always agree with the causes \nthey espouse or the allegations they make, but we would make a terrible \nmistake if we were to choke off the flow of allegations and information \nto them or still their voice.\n  They must, of course, operate within the law. Good intentions do not \ngive them, or the people that come to them, free rein to violate \nfederal conflict of interest laws, agency ethnic rules, or the \nprotective orders of the courts. If anything like that happened in this \ncase, then POGO and the two federal employees should be held \naccountable by the appropriate law enforcement officials and the \ncourts. But, as the Supreme Court has admonished us in the past, \nCongress is not a law enforcement agency or a judicial tribunal, and we \nshould not presume to be one in this case.\n  The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, like most of the \nSenate's standing committees, from time to time, has to conduct \ninvestigations into certain matters to do its job. The Energy Committee \nhas, in recent years, conducted a number of sensitive investigations \ninto serious allegations of wrongdoing leveled against senior \nAdministration officials whose nominations were pending before the \ncommittee. Each of these investigations was handled very thoroughly and \nprofessionally on a bipartisan basis by the committee's own lawyers.\n  Special, partisan investigations like Mr. Thompson's carry with them \nspecial problems. By focusing exclusively on proving the guilt of their \nchosen target, they tend to lose sight of the larger picture and their \nsense of proportion. Justice Robert Jackson warned us of this danger in \nthe case of prosecutors who ``pick people'' they think they ``should \nget rather than cases that need to be prosecuted.''\n\n       With the law books filled with a great assortment of \n     crimes, [Justice Jackson said,] a prosecutor stands a fair \n     chance of finding at least a technical violation of some act \n     on the part of almost anyone. In such a case, it is not a \n     question of discovering the commission of a crime and then \n     looking for the man who has committed it, it is a question of \n     picking a man and then searching the law books, or putting \n     investigators to work, to pin some offense on him. It is in \n     this realm--in which the prosecutor picks some person he \n     dislikes or desires to embarrass, or selects some group of \n     unpopular persons and then looks for an offense, that the \n     great danger of abuse of prosecuting power lies. It is here \n     that law enforcement becomes personal, and the real crime \n     becomes that of being unpopular with the predominant or \n     governing group, being attached to the wrong political views, \n     or being personally obnoxious to or in the way of the \n     prosecutor himself.\n\n  Sadly, I fear that has happened in this case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S7995-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7995-S7997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COST OF REPORTED BILLS BY THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

CBO estimates that the \n     bill would authorize about $2 billion (in 2000 dollars) for \n     these projects.\n       Other provisions of the bill would authorize the Secretary \n     to conduct studies on water resources needs and feasibility \n     studies for specified projects; authorize the Secretary to \n     convey or exchange certain properties; renew, end, or modify \n     previous authorizations for certain projects; and authorize \n     new programs or pilot projects to develop water resources and \n     protect the natural environmental, including a program to \n     restore the natural environment of the south Florida \n     ecosystem. For these activities, CBO estimates that S. 2796 \n     would authorize the appropriation of about $1.7 billion.\n       Assuming the appropriation of the necessary amounts, \n     including adjustments for increases in anticipated inflation, \n     CBO estimates that implementing S. 2796 would cost about $1.6 \n     billion over the 2001-2005 period, and another $2.5 billion \n     over the following 10 years for the projects that would be \n     authorized by the bill. (Some construction costs and \n     operations and maintenance would occur after this period.) \n     CBO estimates that enacting S. 2796 would increase certain \n     offsetting receipts to the Federal Government by about $3 \n     million over the 2001-2003 period.

CBO adjusted those estimates to \n     reflect the impact of anticipated inflation during the time \n     between authorization and appropriation. Estimated outlays \n     are based on historical spending rates for activities of the \n     Corps.\n     Direct Spending (including Offsetting Receipts)\n       Land Exchange in Pike County, Missouri. S. 2796 would \n     authorize the Secretary to receive about 9 acres of land from \n     S.S.S. Lumber, Inc. and convey another 9 acres to the \n     company. If the land the government receives is less valuable \n     than the land the company receives, then the bill would \n     require the company to pay the difference. The bill also \n     requires the company to pay the administrative costs of the \n     exchange. After the exchange is completed, the Federal \n     Government would forgo a small amount of offsetting receipts \n     that are currently collected for the use of this land.\n       Joe Pool Lake, Trinity River Basin, Texas. S. 2796 would \n     authorize the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the \n     city of Grand Prairie, Texas, to transfer maintenance of Joe \n     Pool Lake from the Trinity River Authority to the city. The \n     bill would relieve the Trinity River Authority of its \n     remaining obligation to repay the Federal Government for \n     construction of the lake, and it would require the city to \n     pay the Federal Government about $2 million in both 2001 and \n     2003 as a condition of the agreement. Based on information \n     from the Corps, CBO expects the Trinity River Authority will \n     pay its current obligation of about $1 million for 2001, but \n     will default on its subsequent obligations to the government, \n     which total about $14 million over the next 39 years. Because \n     the government would receive more money under S. 2796 than \n     under current law, the agreement with the city would increase \n     offsetting receipts by $1 million in 2001 and $2 million in \n     2003.\n     Pay-As-You-Go Considerations\n       The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act sets \n     up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting \n     spending or receipts.

State and local governments probably would incur \n     some costs to meet the matching requirements for water \n     resources development projects and other programs authorized \n     by this bill, but these costs would be voluntary. Some State \n     and local governments would benefit from provisions in the \n     bill that would alter cost-sharing obligations.\n       CBO estimates that non-Federal entities (primarily State \n     and local governments) that choose to participate in the \n     projects and programs authorized by S. 2796 would spend about \n     $2.5 billion (in 2000 dollars) to match the authorized \n     Federal funds. These estimates are based on information \n     provided by the Corps. In addition to these costs, non-\n     Federal entities would pay for the operation and maintenance \n     of many of the projects after they are constructed.\n       S. 2796 would authorize new environmental restoration \n     programs in several areas of the country. Under these \n     programs, the Secretary of the Army would select projects and \n     enter into agreements with local interests to carry them out \n     and share in the costs. Generally, the non-Federal share of \n     these costs would be 35 percent. The bill also would direct \n     the Corps to carry out a number of projects in support of a \n     plan to restore the Florida Everglades. Non-Federal \n     participants in these projects would pay 50 percent of the \n     project costs.\n       One section of this bill would benefit non-Federal \n     participants in Corps projects by broadening an existing \n     provision, which requires the Corps to consider the ability \n     of non-Federal participants to pay their share of project \n     costs. Under current law, cost-sharing agreements for flood \n     control projects and agricultural water supply projects are \n     subject to this ``ability to pay'' provision. S. 2796 would \n     add other types of projects, including feasibility studies \n     and projects for environmental protection and restoration, \n     navigation, storm damage protection, shoreline erosion, and \n     hurricane protection.\n       Estimated Impact on the Private Sector: The bill contains \n     no new private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.\n       Estimate Prepared by: Federal Costs: Rachel Applebaum (226-\n     2860); Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: \n     Marjorie Miller (225-3220); Impact on the Private Sector: \n     Sarah Sitarek (226-2940).\n       Estimate Approved by: Peter H.

The bill would authorize appropriations \n     for projects estimated to cost $791 million (at 2000 prices). \n     S. 2797 would require the Secretary to fund 50 percent of the \n     operations and maintenance costs for the specified projects, \n     and to provide administrative support for this effort.\n       Assuming appropriations for the authorized projects and \n     adjusting their estimated costs for anticipated inflation. \n     CBO estimates that implementing S. 2797 would cost $254 \n     million over the 2001-2005 period, and $665 million over the \n     succeeding 5 years. After 2010, program administration, \n     operations, and maintenance for the specified projects would \n     cost about $12 million annually, S. 2797 would not affect \n     direct spending or receipts; therefore, pay-as-you-go \n     procedures would not apply.\n       S. 2797 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined \n     in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA).

CBO adjusted the \n     estimated project costs to reflect the impact of anticipated \n     inflation during the time between authorization and \n     appropriation. That adjustment brings projected funding for \n     project design and construction to about $900 million.\n       Estimated outlays are based on historical spending rates \n     for construction projects of the Corps. Outlays are projected \n     to increase significantly after 2004 as design and \n     preliminary work would be completed and major construction \n     work would begin. CBO also estimated the Corps' \n     administrative expenses under the bill (about $3 million a \n     year), as well as operations and maintenance costs ($11 \n     million from 2007 to 2010), and the cost\n\n[[Page S7997]]\n\n     to the Department of the Interior to purchase certain land \n     specified in the bill ($2 million).\n       Pay-As-You-Go Considerations: None.\n     Intergovernmental and Private-Sector Impact\n       S. 2797 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in UMRA.

Mr. President, I rise today to say how pleased I am that \nthe President recently signed into law H.R. 1749, legislation that \ndesignates Wilson Creek in North Carolina as a wild and scenic river. \nThis legislation passed the House of Representatives without \nopposition, and I was proud to support it here in the Senate and to see \nit pass just prior to the August recess.\n  The designation of Wilson Creek as a wild and scenic river is \ncritically important to the local community. It will protect Wilson \nCreek for use by those who seek a relaxing hike in the woods or an \nexciting rafting experience. The scenic and recreational areas along \nWilson Creek are also some of the most beautiful and ecologically \nvaluable countryside in all of North Carolina. In a time when all of us \nhave so much going on in our lives, Wilson Creek will provide us with a \nplace to relax and enjoy a bit of the natural world.\n  Wilson Creek is truly a national treasure. It possesses remarkable \nscenic and recreational value and is home to a wide variety of plant \nand animal species. It is designated as an Outstanding Resource Water, \nindicating its exceptional recreational and ecological significance and \nhigh level of water quality. It winds its way through rare geologic \nrock formations that are also quite beautiful. The pools and rapids \nalong Wilson Creek provide opportunities for canoe and kayak \nenthusiasts to test their skills or take a relaxing paddle. For years, \nvisitors have camped, hiked, fished and played along Wilson Creek, and \nthis designation will ensure that they will continue to enjoy all that \nthe area has to offer for years to come.\n  I would also like to say a few words about the history of this \nlegislation and the impressive effort that has led us to this important \npoint. It is not enough to say that this measure was a bipartisan \neffort. This law is the result of a cooperative effort spearheaded by \nthe Caldwell County Commissioners, in which every interested party had \na voice. Working with the Forest Service, the Avery County \nCommissioners, the Caldwell County Chamber of Commerce, the Caldwell \nCounty Economic Development Commission, local landowners and the local \ncommunity, the Commissioners helped develop this important plan to \nprotect permanently Wilson Creek. That this legislation has had such \nstrong local support is a testament to the hard work put forward by all \nof these groups and individuals. The collaborative effort to craft and \npass this legislation will serve as a model for other communities that \nmay have similar projects. They are to be commended for their efforts. \nI would also like to thank other local officials, citizens, the Forest \nService, and everyone else who dedicated so much time, effort, and \nheart to get us to this point.\n  Many portions along Wilson Creek exist much as they did more than 100 \nyears ago, and I believe we must do all we can to preserve them. We \nhave a rare opportunity to protect a critically important waterway for \nfuture generations, and I am so pleased to see it become law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S7997-4", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7997-S7998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           DEVILS LAKE OUTLET\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have spoken many times about the \nneed for an emergency outlet for Devils Lake. An article from the Fargo \nForum reaffirms the need to act expediently to build an emergency \noutlet for Devils Lake before a catastrophic natural spill occurs.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n\n                 [From the Fargo Forum, Aug. 22, 2000]\n\n                     USGS Adds Evidence for Outlet\n\n       A little-noticed report from the U.S. Geological Survey \n     adds more to the vast body of evidence that the Devils Lake, \n     N.D., area is in a wet cycle and will remain in a wet cycle \n     for some time to come.\n       And that means Devils Lake, which rose 25 feet from \n     February 1993 to August 1999, likely will continue to rise. \n     The lake's elevation today is about 1446.3 feet, or slightly \n     down\n\n[[Page S7998]]\n\n     from last year's 130-year high. The lake naturally discharges \n     into Stump Lake to the east at level 1447 feet, and into the \n     Tolna Coulee and Sheyenne River at elevation 1459 feet.\n       Given the USGS conclusions that the wet conditions which \n     have dominated the region since 1977 will continue for at \n     least another decade, it is not unreasonable to assume the \n     lake will rise to the breakout level of 1459 feet.\n       What happens then?\n       USGS research suggests a spill into the Sheyenne River \n     would be catastrophic downstream. A discharge would erode \n     sediments in the natural drainage pathways and dump up to 2 \n     million acre feet of water into the river, or about four \n     times the volume of the 1997 flood at Lisbon, N.D. That \n     incredible flood of water would be in addition to normal \n     flows in the Sheyenne.\n       Opponents of a Devils Lake outlet refuse to recognize the \n     potential of a lake breakout. Like blissful Pollyannas, they \n     don't believe the worst can happen.\n       It can. If wet conditions persist and nothing is done to \n     control the lake's level, it will.\n       USGS also says a properly managed outlet would moderate the \n     effects of a catastrophic natural lake breakout. An outlet \n     might not prevent a natural spill into the Sheyenne, but USGS \n     believes chances of a damaging spill would be reduced. Spill \n     volumes and durations would be reduced, thus reducing \n     downstream damage.\n       An outlet remains the best option for managing the lake's \n     level and protecting downstream interests on the Sheyenne \n     River. The USGS report is the latest evidence supporting an \n     outlet.\n       Flood prevention is better than reacting to a disaster. The \n     permanent flood at Devils Lake has caused more than its share \n     of personal heartache and property damage. As the lake \n     rises--it will--the potential for disaster will rise with it. \n     Building an outlet now at least will put in place a tool to \n     moderate the effects of the rising water.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S7998-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMERICANS FAVOR DEATH-TAX REPEAL\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, a number of Senators who opposed the \nDeath Tax Elimination Act have spoken on the Senate floor in recent \nweeks, suggesting that only a few people care about the unfairness of \nthe tax.\n  During the death-tax repeal debate back in July, one of the tax's \nproponents went so far as to question ``whose side are you on?'' if you \nfavor repeal. I have no difficulty answering that at all. We are on the \nside of the American people.\n  A June 22-25 Gallup poll found that 60 percent of the people support \nrepeal, even though about three-quarters of those supporters do not \nthink they will ever have to pay a death tax themselves.\n  A poll conducted by Zogby International on July 6 found that, given a \nchoice between a candidate who believes that a large estate left to \nheirs should be taxed at a rate of 50 percent for anything over $2 \nmillion, and a candidate who believes that the estate tax is unfair to \nheirs and should be eliminated, 75 percent of the people prefer the \nperson supporting death-tax repeal.\n  Other polls similarly put support for repeal at between 70 and 80 \npercent.\n  Some issues are simply about fairness. It does not matter who \nbenefits. Death-tax proponents just cannot seem to understand that, but \nthe American people do.\n  The American people have an unwavering sense of fairness. They \nrecognize that there is something terribly wrong when, despite having \ntaxed someone for a lifetime, the federal government can come back one \nmore time when a person dies and take more than half of whatever is \nleft. That is not only unfair, it threatens the American dream.\n  That is why repeal scores high with the American people in public-\nopinion polls. It is why repeal is supported by a broad coalition of \nsmall business, minority, environmental, family, and seniors \norganizations. Among those groups are the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Indian Business Association, the National Black \nChamber of Commerce, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, to name just a few.\n  Fairness, that is what the effort to repeal the death tax is all \nabout.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S7998-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     LOCAL RABBI SHEDS TEARS OF JOY\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, Rabbi Israel Zoberman, the leader of \nCongregation Beth Chaverim in Virginia Beach and President of the \nHampton Roads Board of Rabbis, recently offered some inspirational \ncomments on the selection of our colleague, Senator Joseph I. \nLieberman, as the Democratic Nominee for Vice President of the United \nStates. I ask that Rabbi Zoberman's comments be printed in the Record.\n\n               [From the Virginian-Pilot, Aug. 28, 2000]\n\n        Jewish Candidate for VP: Local Rabbi Sheds Tears of Joy\n\n                       (By Rabbi Israel Zoberman)\n\n       The Jewish response to events tends to fluctuate from the \n     extreme of elation, of mazal tov!, to the extreme of despair, \n     of oy vey! It is no wonder since the Jewish condition \n     poignantly reflects the tension between the two poles of the \n     human experience; bringing about either a Messianic \n     exaltation concerning sheer survival or a painful note \n     acknowledging a harsh reality.\n       Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is quoted as \n     saying in the past that when you give a Jew optimistic news \n     he turns pessimistic. This exaggeration by the hitherto \n     highest ranking Jewish American, a refugee from Nazi Germany, \n     who lacks Senator Joseph Lieberman's proud religious \n     attachment, is rooted in Jewish caution given the trying \n     lessons of its historical experience. It was no surprise then \n     that upon Senator Lieberman's nomination to the National \n     Democratic ticket, there were those Jews who felt that the \n     ever feared specter of anti-Semitism of pre-World War II days \n     might rear its ugly head again. However, the hardcore anti-\n     Semites on the very fringes of society, already assert that \n     the Jews control the world.\n       There were those whose first impulse was to give thanks for \n     the ``miracle'' of finally removing a remaining barrier \n     carrying much symbolism. Since American Jews have already \n     made it in our great land, it serves as a significant \n     reminder that not all doors have been fully open. For most \n     Jews, it probably was a mixed response, weighing all possible \n     consequences to the historic act.\n       Who could remain neutral to Senator Lieberman's own genuine \n     joy mingled with deep, though inclusive, religious \n     expression, and his wife Hadassah's touching sharing of her \n     family Holocaust background. I myself, son of survivors who \n     spent his early childhood in a Displaced Persons Camp in \n     Germany, was moved to tears witnessing a great American drama \n     unfold, reaching a new high.\n       Indeed we have reason to rejoice in America moving closer \n     to fulfilling its promise to all its citizens with renewed \n     hope now that the highest offices in the land will be \n     available to qualified minority candidates of all groups.\n       At this turning point, America has the curiosity and \n     opportunity to learn more about the heritage of its fellow \n     Jewish citizens, with its various spiritual movements, in the \n     way that only this breakthrough event can provide. American \n     Jews, at the same time, are poised to hopefully become more \n     reassured about their own religious and ethnic affiliation in \n     a country where their major challenge is not being rejected \n     as Americans in this, our most hospitable home, but rather \n     retaining their Jewish identity in face of unprecedented easy \n     assimilation into the mainstream.\n       The possible reinvigoration of the political process \n     because of the presently injected excitement, in spite of yet \n     to be proved American response and maturation over the \n     religious factor, is certainly a worthy plus. What our nation \n     urgently needs is less apathy and more involvement by all in \n     an environment with diminished interest in politics and an \n     embarrassing low voting record, which ultimately are the \n     dangers facing our democracy. Civil disagreement, too, on \n     important issues ought to replace the evident cultural war \n     which threatens to tear apart the precious pluralistic fabric \n     of the enviable American quilt--with church and State \n     separation the golden thread keeping it together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S7998-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7998-S7999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WILLIAM MAXWELL\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN.

He had the power to bless.\n  I ask that a copy of Wilborn Hampton's obituary from the August 1st \nedition of The New York Times be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S7999]]\n\n        [From The New York Times Obituaries, Tues. Aug. 1, 2000]\n\n         William Maxwell, 91, Author and Legendary Editor, Dies\n\n                          (By Wilborn Hampton)\n\n       William Maxwell, a small-town boy from Illinois who edited \n     some of the century's literary lions in 40 years at The New \n     Yorker while also writing novels and short stories that \n     secured his own place in American letters, died yesterday at \n     his home in Manhattan. He was 91.\n       John Updike, whose early stories for The New Yorker were \n     edited by Mr. Maxwell, said in an interview several years \n     ago: ``They don't make too many Bill Maxwells. A good editor \n     is one who encourages a writer to write his best, and that \n     was Bill.''\n       ``A lot of nice touches in my stories belong to Bill \n     Maxwell,'' Mr. Updike said. ``And I've taken credit for them \n     all.''\n       In addition to Mr. Updike, Mr. Maxwell, in his career as a \n     fiction editor at The New Yorker, worked with writers like \n     John Cheever, John O'Hara, J.D. Salinger, Shirley Hazzard, \n     Vladimir Nabokov, Mary McCarthy, Eudora Welty, Harold \n     Brodkey, Mavis Gallant, Isaac Bashevis Singer and Frank \n     O'Connor.\n       Polishing their manuscripts exerted an influence on his own \n     writing, which included six novels, three collections of \n     short stories, a memoir (``Ancestors,'' 1971), a volume of \n     essays and fantasies for children. ``I came, as a result of \n     being an editor, to look for whatever was unnecessary in my \n     own writing,'' he said in a 1995 interview. ``After 40 years, \n     what I came to care about most was not style, but the breath \n     of life.''\n       William Keepers Maxwell Jr. was born in Lincoln, Ill., on \n     August 16, 1908, one of three sons of William Keepers \n     Maxwell, an insurance executive, and the former Eva Blossom \n     Blinn. When he was 10, his mother died in the influenza \n     epidemic of 1918-19, a shattering experience that he would \n     revisit in ``They Came Like Swallows'' (1937), his second \n     novel and the one that established him as a writer. His 14 \n     years in Lincoln (sometimes called Draperville or Logan in \n     his books), would provide, as Mr. Maxwell later put it, \n     ``three-quarters of the material I would need for the rest of \n     my writing life.''\n       Lincoln was a postcard Midwestern town with tree-shaded \n     streets and a courthouse square where an annual carnival was \n     held and people paraded on patriotic holidays. In 1992 Mr. \n     Maxwell wrote a reminiscence (in ``Billy Dyer and Other \n     Stories'') of the ``many marvels'' of Lincoln:\n       ``No house, inside or out, was like any other house, and \n     neither were the people who lived in them. Incandescent \n     carbon lamps, suspended high over the intersections, lighted \n     the way home. The streets were paved with brick, and elm \n     trees met over them to provide a canopy of shade. There were \n     hanging baskets of ferns and geraniums, sometimes with \n     American flags, suspended from porch ceilings. The big \n     beautiful white horses in the firehouse had to be exercised, \n     and so on my way to school now and then I got to see the fire \n     engine when nobody's house was on fire.''\n       After Mr. Maxwell's mother died, he went to live with an \n     aunt and uncle in Bloomington, Ill., which, compared with \n     Lincoln, was a metropolis and ``where something was always \n     going on, even if it was only the cat having kittens.''\n       From his earliest years, he loved reading. As David \n     Streitfeld put it in an article in The Washington Post, \n     ``Maxwell requires printed matter the way other people need \n     oxygen.'' Mr. Maxwell said ``Treasure Island'' was the first \n     work of literature he ever read. ``At the last page, I turned \n     back to the beginning,'' he said. ``I didn't stop until I had \n     read it five times. I've been that way ever since.''\n       Mr. Maxwell's father eventually remarried and moved to \n     Chicago, taking his family with him. Mr. Maxwell earned a \n     bachelor's degree at the University of Illinois and a \n     master's at Harvard and taught in Illinois for two years. As \n     a youth he wanted to be a poet, but realized early that he \n     did not have that gift and so started writing stories. He had \n     published one novel, ``Bright Center of Heaven'' (1934), and \n     had a second in his typewriter when he moved to New York with \n     the $200 advance and applied for a job at The New Yorker.\n       There was a vacancy in the art department, and Mr. Maxwell \n     was hired at $35 a week to fill it. ``I sat in on meetings \n     and then told artists what changes were wanted,'' he said. He \n     eventually moved to the fiction department, where he worked \n     with Katharine White, with whom he formed a lifelong \n     friendship, though one that was always circumscribed by their \n     professional status. Long after both retired, they still \n     wrote letters that began, ``Dear Mrs. White,'' and ``Dear Mr. \n     Maxwell.''\n       One day during World War II he interviewed a young woman \n     who had applied for a job as poetry editor at The New Yorker. \n     The magazine did not have a separate poetry editor in those \n     days, and Mr. Maxwell had been doubling in that capacity. \n     ``She was very attractive,'' he would succinctly explain \n     later, ``and I pursued the matter.''\n       The woman did not get the job, but on May 17, 1945. Emily \n     Gilman Noyes and Mr. Maxwell were married. The couple had two \n     daughters, Kate Maxwell and Brookie Maxwell, both of whom \n     live in Manhattan. Mrs. Maxwell died on July 23, in \n     Manhattan. Besides his daughters, Mr. Maxwell is survived by \n     a grandson and a brother, Robert Blinn Maxwell, of Oxnard, \n     Calif.\n       Mr. Maxwell's last book was ``All the Days and Nights,'' a \n     collection of stories of fables. In a radio interview he said \n     he began the book ``because my wife liked to have me tell her \n     stories when we were in bed in the dark before falling \n     asleep.''\n       As an editor, Mr. Maxwell was known for his tact in dealing \n     with authors with reputations for being headstrong. He didn't \n     always succeed. Brendan Gill wrote in his memoir, ``Here at \n     The New Yorker,'' that Mr. Maxwell once took the train to \n     Ossining, N.Y., to tell John Cheever that the magazine was \n     rejecting one of his stories. Cheever became furious, not so \n     much at the rejection, but that his courtly editor felt it \n     necessary to come tell him in person.\n       On another occasion, Mr. Maxwell again boarded a train, \n     this time to go read three new stories by John O'Hara in the \n     presence of the author. It was a command performance and he \n     was nervous. The first two stories he read were not \n     acceptable to The New Yorker, and Mr. Maxwell started reading \n     the third with trepidation. Fortunately, the third turned out \n     to be ``Imagine Kissing Pete,'' one of O'Hara's best.\n       Some of Cheever's later stories caused consternation at The \n     New Yorker because of the erotic content. When William Shawn, \n     then the editor, objected to a reference to lust, ``I was \n     beside myself,'' Mr. Maxwell said, ``It seems very old-\n     fashioned now, but then it was unacceptable, and there was \n     nothing I could do about it.''\n       When John Updike has his own editorial battles at The New \n     Yorker, he said he always found an ally in Mr. Maxwell. \n     ``There was always a lot of fiddling, and a lot of the \n     fiddles came from Shawn. And Bill would assist me in ignoring \n     them.''\n       Sometimes it was the editor who benefited from the advice \n     of the writter. Mr. Maxwell has been working for eight years \n     on a novel that was eventually titled ``The Chateau'' (1961), \n     which he has set in France rather than in the familiar \n     territory of the American Midwest. But it was not coming \n     together. He showed the manuscript to Frank O'Connor, who \n     read it and advised him that there were, in fact, two novels \n     there. ``My relief was immense,'' Mr. Maxwell said, ``because \n     it is a lot easier to make two novels into one than it is to \n     make one out of nothing whatever. So I went ahead and \n     finished the book.''\n       The letters of Frank O'Connor and Mr. Maxwell from 1945 to \n     1996, the year of O'Connor's death, were published in 1968 \n     under the title ``The Happiness of Getting It Down Right.'' \n     O'Connor, a prolific contributor to The New Yorker, \n     revised endlessly, and after his death left 17 versions of \n     one story that the magazine had eventually rejected.\n       Mr. Maxwell's lack of celebrity never disturbed him. ``Why \n     should I let best-seller lists spoil a happy life?'' he said.\n       Among his novels are ``Time Will Darken It'' (1948) and \n     ``So Long, See You Tomorrow'' (1980). His story collections \n     included ``The Old Man at the Railroad Crossing and Other \n     Tales'' (1966), ``Over by the River, and Other Stories'' \n     (1977) and ``Billy Dyer and Other Stories'' (1992). A \n     collection of essays was published as ``The Outermost Dream'' \n     in 1989.\n       The 1995 Alfred A. Knopf published a collection of his \n     stories under the title ``All the Days and Nights,'' and Mr. \n     Maxwell gained some long overdue public recognition. Jonathan \n     Yardley, writing in The Washington Post, said the volume \n     showed that ``Maxwell has maintained not merely a high level \n     of consistency but has, if anything, become over the years a \n     deeper and more complex writer.''\n       His honors included the American Book Award, the Brandeis \n     Creative Arts Medal and the William Dean Howells Medal of the \n     American Academy of Arts and Letters. (He was elected to the \n     academy in 1963.)\n       In March 1997 Mr. Maxwell wrote an article for The New York \n     Times Magazine in which he talked about his life as a writer \n     and the experiences of age:\n       ``Out of the corner of my eye I see my 90th birthday \n     approaching. I don't yet need a cane, but I have a feeling \n     that my table manners have deteriorated. My posture is what \n     you'd expect of someone addicted to sitting in front of a \n     typewriter.\n       ``Because I actively enjoy sleeping, dreams, the \n     unexplainable dialogues that take place in my head as I am \n     drifting off, all that, I tell myself that lying down to an \n     afternoon nap that goes on and on through eternity is not \n     something to be concerned about,'' he continued. ``What \n     spoils this pleasant fancy is the recollection that when \n     people are dead, they don't read books. This I find \n     unbearable. No Tolstoy, no Chekhov, no Elizabeth Bowen, no \n     Keats, no Rilke.\n       ``Before I am ready to call it quits I would like to reread \n     every book I have ever deeply enjoyed, beginning with Jane \n     Austen and going through shelf after shelf of the bookcases, \n     until I arrive at the `Autobiographies' of William Butler \n     Yeats.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S7999-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7999-S8000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EASTER SEALS OF SOUTHEASTERN MICHIGAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President. I come here to pay tribute to the \nremarkable career of one of our nation's most influential labor and \ncivil rights leaders, Dolores Huerta, who has retired as Secretary-\nTreasurer of the United Farm Workers of America.\n  Dolores Huerta is a true national treasure. For half a century, the \ngreat victories for farm workers, the advances for these hardworking \nand proud families, would not have been possible without the able \nleadership and vision of Dolores Huerta. When farm workers marched, \nDolores led the way. When farm workers struck for better wages and \nworking conditions, Dolores was at the front of the line. In all of the \ngreat boycotts for better jobs for farm workers and their families, it \nwas Dolores who pulled it all together.\n  Farm workers are her family. And all of us in public life soon \nlearned that if something was wrong with her brother and sisters in the \nfield, Dolores would be knocking on doors to set things right. Her \nactivism was ignited when as a teacher, many of her students came to \nschool suffering from hunger and without adequate clothing. Frustrated \nby the plight of these children, Dolores decided that she could best \nserve her community by working as a grass roots advocate and refocused \nher life to the economic empowerment of the parents of her students--\nthe farm workers.\n  In 1955, she founded the Stockton, California chapter of the \nCommunity Service Organization. There, she began to develop her \nleadership skills through the organization's advocacy work to end \nsegregation and police brutality, promoting voter registration, and \nimproving public services for the disenfranchised.\n  The plight of migrant farm workers always remained a central part of \nher public service. She soon met her kindred spirit in the cause for \nfarm worker rights, Cesar Chavez. Dolores and Cesar embarked on a new \npath to bring the plight of farm workers in our national consciousness. \nIn 1962, they founded the National Farm Workers Association, the \npredecessor to the United Farm Workers. Never before did farm workers \nhave a voice in the political process. Under her leadership as \nPolitical Director, farm workers began to understand that they could \nachieve social justice by organizing strikes, boycotts, and voter \nregistration drives. Through Dolores' leadership, once invisible farm \nworkers were now given a human face and became an integral part of the \nstruggle to gain civil rights and equal justice for people of all \ncolors and economic backgrounds.\n  Dolores will always hold a special place in the hearts of the Kennedy \nfamily. Dolores and Cesar Chavez developed a special relationship with \nmy brother Bobby for John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign. \nTogether, they established the ``Viva Kennedy'' voter registration \ndrive for Hispanic voters in California. That effort was revived in \n1968 for Bobby's presidential campaign. l will always remember how her \ndedication and hard work were instrumental to my brother's California \nprimary victory. Dolores made it possible for Bobby to reach out to \nMexican-Americans and convey the message of a common vision for equal \njustice. She encouraged those who believed that they were \ndisenfranchised to come to the polls for the first time to join in the \nfight for civil rights and human dignity. My family will always \nremember and respect Dolores for her strong and skillful efforts as \nwell as her commitment to the great goals that we share.\n  1973 was yet another turning point for the farm worker movement. When \ngrape growers decided to discontinue the collective bargaining \nagreements with the United Farm Workers, Dolores organized a national \nboycott and public education campaign to inform consumers of the poor \nworking conditions and unfair wages that farm workers endured from the \nagricultural industry. The striking farm workers were subjected to \nsevere harassment and violence. Many of them lost their lives in the \nstruggle. But they would not give up until justice was won. In the end, \nthe California legislature enacted the Agricultural Labor Relations \nAct. For the first time, farm workers were granted the right to \ncollectively organize and bargain for better wages and working \nconditions.\n  Cesar Chavez passed on seven years ago, but the struggle of the farm \nworkers continues. At a time in which most people settle into the \nslower pace of their golden years, Dolores keeps on fighting the \nbattles that have not yet been won. I am delighted to hear that she \nwill still be on the ramparts and in the trenches for workers in need \nof her help. Dolores continues to do all she can to empower future \ngenerations of Americans to carry the torch that she let so brightly \nshine over these challenging years. She will also continue her efforts \nto increase Latino voter participation and develop strong leadership \nopportunities for Hispanic women around the country, and advocate for \nthe rights of immigrants and working people, speak on behalf of working \npeople across America.\n  Millions of Americans enjoy a higher quality of life because of her \nskillful efforts. No one has fought harder for civil rights of people \nof color, for worker's rights, for environmental rights, for women's \nand children's rights, for quality education and health care, and for \neconomic empowerment for the poor. The Kennedy family is proud to \nconsider Dolores a friend.\n  Dolores Huerta is a living legend and a true American hero. Her \nvision, compassion, and tireless commitment to all Americans is never \nending. Nothing we can say or do can truly repay her for all she has \ndone to make our country the strong and more just nation that it is \ntoday. From all of us who love and respect her, we say, ``Job well \ndone!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S8000-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting five \ntreaties which were referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S8000-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8000-S8001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 1999, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on July 28, 2000, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the House has passed the following bill:\n\n       S. 2869.

Lizama, known to his friends \n     and the large number of civic and community organizations as \n     ``Al,'' was arrested and sentenced to a year in prison for \n     charges stemming from an incident at the U.S. District Court \n     of Guam; and\n       Whereas, ``Al'' is a Historic Preservation Specialist II \n     employed with the Historic Resources Division of the Guam \n     Department of Parks and Recreation, devoting his life work to \n     the study, documentation and preservation of the Chamorro \n     culture through art, research and outreach; and\n       Whereas, ``Al,'' during his over twenty-five (25) years of \n     service as an employee of the Guam Department of Parks and \n     Recreation has shared this knowledge with the military and \n     federal community, including those from the Department of the \n     Air Force, the Department of Defense school system, and the \n     Navy Family Service Center, voluntarily conducting ``Welcome \n     to Guam Orientation'' programs and other outreach programs; \n     and\n       Whereas, ``Al'' is the recipient of countless certificates \n     of appreciation and commendation, voluntary service awards \n     and certificates of appreciation, including those from Major \n     General Richard T. Swope, USAF Commander, Thirteenth Air \n     Force; Colonel Stephen M. McClain, USAF Commander, 633d Air \n     Base Wing; Commander D. L. Metzig, U.S. Navy, Director of \n     Navy Family Service Center Guam, by direction of the \n     Commander; and Principal Steven Dozier, Guam Department of \n     Defense High School, for his many hours of voluntary service \n     to their Communities;\n       Whereas, in 1994 ``Al'' was selected and recognized as one \n     of Ten Employees of the Year in the ``Magnificent Seven \n     Program,'' a prestigious event which recognizes individuals \n     and groups for their achievements and contributions in the \n     service of the government of Guam; and\n       Whereas, ``Al'' is one (1) of just four (4) nominees for \n     the 2000 ``Governor's Award of Excellence,'' recognized for \n     his innumerable contributions to the Community over the \n     years, including, but not limited to, volunteering his time \n     to speak to students and members of the Community in outreach \n     programs about the significance of preserving one's culture \n     and past; and\n       Whereas, ``Al'' is an accomplished artist whose many \n     donated artworks appear proudly displayed in all parts of the \n     Island; and\n       Whereas, ``Al'' was awarded the ``Bronze Star Medal'' for \n     valor, the ``Combat Infantry's Badge'' and other Campaign \n     medals for his patriotic service and achievement during the \n     Vietnam War; and\n       Whereas, ``Al'' suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder \n     (``PSTD'') and was accepted to participate in the PTSD \n     Residential Rehabilitative Program in Hilo, Hawaii, to deal \n     with the trauma scars acquired during this service to our \n     Country in Vietnam; and\n       Whereas, it would be against the interests of both ``Al'' \n     and the Island Community, and would not advance the cause of \n     justice and retribution if he were to be incarcerated for a \n     full year; Now, therefore, be it.\n       Resolved, That I MinaBente Singko Na Liheslaturan Guahan \n     does hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, respectfully \n     request that clemency be granted to Veteran Alejandro T.B. \n     Lizama by President William J.

A bill to authorize a coordinated research program to ensure \nthe integrity, safety and reliability of natural gas and hazardous \nliquids pipelines, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\nthe pipeline integrity, safety and reliability research and development \n                              act of 2000\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to address a serious issue \ncurrently pending in the Senate--pipeline safety. On August 19, there \nwas a tragic pipeline accident in my state of New Mexico. A natural gas \ntransmission line ruptured at 5:30 a.m. that Saturday morning in a \nrural area south of Carlsbad, NM. Unfortunately, the rupture occurred \nnear a popular fishing spot along the Pecos river. Two families were \ncamped below the bridge traversed by the pipeline. Eleven people, \nincluding five small children, died when their favorite camping spot \nwas overcome by heat and flames. I have just learned that the one \nsurvivor, Amanda Smith, died earlier today. I would like to include a \ncouple of articles about the victims to be printed in the Record after \nmy statement. They should be remembered as individuals, not mere \nstatistics.\n  This was a human tragedy I can barely describe. I spoke briefly with \nMartha Chapman, mother of two of the victims, and grandmother of two of \nthe children. She had just returned to Carlsbad for the funeral from \nLubbock where she had been keeping vigil at the bedside of her \ndaughter-in-law. She was devastated. She said her whole life was gone. \nShe begged me to do what I could\n\n[[Page S8020]]\n\nto make sure something like this would never happen to another family. \nI had no words that could ease her grief, but I promised to do what I \ncould when I returned to Washington. That afternoon I went out to the \nsite to see firsthand the damage and what was being done to determine \nthe cause of the rupture.\n  I spent several hours with Kelley Coyner, the chief pipeline safety \nofficial at the Department of Transportation, and some of her engineers \nand inspectors. What became abundantly clear to me is that the Office \nof Pipeline Safety does not have adequate resources to carry out its \nmandate. There are only 55 inspectors for the entire interstate \npipeline system. Secondly, the agency needs the additional authority it \nhas requested in the current reauthorization bill to address the \ndifferent circumstances on individual pipelines.\n  The first thing we need to do is to ensure the Office of Pipeline \nSafety has the necessary resources to protect the public safety and the \nenvironment. The budget of the Office of Pipeline Safety is fully \nreimbursed by user fees charged to the pipeline operators, yet for the \nlast five years the Congress has under funded the agency's budget \nrequest. For FY 2001 the request was $47 million. The Senate has \nappropriated $43 million, the House only $40 million. I urge the \nconferees to increase the appropriation for FY 2001 to at least the \nrequested level.\n  Second, we need to pass the Pipeline Safety Reauthorization bill. The \nbill reported by the Commerce Committee requires each and every \ninterstate natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline to develop and \nimplement an integrity management plan. This approach will give the \nOffice of Pipeline Safety the authority to impose more rigorous \nrequirements, as necessary, to address areas with the greatest \nlikelihood of failures and on aging pipelines and those in populated or \nenvironmentally sensitive areas. This bill is a major step toward \nensuring the safety of our pipeline infrastructure. I am concerned, \nthough, that the authorization levels included in the bill as filed may \nnot be adequate for the task of a very individualized approach that \nwill require a significant increase in staffing to address regional \ndifferences and community-specific needs.\n  I would like to commend the efforts of Senator McCain, chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, and Senators Murray and Gorton and their staff, \nwho have all worked hard to move the reauthorization forward. I also \nwant to acknowledge Senators Breaux and Brownback for their efforts to \ninclude a workable set of requirements that can be fully implemented \nand enforced.\n  Although the National Transportation Safety Board has not determined \nthe cause of the accident in New Mexico, it appears that internal \ncorrosion was a major factor. The transmission line in New Mexico \nruptured at a point near a sharp bend in the pipe. An electronic \ninternal inspection device, commonly called a smart pig, which is used \nfor detecting corrosion in a pipeline, could not be run through that \nsection of pipe because of the bend. Currently, about the only way to \ninspect sections of pipe such as this is to dig up the pipe and \nevaluate it directly. The company in New Mexico is doing just that \nalong nearly 400 miles of pipeline to ensure there are not any other \nvulnerable spots along the pipe. But, with nearly 500,000 miles, and \ngrowing, of transmission lines across the country, this is not an \noptimal solution from the standpoint of time or cost.\n  This country has the technological capability to collect data from \nthe outer reaches of the solar system; we should be able to develop \ntechnologies to measure pipeline integrity under six feet of soil \nwithout digging up thousands of miles of pipe.\n\n  I asked one of the scientists from Sandia National Laboratories, one \nof the Department of Energy's multipurpose labs, to come to Carlsbad \nwith me to visit the site of the accident and to talk to the pipeline \nsafety experts about the gaps in our technical capabilities. The \nnational labs have capabilities for remote sensing, satellite \nmonitoring and materials development that could surely be adapted for \nbetter testing and inspection of the pipeline infrastructure. I am also \nwondering whether MEMS, the efforts at miniaturizing electronic \nequipment, could be applied to develop a smart pig, or device with the \nsame purpose, to negotiate older pipelines. Sandia has been working on \na project to upgrade the Russian pipeline system, the scientists have \nthe knowledge and expertise on pipeline operations to benefit our own \nsystem.\n  Since returning from Carlsbad, I have been working to develop a \nframework for a collaborative R effort directed by the Department of \nTransportation with the assistance of the Department of Energy and the \nNational Academy of Sciences. The Departments of Transportation and \nEnergy, as well as a number of industry research groups, including the \nPipeline Research Council International and the Gas Technology \nInstitute, currently conduct research on pipeline integrity, but there \nis no coordinated, prioritized plan to ensure the most critical issues \nare being addressed in the most effective manner. I am introducing a \nbill today, the Pipeline Integrity, Safety and Reliability Research and \nDevelopment Act of 2000, that will set up such a structure led by the \nDepartment of Transportation. I want to thank Senators McCain, \nHollings, Murray, Gorton, Robb, Brownback, Breaux, Domenici, Landrieu, \nKerry and Torricelli for cosponsoring this bill.\n  The bill directs DOT and DOE to work with an Advisory Committee set \nup by the National Academy of Sciences to develop a five-year \naccelerated plan of action to address the most critical R needs to \nensure pipeline integrity, safety and reliability. The Advisory \nCommittee would include representatives of the natural gas, oil and \npetroleum product pipelines, the national labs, universities, the \nindustry research groups, state pipeline safety officials, \nenvironmental organizations, pipeline safety advocates and any other \ntechnical experts the Academy includes.\n  According to a recent GAO report, ``From 1989 through 1998, pipeline \naccidents resulted in an average of about 22 fatalities per year. \nFatalities from pipeline accidents are relatively low when compared \nwith those from accidents involving other forms of freight \ntransportation: On average about 66 people die each year from barge \naccidents, about 590 from railroad accidents, and about 5100 from truck \naccidents.'' Recent accidents, including the tragedy in my state, have \nundermined public confidence in the safety of pipelines. As \npolicymakers we must take responsibility for restoring that confidence.\n  Natural gas and liquid pipelines are a critical element of our \nnation's energy infrastructure. They provide a cost-effective and \nrelatively safe means of delivering energy. As the economy has grown, \nand become increasingly urbanized, siting new pipelines has become more \nand more challenging. At the same time, the importance of these \npipelines has increased dramatically. Incidents on two gasoline \npipelines, relatively unnoticed since no one was injured, reduced their \noperations at a critical time this summer contributing to a gasoline \nprice spike of $2.50 a gallon in the northern Midwest. The rupture of \nthis major natural gas transmission line in New Mexico reduced supplies \ninto California at a critical time of peak electricity demand. I hope \nwe don't experience a major failure of a product line into the \nnortheast this fall or winter which could send the price heating oil \noff the charts.\n  I plan to offer my bill as an amendment to the pipeline safety \nreauthorization when it comes before the Senate. As the ranking member \non the Energy Committee and representative of a state crisscrossed with \nthousands of miles of pipelines, I urge my colleagues to support \npassage of the pipeline safety reauthorization bill with my amendment. \nI further urge you to support full funding for the Office of Pipeline \nSafety and the R program.\n  Let me indicate the cosponsors of this legislation: Senators McCain, \nHollings, Murray, Brownback, Domenici, Breaux, Robb, Torricelli, \nGorton, Kerry, and Landrieu. I ask unanimous consent to have the bill \nand two articles printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3002\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S8021]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to preserve access to outpatient cancer therapy \nservices under the medicare program by requiring the Health Care \nFinancing Administration to follow appropriate procedures and utilize a \nformal nationwide analysis by the Comptroller General of the United \nStates in making any changes to the rates of reimbursement for such \nservices; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      cancer care preservation act\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, in recent years, our nation has achieved \ntremendous advances in its War on Cancer--including developing \nbreakthrough therapies and expanding the cancer care delivery system of \nconvenient and low-cost community settings. This progress has enabled \nus to achieve an unprecedented reduction in American cancer deaths, \nwhich began in 1998.\n  Today, 90% of all chemotherapy treatments are delivered in community \nsettings like doctors' offices and outpatient hospital settings. Two \nimportant components of Medicare reimbursement for outpatient cancer \ntreatments support these community care sites: payment for drugs \nthemselves; and payment for the services of the physicians, nurses, and \nother caregivers who treat patients with cancer.\n  Unfortunately, the Health Care Financing Administration has targeted \noutpatient cancer therapy services for deep budget cuts. HCFA has \nproposed to reduce drastically Medicare reimbursement rates for cancer \ndrugs by unilaterally changing the definition of ``average wholesale \nprice,'' which is at the heart of the current reimbursement formula. \nWhile there are indications that drug reimbursements have often \nexceeded doctors' and hospitals' costs, these margins have been used to \nhelp cover costs for professional services, which are inadequately \nreimbursed according to the cancer community, the General Accounting \nOffice, and HCFA itself. Yet HCFA has not made any adjustments in these \nprofessional services payments.\n  The planned cuts in Medicare reimbursement rates threaten to force \ndoctors to send seniors with cancer out of the community settings where \nthey now receive care and into more expensive in-patient settings. As a \nresult, seniors may lose the option of receiving cancer treatments from \nthe caregivers of their choice in settings that are close to the \nsupport structure of family, friends, and community. In addition, since \nthe cost of cancer treatments are generally higher in hospital in-\npatient settings than they are in outpatient settings, this ill-\nconceived proposal to force seniors into hospitals will actually cause \nMedicare spending to rise.\n  Mr. President, I have heard from many Missourians--doctors, patients, \nand hospital officials--about how the Administration's planned cuts in \nMedicare outpatient cancer care reimbursement rates will negatively \nimpact patient care. I would like to share with my colleagues what some \nof them have told me.\n  Dr. Burton Needles of St. Louis wrote to me to say that his patients \nprefer receiving chemotherapy in his office rather than in the \nhospital, but that the planned cuts would make it impossible for him to \ncontinue treating Medicare cancer patients in his office. On the other \nside of the state in Kansas City, Dr. Christopher Sirridge said that \nthe result would be less accessible care for seniors with cancer, and \neven higher costs for the Medicare program.\n  In Columbia, officials at the Ellis Fischel Cancer Center have told \nme that HCFA's change in reimbursement rates would make it extremely \ndifficult for them to continue to be a source of chemotherapy and \nsupportive care for cancer patients.\n  And, finally, Mr. President, let me share the words of a cancer \npatient, Darlene Bahr, from St. Louis. Ms. Bahr wrote to me: ``I have \nbeen fighting cancer for 18 years. This is the fourth time I have \ncancer. I have been on a total of four years of chemo, which had been \nsuccessful. I am now on chemo and hope it will be successful again.'' \nMs. Bahr continues: ``If the physician's office and the hospital cannot \nafford to give me these drugs, where will I get them? Does Medicare \nwant to eliminate cancer care?''\n  Mr. President, Medicare beneficiaries like Ms. Bahr--who are facing \nbattles against cancer--must not be saddled with the added burden of \nworrying about whether they will receive the care they need, in the \nsetting they choose. Many doctors have communicated to HCFA and \nCongress that the Administration's plan to cut payments for cancer-\nfighting drug treatments will likely prevent doctors from delivering \noutpatient cancer care--leaving thousands of seniors without this \npreferred, and lower cost, option.\n  Congress must act to ensure that our progress in cancer treatment is \nnot undermined by bureaucratic, inappropriate changes to Medicare \nreimbursement rates for cancer care.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Cancer Care \nPreservation Act, which will guarantee that HCFA cannot implement any \nreductions to Medicare reimbursement for outpatient cancer treatment \nunless those changes: are developed in concert\n\n[[Page S8023]]\n\nwith the General Accounting Office, the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission, and representatives of the cancer care community, including \npatients, survivors, nurses, physicians, and researchers; provide for \nappropriate payment rates for outpatient cancer therapy services, based \nupon the determinations made by the General Accounting Office; and are \nauthorized by an act of Congress.\n  My legislation also will require GAO to complete a formal nationwide \nanalysis to determine the physician and non-physician clinical \nresources necessary to provide safe outpatient cancer therapy services. \nIn addition, GAO must determine the appropriate payment rates for such \nservices under the Medicare program.\n  Medicare beneficiaries with cancer must be confident that they will \ncontinue to receive the care they need, in the setting they choose, \nwithout risk of arbitrary and unexpected reductions in reimbursement \nthat may force their doctors to cease offering treatment or refer them \nto a different facility for treatment.\n  So today, I urge my colleagues to join with me in ensuring that our \nseniors receive full access to the life-saving therapies they need in \nthe settings they choose, by cosponsoring the Cancer Care Preservation \nAct.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Cancer Care \nPreservation Act be printed in the Record immediately following my \nremarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3003\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDING.\n\n       Congress finds that in light of the tremendous advances \n     achieved by this Nation in its war on cancer, including the \n     development of breakthrough therapies, the expansion of the \n     cancer care delivery system to convenient and low-cost \n     community settings, and the unprecedented annual reduction in \n     American cancer deaths beginning in 1998, legislation is \n     needed to ensure that these advances are not undermined by \n     inappropriate changes to rates of reimbursement for \n     outpatient cancer therapy services under the medicare program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 \n     et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 3. PRESERVATION OF REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR OUTPATIENT \n                   CANCER THERAPY SERVICES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration may \n     not implement any reduction to the rates of reimbursement for \n     outpatient cancer therapy services under the medicare program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 \n     et seq.), unless such reductions--\n       (1) are developed in consultation with the Comptroller \n     General of the United States, the Medicare Payment Advisory \n     Commission established under section 1805 of such Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395b-6) (in this Act referred to as ``MedPAC''), and \n     representatives of the cancer care community, including \n     patients, survivors, nurses, physicians, and researchers;\n       (2) provide for appropriate payment rates for outpatient \n     cancer therapy services, based upon the determinations made \n     by the Comptroller General of the United States in the \n     nationwide analysis required under section 4 of this Act; and\n       (3) are authorized by an Act of Congress.\n\n     SEC. 4. FORMAL NATIONWIDE ANALYSIS OF CLINICAL RESOURCES \n                   NECESSARY TO PROVIDE SAFE OUTPATIENT CANCER \n                   THERAPY SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Analysis.--\n       (1) In general.--The Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall conduct a nationwide analysis to determine the \n     physician and non-physician clinical resources necessary to \n     provide safe outpatient cancer therapy services and the \n     appropriate payment rates for such services under the \n     medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.).\n       (2) Issues analyzed.--In conducting the analysis under \n     paragraph (1), the Comptroller General of the United States \n     shall determine--\n       (A) the adequacy of practice expense relative value units \n     associated with the utilization of those clinical resources;\n       (B) the adequacy of work units in the practice expense \n     formula; and\n       (C) the necessity for an additional reimbursement \n     methodology for outpatient cancer therapy services that falls \n     outside the practice expense formula.\n       (3) Consultation.--In conducting the analysis under \n     paragraph (1), the Comptroller General of the United States \n     shall consult with Administrator of the Health Care Financing \n     Administration, MedPAC, and representatives of the cancer \n     care community, including patients, survivors, nurses, \n     physicians, and researchers.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall submit a report to Congress on the analysis \n     conducted under subsection (a) together with recommendations \n     for such legislative and administrative action as the \n     Comptroller General of the United States determines \n     appropriate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 3004. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax relief for the conversion of cooperative housing corporations into \ncondominiums; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n    to provide tax relief for the conversion of cooperative housing \n                     corporations into condominiums\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that \nwould amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow Cooperative \nHousing Corporations (Co-ops) to convert to condominium forms of \nownership without any immediate tax consequences.\n  Under current law, a conversion from cooperative shareholding to \ncondominium ownership is taxable at a corporate level as well as an \nindividual level. The conversion is treated as a corporate liquidation, \nand therefore taxed accordingly. In addition, a capital gains tax is \nlevied on any increase between the owner's basis in the co-op share \npre-conversion and the market value of the condominium interest post-\nconversion. This double taxation dissuades condominium conversion \nbecause the owner is being taxed on a transaction that is nothing more \nthan a change in the form of ownership. While the Internal Revenue \nService concedes that there are no discernible advantages to society \nfrom the cooperative form of ownership, it does not view Federal tax \nstatutes as having the flexibility to allow co-ops to re-organize \nfreely as condominiums.\n  In cooperative housing, real property ownership is vested in a \ncorporation, with shares of stock for each apartment unit, that are \nsold to buyers. The corporation then issues a proprietary lease \nentitling the owner of the stock to the use of the unit in perpetuity. \nBecause the investment is in the form of a share of stock, investors \nsometimes lose their entire investment as a result of debt incurred by \nthe corporation in construction and development. In addition, due to \nthe structure of a cooperative housing corporation, a prospective \npurchaser of shares in the corporation from an existing tenant-\nstockholder has difficulty obtaining mortgage financing for the \npurchase. Furthermore, tenant-stockholders of cooperative housing also \nencounter difficulties in securing bank loans for the full value of \ntheir investment.\n  As a result, owners of cooperative housing are increasingly looking \ntoward conversion to condominium ownership regimes. Condominium \nownership permits each owner of a unit to directly own the unit itself, \neliminating the cooperative housing dilemmas of corporate debt that \nsupersedes the investment of cooperative housing share owners, and \nother financial concerns.\n  The legislation I introduce today will remove the penalty of double \ntaxation from the cooperative housing to condominium ownership, and \nwill greatly benefit co-op owners across the Nation. I urge my \ncolleagues' consideration and support for this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                S. 3004\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 347\n\n       Whereas 1 out of every 55 women will develop ovarian cancer \n     at some point during her life;\n       Whereas over 70 percent of women with ovarian cancer will \n     not be diagnosed until ovarian cancer has spread beyond the \n     ovary;\n       Whereas prompt diagnosis of ovarian cancer is crucial to \n     effective treatment, with the chances of curing the disease \n     before it has spread beyond the ovaries ranging from 85 to 90 \n     percent, as compared to between 20 and 25 percent after the \n     cancer has spread;\n       Whereas several easily identifiable factors, particularly a \n     family history of ovarian cancer, can help determine how \n     susceptible a woman is to developing the disease;\n       Whereas effective early testing is available to women who \n     have a high risk of developing ovarian cancer;\n       Whereas heightened public awareness can make treatment of \n     ovarian cancer more effective for women who are at-risk; and\n       Whereas the Senate, as an institution, and members of \n     Congress, as individuals, are in unique positions to help \n     raise awareness about the need for early diagnosis and \n     treatment for ovarian cancer: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of September 17, 2000, through \n     September 23, 2000, as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness \n     Week; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe \n     National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Week with appropriate \n     recognition and activities.\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue \nthat should concern us all: that of ovarian cancer. Specifically, I \nrise to introduce a resolution, along with my colleagues Senators \nLincoln, Mikulski, Feinstein, Murray, Snowe, Hutchison, Collins, and \nBoxer, designating September 17th through September 23d as National \nOvarian Cancer Week.\n  Mr. President, of the more than 25,000 women who were diagnosed with \novarian cancer in 1999, about 14,500, a little over half, will die of \nthis disease. Think about that for a moment. More than half of our \ngrandmothers, our mothers, our sisters and daughters are dying of a \ndisease that, if caught earlier, could have been treated. Mr. \nPresident, I wish this were the only condition in which this was the \ncase, but it is not. Like with many other diseases, we need to turn our \nfocus to prevention and early detection. Doing so not only means saving \nlives, but millions of tax dollars in the long run.\n  In over 70 percent of the women with this disease, it will not be \ndiscovered until after it has spread beyond the ovaries. This is of \ncritical importance, since the recovery rate for these women for whom \nthe disease has spread is less than 25 percent. This is compared to an \n85 to 90 percent recovery rate for those in whom the disease is caught \nearly. Ovarian cancer is difficult to detect, as the symptoms are often \nvague and mimic other medical problems.\n  Still, there are ways that we can reduce the risk of this disease, \nand significantly reduce the mortality rate. For women with a family \nhistory of ovarian cancer, as well as other women with high-risk \nfactors for the disease, regular screenings are available. Although \nthese screenings are not for everyone, individuals with a high-risk\n\n[[Page S8027]]\n\nfactor, particularly those with one or more family members who have had \novarian cancer, should look into these tests.\n  Mr. President, this is why it is so important that we raise awareness \nabout ovarian cancer, and this is what this resolution tries to do. By \nestablishing this special week, we can bring the knowledge of this \ndisease to thousands of high-risk women, and give people a better \nchance of beating this dreadful disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S8027-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             CLELAND (AND MILLER) AMENDMENTS NOS. 4030-4031\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. CLELAND (for himself and Mr. Miller) submitted two amendments \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill (H.R. 4733) making \nappropriations for energy and water development for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2001, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 4030\n\n       On page 58, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1____.

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The closure or downsizing of a Department of Energy \n     facility can have serious economic impacts on communities \n     that have been built around and in support of the facility.\n       (2) To mitigate the devastating impacts of the closure of \n     Department of Energy facilities on surrounding communities, \n     section 3161 of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 1993 (42 U.S.C. 7274h) provides a mechanism for \n     the provision of financial assistance to such communities for \n     redevelopment and to assist employees of such facilities in \n     transferring to other employment.\n       (3) It is difficult to forecast necessary changes in the \n     workforce at Department of Energy facilities in advance of \n     the preparation of the budget for the Department of Energy \n     given uncertainties regarding future budges, project \n     schedules, and other factors.\n       (4) Limitations on the capacity of the Department of Energy \n     to seek reprogramming of funds for worker and community \n     assistance programs in response to the closure or downsizing \n     of Department facilities undermines the capability of the \n     Department to respond appropriately to unforeseen \n     contingencies.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that, \n     in agreeing to the conference report to accompany the bill \n     H.R.4733 of the 106th Congress, the conferees on the part of \n     the Senate should not recede to provisions or language \n     proposed by the House of Representatives that would limit the \n     capacity of the Department of Energy to augment funds \n     available for worker and community assistance grants under \n     section 3161 of the National Defense Authorization for Fiscal \n     Year 1993 or under the provisions of the USEC Privatization \n     Act (subchapter A of chapter 1 of title III of Public Law \n     104-134; 42 U.S.C. 2297h et seq.).\n\n[[Page S8028]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 DeWINE (AND LEVIN) AMENDMENT NO. 4035\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Levin) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill, H.R. 4733, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 47, strike line 18 and insert the following: \n     $139,219,000, to remain available until expended, of which \n     $1,500,000 shall be made available to carry out activities \n     under the John Glenn Great Lakes Basin Program established \n     under section 455 of the Water Resources Development Act of \n     1999 (42 U.S.C. 1962d-21).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S8028-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the Government of \nthe United States of America and the Government of the Republic of \nCosta Rica for the Return of Stolen, Embezzled, or Appropriated \nVehicles and Aircraft, with Annexes and a related exchange of notes, \nsigned at San Jose on July 2, 1999. I transmit also, for the \ninformation of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with \nrespect to the Treaty.\n  The Treaty is one of a series of stolen vehicle treaties being \nnegotiated by the United States in order to eliminate the difficulties \nfaced by owners of vehicles that have been stolen and transported \nacross international borders. Like several in this series, this Treaty \nalso covers aircraft. When it enters into force, this Treaty will be an \neffective tool to facilitate the return of U.S. vehicles and aircraft \nthat have been stolen, embezzled, or appropriated and taken to Costa \nRica.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Treaty, with Annexes and a related exchange of notes, and give its \nadvice and consent to ratification.\n                                                  William J.

Also transmitted for the \ninformation of the Senate are the report of the Department of State \nwith respect to the Protocol and a February 2, 2000, letter from the \nCouncil of the European Union regarding voting within the Assembly \nestablished under the Protocol.\n  The Protocol will offer several major advantages to U.S. trademark \nowners. First, registration of trademarks internationally will be \npossible without obtaining a local agent and without filing an \napplication in each Contracting Party. If the United States accedes to \nthe Protocol, the Protocol will provide a trademark registration filing \nsystem that will permit a U.S. trademark owner to file for registration \nin any number of Contracting Parties by filing a single standardized \napplication in English, and with a single payment in dollars, at the \nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). The PTO will forward \nthe application to the International Bureau of the World Intellectual \nProperty Organization (respectively, the ``International Bureau'' and \n``WIPO''), which administers the Protocol. Second, under the Protocol, \nrenewal of a trademark registration in each Contracting Party may be \nmade by filing a single request with a single payment. These two \nadvantages should make access to international protection of trademarks \nmore readily available to both large and small U.S. businesses.\n  Third, the Protocol will facilitate the recording internationally of \na change of ownership of a mark with a single filing. United States \nbusinesses experience difficulties effecting valid assignments of their \nmarks internationally due to burdensome administrative requirements for \nrecordation of an assignment in many countries. These difficulties can \nhinder the normal transfer of business assets. The Protocol will permit \nthe holder of an international registration to record the assignment of \na trademark in all designated Contracting Parties upon the filing of a \nsingle request with the International Bureau, accompanied by a single \npayment. To carry out the provisions of the Protocol, identical \nimplementing legislation, which is supported by my Administration, was \npassed by the House of Representatives and introduced in the Senate.\n  Accession to the Protocol is in the best interests of the United \nStates. Therefore, I recommend the Senate give early and favorable \nconsideration to the Protocol and give its advice and consent to \naccession, subject to the declarations described in the accompanying \nreport of the Department of State.\n                                                  William J.

I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the \nreport of the Department of State with respect to this Treaty.\n  The bilateral investment treaty (BIT) with Lithuania was the third \nsuch treaty signed between the United States and a Baltic region \ncountry. The Treaty will protect U.S. investment and assist Lithuania \nin its efforts to develop its economy by creating conditions more \nfavorable for U.S. private investment and thereby strengthening the \ndevelopment of its private sector.\n  The Treaty furthers the objectives of U.S. policy toward \ninternational and domestic investment. A specific tenet of U.S. policy, \nreflected in this Treaty, is that U.S. investment abroad and foreign \ninvestment in the United States should receive national treatment. \nUnder this Treaty, the Parties also\n\n[[Page S8031]]\n\nagree to customary international law standards for expropriation. The \nTreaty includes detailed provisions regarding the computation and \npayment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation for \nexpropriation; free transfer of funds related to investments; freedom \nof investments from specified performance requirements; fair, \nequitable, and most-favored-nation treatment; and the investor's \nfreedom to choose to resolve disputes with the host government through \ninternational arbitration.\n  I recommend that the Senate consider this Treaty as soon as possible, \nand give its advice and consent to ratification of the Treaty at an \nearly date.\n                                                  William J.

Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is \nthe report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.\n  The Protocol expands the scope of tax exemption under the 1950 \nConsular Convention Between the United States of America and Ireland to \nprovide for reciprocal exemption from all taxes, including Value Added \nTaxes (VAT) on goods and services for the official use of the mission \nor for the personal use of mission members and families. The amendment \nwill provide financial benefit to the United States, both through \ndirect savings on embassy purchases of goods and services as well as \nthrough lowering the cost of living for United States Government \nemployees assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Dublin.\n  Because the Protocol will achieve long-term tax exemption on the \npurchase of goods and services for our embassy and personnel in \nIreland, I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable \nconsideration to the Protocol and give its advice and consent to \nratification.\n                                                  William J.

I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the \nreport of the Department of State with respect to this Treaty.\n  The bilateral investment treaty (BIT) with Lithuania was the third \nsuch treaty signed between the United States and a Baltic region \ncountry. The Treaty will protect U.S. investment and assist Lithuania \nin its efforts to develop its economy by creating conditions more \nfavorable for U.S. private investment and thereby strengthening the \ndevelopment of its private sector.\n  The Treaty furthers the objectives of U.S. policy toward \ninternational and domestic investment. A specific tenet of U.S. policy, \nreflected in this Treaty, is that U.S. investment abroad and foreign \ninvestment in the United States should receive national treatment. \nUnder this Treaty, the Parties also\n\n[[Page S8031]]\n\nagree to customary international law standards for expropriation. The \nTreaty includes detailed provisions regarding the computation and \npayment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation for \nexpropriation; free transfer of funds related to investments; freedom \nof investments from specified performance requirements; fair, \nequitable, and most-favored-nation treatment; and the investor's \nfreedom to choose to resolve disputes with the host government through \ninternational arbitration.\n  I recommend that the Senate consider this Treaty as soon as possible, \nand give its advice and consent to ratification of the Treaty at an \nearly date.\n                                                  William J.

Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is \nthe report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.\n  The Protocol expands the scope of tax exemption under the 1950 \nConsular Convention Between the United States of America and Ireland to \nprovide for reciprocal exemption from all taxes, including Value Added \nTaxes (VAT) on goods and services for the official use of the mission \nor for the personal use of mission members and families. The amendment \nwill provide financial benefit to the United States, both through \ndirect savings on embassy purchases of goods and services as well as \nthrough lowering the cost of living for United States Government \nemployees assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Dublin.\n  Because the Protocol will achieve long-term tax exemption on the \npurchase of goods and services for our embassy and personnel in \nIreland, I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable \nconsideration to the Protocol and give its advice and consent to \nratification.\n                                                  William J.

I transmit also, for the \ninformation of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with \nrespect to the Treaty.\n  The Treaty is one of a series of stolen vehicle treaties being \nnegotiated by the United States in order to eliminate the difficulties \nfaced by owners of vehicles that have been stolen and transported \nacross international borders. Like several in this series, this Treaty \nalso covers aircraft. When it enters into force, it will be an \neffective tool to facilitate the return of U.S. vehicles and aircraft \nthat have been stolen, robbed, or converted and taken to Panama.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Treaty, with Annexes and a related exchange of notes, and give its \nadvice and consent to ratification.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, as always, I appreciate the hard work the \nchairman and his staff put into drafting this annual appropriations \nbill.\n  They have done an excellent job in pulling this bill together and I \nappreciate the cooperative manner with which he and his staff have \nworked with my staff. I also appreciate the consideration he has \nprovided to the requests of all Members.\n  This subcommittee received over 1,000 requests from Members this year \nand majority and minority staff have combed through all of them.\n  As always, we are not able to accommodate as many of them as we would \nlike, and, frankly, not even as many as we need to.\n  There are a great many things to like in this bill:\n  Solid funding for the programs to keep our nation's nuclear arsenal \nsafe and secure.\n  Strong Army Corps and Bureau of Reclamation funding for work already \nunderway.\n  First time funding for the Delta Regional Commission.\n  Also, for the first time in many years, the bill contains nearly full \nfunding for the Solar and Renewable Energy programs.\n  I want to thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee, Mr. Domenici, for \nworking with me to send some more resources to renewables.\n  We received a bipartisan letter, signed by 56 of our colleagues, \nrequesting full funding for the Solar and Renewable accounts in this \nbill. I am delighted to report that we have come very close to doing \nso.\n  I believe that the Solar and Renewables programs are essential to our \nnation's long-term energy security and appreciate your consideration, \nMr. Chairman.\n  As we have discussed, I am committed to producing a final energy and \nwater conference report that is balanced and takes into account the \nwide variety of activities that we are called upon to fund.\n  Unfortunately, I do not believe that we can do justice to the non-\ndefense side of our bill without additional resources.\n  There are also several controversial items, including no funding for \nCal-Fed, no funding for the removal of a uranium tailings pile on the \nshore of the Colorado River near Moab, and the inclusion of several \npolicy riders that will all need to be resolved in conference, or \npossibly here on the floor.\n\n[[Page S8032]]\n\n  Additionally, it is my understanding that the administration has \nissued a veto threat over several issues, including:\n  1. Language prohibiting the Secretary of Interior from allocating \nwater from the Central Arizona Project; and\n  2. A provision that prohibits the Army Corps of Engineers from \nupdating the Missouri River Operators Manual; this provision also \ninvolves the Endangered Species Act.\n  This second item will be the subject of a fairly extensive debate \nhere on the floor between Senators Daschle and Baucus and Senator Bond \nand others.\n  I take the veto threat seriously and encourage other Members to do \nthe same.\n  While I am not inclined to encourage Members to vote against this \nbill at this time, it is my hope and expectation that these matters can \nbe worked out either here on the floor or in conference.\n  In short, the vote count on this bill today or whenever we vote \nshould not be considered indicative of the way I or other Members will \nvote if the President vetoes this bill.\n  That said, given the unfortunate financial constraints that the \nsubcommittee had to work with--which I will discuss in a moment--this \nis a good bill overall. I support it and encourage my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  My overall message is simple today: This subcommittee simply does not \nhave the resources it needs to do the job that Congress, the \nadministration, and the American people expect of us.\n  I am not pointing fingers or attempting to assign blame: I am simply \nstating a fact.\n  This is a very important appropriations bill, one where we are asked \nto pay for a broad array of programs critical to our nation's future. \nWe fund:\n  The guardians of our nation's nuclear weapons stockpile.\n  Our nation's flood control and navigation systems, infrastructure \nthat contributes to human safety and economic growth.\n  Long-term research, development, and deployment of solar and \nrenewable technologies, programs critical to our nation's long-term \nenergy security and environmental future and;\n  Science programs that are unlocking the human genome and other \nbreakthroughs that help to keep the U.S. at the scientific forefront of \nthe world.\n  All of these are areas that are critical to our nation's independence \nand security, yet, year after year, this subcommittee is called upon to \ngut one or more of these programs to pay for other energy and water \nprograms, or spending in other subcommittees.\n  We cannot continue to do this. These activities are too important.\n  While most of these comments focus on our shortfalls on the non-\ndefense side of our ledger, they hold true for the defense programs, as \nwell.\n  The subcommittee allocation for non-defense activities of the Bureau \nof Reclamation, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Energy \nand others is over $600 million below the President's request.\n  Such a huge funding shortfall has required the subcommittee to impose \nstrict limits on the types of projects that can be funded this year.\n  For example, as Chairman Domenici mentioned, there are no new \nconstruction new starts for BOR or the Army Corps in this bill.\n  As you can imagine, it is difficult to tell my colleagues that a \nfully authorized water project, one that is completely ready to go, has \nno shot at a construction new start this year. Only on-going work--\nusually at a dollar level well below the President's request--and a \nhandful of new studies.\n  This is no way to run a robust national program.\n  But this year's numbers really only tell part of the story. All of us \nknow, we have good financial years and bad financial years around here. \nHowever, short-falls year in and year out in the water accounts of the \nArmy Corps have now resulted in a backlog of $45--$50 billion in fully \nauthorized projects that are awaiting the first dollar in funding.\n  This shortfall just takes into account the Corps' historic mission of \nnavigation and flood control and does not take into account some of the \nnew directions that Congress has pushed the Corps in recent years.\n  It is wrong to give short shrift to important components of our \nnation's critical infrastructure. Flood control protects human lives \nand property; navigation projects ensure that our nation's economic \nengine continues to hum.\n  I think it is important to take a few minutes to review our \n``critical water infrastructure'' and what it means in real terms to \nthis country.\n  Our Nation's water resources infrastructure, developed over the past \ntwo centuries, has improved the quality of our lives and provided a \nfoundation for the economic growth and development of this country.\n  Water supply systems, water treatment systems, flood protection \nprojects, and water transportation systems all contribute to our \nnational prosperity.\n  Our current economic expansion can be directly traced, at least in \npart, to investment decisions made by our forebears in this body to \ndevelop the nation's water resources.\n  They had the forethought to make these tough investment decisions and \nfortunately they are still paying dividends today.\n  The water infrastructure provided by the Army Corps alone provides an \nannual rate of return of approximately 26 percent. The stream of \nbenefits are realized as flood damages prevented, reduced \ntransportation costs, electricity, recreation, and water supply \nservices.\n  Navigable channels provide an efficient and economic corridor for \nmoving more than 2 billion tons of the Nation's domestic and foreign \ncommerce. The value of this commerce is in excess of $660 billion.\n  Total jobs generated are about $13 million and Federal taxes \ngenerated by this commerce is estimated at nearly $150 billion. For \nevery dollar invested to improve navigation infrastructure, U.S. Gross \nDomestic Product rises more than $3 dollars.\n  About 660 million of the 2.2 billion tons of cargo are moved on the \nnation's inland waterway system. That equates to 440,000 barges.\n  To move this cargo by alternative means would require an additional \n17.6 million trucks on our nation's highway system or an additional 5.8 \nmillion rail cars on the nation's rail system.\n  That is a considerable amount of traffic to add to these overburdened \nsystems.\n  The Army Corps manages 383 major lakes and reservoirs for flood \ncontrol and has 8500 miles of levees in place. The flood protection \nprovided by these structures, on average, prevents $20 billion in \ndamages per year. That is a saving of $6 for every dollar invested in \nflood control projects.\n  Thousands of cities, towns and industries rely on the roughly 9.5 \nmillion acre feet of water supply storage from 116 lakes and reservoirs \nin the U.S. built by the Army Corps.\n  Army Corps owned and operated hydroelectric power plants produce \nenough electricity to supply almost 5 million homes with power. That is \n24 percent of the total U.S. hydropower capacity of 3 percent of total \nU.S. electric capacity. Additionally, these plants annually return over \nhalf a billion dollars to the Federal Treasury.\n  Coastal projects protect almost 500 miles of our nation's critical \neroding shoreline.\n  Over 30 percent of the recreation and tourism occurring on Federal \nlands takes place on Army Corps water resource projects. These visitors \nspend $10 billion annually on these recreational pursuits resulting in \nover 600,000 full and part-time jobs.\n  In addition to the direct benefits provided by this water \ninfrastructure, substantial secondary or indirect economic benefits are \nrealized.\n  I am also very familiar with the great work that the Bureau of \nReclamation does for the 17 Western states, including mine. Its \nfacilities include: 348 reservoirs providing 245 million acre-feet of \nwater storage for municipal, rural and industrial uses to over 31 \nmillion people in the Western states. Irrigation water to 1 in every 5 \nwestern farmers for about 10 million acres of irrigated land.\n  Additionally, the Bureau is the second largest producer of \nhydroelectric power generating 40 billion kilowatt hours of energy each \nyear from 58 powerplants. Its facilities also provide substantial flood \ncontrol, recreation, and fish and wildlife benefits.\n  The great urbanization of the west could not be accomplished without\n\n[[Page S8033]]\n\ntheir management of scarce water resources.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years national investment has not kept pace \nwith our level of economic and social expansion.\n  Public infrastructure investments including those for water resources \ninfrastructure in 1960 amounted to 3.9 percent of the Gross Domestic \nProduct.\n  Today the figure is more like 2.6 percent of the GDP.\n  That may not sound like much of a change, but let's look at the Army \nCorps during that period.\n  In the mid 1960s, the country was investing $4.5 billion annually in \nnew water infrastructure, today it is less than $1.5 billion (measured \nin 1996 dollars).\n  Our water resources needs are no less today than they were 40 years \nago. Yet we are investing one third as much.\n  One major impact of that reduction is the increasingly drawn out \nconstruction schedules forced by underfunding these projects.\n  These artificially lengthened schedules cause the loss of some $5 \nbillion in annual benefits and increase the cost of these projects by \nsome $500 million.\n  Failure to invest in maintenance, major rehabilitation, research and \ndevelopment, and new infrastructure has resulted in the gradual \nreduction in the value of our capital water resources stocks, and in \nturn the benefits we receive.\n  The value of the Army Corps' capital stock peaked in 1981 with a \nreplacement value of $150 billion. Today its estimated value has \ndecreased to $124 billion measured in 1995 dollars.\n  The Army Corps' estimates that their backlog for critical maintenance \nwork is $400 million and is projected to grow by $100 million per year \nat current funding levels.\n  Our Nation's water infrastructure continues to perform as designed, \nbut evidence of the need for reconstruction or modernization is \nbecoming evident.\n  Some facilities have reached their capacity and some have reached the \nend of their design lives. New or shifting populations and growth have \ncreated unmet demands.\n  Finally, society's values are increasingly emphasizing sustainability \nand ecological considerations in water infrastructure management and \ndevelopment.\n  As you can see, I am one who firmly believes that investments in our \nnation's infrastructure more than pay for themselves through improved \nproductivity and efficiency. To ignore these needs in the short term is \ngoing to cause us problems over the long haul.\n  Before I close today, I want to say some words of praise for the \nfederal employees and contractors that populate the Departments, \nAgencies, and other organizations that are funded under this bill.\n  In the last year there has been a considerable amount of press and \ncongressional attention surrounding issues such as security lapses at \nour National Labs and criticism of processes and procedures at the Army \nCorps.\n  From time to time we summons the political leadership of these \norganizations to the Hill to criticize, chide, or impress upon them the \nwisdom of our thinking. Often, it can be a pretty warm seat that we put \nthem on.\n  None of that is to suggest that the Members of this body are anything \nother than respectful and proud of the hard work and accomplishments of \nour federal workforce, including contractors, lab employees, and others \nthat make these important organizations run.\n  We expect a lot of you and, with very few exceptions, you live up to \nall of the expectations and demands that we impose on you. You serve \nyour nation with distinction and we appreciate it.\n  I thank the Chairman, and the subcommittee staff for all of their \nhard work in getting us to this point. His team of Clay Sell, David \nGwaltney, and LaShawnda Smith have been great to work with. On the \nminority staff, I want to say a word of thanks to Roger Cockrell, who \nis on detail from the Army Corps of Engineers office in Vicksburg, \nMississippi, and Liz Blevins of the subcommittee staff.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/05/senate-section/article/S8033-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8033-S8034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL IGNITION FACILITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Brownback \namendment.\n  The National Ignition Facility has become a shining example of how \nnot to build large national facilities.\n  When this project was first proposed by the Department of Energy \nseveral years ago, DOE sold this project to me and other Members as a \ncornerstone of our nation's science-based Stockpile Stewardship \nprogram.\n  Leaders from DOE and the Lawrence Livermore National Lab came to me \nat a time when many Members of the Senate, including Chairman Domenici, \nwere somewhat skeptical that NIF was actually needed.\n  They assured me that NIF was absolutely vital to national security \nand that it would be brought in on time and within budget.\n  Based on that, I came to bat for NIF and convinced many of my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I regret it.\n  In my estimation, DOE lied to me.\n  They sold me a bill of goods and I am not happy about it.\n  It is now several years later and the project is hundreds of millions \nof dollars over budget and years behind schedule.\n  The administration has undertaken a re-baselining activity in the \nlast year that they believe will put this project back on a glidepath \nto completion.\n  Our subcommittee has provided (temporarily) $74.5 million for the \nproject. The administration wants another $135 million this year and \nhundreds of millions of dollars more on top of the original baseline \nper year over the next 7 years to get this thing done (3-5 years late).\n  That is what they say now. By the time we are actually done, it will \nbe billions.\n  Enough is enough.\n  There is plenty of skepticism in the scientific and national security \ncommunity as to whether we will ever be able to get the information we \nneed to certify our stockpile from NIF.\n  I believe there are other, cheaper ways to get this job done and I \nthink it is time to go back to the drawing board and find a new path \nforward.\n  I cannot tell you how angry I am that DOE and all of the national \nlabs consistently do this sort of thing to Congress:\n  They overpromise and under-deliver at a vastly inflated price.\n  I say, enough is enough.\n  This is nothing personal against Livermore.\n  If the next big thing at Los Alamos or Sandia runs dramatically over-\nbudget I will be down here again to express my outrage.\n  I have been a Member of Congress and the Senate too long to watch as \nadministration after administration comes up here to whisper sweet \nnothings in my ear and then jack up the price a year or two later.\n  Let me clear about one thing: I have nothing but respect for the \nthousands of men and women who populate our nation's weapons labs.\n  The scientists of Lawrence Livermore, Sandia, and Los Alamos are \namongst the most brilliant, dedicated, patriotic and creative people on \nEarth.\n  The contributions they have made to our nation's national security \nare too numerous to count.\n  In recent years, I have had two Fellows from Lawrence Livermore, \nLarry Ferderber and Bob Perret, serve in my personal office. They both \ndid exceptional work for me, for Nevada, and for our nation. They both \nserved me very well for many years.\n  It is a shame that the highest levels of leadership at DOE and at \nLivermore have not served their employees and the American people with \nequal distinction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the Floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask to speak for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reid for his comments \nand his cooperation. We still have a few days to go. The picture \npresented with reference to the nondefense portion of this bill, in \nparticular, is absolutely true. I cannot figure why the House and \nSenate in their overall scope of allocating money continue to \nunderallocate for nondefense when Senators and House Members probably \nrequest more of us in the nondefense part of this bill than any bill, \nexcept perhaps the interior appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S8034]]\n\n  The Senator mentions 1,000 requests. Those have to do with projects \nor programs or activities for dams that are clearly within reason as \nthings we should do. I am working hard and will continue to work hard \nto try to get additional allocation before we complete the conference. \nI hope we can. Obviously if we cannot, with what the House has \nappropriated this will be a bad overall result for the nondefense part \nof the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation.\n  Mr. REID. I hope we can get a bill that we can send to the President, \nrecognizing that it is a bill that he will sign. I hope we can do that. \nWe have a commitment from the chairman of the full committee, Senator \nStevens, that he will work with us.
