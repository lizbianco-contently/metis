Mr. President, let me begin by thanking Senator Thomas, \nagain, for allowing the time to be devoted to this important subject \nwhich we began discussing last week and hopefully will be able to \ncontinue this week, namely, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nand specifically the bill the Republican majority in the Senate has put \nforth called the Educational Opportunities Act, S. 2.\n  It is my hope that by the end of this week we will have an \nopportunity to vote on this legislation, to finally conclude our work \nand move this bill forward so we can present it to the President for \nhis signature and actually achieve a historic reform opportunity this \nyear. As I said, I hope we will have that result. The reason, however, \nI have some doubt is that we have seen what I fear is a trend, on the \npart of\n\n[[Page S3570]]\n\nthe Democratic minority, to continue to talk about education but in the \nend not allow the Senate to vote on any meaningful piece of \nlegislation. I think the debate so far has vividly portrayed two very \ndifferent views of how the Federal Government should proceed with \neducational reform in our country.\n  On the one hand, you have the majority arguing for flexibility \ncombined with accountability: Flexibility, so the local entities, the \nschool districts, the States, the schools, and the parents can have the \nability to direct the dollars from the Federal Government to do those \nthings they know work best in their particular area, and to have some \naccountability for that by ensuring that at the end of the year they \ndemonstrate what they have done with this money has actually produced \nresults. We are talking here about academic achievement, we are talking \nabout meaningful results, not simply more students in a \nparticular program or more teachers hired or more school buildings \nbuilt. We are talking about some tangible results of those particular \nactions. So it is flexibility with accountability.\n\n  Part of the way we achieve that is through greater competition, which \nis driven by more parental choice, parents having the ability to decide \nwhat is best for their kids; after all, they are the ones we presume \ncare the most about them, know the most about their needs, and \nunderstand how best, therefore, to deal with those kids' needs.\n  On the other hand, you have the minority that has been arguing for \nthe same system of Federal mandates and regulations that, frankly, \nafter 35 years have proven to be a failure. It is the same system with \na new layer of mandates and poll-tested, Washington-run spending \nprograms added onto what we have right now. One of our colleagues from \nthe other side put it this way. He said:\n\n       The Senate has a choice. Will it pass the Republican \n     Educational Opportunities Act or, on the other hand, are we \n     going to follow the tried and tested programs that have \n     demonstrated results for children at the local level?\n\n  They vote for the tried and tested programs that have demonstrated \nresults. They have demonstrated results, all right. The problem is, not \nmany people I know are very happy about those results. An old farmer \nfriend of mine once said: If you want to get out of a hole, the first \nthing you do is stop digging. We just want to keep digging the hole \ndeeper and deeper, it appears some of our colleagues are saying. That \nis not producing the right kind of results, good results: Enhanced \nachievement on test scores, enhanced ability to compete, and a real \nachievement-based accountability, which is what the Republican plan is \nasking for.\n  I have to say I am disappointed by this debate. I am disappointed \nwith the direction in which the legislation itself appears to be \nheading because the American people have told us they want results. \nThey would like to see reform now. Every poll says this is the No. 1 \nissue of concern of the American people--to improve our educational \nsystem.\n  As our colleague on the other side said, yes, the current system has \nproduced tried and tested results. But over 80 percent of the American \npeople do not like those results. They are not happy with those \nresults. They think we can do better. We can do better. We are spending \nan awful lot of money, and we ought to get something for that money. \nBut more important than that, more important than the accountability to \nthe taxpayers, is the accountability to our children, our future.\n  These kids have one opportunity to get their education--right now. We \nare not talking about 20 years from now. We are talking about the \nchildren who are in our educational system today. Each year we delay is \nanother year our children are involved in a school system that is less \nthan adequate by most standards.\n  The American people who are demanding accountability are going to be \nvery disappointed if we conclude this debate with yet another year \nfailing to enact fundamental reforms. That is what has me concerned \nbecause there seems to be a rather cynical strategy developing on the \nother side to talk this thing to death, to set up a whole lot of \namendments on which we have to vote, some of which have nothing to do \nwith education, and then, in effect, put the blame on the Republican \nmajority until, finally, when we have to move on to other business, the \nmajority leader has to say: If you are not going to let us get to a \nfinal conclusion on this, if we cannot vote for these reforms, we have \nto move on. However, the blame would not be on the majority but on the \nminority for its refusal to let us move on and get this legislation \npassed.\n  I do not think it is too late to put politics aside and put our \nchildren first, but time is running out. I call upon my colleagues: \nLet's keep talking about education. Let's put the political \ngamesmanship aside for just a few hours. Is it just possible, for \nexample, that we can conclude debate on one bill without getting bogged \ndown on gun control?\n  Yet I predict, before this week is out, we will have colleagues from \nthe other side say: We cannot really deal with S. 2 unless we deal with \nissues relating to gun control.\n  Let's talk about what is in this education bill, what is in our \nproposal. It may be that some of our colleagues on the other side are \nactually uncomfortable focusing the debate on education because of this \nnotion that the current system is working just fine. I think they are \nreluctant to talk about reform, but the American people want reform. As \nI said, they know we can do better.\n  We heard last week from members of the minority that we cannot trust \nparents to do what is right for children. One of our colleagues said: \nWhere are the guarantees that the parents will make the right \ndecisions? There are no guarantees that parents will make the right \ndecisions, but I suppose one can ask: Who is more likely to make right \ndecisions for their children, the parents or some bureaucrat in \nWashington, DC, or some Senator in Washington, DC?\n  My heart is in the right place when it comes to taking care of the \nschoolkids in this country, but I certainly would not presume to set \nall the policies in Washington that would fit the needs of every single \nschoolchild in this country. We in Washington just do not have that \ncapability. There are no guarantees that every parent will make every \ndecision correctly, but it is a lot more likely that parents making the \ndecisions will result in good decisions for the most number of kids \nthan if those decisions are relegated to Washington, DC.\n  Another thing we heard was that the leaders in our States and \ncommunities cannot be trusted to do what is right for America's young \npeople; again, we need guarantees. By guarantees they mean Federal \nenforcement that these local officials will do the right thing and, of \ncourse, the right thing is defined by the bureaucrats in Washington, \nDC: You have to do it the way Washington wants to do it or you are not \ngoing to get the money.\n\n  One of the things we heard was that it would be a better approach to \nthe Republican reform ideas to simply fine-tune the Federal regulations \nthat impose 50 percent of the paperwork requirements on the local \nschools, and that is in exchange for only 7 percent of their funding. \nIn other words, the 7 percent of funding that primary and secondary \neducation receives from the Federal Government accounts for 50 percent \nof the paperwork. It is a pretty expensive proposition, in other words, \nto get the Federal funding. Schools go after that Federal funding even \nthough it is a very inefficient way for them to fund the education of \nthe children.\n  The point is this: How can you expect to get different results if you \nkeep doing things the same way? The answer is, of course, you cannot. \nThat is where the reforms in S. 2 come into play. One of the things \nwhich exemplifies this debate is the issue of class size or class size \nreduction.\n  Members of the minority have said we have to use this money for the \npurpose of hiring more teachers so we can achieve a class size \nreduction. The majority has said we need to let the local schools \ndecide if that is their top priority. If it is, then they have the \nability to use the funds for that purpose. If they have a higher \npriority, who should make that judgment of how to spend the money? \nShould it be those of us in Washington or should it be the people who \nunderstand what their priorities are?\n\n[[Page S3571]]\n\n  Almost everyone would like to see smaller class sizes. We intuitively \nbelieve that would be better for education, but with every other area \nof this debate, we do have to look at the track record. The fact is \nthat class sizes have fallen over the period that the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act has been in existence, but performance has not \ntracked. George Will, with his wonderful characteristic dry wit, looked \nat the data, and this is what he said:\n\n       Pupil-teacher ratios have been shrinking for a century. In \n     1955 pupil-teacher ratios in the public elementary and \n     secondary schools were 30.2-to-one and 20.9-to-one \n     respectively. In 1998 they were 18.9-to-one and 14.7-to-one. \n     We now know it is possible to have, simultaneously, declining \n     pupil-teacher ratios and declining scores on tests measuring \n     schools' cognitive results.\n\n  The truth is, we have declining class sizes and with it declining \ntest scores. We still think it would be a good idea to reduce the size \nof classes; that there are other reasons why those test scores have not \nimproved. But under the proposal from the President, they have to spend \nthe money strictly on hiring teachers. They cannot use it for anything \nelse, as I will get to in a moment.\n  One of the things this money can be used for is to create more \ncharter schools, something that has improved the education in my own \nState of Arizona. Our State superintendent of education, Lisa Graham \nKeegan, has pointed out under the President's proposal, the $17 million \nArizona would receive to hire new teachers could actually start 425 new \ncharter schools across the State, more than enough schools to keep \nclass sizes relatively small, but they would not have that flexibility \nunder the President's plan, under the Democrats' plan. No, they have to \ndo it their way or no way. The only way they get the money is if they \nfollow precisely their guidelines. That is the way it has been all \nthese years. We can see the results. Again, the American people are \nasking for something different.\n\n  One of the ideas embodied in our legislation is something we call the \nStraight A's approach. The idea behind it is to actually look at where \nthe Federal Government has been successful in making major reforms and \napplying that same technique to education.\n  There are few successes more dramatic than our success in welfare \nreform. It cannot be done, we were told, but we did it, and the results \nhave been dramatic. The idea was pretty simple. The Federal Government \nsaid: We will repeal the regulations that have historically defined \nthis program, and we will give unprecedented flexibility to the \nreformers in State government, as well as unprecedented accountability \nfor them. Go out and pursue reforms, we said, and if you are \nsuccessful, you will be rewarded. If you fail, then you will lose some \nof your latitude.\n  As with welfare reform, we need to put aside the certainty that \nWashington knows best and all wisdom that is formulated comes from \nWashington.\n  I know there is no such monopoly because I have the good fortune of \ncoming from a State where education policy is made by people who really \nhave been innovative, people such as our State superintendent of \neducation, Lisa Graham Keegan.\n  I want to present some of the things she has had to say. When we \nconsider how to provide this flexibility to education just as we did \nwith welfare reform, I think we will see the same results. This is some \nof what Ms. Keegan had to say:\n\n       Federal programs have tied dollars to bureaucracies and \n     institutions, not to students.\n\n  What that illustrates is the disorientation from Washington. We \nbelieve if you send the money to the institution, to the organization, \nautomatically good things will happen. The fact is, we ought to be \nfocused on what some call child-centered education. We ought to figure \nout how to get the money we want to educate these children as close to \nthose children as possible because the sad fact is, when we send it to \nan institution or a bureaucracy, a significant amount of that money \ngets stuck at that bureaucracy.\n  As with many Federal programs, it costs a lot of money to administer \nthe program, to comply with all of the Federal redtape and paperwork. \nThat is why we say that, while the Federal Government only supplies 7 \npercent of the primary and secondary education dollars the States \nspend, the States have to spend 50 percent of their administration \ncosts just administering that 7 percent at the Federal level. That is \nwhy if we can get over this business of tying dollars to the \nbureaucracies and the institutions and tie it more to the students, it \nwill be a much more efficient expenditure of the money.\n  Ms. Keegan also says:\n\n       But before we ask Washington to get involved with the \n     education of our children, we need to think about exactly \n     what we're asking for. Sometimes, when we ask Washington for \n     help, we run a very real risk of getting it. . . . More often \n     than not, the government's preferred method for \n     alleviating a perceived problem is to create a federally \n     funded program with federally authored strings and \n     federally enforced regulations. This approach may work \n     fine when it comes to matters that have clearly defined \n     federal responsibilities, such as highways or post \n     offices. When it comes to education, which has always been \n     largely a state and local matter with no clear federal \n     role, such an approach tends not to work so well. . . .\n       . . . we still let Washington drive state and local \n     decision making through the lure of federal dollars tied to \n     programs with hazily-defined goals and well-defined \n     regulations.\n\n  Then here is how she concludes this point:\n\n       The problem with this approach is that the federal \n     government has tied its dollar to a program rather than to a \n     student. An at-risk student who succeeds will, more often \n     than not, find him or herself ineligible for more at-risk \n     services. When the student moves on, the federal dollar dries \n     up--and it won't come back until that child again slips into \n     the at-risk group and becomes eligible for the federal \n     program once more. These kinds of programs thrive on student \n     stagnation, even failure.\n\n  We had that same situation with the welfare program. We tended to \nmeasure the success of the welfare program by how many people we had on \nthe welfare rolls, by how much money we were spending on that. Then one \nday it dawned on someone that we ought to be measuring the success of \nthe welfare program by how few people were on the welfare rolls and by \nhow little we had to spend.\n  As a result, by giving flexibility to the local governments with \nregard to welfare, we have cut the welfare rolls in half. We are not \nspending near as much money on welfare. We have only half as many \npeople involved in the welfare program. Is that failure? No. It is a \nsuccess. And so it is with education.\n  If we are going to devote Federal dollars to the education of the \nstudents, then we ought to provide those dollars to the students so \nthat wherever they think they can get their best education, whatever \ntheir needs are in terms of priorities, the money will be spent for \nthat, not because the Federal Government makes a judgment that a \nparticular expenditure is necessarily the right thing.\n  I think it is important to reiterate our responsibility to those who \nwill pay the highest price if we fail to take advantage of the \nopportunities that are here presented. As I said, it is not necessarily \nthe American taxpayer, even though we have, as stewards of those \ntaxpayer dollars, an obligation to see that they are efficiently spent.\n  No. Those that will pay the highest price, if we fail, are the \nschoolchildren, the children who, this year, will not receive an \nimproved education because, perhaps, we will not get these reforms \npassed this year. They will have to go yet one more year stuck with the \nkind of bureaucratic redtape and regulations that have failed them thus \nfar in their careers.\n  Last week, we also learned that there are those on the other side who \ndo not agree that choice should be available to children in failing or \nunsafe schools. I always find this interesting because very frequently \npeople who make this argument have sent their kids to private schools.\n  I am a product of the public schools. That is where I received my \neducation, including my college and law school education. It was from \nthe public schools. Both of my parents were public school graduates and \npublic school teachers. And others in my family are or have been \nteachers in public schools. So I fully appreciate the need to improve \nour public schools.\n\n  I think one does that by enabling some competition between these \nschools, and also with the private schools. What we find is that when \nthat competition is allowed to work, everyone benefits. To use a crude \nexample, it\n\n[[Page S3572]]\n\nis similar to the automobile manufacturers. If one of them finds a new \nway to improve the way a car operates, it isn't long before the others \nfind a way to incorporate that same technique or technology into their \ncars. If they do not, they are going to lose sales.\n  By the same token, when a school finds that something really works \nwell--if we give parents a choice to send their kids to that school--\nthe other schools are soon going to find that they will want to \nincorporate that same kind of technique to keep the kids there.\n  That is especially the case because so much of our Federal and State \nfunding goes to the institutions, as we have said. If they want to \ncontinue to get that funding, under the Republican proposal, they would \nhave to be able to continue to attract the kids.\n  In my State of Arizona, we have, in effect, open enrollment so there \ncan be some degree of competition among the public schools. We also \nhave more charter schools--almost 350 at last count--than any other \nState. I think it is a third of the charter schools in the country. \nThese charter schools promote a lot of competition. A lot of them have \nlearned to attract students by doing things a little differently. Some \nof the larger public schools have picked up on these techniques and \nhave incorporated them into their curricula, into their procedures. As \na result, they can be quite competitive with those charter schools. It \ndoes not hurt one at the expense of another.\n  It is not a zero sum game. Competition is like invention. What it \ndoes is lift all of the boats. When one begins to do something better, \nthe others soon follow behind and copy it in order to keep up with the \nfirst one. When you have that kind of competition, therefore you can \nhave innovation. If you have flexibility, you have the ability to \nexperiment, and the net result is a better opportunity for more kids. \nThat is what we want to promote in this Federal legislation.\n  As I say, in my own State of Arizona we already have a significant \nelement of this in our public schools. But what we found last week from \nthose on the other side of the debate was that there is a real desire \nto keep students and parents from having this additional flexibility, \nthis additional choice. It seems to me there is a fear of it. There is \na fear that not everyone will be able to do as well as those who do the \ninnovation, and somebody might actually fail or fall behind, which \nwould be bad.\n  Who is the somebody they are talking about? They are not focused on \nthe student. They are talking about the school, that it would not be \nfair if a particular school failed. Why wouldn't it be fair if a \nparticular school failed if the students all had the opportunity to go \nto the successful school? What is not fair is that failing schools keep \nahold of failing students. We are failing in the education of these \nkids, and they will never be able to go back and get it.\n  Yes, we have some remedial education. But that is a very hard way to \nreeducate people in our society. So it is not the schools that we ought \nto be concerned about; it is the students in those schools. I remain \nconvinced that no American child should be trapped in a school that \ncannot guarantee a good education. We have an obligation to those \nstudents.\n\n  So whatever happens with this bill, I believe we will continue to \npursue this idea of choice, of competition, of flexibility, because it \nwill work. Sooner or later, this approach will provide the basis for \nreform that will characterize the Federal program that provides the \nFederal funding to primary and secondary education. I still believe we \ncan make a difference in this area.\n  So while it may become a disappointment that we are not able to \nconclude work this year on this important bill, that we may not be able \nto pass a bill that we can send to the President for his signature, I \nthink, in the end, the power of this idea of flexibility and \naccountability and more choice--the power of that idea--will end up \ndefining the Federal program.\n  It would be better if we could do it this year because that would \nmean we would not allow another year to pass with the same devastating \nresults for the kids who are in school right now where far too many of \nthem are failing. That is my hope.\n  I urge my colleagues this week to take this debate seriously, to try \nto move on beyond extraneous issues, and in the end, to bring it to a \nclose so we can actually have a vote on S. 2 and get this important \nreform measure to the American people where it can begin to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator from Arizona. He obviously believes \nvery strongly in this issue and has defined very clearly where we are \nwith two very definite points of view. One is that the Federal \nGovernment ought to make the rules, ought to set up the redtape, ought \nto make the decisions here to be implemented in the country; the other \nis to send the assistance from here to local schools so they can make \nthe kinds of decisions that are necessary to make their schools \nsuccessful.\n  So I say to the Senator, thank you very much.\n  I yield to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to share some additional thoughts \nwith the Members of the Senate and those watching what we can do to \nimprove education in America.\n  I believe in public education. I have taught and my wife has taught \nin public schools. I say that to express how deeply I care about it. We \nhave been active in PTA as our kids have gone forward. We want to \nimprove the system. We want to make learning occur more regularly. We \nwant to help teachers. I believe in American teachers. They are some of \nthe finest in the world. They are well trained. They give their hearts \nand souls to it, only to be frustrated by regulations, paperwork, and \ndiscipline problems resulting from mandated rules passed by this \nCongress.\n  I am going to share some thoughts today, and those in education in \nany State of America will know what I am saying is true. They will have \nheard these kinds of examples time and time again. But the vast \nmajority of Americans will not believe it; they will not believe these \nthings occur.\n  Over 25 years ago, for example, we passed a federal disabilities act. \nIt was designed to mandate to school systems and require that they not \nshut out disabled kids from the classroom and that they be involved in \nthe classroom. If they have a hearing loss, or a sight loss, or if they \nhave difficulty moving around, in a wheelchair, or whatever, the school \nsystem must make accommodations for them. They would be mainstreamed. \nThey would not be treated separately.\n  That was a good goal, a goal from which we should not retreat. I hope \nno one interprets what I say today as a retreat from that goal. But in \nthe course of that time, we have created a complex system of Federal \nregulations and laws that have created lawsuit after lawsuit, special \ntreatment for certain children, and that are a big factor in \naccelerating the decline in civility and discipline in classrooms all \nover America. I say that very sincerely.\n  Teachers I have been talking to have shared stories with me. I have \nbeen in 15 schools around Alabama this year. I have talked to them \nabout a lot of subjects. I ask them about this subject in every school \nI go to, and I am told in every school that this is a major problem for \nthem. In fact, it may be the single most irritating problem for \nteachers throughout America today.\n  It was really brought to my attention a little over a year ago when a \nlong-time friend, District Attorney David Whetstone, in Baldwin County, \nAL, called me about a youngster in the school system classified as \nhaving a disability. It is called ``emotional conflict.'' He was \nemotionally conflicted. He could not, or would not, behave. An aide \nwould meet him in the morning at his home, get on the bus with him, and \ngo to school, sit through the class all day, and ride home on the \nschool bus with him. This student was known to curse principals and \nteachers openly in the classroom. Because he was a disabled student, he \ncould not be disciplined in the normal way. The maximum 10-day \nsuspension rule--and 45 days is the maximum a child can be disciplined \nunder this Federal law and then they are back in the classroom. One \nday, he attacked the school bus driver on the way home. The aide tried \nto restrain him. He then attacked the\n\n[[Page S3573]]\n\naide. District Attorney Whetstone told me, ``I was never more stunned \nwhen I talked to school officials and they told me this is common in \nour county.''\n  We have children we cannot control because of this Federal law. He \ncame to Washington, and we sat up in the gallery and talked about it. I \nrespect David Whetstone and his views. He said this cannot be. I began \nto ask around, is this true? As a matter of fact, this very incident \nwas focused on in Time magazine. There was a full-page story about it \ncalled ``The Meanest Kid in Alabama,'' and ``60 Minutes'' did a story \nabout it because it is, unfortunately, so common around the country.\n  What can we do about it? I began to ask leaders in education around \nthe State. The State superintendent: ``Absolutely, it is one of the \nbiggest problems we have.'' I talked to Paul Hubbard, head of the \nteachers union in Alabama: ``Absolutely, it is a big problem.'' ``I am \ntired,'' he said in the newspaper recently, ``of children cursing my \nteachers in the classroom and nothing being done about it.''\n\n  Then we began to talk to teachers, principals, and school board \nsuperintendents. They talked about the lawyers and the complicated \nregulations with which they deal. It is really unacceptable. Teachers \nwho have been trained with masters' degrees in special education to \ndeal with these children have also overwhelmingly told me this is not a \nhealthy thing, that we are telling special children with physical \ndisabilities, or disabilities as defined by the Federal law, that they \ndon't have to adhere to the same standards other children do. Right in \nthe classroom, we create, by Federal law, two separate standards for \nAmerican citizens. You can say to one child: You can't do this, you are \nout of school. But we can say to another children: You can do it, and \nyou are only out 10 days, or maybe 45 days, and then you are back in \nthe classroom. That is not defensible.\n  I want to share some of the letters I began to receive from teachers \nwho care about this problem and want me and you and the Members of this \nCongress to do something about it. I believe we can. I hope it will be \npart of the debate this year in our political arena. Maybe we can make \nsome progress with it.\n  First, I want to mention that when Congress passed the IDEA--\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act--in 1975, we committed to \npay the States, whom we were requiring to do it--we require these \nStates to meet these standards. We agreed to pay 40 percent of the \ncost. We have never paid more than 15 percent of the cost. It has been \nbelow 10 percent in most years. We had testimony in the Health, \nEducation, and Labor Committee, of which I am a member, from a \nsuperintendent in Vermont who testified to our committee that 20 \npercent of the cost of the school system in his county is for special \neducation children. This is a major factor in education today. Let me \nshare some stories with you about this.\n  An experienced educator in Alabama shared these thoughts with me in a \nletter:\n\n       We have a student who is classified emotionally conflicted, \n     learning disabled, and who has attention deficit disorder. \n     While this student has been enrolled, students, teachers, and \n     staff have been verbally threatened with physical harm. Fits \n     of anger, fighting, and outbursts of verbal abuse have been \n     commonplace. Parents and students have expressed concern over \n     the safety of their children due to the behavior of this \n     young man. Teachers have also become extremely apprehensive \n     toward the presence of the student due to his explosive \n     behavior. His misbehavior has escalated to the point that the \n     instructional process of the entire school has been \n     jeopardized.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       I have taught for 25 years. I plan to continue teaching, \n     but the problems with discipline are getting out of hand. We \n     are not allowed to discipline certain students. Any student \n     labeled as ``special needs'' must be accommodated, not \n     disciplined. A student recently brought a gun to my school. \n     He made threats to students and teachers which he claims were \n     jokes. I was one of those teachers. This student has been \n     disruptive and belligerent since I first encountered him in \n     the ninth grade. Now, he is a senior. After bringing a gun to \n     school, he was given another ``second chance.'' He should \n     have been expelled. What is his handicap? He has a problem \n     with mathematics. While this may be an extreme situation, it \n     is not isolated.\n\n  Still reading from the letter:\n\n       Teachers are told to handle discipline in the classroom. \n     The Government has taken most of the teachers' rights away; \n     our hands are tied.\n\n  This is a letter from a young teacher in a small town of about 25,000 \nin Alabama. This is a story by which I think anybody would be moved:\n\n       As a special educator of six years, I consider myself ``on \n     the front lines'' of the ongoing battles that take place on a \n     daily basis in our Nation's schools. I strongly believe that \n     part of the ``ammunition'' that fuels these struggles are \n     the ``right'' guaranteed to certain individuals by IDEA \n     '97. The law, though well intentioned, has become one of \n     the single greatest obstacles that educators face in our \n     fight to provide all of our children with a quality \n     education delivered in a safe environment. There are many \n     examples that I can offer first hand. However, let me \n     reiterate that I am a special educator. I have dedicated \n     my life to helping children with special needs. It is my \n     job to study and know the abilities and limitations of \n     such children. I have a bachelor's degree in psychology, a \n     masters degree in special education and a Ph.D. in good \n     old common sense. No where in my educational process have \n     I been taught a certain few ``disabled'' students should \n     have a ``right'' to endanger the right to an education of \n     all other disabled and non-disabled children. It's non-\n     sense; it's wrong; it's dangerous; and it must be stopped.\n       There is no telling how many instructional hours are lost \n     by teachers in dealing with behavior problems. In times of an \n     increasingly competitive global society it is no wonder \n     American students fall short. Certain children are allowed to \n     remain in the classroom robbing the other children of hours \n     that can never be replaced.\n       There is no need to extend the school day. There is no need \n     to extend the school year. If politicians would just make it \n     possible for educators to take back the time that is lost on \n     a daily basis to certain individuals there is no doubt we \n     would have a better educated students.\n       It is even more frustrating when it is a special education \n     child who knows and boasts ``they can't do anything to me'' \n     and he is placed back in the classroom to disrupt it day \n     after day, week after week.\n       It is clear that IDEA '97 not only undermines the \n     educational process it also undermines the authority of \n     educators. In a time when our profession is being called upon \n     to protect our children from  increasingly dangerous sources \n     our credibility is being stripped from us.\n       I am sure you have heard the saying: The teachers are \n     scared of the principals, the principals are scared of the \n     superintendents, the superintendents are scared of the \n     parents, the parents are scared of the children, and the \n     children are scared of no one. And why should they be?\n       I have experienced the ramifications of the ``new and \n     improved'' law first hand. I had one child attempt to assault \n     me--he had been successful with two other teachers. He was \n     suspended for one day. I had another child make sexual \n     gestures to me in front of the entire class. Despite the fact \n     that every child in my class and a majority of the children \n     in the school knew of it, I was told by my assistant \n     principal that nothing could be done because ``these special \n     ed kids have rights.''\n       I literally got in my car to leave that day, but my \n     financial obligations to my family and my moral \n     responsibilities to the children I had in my class kept me \n     there.\n       The particular child I spoke about frequently made vulgar \n     comments and threats to my girls in my class on every \n     opportunity he had when there was no adult present. \n     Fortunately, the girls, also special ed, could talk to me \n     about it. Unfortunately, they had to put up with it because \n     ``nothing could be done.''\n       I know of a learning disabled child who cut a girl in a \n     fight. The learning disabled child and her parents then \n     attempted to sue the school system because the child was \n     burned when she grabbed a coffee pot to break it over the \n     other child's head. I know of another specific incident where \n     three children brought firearms to school. The two \n     ``regular'' children where expelled. The special education \n     student was back to school the following week.\n       I fully expect that you and your colleagues in Washington \n     will do what it takes to take our schools back from this \n     small group of children who feel it is their right to \n     endanger the education of every other child in school. As my \n     grandmother said, ``right is right and wrong is wrong'' and \n     to enable this to continue is just wrong.\n\n  She does have a right to expect Members of this Congress to confront \nthis issue and not allow it to continue.\n  This is a letter from a town in Alabama with a population of 20,000, \nor so, from another special education teacher.\n\n       As a special educator teacher for 27 years, may I applaud \n     your efforts to make special education students as \n     accountable as any other student for any behavior they \n     exhibit while in school. I fully support the idea that just \n     because they are students in need of special education \n     services that it in no way diminishes their ability to tell \n     right from wrong. When teachers and administrators cannot \n     provide some type of appropriate\n\n[[Page S3574]]\n\n     punishment, then the students are taught that their behavior \n     has no consequences. Just the other day, we had a student, \n     who had been offered detention to avoid mission school time, \n     he responded that they could just go ahead and suspend him \n     because he was not going to come to school on Saturday and \n     that it was not going to hurt his grades because ``he'' was \n     allowed to make up all the work. When students find out about \n     this ``loophole'' then they often feel they have free reign \n     to do or say whatever they feel and that there is nothing \n     that anyone can do.\n\n  He is correct about that. This is a Federal law. We provide 7 percent \nof the cost of education in America. But we don't hesitate to mandate \nthese kinds of rules in every school system in the country.\n\n       There federal rules often make teaching very difficult and \n     it penalizes the students who come to school to try and \n     improve themselves.\n\n  He is teaching a class of special education students, and wants all \nof them to learn. Many of them are there trying to learn, and they find \nit more difficult because of these rules.\n\n       I feel that for the best interest of the students and of \n     the entire education population, changes in this policy must \n     take place.\n\n  Mr. President. I don't want to disrupt the system. But I have some \nmore comments that I am prepared to make.\n  This is a letter from a small town in Alabama.\n\n       Due to the federal rules and the situation they create, I \n     cannot spend time in my class discussing a lesson. I do not \n     do something to tantalize the students, they become \n     disruptive. I can no longer simply explain a concept. I now \n     must spend over half my time disciplining the disruptive \n     students. I am no longer a teacher, I am a threatened and \n     battered baby-sitter who is not allowed to do her job. Give \n     us back our classrooms and our schools. Give the teacher the \n     right to have these disruptive students removed. Please help \n     us.\n\n  This is a letter from an assistant principal.\n\n       I am an assistant principal in Alabama. I taught middle \n     school before taking this administrative position. As a \n     teacher I saw a ``small picture'' of the problem, as an \n     administrator I see a much ``larger picture''. You have \n     chosen a much needed, but difficult battle. Most of the \n     special education students are wonderful (emphasis added) \n     unfortunately, a few are literally destroying the public \n     education process in our country. We are teaching them that \n     they have excuses not to follow rules or obey laws, then we \n     act shocked when violence occurs. Now, perhaps more than ever \n     in our history, we need to teach our children right from \n     wrong and that there will be consequences for their actions. \n     Instead we develop more and more excuses for unacceptable, \n     sometimes criminal behavior. Thank you for anything you can \n     do to help save our children, as well as our country's \n     future.\n  I have a letter from a student in a good school system in Alabama.\n\n       I would like to let you know I agree with changing the \n     section on IDEA law. I am in high school and I know how \n     difficult it is for you to learn if there is disruption in \n     the classroom. I think if there is a student who does not \n     want to learn, they should be put in an alternative school or \n     separate class.\n\n  Amen, young student. I agree.\n  Another student from an average town in Alabama.\n\n       I'm seeing more and more teachers getting out of education \n     because of the ridiculous lawsuits by special education \n     students.\n\n  We are losing good teachers today in America. If you check around, \none of the biggest reasons is frustration over their inability to \nmaintain discipline in the classroom. Talk to them about it. In most \nschools, that is a real problem. It is hurting public education. These \nlaws don't apply to private schools. Teachers in private schools don't \nhave these problems and are able to be more effective in creating a \nlearning atmosphere. In a way, it hurts our ability to maintain public \neducation as a competitive enterprise. We need to make sure what we do \nin Congress does not make it more difficult for our teachers to teach. \nFirst, do no harm.\n  The letter continues,\n\n       We have been told to give the parents whatever they want.\n\n  They have individual education plans for each student. A lot of \ntimes, that is very helpful. But they have become almost contracts with \nthe parents, and schools have to obey them to the letter of the law. \nThere are frequently lawsuits over whether the school is following the \nIEP, the individual education plan. It is sad.\n\n       We have been told if they sue us we are going to lose. \n     Because of this, special education students are suffering and \n     so are those students around them. They can disrupt class at \n     will and take away from the education of the majority of the \n     students. Often they do less, and even no work, and we are \n     told to pass them anyway.\n\n  Then he makes an interesting point:\n\n       When these students leave school and enter the real world, \n     they will not have things given to them as they do in school. \n     They will not be prepared to function as a regular citizen \n     should be. As a parent, I fear for my son's safety in school. \n     He has already had one confrontation with a special needs \n     child. The disabled student assaulted my child. In self-\n     defense, my son hit the student back. The student was known \n     to get into fights. My son was hauled off to the police \n     station. His grades suffered. The special ed student could go \n     on repeatedly assaulting, with very little consequence. As \n     you can see, this is both an emotional and professional issue \n     for me. I am glad you are aware of the large problem our \n     educational system is having. I hope something can be done \n     before it gets worse. We will see the repercussions for years \n     to come if we don't change this system.\n\n  Another letter from a teacher:\n\n       I have over 30 years experience as a teacher, principal, \n     Federal program coordinator, and school superintendent. I am \n     greatly concerned about the future of public education in \n     this country. IDEA has given local superintendents grief \n     beyond description. First, in 1975, the law was first passed, \n     Congress promised to pick up 40 percent of the cost to \n     operate the program, and according to figures I have seen, 10 \n     percent has been the norm since then. Second, this has made \n     every system fair game, with litigation costs consuming more \n     than education dollars. While our system is small, we have \n     had to deal with a number of weapons cases in the last few \n     years. Two of the cases students were caught with weapons \n     they admit they accidentally left in their vehicles coming to \n     school grounds from target shooting. The first boy was \n     expelled 1 year. He never returned to school to graduate. \n     According to him, the situation was just too embarrassing. \n     Although the second boy was in the exact same position as \n     the first, having accidentally left the weapon in his car, \n     instantly we were told he was a special education student \n     and has an IEP. He was then assigned to an alternative \n     school for 45 days and is now back in our school. Both of \n     these young men were not troublemakers at school. Senator, \n     it is impossible to explain to the family of the first \n     student that their son was deserving of more punishment. \n     Think about that.\n       This family is now bitter toward me and toward the American \n     system because they, in grave error, believe that all \n     Americans have the same legal right and they were unaware \n     that Congress now decides what rights we are entitled to hold \n     as American citizens. As said in ``Animal Farm'': All are \n     equal, but some are more equal than others.\n       The second student's handicap does not prevent him from \n     knowing right from wrong. I'm sorry that I'm old fashioned \n     and believe we should be teaching all students to be \n     responsible for their behavior. We should be helping them \n     develop good decisionmaking skills, not telling them that you \n     are not responsible for your behavior and that there will be \n     no consequences, or minimal consequences, regardless of your \n     behavior.\n       I became a teacher in 1965 and I do not remember hearing of \n     gun shootings prior to 1975 when Congress began telling ten \n     percent of our students you are not responsible.\n\n  I think these teachers make a point. It is a matter we need to give \ncareful consideration to, not overreact, not undermine the great \nprinciples of the Disabilities Act Program. But at the same time, we \nneed to say that a child is not allowed to commit crimes, to disrupt \nclassroom, to curse teachers, principals and students, and abuse them \nand do so with impunity.\n  I thank the Chair for the time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. How much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has until 3 o'clock.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for the \ngreat job of expressing the feelings the teachers and students have \nwith respect to what we are doing.\n  We have had an interesting week of debate. A number of things, of \ncourse, have helped define where we are and the direction we will take. \nOne of the quotes from the other side of the aisle is the reason we \nhave title I is because we decided in 1965 the needs of disadvantaged \nchildren were not being addressed.\n  Madam President, 35 years later, we find once again, the needs of \npoor kids are not being addressed--this time, by those who defend the \nstatus quo, the means of trapping another generation.\n  A Wall Street Journal editorial indicates that this is an effort to \nrestrict the States from making the decisions. Again, one of the \ncomments made\n\n[[Page S3575]]\n\nabout it was the GOP plan allows a blank check for Governors who will \nsee to it that the neediest and the poorest children will not benefit \nfrom the money.\n  This defines rather well where we are in this debate. Some of the \nfacts seem to be different than what is being talked about. So $120 \nbillion later, poor kids still lag behind in reading. The percentage of \nthose reading below basic level at the 12th grade is still 40 percent. \nThe percentage of those writing below basic level in title I is 38 \npercent in the 12th grade after $120 billion and 35 years of \nexpenditures under this program.\n  We are talking about returning some of the decisionmaking to parents, \nto local leaders, sending dollars to the classroom rather than having \nthem spent here, giving families greater educational choices, \nsupporting and encouraging exceptional teachers, focusing on basic \nacademics.\n  I think, if nothing more, we have defined very clearly where our \npriorities lie in terms of this body. I think we have a great \nopportunity to make some changes to bring about the results in \neducation that all Members seek.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I might have \n4 minutes to speak about Mike Epstein, who passed away on Saturday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Minnesota?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/08/senate-section/article/S3575-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF MIKE EPSTEIN\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, first I want colleagues to know, and \nof course this is for Democrats and Republicans, and with Mike it is \nfor staff and support staff and just about everybody who works here, \npages and others, there will be a service for Mike in the Mansfield \nRoom. It will be at 3 tomorrow. That is room S-207.\n  Many Senators came to the floor and spoke about Mike last week, on \nThursday. It was wonderful. I thank you. About 70 people came to our \noffice and did videos. All of this was sent to his family. Mike heard \nit. It was read to Mike. It meant a great deal to him. Letters have \ncome in. It has really been wonderful to recognize such a great, great \nperson.\n  Mike passed away on Saturday. We had a very small service for him \ntoday. He was buried in the Congressional Cemetery. Rabbi David \nSaperstein was there, Mike's family was there, and a few friends of \nmany years were there. Then tomorrow we will have a service here. I \nlook forward to that because it is wonderful, I say as a friend of \nMike, the unbelievable impact he made.\n  I could go on forever. I will not because if I try to, the truth is I \nprobably will not be able to go on at all. I just would not be able to \ndo it here on the floor. I will say one unimportant thing because it is \nabout me, and then I will say one important thing, and then I will be \nfinished.\n  The unimportant thing is in some ways I will just be lost without \nhim. It is not like Mike was my assistant; it was like he was my \nteacher. But I will talk to him every day.\n  The second thing I want to say, which is much more important, is if I \nhad to summarize a life, I would say the reason there has been such an \noutpouring of love is because Mike loved his family; he loved his work. \nAnd do you know what else? This is the best thing of all. He really \nloved and believed in public service. He loved his country. He was just \nsteady. It was just who he was. He never changed.\n  The world is going to miss him. The Senate is going to miss him. Most \nimportant of all, his family is going to miss him. Sheila and I are \ngoing to miss him.\n  Evan Bayh, who went through a real tragedy in his own family and lost \nhis mother at an early age, was kind enough, last week, to say to me: \nPaul, it's not how long you live your life; it's how you live your \nlife.\n  I think Mike is one of the five greatest individuals I have ever met \nin my life. He lived a wonderful life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I know all of us share in Senator \nWellstone's grief. I know I have lost, in the past, one of my chief \nstaff persons. You never know how important they are until they are not \nwith you. I know the Senator's chief of staff was an outstanding person \nwhom we all appreciated for his ability.\n  I am sure I speak for all Members on this side of the aisle: We share \nin the Senator's grief. We want him to know that.\n  I yield to Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, first of all, we all reach out again to \nMike's family. I think all of us in the Senate, just a few days ago, \nwere very grateful of our good friend and colleague, Senator Wellstone, \nfor giving us the opportunity to add a word to the comments on the \nextraordinary life of Mike Epstein.\n  As Paul--Senator Wellstone--had pointed out last week, the hours were \npassing along and there was very little time left. But I think the \nchallenge for all of us is to live a productive and useful life. That \nis the criterion the great philosophers have defined as the purpose in \nlife, and Mike lived that. We all are the beneficiaries of it.\n  Our hearts reach out to Paul at this time, and to all the members of \nthe family. I think Mike would feel right at home here this afternoon, \nwhere we are debating the education act. He had strong views about \nthese issues, as well as many others.\n  He made life better for people in this country. We will think of him \nduring the course of this debate, too.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/08/senate-section/article/S3575-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 2, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2) to extend programs and activities under the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, we are awaiting the arrival of the \nSenator from New Hampshire. I would like to say, in the interim, we \nwould like to proceed today with other amendments. I hope by the end of \nthe day we will be able to establish a program for the coming week, \nwhich will put us in a position where we can move the education bill \nforward.\n  At this time, I am happy to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I will speak briefly. As soon as the \nSenator from New Hampshire is on the floor, I will be glad to yield so \nhe will be able to make a presentation on his amendment. I have had the \nchance, over the weekend, to study it closely. I will reserve my \ncomments on it until we have had an opportunity to hear his \npresentation in the Senate this afternoon.\n  Just to review very briefly, we have had, now, as I understand it, \nprobably 4 days of discussion of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. Of those 4 days, 1 day was a general kind of presentation, \nalthough that was a good presentation by the speakers who had different \nviews on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We had five votes: \non Senator Gorton's amendment, what they call Straight A's; our \nDemocratic alternative, which was introduced by Senator Daschle and a \nnumber of us; Senator Abraham's merit pay amendment--I offered a \nsecond-degree on the Abraham amendment; and then on the Murray class \nsize amendment.\n  We had indicated there would be a number of others, although a \nrelatively small number. Actually, the total number that would be \noffered by this side would be somewhat less than has been usually \noffered in past considerations of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  We were going to have proposed an amendment that would address the \nwhole issue of the quality of our teachers, to guarantee we would have \na well-\n\n[[Page S3576]]\n\ntrained teacher in every classroom at the expiration of the \nauthorization bill. I will come back to that, how we are going to do \nit, and the importance of it for strengthening the quality of education \nand what the results are if you do have an excellent teacher, and what \nthe academic results are, from various examinations of whether having a \nwell-trained teacher, who is competent and knowledgeable about the \ncontent of the subject matter, and a good teacher. The difference that \nmakes to children's ability to learn is intuitively \nobvious. Nonetheless, we will have an opportunity to present some very \nimportant and powerful evidence about why the way we have approached \nthis will result in more favorable results.\n\n  Secondly, we have the whole issue about assisting many of the schools \nin this country that are older and are in great need of repair and \nmodernization. We want an opportunity to make a presentation to make. \nThe Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, has a powerful presentation to make. \nWe need over $112 billion a year to bring our schools up to standard. \nThere is much work that needs to be done, again, through a partnership \namong the Federal Government, States, and local communities.\n  We want to address the important issue of afterschool programs. \nSenator Dodd, Senator Boxer, and others have been involved in the \ndevelopment of that program. We have important results as to how that \nprogram is working and has worked in advancing the cause of teachers.\n  We want to have a good debate on accountability. We believe the most \nknowledgeable member is on our side, Senator Bingaman of New Mexico, \nwho has, going back to the time of the Governors' conference a number \nof years ago, made that a speciality of his. Most of the pieces of \nlegislation that are before us reflect a good deal of what he has \ndeveloped and has broad support. That has been very important.\n  Senator Mikulski has reminded us a number of times about the \nimportance of addressing the digital divide. In a time of new \ntechnology, it is important we not look back 10 years from now and find \nthat the new technology has been used in such a way it further divides \nour children who are attending schools, but instead that we have been \ncreative enough to use technologies in ways that have reduced the \ndivide that exists in our schools rather than exacerbate it. That is \nvery important. Senator Mikulski wants an opportunity to talk about \nthis issue.\n  Senator Reed has made a very important contribution to our \nlegislation. He was a member of the Education Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives prior to coming to the Senate, following Senator Pell. \nHe wants to talk about the importance of the involvement of parents in \ndecisionmaking in the local communities. That is very important.\n  Senator Wellstone will be bringing up the issue of fair testing of \nchildren. He has spoken about that issue a number of times. We have \nvoted on some aspects of it in the past.\n  Those are the principal education issues. There are some on our side \nwho feel safety and security in our schools is an important issue, and \nwe will be addressing that issue.\n  We have a limited number of amendments. In my conversations with most \nof our colleagues, we are prepared to enter into very reasonable time \nlimits. I know on six or eight of those subject matters, we are \nprepared to enter into time agreements of an hour or so evenly divided \nso we can move this process forward. These are not subjects the Senate \nhas not addressed. We have addressed these issues in the full committee \nin our markups. We have spoken about these issues during the debate. I \nintend to speak on the issue of the quality of our teachers because \nthat is relevant to the Gregg amendment.\n  I have talked with our leader, Senator Daschle, who will be talking \nwith the majority leader and hopefully will work out a program so we \ncan reach a determination on these issues in the next few days. There \nis no reason why we should not do that.\n  There are amendments on the other side as well. We have had \nan opportunity to look at some of those. There is no reason we cannot \npick up the pace and resolve some of these issues in a timely way. We \nhad hoped to do more of these amendments at the end of last week, and \nwe are in the situation today, with the funeral of His Eminence \nCardinal O'Connor, of being unable to reach a conclusion on some of \nthese debates this afternoon.\n\n  Hopefully, we can, by the end of the day, give an indication of how \nthe Senate wants to proceed. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for fulfilling the commitment he made during a discussion \nwe had on Thursday night. I advise the Senator in Massachusetts that \nfive of the seven amendments he talked about did arrive at our office \nFriday. I thank him and his staff for that. We are going to try to \naccommodate him this afternoon in return.\n  At the moment, by previous agreement, we were prepared to move to an \namendment by Senator Gregg of New Hampshire. His arrival has been \ndelayed somewhat--I do not think very long. I had a chance to talk with \nthe chairman, and I thought we might accommodate Senator Inhofe, if the \nSenator from Massachusetts concurs, for some 5 to 10 minutes on an \nunrelated matter while we are locating Senator Gregg.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma be given up \nto 10 minutes to conduct his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I thank both managers of the bill for \ngiving me some time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/08/senate-section/article/S3576-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3576-S3601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UPDATE ON LINDA TRIPP FILE CASE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I want to update my colleagues and the \nAmerican people on the latest developments in the Linda Tripp file \ncase. As my colleagues will recall, this is a matter concerning how \ninformation from the confidential personnel file of a Pentagon civil \nservant was leaked to the media in March of 1998, more than 2 years \nago, by the Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon and a colleague in \nviolation of the Privacy Act.\n  As my questions at an Armed Services Committee hearing revealed for \nthe first time on April 6, the Pentagon's Office of Inspector General \nessentially completed its investigation of this matter within 4 months \nof the incident. In July of 1998, it referred its report to the Justice \nDepartment, having found sufficient evidence that a crime had been \ncommitted.\n  From July 1998 until March of 2000, the Justice Department sat on the \nreport, taking no action, making us believe the IG report was not \ncompleted and not given to them--essentially engaging in a coverup, in \nits typical stonewalling, delaying tactics. Then finally, on March 28, \n2000, they quietly returned the report to the Pentagon, informing them \nit would not criminally prosecute anyone in the case.\n  I reported all of this to the Senate in a floor statement I made on \nApril 11. At that time, I pointed out that the offense in this case--\ndisseminating to the media information from a Government employee's \nconfidential personnel file--was the same offense Chuck Colson pleaded \nguilty to during Watergate. It was the same offense for which Colson \nserved in the Federal penitentiary.\n  Since all of this was revealed last month, three principal defenses--\nI would call them excuses--have emerged as to why Mr. Bacon should not \nbe prosecuted. These have been put forth to the media by Mr. Bacon's \nlawyer and by the Justice Department in its decision to take a pass on \nprosecution. Let me state these three defenses and what they are:\n  No. 1, defense by Kenneth Bacon is that Bacon only leaked a part of a \nconfidential file, not the whole file;\n  No. 2, that the Freedom of Information Act ``trumps'' the Privacy \nAct; and\n  No. 3, that Bacon ``didn't intend to break the law.''\n  Today, I want to report to the Senate that all of these arguments \nhave been refuted and exposed as having no merit in this case. This \nleaves us facing the stark truth: The law was violated, and those who \nviolated it should be prosecuted.\n  In testimony on April 26 before the Senate Armed Services \nSubcommittee on Readiness, which is the Committee I chair, I asked \nPentagon Deputy Inspector General Donald Mancuso about these issues. He \nconfirmed these points:\n\n[[Page S3577]]\n\n  No. 1, that criminal violations of the Privacy Act are not contingent \non whether a whole file or just a part of a file is compromised.\n  Common sense would lead us to this conclusion anyway, but this was \nconfirmed by the inspector general in our committee meeting.\n  Either one constitutes a violation. There is no distinction between \nleaking part of a file or leaking the entire file.\n  Secondly, that there was no formal written Freedom of Information Act \nrequest made prior to the Tripp file leak; that, in any event, the \nFreedom of Information Act does not trump the Privacy Act; and that, \nindeed, the Freedom of Information Act includes specific exemptions \ndirectly related to the Privacy Act.\n  So we are saying two things really. We are saying, first of all, when \nthey said they used the Freedom of Information Act request as an \nexcuse, they were lying, because there was no request under the Freedom \nof Information Act. Secondly, if that had happened, there is specific \nexemptions within our law to the Freedom of Information Act, one of \nwhich is the Privacy Act.\n  Finally, in its March 2000 decision not to prosecute, the Justice \nDepartment stated that Bacon and his colleague ``didn't intend to break \nthe law when they released information from Linda Tripp's personnel \nfile.''\n  What this tells me is that the Justice Department knows the law was \nbroken. It is all the more reason why their decision not to prosecute \nis so outrageous. The next time I am stopped by a policeman for \nspeeding, I am going to tell him, ``I didn't intend to break the law.'' \nI suppose then everything will be all right.\n  Recently, I received a letter from Mr. Bacon's lawyer taking \nexception to a couple of points I made it my previous remarks on the \nfloor. I would like to respond to each of those points here:\n  First, Bacon's lawyer claims that comparing Kenneth Bacon's offense \nto Chuck Colson's offense in Watergate is ``inaccurate'' and ``unfair'' \nbecause the two cases, he says, are not ``remotely comparable.''\n  But he is wrong. They are directly comparable.\n  He goes into a lengthy description of the charges against Colson \nwhich were dropped by the court. All of this is interesting, but it is \nirrelevant to the current case.\n  Colson released information from Daniel Elsberg's confidential file, \nviolating Elsberg's privacy.\n  Bacon released information from Linda Tripp's confidential file, \nviolating Tripp's privacy.\n  What could be more ``comparable'' than this?\n  Second, Mr. Bacon's lawyer notes that the court said Colson \nimplemented ``a scheme to defame and destroy the public image of Daniel \nElsberg, with the intent to influence, obstruct, and impede the conduct \nand outcome'' of pending investigations and prosecutions.\n  Similarly, Bacon's action can easily be seen as part of ``a scheme to \ndefame and destroy the public image of Linda Tripp, with the intent to \ninfluence, obstruct, and impede the conduct and outcome'' of pending \ninvestigations and possible prosecutions of the President and of Linda \nTripp herself.\n  Let's not forget that Linda Tripp has testified that she was told by \na top White House aide that she would be ``destroyed'' if she came \nforward and exposed illegal activities she witnessed in the Clinton \nWhite House, including matters related to the Filegate scandal. Tripp's \nFBI file was one of over 900 FBI files improperly obtained by the \nClinton White House. Tripp remains a material witness in continuing \nlegal proceedings on the Filegate matter.\n  In addition, let's not forget that Tripp has also been the target of \na politically motivated prosecution in Maryland concerning the taping \nof Monica Lewinski's phone calls.\n  All of this provides ample evidence of possible motivations ``to \ndefame or destroy'' her ``public image.''\n  Third, Mr. Bacon's lawyer claims that Bacon did not violate any law \nin releasing the information on Tripp.\n  Again, he is simply wrong. Bacon clearly violated the Privacy Act, \nthe law which was enacted in 1974 as a direct result of the Colson \ncase. It isn't even a close call.\n  The contention that the media inquiry constituted a FOIA request that \nsomehow superseded the Privacy Act will simply not stand up to \nscrutiny.\n  Finally, Mr. Bacon's lawyer makes a legitimate point with which I \nam prepared to agree; and that is, that Mr. Bacon is a dedicated public \nofficial who has served the Department of Defense with distinction for \n6 years.\n\n  Similarly, Linda Tripp is a dedicated public official who has served \nin the Pentagon and the White House with distinction for many years.\n  The problem is that there must be equal application of the law if the \nlaw is to have any meaning.\n  Mr. Bacon simply cannot be permitted to escape responsibility for an \nact that so clearly violated the law--a law which is designed to \nprotect the rights of all government employees.\n  The news media, I think, has created a particular problem in this \ncase. It is a travesty that the major news media have not covered this \nstory and informed the American people about why this is important.\n  What a contract with how the news media acted during the Watergate \nera. At that time, the news media led the charge to uncover wrongdoing \nby high government officials, explaining why adherence to the rule of \nlaw was so vital to the protection of liberty.\n  In the aftermath of Chuck Colson's pleading guilty in June 1974, \nalong with other Watergate figures, newspapers across the country \nexpressed appropriate outrage. They covered the story. They commented \non it forcefully. They didn't sweep it under the rug. They did not say \nthey were bored. They did not argue that the country should ``move on'' \nto other things.\n  They knew that lawbreaking by high officials was one of the most \nimportant things they could report to the American people, because, as \nthey kept telling us, an informed public is essential to the protection \nof liberty in a democracy.\n  Here are a few examples of editorials during the Watergate years. \nWhere are the similar editorials today?\n  On June 12, 1974, the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin was upset that \nanother Watergate figure got off too lightly with a 30-day suspended \nsentence for his Watergate crime. They said.\n\n       The circumstances (in this case) did not call for a tap on \n     the wrist. [The judge's] praise for (the defendant's) \n     integrity in this setting seems inappropriate. If [the \n     defendant] is to be so excused for failing to do his duty . . \n     . then how are others to be held accountable for placing \n     personal loyalty above their duty and the requirements of the \n     law?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Then, speaking of Chuck Colson, on June 4, 1974, the \nDayton (Ohio) Daily News wrote:\n\n       In this tawdry matter, Mr. Nixon's White House again has \n     been exposed--this time by an aide who was high in its \n     deliberations and was an intimate of the President's--as \n     acting against the political and judicial process of this \n     country as if they were enemies.\n\n  Finally, in commenting on Chuck Colson, in the home state of the \nPresiding Officer, the Portland (Maine) Evening Express wrote on June \n30, 1974:\n\n       Yet another close aide or high appointee of President Nixon \n     has been brought to justice . . . He had attempted to defame \n     Elsberg and destroy his credibility . . . Daily, it becomes \n     abundantly clearer that [the Nixon Administration is] the \n     most morally reprehensible administration in the history of \n     the nation.\n\n  So who is at fault? Of course, Ken Bacon is at fault for violating \nthe law. But I suppose it is human nature to cover up to save oneself. \nWho is really at fault is the press--the media--who are covering up \nthis crime. No one can look at the way the press assailed Chuck Colson \nfor his crime and now covers up the crime of Ken Bacon without asking, \n``Why? Why are they so defensive of Ken Bacon when they so aggressively \nwent after Chuck Colson?'' Unequal application of the law is no worse \nthen inequality in reporting. The consequences of both serve to \ndiminish our liberty.\n  Unfortunately, Ken Bacon, who should have been prosecuted, is now in \nthe hands of Secretary of Defense William Cohen. Cohen is charged with \nreviewing the IG report and issuing any administrative discipline, \nshort of criminal punishment. I urge him to act swiftly and in accord \nwith the seriousness of this matter.\n\n[[Page S3578]]\n\n  Federal employees throughout government are watching this case. What \nwill it say to them if someone who has so clearly violated the Privacy \nAct is not held accountable?\n  It will say that no one's privacy can ultimately be protected, that \nthe law is largely meaningless, and that ideal of public service in \nsupport of the Constitution and the laws is forever diminished.\n  Madam President, I am not trying to single out Kenneth Bacon. I don't \neven know him. But I do know Chuck Colson, and he admits he was \nproperly prosecuted, and Kenneth Bacon has committed the same crime and \ngets off free. This is wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3126\n\n       (Purpose: To improve the provisions relating to teachers)\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell], for Mr. Lott and \n     Mr. Gregg, proposes an amendment numbered 3126.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I rise to speak on behalf of this \namendment and, in particular, a core provision of it, which is teacher \nliability.\n  As schools have become more violent, it is increasingly necessary for \nteachers to use reasonable means to maintain order and discipline in \ntheir classrooms. In order to provide a safe and positive learning \nenvironment, teachers and principals must not be afraid to remove \ndisruptive students for fear of becoming the subject of frivolous \nlawsuits.\n  I forget the exact timing of this, but sometime within the last 2 \nyears, the Senate and House passed the Volunteer Liability Protection \nAct. I want to use that as a backdrop in preparation for what the \nprovisions of this amendment do.\n  At a time when the Nation was calling on more and more people to step \nforward and be charitable and be volunteers, we had a huge summit. The \nPresident and all the former Presidents were there, as was Gen. Colin \nPowell. They outlined a call to the Nation to step forward and \nvolunteer. Several days after that summit, I, along with several \nothers, introduced this Volunteer Liability Protection Act.\n  It was based on this premise that voluntarism in the country was \ndeclining, even though voluntarism is like a national monument in the \nUnited States, but it was declining. And when you looked into why--or \namong the reasons why--it was the fact that volunteers, such as sports \nfigures, role models who were consistently asked to step forward and \nvolunteer, and major figures in the community, people of substance, or \na family who sold a business and, in effect, retired and had the time \nand the resources to step forward and help the local YMCA or a \ncharitable group, were targeted for frivolous lawsuits. I will give an \nexample of one and then I will get back to the teacher side of it.\n\n  Picture a YMCA gym. This woman, in particular, who I talked about \nover and over throughout that debate, was a volunteer receptionist; she \nwas answering the phone. She had nothing to do with the actual rigors \nof what was going on in the gym. Well, a young man broke either an arm \nor a leg in some activity in the gym. So you would have thought, well, \nif there were grounds for a lawsuit--and it wasn't just an accident and \nit involved no willful neglect--you would go after whoever was \nsupervising the young man. I think that sounds reasonable to most \nAmericans. But, no, the person who was sued was the woman answering the \nphone because they knew she had assets. Needless to say, people such as \nthat didn't want to volunteer anymore. It is kind of hard to be a phone \nreceptionist for the YMCA and put your whole family on the line, where \nyou might be subject to a lawsuit and you might inadvertently lose it, \nand everything the family had worked for could be gone.\n  So we introduced the Volunteer Liability Protection Act. After a \nrigorous debate, it passed here, it passed the House, and the President \nsigned it. It has been welcomed throughout the entire country as a \nrelief that allows Americans, whether athletes or people who have \nassets, or somebody else, to step forward and be a volunteer.\n  It is directly analogous to the situation that we have in schools. \nAgain, I say in order to provide a safe and positive learning \nenvironment, teachers and principals must not be afraid to remove a \ndisruptive student for fear of being subject to a frivolous lawsuit. \nYou can picture it. There is a scuffle going on in the hallway. A \nteacher has to make a decision. I remember that in the near disaster in \nRockdale County, after Columbine, a young man entered the school. He \nhad a weapon and he threatened several students with it, and he fired \nseveral shots. No one, gratefully, was either killed or permanently \nwounded. But the assistant principal appeared and moved directly to the \nstudent who had the firearm and pointed the firearm at him. \nCourageously--in my judgment, he had unbelievable courage--he walked \nup, calmed the student and took the weapon and held the student, who \nhad become very emotional, until law enforcement officers could arrive.\n  That is an exaggerated incident, but we all know that scuffles such \nas this occur between students, or a verbal attack might occur in a \nclassroom. A teacher can't be sitting there computing whether or not \nshe or her family is at risk if she does her job. As the Volunteer \nProtection Act, this legislation does not allow for any willful \nmisconduct. If this teacher were involved in willful misconduct, \naggravated conduct, she would be subject to a lawsuit. But what it \nwould end is just picking her out and harassing her or him into a \nsettlement.\n  Listen to these statistics. The percentage of public school teachers \nin the United States who say they have been verbally abused is 51 \npercent. Fifty-one percent of all of our teachers threatened with \ninjury, which is perhaps an even more significant percentage, is down. \nBut 16 percent have been threatened they would be harmed; physically \nattacked, just under 1 in 10. It is 7 percent.\n\n  In 1992, 33 percent of 12th grade public school students felt \ndisruptions by other students interfered with their learning. In other \nwords, a third of the school population is talking about the disruption \nanother student is conducting that interrupts the schoolday \nsufficiently to interfere with that student's learning.\n  In my State of Georgia, in 1997, there were 38,000 violent incidents \nand 2,600 weapons violations.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts cited a survey of teachers which \nfound that 43 percent of high school teachers felt their personal \nsafety was in jeopardy in a 2-year period. A seventh grade student at \nLincoln Academy in New York was arrested on June 2, 1999, for setting a \nfire to his teacher's hair.\n  Two Irving Middle School seventh graders in Lorain, OH, were charged \nin January of 1999 of plotting to kill their teacher with a 12-inch \nfillet knife. As 15 students placed bets on the girl's plot, another \nteacher found out and intervened--in moments. She overrode this \nsituation before the stabbing occurred.\n  In Columbus, GA, my home State, seven students were sent to summer \ncommunity service after planning to poison a teacher's iced tea and \ntrip her on the stairs because the students thought she was too strict.\n  Recently, I met with a large number of school superintendents. They \ntalked about the multitude of issues that are affecting them and their \nability to do the job. But when you mention teacher liability, the \nthreat to them of a lawsuit--whether it is the principal, the \nadministrator, or teacher--is very high on their agenda; that we are \ncreating an environment where prudent decisions might be missed. A \ncircumstance where a teacher's intervention would be useful doesn't \noccur because the teacher is intimidated by the threat of being sued \nfor having made that decision.\n  Again, I reiterate that in the Volunteer Liability Protection Act, \nthis language does not excuse any willful conduct or any aggravated \nconduct. The\n\n[[Page S3579]]\n\nperson is still liable for that kind of behavior. It is the frivolous \nactivity that would apply, just as in the Volunteer Liability \nProtection Act.\n  I am going to describe for a minute or two the language of this \nsection. The teacher liability protection provisions provide limited \ncivil litigation immunity for teachers, principals, and other \neducational professionals who engage in reasonable--I repeat \n``reasonable''--actions to maintain order, discipline, and a positive \neducational environment in America's schools and classrooms. It \nprotects teachers from lawsuits when using reasonable means to maintain \norder, control, or discipline in the school or classroom.\n  What does ``reasonable'' mean? It does not include wanton and willful \nmisconduct. It does not mean a criminal act. It does not mean the \nviolation of State law. It does not mean the violation of Federal civil \nrights laws. And it does not mean inappropriate use of drugs or alcohol \non the teacher's behalf. As I said a little earlier, it is modeled on \nthe Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 and various State laws that seek \nto provide teachers limited civil liability immunity, including my own \nState of Georgia.\n  It is narrowly crafted to protect teachers from lawsuits when they \nare attempting to maintain order, control, or discipline in the school \nand classroom. It protects teachers from frivolous lawsuits.\n  I always use the word ``teachers.'' But I think I should reiterate \nthat it is teachers, principals, and administrators in the system. It \nis not only teachers, such as the person I just talked about who \ninterceded to try to contain a student who brought loaded weapons to \nthe school and threatened not only other students of being shot but his \nown life and the life of the assistant principal. All had been \nthreatened. There is no telling what the outcome might have been \nwithout the courage of this administrator to intercede.\n  It protects teachers from frivolous lawsuits when they remove a \ndisruptive or belligerent and possibly dangerous child from the \nclassroom. That ought to be expanded. It is not necessarily from the \nclassroom but from an environment on the school property that is \npotentially dangerous; a fight in the cafeteria. What do you do? Do you \njust sit there and watch the fight because you are saying to yourself, \nif I go over there and interrupt, the parents of one, or two, or three \nof those children are going to sue us. In this case, that would be \nconsidered frivolous. It would be the person doing their job. On the \nother hand, if the teacher was involved with starting or aggravating a \nfight, it would be wanton behavior, and that teacher or that \nadministrator would be liable because they did something wrong; \nsomething outside the parameter of their job.\n  It would allow principals and administrators to take charge of \ncircumstances in the school and the classroom. It would prevent the \noveractive trial lawyer community--and I believe by anybody's standard \nthis is one of the great issues of our time with enormous utilization. \nWe have become a society that is ready to sue--your neighbor or the guy \nwho is packing your food at the grocery store. We are just suing \neverybody. Some of it is very appropriate, but a lot of it is not. It \nprobably has to be dealt with in a lot more places than volunteers in \nthe schoolroom.\n  But it certainly needed to happen. It has to protect volunteers, and \nit certainly needs to happen on these school properties. It does not, I \nrepeat, override any State law that provides teachers with greater \nimmunity--as I said, some do, including Georgia--of liability \nprotections.\n  This is important: States can affirmatively opt out of Federal \ncoverage by passing State legislation. They have their own view of it. \nIf they want to expand it, they can. But they can opt out.\n  The provision does not address the rights of individual States to \nprohibit or allow use of corporal punishment by teachers and \nadministrators to discipline unruly and possibly dangerous students.\n  Recently, parents brought a suit against a history teacher at a high \nschool for damages the parents claim their son suffered when the \nteacher removed him from the classroom after the student refused to go \nto the vice principal's office.\n  We have a classroom. We have an unruly student. In this case, the \nteacher steps forward and says, You need to go to the vice principal's \noffice. The student refuses to do so. The teacher removes that student \nfrom the classroom--this is not an appropriate interaction going on in \nthe classroom--and gets sued for doing that.\n  That is an individual doing their job.\n  Matt Grimes, a student, went to a teacher's tutorial class. The \ngentleman's name was Mr. Stringer. Mr. Stringer told him to go to the \ntutorial he was scheduled to attend. In other words, the student was in \nthe wrong place and needed to be somewhere else. Matt said his teacher \nwould not let him into that class because he was late. That teacher \ndid, indeed, refuse Matt's admittance because of a late arrival. \nSomething was said to the teacher that was disrespectful, and the \nteacher pointed or touched his chest with his index finger. In other \nwords, he touched him and was sued. The teacher ended up being sued as \na result of that incident.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a full article be \nprinted into the Record from the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, May 4, \n1999, by Kay Hymowitz.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 4, 1999.]\n\n              How the Courts Undermined School Discipline\n\n                          (By Kay S. Hymowitz)\n\n       In the wake of the Littleton school shootings, we've heard \n     a lot about educators' need to pay attention to the ``warning \n     signs'' of potentially violent youngsters. In this case such \n     signs were plain to see: Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold \n     produced videos and wrote essays for their classes depicting \n     their murderous fantasies. But the legal culture produced by \n     a pair of Supreme Court rulings makes it difficult for \n     educators to do anything when confronted with such warning \n     signs--or indeed even to enforce the ordinary discipline that \n     our kids need in order to be molded into citizens.\n       In Tinker v. Des Moines School District (1969), the \n     justices sided with students who had been threatened with \n     suspension for wearing black armbands to protest the Vietnam \n     War. Tinker protected young people who expressed opinions at \n     odds with the government and reduced the possibility that \n     educators could simply indoctrinate children with their own \n     beliefs. ``It can hardly be argued,'' wrote Justice Abe \n     Fortas, ``that either students or teachers shed their \n     constitutional rights . . . at the schoolhouse gate. . . . \n     Students in school as well as out of school are `persons' \n     under our Constitution.''\n       Six years later, in Goss v. Lopez, the court granted \n     students the right to due process when threatened with a \n     suspension of more than 10 days. Careful to insist that \n     schools need only provide informal hearings, not elaborate \n     judicial procedures, the justices believed that they could \n     help guard against feared abuses of power without seriously \n     disrupting principals' authority.\n       On first sight, these decisions seem balanced and sensible. \n     But their unintended consequence was to help create the world \n     Gerald Grant described in his 1988 book, ``The World We \n     Created at Hamilton High.'' ``Assemblies often degenerated \n     into catcalls and semiobscene behavior while teachers watched \n     silently,'' Mr. Grant writes. ``Trash littered the hallway \n     outside the cafeteria, but it was a rare teacher who \n     suggested a student pick up a milk carton he or she had \n     thrown on the floor.''\n       Cheating was sidespread, but ``few adults seemed to care.'' \n     No wonder. Teachers who accused kids of cheating were \n     required to produce documentation and witnesses to counter \n     the ``other side of the story.'' One teacher who had failed a \n     boy for plagiarizing a paper had to defend herself repeatedly \n     before a supervisor after being harrassed by daily phone \n     calls from the student's parents and the lawyer they had \n     hired on their son's behalf. Another teacher was asked why \n     she didn't report several students who were making sexually \n     degrading remarks about her in the hallway. ``Well, it \n     wouldn't have done any good,'' she shrugged. ``I didn't have \n     any witnesses.'' The phrase ``You can't suspend me'' became \n     the taunt of many a disruptive student.\n       Surely the justices who decided Tinker and Goss did not \n     anticipate this. Indeed, subsequent decisions have made clear \n     that students don't enjoy the same legal rights as adults. In \n     Bethel School District v. Fraser (1986), the Supreme Court \n     ruled in favor of a principal who suspended a student for \n     making an obscene speech, and in Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier \n     (1988), it allowed principals to censor high-school \n     newspapers. And lower courts often decide in favor of school \n     administrators who take a strong stand against provocative \n     student speech and behavior.\n       But the mere threat of a lawsuit is often enough to have a \n     chilling effect on teachers and administrators. Educators are \n     understandably wary of students backed by litigious parents, \n     not to mention numerous\n\n[[Page S3580]]\n\n     rights manuals with titles like ``Up Against the Law,'' ``A \n     High School Student's Bill of Rights'', and ``Ask Sybil \n     Liberty.'' These guidebooks enumerate for already-disaffected \n     kids all the impermissible things teachers are going to try \n     to make them do. You don't have to answer a school official \n     if he questions you; a teacher can't make you do anything \n     that violates your conscience; if you don't like the way the \n     school makes you dress, you can go to court; you can demand \n     to see your school records.\n       In his dissent in Tinker, Justice Hugo Black, one of the \n     court's strongest defenders of the First Amendment, wrote \n     that the decision ``subject all the public schools in the \n     country to the whims and caprices of their loudest-mouthed, \n     but maybe not their brightest, students.'' Justice Black was \n     right. A few years ago a Colorado high school principal took \n     no action as one of his students strutted into school wearing \n     Ku Klux Klan insignia. That is, until a black student punched \n     the would-be Klansman. Only then, when the Klansman's \n     ``speech'' could be construed as an incitement to violence, \n     did the principal forbid it.\n       In another case, a high-school senior in New York state \n     distributed articles urging students to urinate in hallways, \n     scrawl graffiti on the walls and riot when the police \n     arrived. In 1997 the school district suspended the boy, but \n     only after the case had dragged on for two years, including \n     an appeal to the state's highest court. Last year a 14-year-\n     old eighth-grader in Half Moon Bay, Calif., wrote a pair of \n     English compositions, one about torching the school library \n     and beating up the principal and another, charmingly entitled \n     ``Goin' Postal,'' about pumping seven bullets into the \n     principal. When the boy was suspended for five days, his \n     parents sued the school district. The district and the \n     parents reached a settlement under which the suspension was \n     reduced to two days and the grounds were changed from \n     ``terroristic threats'' to ``habitual use of profanity in \n     school assignments.''\n       Rights-empowered students are not merely a discipline \n     problem; they have also helped dumb down the curriculum. Mr \n     Grant found that as administrators and teachers became \n     fearful of restless, back-talking adolescents, they resorted \n     to keeping classes amiable and nonthreatening--in other \n     words, unchallenging. All but a handful of charismatic \n     teachers studiously avoided giving low grades, demanding \n     homework or administering rigorous tests. This same dynamic \n     is at work in the many schools today where students choose \n     their courses from a number of faddish, ``creative'' options. \n     After all, ``Music as Expression'' is much less likely to \n     make a kid testy than ``19th-Century American History.''\n       Thus instead of enriching children's minds and challenging \n     their media-fed fantasies, adults stand by and condone the \n     worst forms of adolescent acting-out, sometimes with deadly \n     results. Kip Kinkel, a 15-year-old Springfield, Ore., boy, \n     reported in science class on how to build a bomb and read in \n     literature class from his journal about his dreams of murder. \n     Last May the teenager allegedly shot and killed his parents, \n     then went to school, where he allegedly murdered two \n     classmates and injured two dozen more; he is now on trial. \n     The adults' response to his classroom rantings? ``He was a \n     typical 15-year-old,'' the Springfield superintendent of \n     schools said. Other school officials said classroom talk of \n     murder and violence is nothing unusual.\n       The Supreme Court undoubtedly thought that Tinker and Goss \n     would free students from oppressive adult power. Yet today, \n     30 years later, resentful students must march through metal \n     detectors, get sniffed for guns by trained dogs, watch police \n     and security guards patrolling the hallways--and fear for \n     their lives.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It says:\n\n       In the wake of the Littleton school shootings, we've heard \n     a lot about educators' need to pay attention to the ``warning \n     signs'' of potentially violent youngsters. In this case such \n     signs were plain to see. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold \n     produced videos and wrote essays for their classes depicting \n     murderous fantasies.\n\n  I make a point about the legal culture. A pair of Supreme Court \nrulings makes it difficult for educators to do anything at all when \nconfronted with such warning signs. The warning sign in the case of the \nteacher in Georgia was a pistol pointed right at him. That is a little \nlate. But he made a decision and he executed the decision, saved the \nchild, and was not harmed himself.\n  It is difficult for educators to do anything when confronted with the \nwarning signs or, indeed, to even enforce ordinary discipline that kids \nneed in order to be molded into citizens.\n  That goes back to the point I was making a bit ago. Unfortunately, \nthis happens in a lot of walks of life. It happens with employers. It \nhappens with store owners. People stop making prudent decisions or \nbecome so overly cautious about the legal costs, which are passed on to \nthe consumer, that they start doing things that do not make sense for \nsociety.\n  We pay a price when it occurs in the school, when a teacher sees a \ndisorderly event or something that potentially is dangerous, wrong, or \ndisruptive to the education in the school, and in that teacher's mind \nthey decide not to do anything, not to act; they walk away because they \nare intimidated for fear of ultimate consequences. Maybe somebody else \nin the school system was involved in a frivolous lawsuit. We are \nproducing an environment where persons in charge on school property are \nstopped from doing things we expect them to do.\n  In Tinker v. Des Moines School District, the justices sided with \nstudents who had been threatened with suspension for wearing black \narmbands to protest the Vietnam war. The court believed it was a form \nof expression. Now we hear about all these articles, one after other, \ncondemning the school for not doing anything because students showed up \ndressed in a threatening manner in the school. They condemned them for \nnot doing anything. On the one hand, if you do anything, you get sued. \nIt is a Catch-22 situation.\n  This article says:\n\n       On first sight, these decisions seem balanced and sensible. \n     But their unintended consequence was to help create the world \n     Gerald Grant described in his 1988 book, ``The World We \n     Created at Hamilton High.'' Assemblies often degenerated into \n     catcalls and semiobscene behavior while teachers watched \n     silently.\n\n  Mr. Grant writes, ``Trash littered the hallway outside the cafeteria, \nbut it was a rare teacher who suggested a student pick up a milk carton \nhe or she had thrown on the floor.''\n\n       Cheating was widespread, but ``few adults seemed to care.'' \n     Teachers who accused kids of cheating were required to \n     produce documentation and witnesses to counter the other side \n     of the story. One teacher who had failed a boy for \n     plagiarizing a paper had to defend herself repeatedly before \n     a supervisor after being harassed by daily phone calls from \n     the student's parents and the lawyer they had hired on their \n     son's behalf.\n\n  This is different from the place I went to school. There was no \n``chill'' on those teachers. If something this egregious was going on, \nthere was somebody who was going to do something about it. I know I am \nbetter off for it and so are all my classmates. This is not the kind of \nenvironment--we are talking reform in education--you want going on in \nschools.\n  Gratefully, it doesn't go on in all schools. But there is a teacher \nor principal or administrator in every school who has had it register: \nI am at legal risk here, even if I'm just doing my job. Everybody knows \nthey are at legal risk if they engage in some wanton behavior that is \nobstructive or damaging. They cannot tell a student to pick up trash \noff the floor or do something about cheating going on in a classroom \nwithout getting sued. The mere threat of a lawsuit is often enough to \nhave a chilling effect on teachers and administrators. Educators are \nunderstandably weary of students backed by litigious parents, not to \nmention the numerous rights manuals with titles like ``Up Against The \nLaw,'' ``A High School Student's Bill of Rights,'' and ``Ask Sybil \nLiberty''--that is S-y-b-i-l Liberty.\n\n       These guidebooks enumerate for already disaffected kids, \n     all the impermissible things teachers are going to try to \n     make them do.\n\n  That is actually published literature out there, that somebody who is \ndisaffected for some reason or other can seize onto to protect \nthemselves from the environment of a stable school.\n\n       You do not have to answer a school official, if he \n     questions you.\n\n  This is the advice from all these great documents I have just \nenumerated.\n\n       A teacher can't make you do anything that violates your \n     conscience.\n\n  You know, like the other fellow a little bit ago who was asked to go \nto the vice principal's office.\n\n       If you don't like the way the school makes you dress you \n     can go to the court.\n       You can demand to see your school records.\n\n  In another case, a high school senior in New York State distributed \narticles urging students to urinate in the hallways, scrawl graffiti on \nthe walls, and riot when the police arrived.\n  In 1997 the school district suspended the boy but only after the \nlegal case had dragged on for 2 years, including an appeal to the \nState's highest court.\n  Rights-empowered students are not merely a discipline problem; they \nhave also helped dumb down the curriculum. Mr. Grant found that as \nadministrators and teachers became fearful of restless,\n\n[[Page S3581]]\n\nback-talking adolescents, they resorted to keeping classes amiable and \nunthreatening; in other words, unchallenging. All but a handful of \ncharismatic teachers studiously avoided giving low grades, demanding \nhomework, or administering tests.\n  We all came down here last week. We preached. We had different views \nabout what we ought to do.\n  We know there is something badly wrong in K-12 today. We know it. \nEverybody knows it. The data is just beyond description--the number of \nstudents who cannot read, who do not have quality math skills.\n  With this activity going on, it is going to be pretty hard, no matter \nwhat we do, to get things reversed. We want quality teachers. We want \nto recruit quality teachers. How many Senators have come down here \ntalking about wanting a quality teacher? I think just about everybody. \nHow are we going to get a quality teacher with this stuff going on \nwhere they work?\n  Over the 5-year period, just 5 years, from 1993 to 1997, teachers \nwere the victims of 1,771,000 nonfatal crimes at school, including \n1,114,000 thefts, and 657,000 violent crimes. On the average this would \nbe about 350,000-plus crimes per year.\n  Madam President, I made my point. I want to give the other side some \ntime. For the moment, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we have the Gregg-Lott amendment before \nus. The Senator has spoken about the liability provisions that have \nbeen included. There are four other provisions that are included in the \namendment.\n  At the appropriate time, I am going to urge the Senate to accept the \nGregg amendment.\n  It seems to me the case ought to be made within the States, since the \nStates have the power to take action on the matter discussed here \nduring the course of this afternoon. The liability provision the \nSenator has mentioned would say if the States have weaker provisions, \nthen these standards would stand. If they have stronger standards in \norder to deal with the problems of protecting those who are involved in \neducation, than those would stand.\n  A number of States have taken it. It always seemed we were focused on \nwhat was going to happen in the classroom. If the States wanted to take \nthat action, they should take it. A number of them have. The Senator \nhas offered an amendment which includes these provisions. We are going \nto recommend they move ahead and they be accepted.\n  There were other provisions that were included in the Gregg \namendment. It makes some small adjustments to what they call the TOPS \nProgram by requiring every local district to take advantage of what the \nTOPS Program would be. They change the requirements to say that every \nlocal district has to do it, instead of just failing ones. I think that \nis an improvement.\n  It adds a part of our Democratic teacher quality accountability \nprovision, so after 3 years, if the local district is not improving, \nthe district cannot get the fourth and fifth year funds. We do that \nplus provide additional kinds of protections. Theirs is a modest \nchange, but a useful one.\n  As I said, it provides teacher liability, which is acceptable. Then, \nas I understand it--I read it--there is, in addition, a small pot of \nmoney for financial incentives for certifications of teachers. That is \nnot objectionable. It is a very modest program. It might provide some \nvalue for teachers.\n  But I want to come back to the underlying themes of where we are in \nthis legislation. The amendment itself can be easily wiped out by the \nGovernors of the States; the teacher quality program is blockgranted \nunder Straight A's in S. 2.\n  So in effect, if the Governor wanted to block grant the whole TOPS \nProgram--their basis for recruitment, mentoring, and upgrading skills \nfor teachers in classrooms, which is their teacher education program, \nthey could do it. It disappears. The teacher quality program can be \nblock granted in the 50-State block grant and the 15-State block grant.\n  So we are effectively eliminating--or under the Republican program we \nare giving the Governor, at his own whim, the ability to eliminate all \nthe teacher enhancement programs.\n  We are not there. Democrats are not there. We believe in having a \nstrong emphasis in our program, a $2 billion program, that recognizes \nhigh quality recruitment, mentoring, and professional development.\n  Just on page 630, there is the treatment of the eligible programs, \nthose which can be block granted. Here we have subparts 1, 2, and 3 of \npart (A) of title II, that is teacher empowerment. That is true on page \n656, which is the 15-State block grant.\n  Why do we have this debate on a Monday afternoon? We say OK, we will \naccept it. If we are going to eventually pass S. 2, it will not be in \neffect in any event. So let's get on to other issues.\n  This is what has bothered many of us during the course of this whole \ndebate. There is this fundamental commitment of our Republican friends \nto block grant these programs and issue a blank check for these \nprograms. But, on the other hand, they say that they are really serious \nabout these programs.\n  How can we accept the fact that they are serious about putting a \nwell-qualified teacher in every classroom when they give an opportunity \nto the Governors to wipe out that entire program? We do not do that. We \nsay it is essential, as part of the program to which we are committed, \nthat you are going to have an effective program in recruiting and also \nin professional development.\n  Let's take another look at page 632 under the block grant program. We \ncall it the blank check--block grant program. On page 632 it says:\n\n       (d) Uses of funds under agreement.--Funds made available to \n     a State under this part shall be used for educational \n     purposes . . .\n\n  Educational purposes. Do my colleagues know what qualifies for \neducational purposes? State administrators and their offices. That \nqualifies for State educational purposes.\n  We have heard a great deal of rhetoric about how they want to get the \nmoney where it ought to be, with needy students, and, under their own \ndefinitions, they say it can be used for any educational purpose. It \ncan be used by local administrators for their needs, it can be used for \nsports facilities, it can be used for band uniforms, because States \nspend their educational money for those purposes.\n  What the Republicans say is that they can use the money we are going \nto provide to them on whatever the States want to use it. The States \nuse it for band uniforms. They use it for administrative funds. They \nuse it for State departments of education. Not our program, but theirs \ndoes.\n  On the one hand, we have an amendment to the TOPS Program that \neffectively can be wiped out by the Governors and the block grant, and \nthen we look at how they define what are educational purposes under \nthis legislation. They create a loophole for the Governors to drive a \ntruck through. The Governors will make those decisions, not the local \neducators. It is not going to be the parents. It is not going to be the \nlocal school boards. It is the Governors.\n  One asks: Why, Senator, is it the Governors? Because the Governors \nare the only ones who, at the end of 5 years, are held accountable. \nThey are the ones held accountable. All they need is to have \nsubstantial compliance, and then they can reapply for 5 more years. If \nthis goes on--and I do not believe it will because I do not think they \nare going to get the results under this program.\n  I want to take a few minutes of the Senate's time to come back to why \nwe feel so strongly about targeting these programs. I am going to speak \nabout the importance of recruitment and professional development and \nthe importance of mentoring.\n  As I have said at other times during this debate, we are committed to \nhaving a well-qualified teacher in every classroom in this country by \nthe time this legislation has expired.\n  What is happening at the present time? This is the most recent report \nfrom 1999, using statistics from 1994. We see that about two-thirds of \nindividuals who went into teaching had a regular or advanced license. \n``No license,'' ``substandard license,'' or ``probationary license'' \nare terms used by the States to describe those who have not met \ncertification. They use them interchangeably for the most part. \nBasically, a third have not met the rigorous standards. We are setting \nrigorous standards to make sure we have good teachers.\n\n[[Page S3582]]\n\n  Let's see what is happening. This legislation was developed to meet \nthe challenges of the neediest students in the country. We know \napproximately 25 percent of the teachers do not have competency in the \nsubject matter or in training skills. Let's see where those teachers \nare going and what students they are teaching.\n  Let's look at ``by income.'' Where are these unqualified teachers \nteaching? 4.4 percent are in low-income communities, and 17.6 percent \nare in communities with more than 50 percent poverty. As this chart \nshows, they are not teaching in the wealthy suburbs of this country. \nThey are not teaching where there are middle-income and high-income \nfamilies in this country. They are teaching basically the lower-income \nstudents in this country. This is the very group on which this program \nand the ESEA is supposed to focus. That is what this whole program is \nabout. That is why in 1965 we had a national concern about the poorest \nof the poor children in our country, and we decided to focus attention \non their needs.\n\n  Now, when we are talking about one aspect of education, and that is \nthe quality of our teachers, we are finding in excess of 17 percent are \nteaching low-income students. If we take this by race, this column \nshows in schools with 1 to 10 percent minority students, 3.2 percent of \nthese unqualified teachers are teaching in those areas which have the \nwealthier schools. Again, 17 percent are teaching in schools with a \nhigher percentage of minority students.\n  This clearly indicates that if we are going to provide the funds, \nlet's try to make some difference. When we give it to the Governors--\nthe Governors are the ones who are giving these numbers to us now. They \nare the ones responsible for this. They have 93 cents out of every \ndollar. We are saying that we want to have better qualified teachers.\n  Let's look at this next chart. This is another way of looking at the \nteachers in this country. This is the better prepared and the poorly \nprepared. This is alternative certification program, B.A., and summer \ntraining. Designated in red, of those who enter training, 80 percent \nwent into teaching, and about a third remained after 3 years.\n  Seventy percent went into teaching with a 4-year program, B.A., and a \nmajor in a subject field or in education. They are better trained, 70 \npercent; 53 percent remain after 3 years.\n  The 5-year program: They get a B.A. and a major in a subject and \nmaster's in education. Of the 90 percent who went in after 3 years, 84 \npercent stayed. What does this say? If we develop the teachers \nprofessionally in their competency and skills and additional \ncertification, they will remain in teaching.\n  And they will make a difference to the underserved in our \ncommunities. That is what these charts are all about. This is another \nfeature, the mentoring.\n  The three provisions are professional development, recruitment, and \nmentoring. When you have mentors for new teachers, they stay in the \nprofession. This chart shows the percentage of teachers who leave the \nprofession after the first 3 years without mentoring, which is 23 \npercent; but with mentors, it is 7 percent. Teachers will stay in \nteaching when they have mentors. Those teachers who have better \nopportunities for continuing their education will remain in teaching.\n  We know how to help retain teachers. We can ask ourselves: What does \nall this mean in terms of academic achievement? This is from the \nTeacher Quality and Student Achievement, of December 1999:\n\n       Increasingly, the States that repeatedly lead the Nation in \n     mathematics and reading achievement have among the Nation's \n     most highly qualified teachers and have made the longstanding \n     investment in the quality of teaching. Top scoring States--\n     Minnesota, North Dakota, and Iowa; recently joined by \n     Wisconsin, Maine, and Montana--all have rigorous standards \n     for teaching that include requiring the extensive study of \n     education plus a major in the field to be taught. Case \n     studies of States that undertook the most comprehensive \n     teaching policy initiatives during the 1980s, especially \n     Connecticut, North Carolina, and other States, such as \n     Arkansas, Kentucky, and West Virginia, that pursued \n     comprehensive reform initiatives in which teacher quality \n     figured prominently showed evidence of steep gains in student \n     performance.\n\n  We are not doing this as an academic exercise. We are trying to say \nwhat works for children. What is happening now can make a difference in \nterms of children:\n\n       There have been steep gains in student performance from the \n     early to mid-1990s for those States that have given a high \n     priority to recruitment, mentoring, and professional \n     development.\n\n  Listen to this. The study continues:\n\n       By contrast, States, such as Georgia and South Carolina, \n     where reform initiatives across a comparable period focused \n     on curriculum and testing, but where they invested less in \n     teacher learning, showed less success in raising student \n     achievement within this timeframe.\n\n  Can we not learn, in terms of using scarce resources, what works and \nwhat does not work? This is only one aspect. This is one aspect of our \neffort here on the floor of the Senate.\n  We know what works, based upon the kinds of reports and evaluations \nthat have been done.\n  Here is the study: ``What Matters Most: Teaching for America's \nFuture, report of the National Commission on Teaching & America's \nFuture. This was done by Republicans and Democrats alike. What do they \npoint out in this area? They say:\n\n       Some problems, however, are national in scope and require \n     special attention: There is no coordinated system for helping \n     colleges decide how many teachers in which fields should be \n     prepared or where they will be needed. Neither is there \n     regular support of the kind long provided in medicine to \n     recruit teachers for high-need fields and locations. Critical \n     areas like mathematics and science have long had shortages of \n     qualified teachers that were only temporarily solved by \n     federal recruitment incentives during the post-Sputnik years. \n     Currently, more than 40% of math teachers and 40% of science \n     teachers are not fully qualified for their assignments.\n\n  Since the successful recruitment programs of the 1970s ended (Teacher \nCorps), only a few States have created support in the form of \nscholarships or loans to prepare teachers for high-need areas and \nfields. In addition, investing once again in the targeted recruitment \nand preparation of teachers for high-need fields and location is a \nnational need.\n  That is just with regard to the recruitment. They say it is a \nnational need, a national responsibility.\n\n  On the issue of mentoring:\n\n       The weight of accumulated evidence clearly shows that \n     traditional sink-or-swim induction contributes to high \n     attrition and to lower levels of teacher effectiveness.\n\n  That is just what the chart showed.\n  Further:\n\n       The kinds of supervised internships or residencies \n     regularly provided for new entrants in other professions--\n     architects, psychologists, nurses, doctors, engineers--are \n     rare in teaching, but they have proven to be quite effective \n     where they do exist. Beginning teachers who receive mentoring \n     focus on student learning much sooner; they become more \n     effective as teachers because they are learning from guided \n     practice rather than trial-and-error; and they leave teaching \n     at much lower rates.\n\n  Then it continues:\n\n       Although some states have created programs for new teacher \n     induction, few have maintained the commitment required. With \n     a few exceptions, initiatives during the 1980s focused on \n     evaluation and failed to fund mentoring. Others provided \n     mentoring that reached only a few eligible teachers or \n     withered as funds evaporated. Again, the problem is not that \n     we don't know how to support beginning teachers; it is that \n     we have not yet developed the commitment to do so routinely.\n\n  This isn't only Democrats who are saying this. This is the most \ncomprehensive report on how to get high-quality teachers, mentoring \nprograms, professional development, and what it means in terms of \nacademic achievement. That is what we stand for.\n  Further, on the issues of professional development, let me mention \nthis:\n\n       (Pg. 41) Most U.S. teachers have almost no regular time to \n     consult together or learn about new teaching strategies, \n     unlike their peers in many European and Asian countries.\n\n  Remember all the debate we heard last week about: Look what is \nhappening in these European countries. Look what is happening there. \nOne of the things they are doing in many of the European countries, \nwhere teachers have substantial time to plan and study with one \nanother--\n\n       In Germany, Japan, and China, for example, teachers spend \n     between 15 and 20 hours per week working with colleagues on \n     developing curriculum, counseling students, and pursuing \n     their own learning. . . .\n       The result is a rich environment for continuous learning \n     about teaching and the needs of students.\n       Instead of these ongoing learning opportunities, U.S. \n     teachers get a few brief workshops offering packaged \n     prescriptions from\n\n[[Page S3583]]\n\n     outside consultants on ``in-service days'' that contribute \n     little to deepening their subject knowledge or teaching \n     skills.\n\n  We challenge our Republican colleagues to point out in their bill \nwhere they are going to do these kinds of things and meet these kinds \nof challenges that have been outlined for our students. We ask them: \nWhere is it? It is nonexistent. It just isn't there. I will show you \nwhy it isn't there.\n\n  Let us compare the various provisions under our amendment to S. 2.\n  This is where we say: Well, let's see where your program is. Let's \ntake the issue of professional development and mentoring.\n  The allocation of funds goes to States by formula based on 60 percent \npoverty and 40 percent population. At the State level, funds go to \ndistricts by formula based on 80 percent poverty and 20 percent \npopulation. Funds are targeted and focused on the neediest areas. We \nguarantee funds for these two purposes.\n  In terms of recruitment, we provide that 30 percent of the State's \nallocation shall be used by the State agency to provide grants to \nrecruitment partnerships under the sections that we have for \nrecruitment activities. We guarantee funds in terms of the recruitment.\n  Pass this bill, and it is $2 billion for high quality professional \ndevelopment, mentoring, and recruitment. We are guaranteeing the funds \nfor these activities. We spell it out in the bill.\n  They haven't done it yet in their bill. And they can't do it because \nit is just not there.\n  When it comes to the professional development, under the basic \nRepublican bill, they say it doesn't guarantee substantial funds for \nprofessional development. They say a portion of the funds can be used. \nThis could be as little as one dollar. It is an allowable use for \nprofessional development. It is an allowable use in terms of mentoring. \nIt is an allowable use in terms of recruitment. There is no guarantee \nof any funds for these two activities. Also, there are no assurances to \nparents that they are going to have qualified teachers in the \nclassroom.\n  On our side, we say if you are going to end up on the back end of \nthis legislation with results, you have to invest in quality in the \nfront end. You have to set criteria at the beginning of this \nlegislation about what you are going to do in these particular areas.\n  That is what we have done because that is what is overwhelmingly \ncalled for.\n  Our amendment also guarantees that teachers are going to be prepared \nto teach children with disabilities along with other students with \nspecial needs. We have accountability not only at the State level in \nterms of teachers but also for every class at the local level.\n  Our amendment says if you do not make progress in student achievement \nafter 3 years, you cannot continue in terms of the funds.\n  There is a dramatic contrast in the two different proposals on issues \nwhich are so incredibly important in terms of the children of this \ncountry.\n  We have tried in other areas as well: Afterschool programs, \nconstruction programs, accountability programs, and parental \ninvolvement.\n  Also, we have tried to find out the importance of those particular \nprograms and what their impact has been on children to advance their \nacademic achievement, accomplishment, enhance their sense of self-\nconfidence, and advance their interests in learning. These are all \nextremely important. We have tried to include those various programs in \nthe legislation we have advanced. We believe this is a much more \nvaluable way of proceeding than just giving a blank check to the \nGovernors.\n  How can we in good conscience vote for legislation that is going to \nsend the money back to the States when the States are absolutely \nfailing to do their job today?\n  We hear: Well, we want something different. We want something that is \nnew. We want something revolutionary. We want something that will sound \nlike it is something completely different from the past.\n\n  We are saying we have tried revenue sharing and block grants in the \npast. That is what we had from 1956 to 1969, and it didn't work. The \nstudies and statistics demonstrate that it didn't work. But this is a \nvery different approach. We didn't have the technology concepts and \nlegislation 6 or 10 years ago. We have a new effort in the way we are \ngoing to use that technology, ways that will reduce the division in \nterms of the digital divide. Years ago, we didn't understand the \nimportance of well-qualified teachers and the relationship between \nwell-qualified teachers and the academic achievement of students. But, \nwe have the statistics, the information, and the studies now, and we \nwant to do something to make a difference.\n  We didn't really have afterschool programs years ago, because quite \nfrankly, children went home, and more often than not, one of their \nparents was home working with the child and helping and assisting the \nchild with their homework. That is entirely different today. We didn't \nknow the importance of trying to develop afterschool programs. When you \nlook at the demand for those afterschool programs in communities across \nthe country, we know the importance and significance of giving help and \nassistance to those children with afterschool programs, which means \nthey are going to continue to make progress academically in these \nafterschool programs. That is enormously important.\n  These are matters which are enormously important. They are tried and \ntested. They are different from where we were before. But there is \ncompelling evidence that these kinds of efforts result in enhanced \nacademic achievement and accomplishment.\n  The alternative just baffles me. I have been listening and have been \non the floor for just about the whole time through: Monday of last week \nand during the brief time on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. We \ncontinue to hear that we are having a lot of trouble with children in \nunderserved and disadvantaged areas, and what we have tried in the past \ndoesn't work. Therefore, we have to try something else. What is \n``something else''? What is ``something new''? Block grants. They call \nthat something new? That is an old word for revenue sharing. That has \nbeen a discarded and discredited program. If the Governors want to do \nall these things, there is no reason they cannot do them.\n\n  Debating merit pay. They said let's have merit pay. Well, the \nGovernors can do that if they want to. If they don't want to, they \ndon't. We are waiting to hear from any State that wants to develop the \nmerit pay program for individual teachers rather than doing it on a \nschoolwide basis, which, as Governor Riley learned, is the way to go. \nGovernors can go ahead and do it.\n  As we spelled out last week, different Governors made statements that \nthey were committed to trying to do something about underserved \nschools. They made those commitments over a long period of time. There \nare notable exceptions, and I mentioned those States earlier today. \nThey are Republican and Democrat Governors.\n  In the Governors' Association report of 1986, ``Time for Results,'' \nthe task force was chaired by Governors Alexander, Riley, Clinton, and \nKeene. Intervene in low-performing schools and school districts and \ntake over or close down academically bankrupt school districts--they \nurged the Governor to do that in 1986.\n  By 1997, there were nine States that moved ahead. In 1998, the \nsupport for the State focused on schools reiterating a position first \ntaken in 1988 by the National Governors Policy. They say States should \nhave the responsibility for enforcing accountability, including \nestablishing clear penalties in cases of sustained failure to improve \nstudent performance. By the year 2000, we will have 20 States providing \nassistance to low-performing schools.\n  Some have not done it. Some Governors have not shaped up. Some have, \nand those Governors ought to be commended.\n  If we go at this rate from 1986 to the year 2000, from 9 States to \n20, it will take 50 more years to get these programs active in the \nlocal community. Who wants to wait?\n  If you were able to demonstrate you had 10 States out of 50 with \nGovernors who had turned that around, you would have some legitimacy on \nthe floor of the Senate in desiring to try it in the other 40. But we \nhaven't seen it.\n  Our Republican friends want to give them another chance to take all \nof this money and use it in the capitals of their States, use it for \neducational purposes which include bureaucracies, and\n\n[[Page S3584]]\n\npermit them to use it for a wide range of different activities outside \nof the needs of underserved children. It is absolutely wrong.\n  I will discuss another offensive part of this legislation. That is \nthe provision that eliminates our national commitment to help and \nassist the three categories of children which are the most vulnerable \nin our society: The homeless, migrant children, and immigrant children.\n  The immigrant children come from families impacted by federal \nimmigration law and will eventually be eligible to become American \ncitizens. Nonetheless, they have some very special needs. By and large, \nthe States have never paid any attention to them.\n  We have the homeless children. As recently as 1987, the Center for \nLaw and Education sent out a questionnaire regarding the State \npractices and policies for homeless students to the chief State \nofficials in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. The majority \nof the respondents had no statewide data on the number of homeless \nchildren in their jurisdictions or whether those children were able to \nobtain an education. The majority of States had no uniform plan for \nensuring homeless students receive an education.\n  I asked over the weekend, outside of Federal funds, what are the \nStates doing for homeless children. We have been unable to get any \nindication from any State. Madam President, there were 625,000 homeless \nchildren in 1997 and 1998, and only 231,000 of those children were \ngetting some additional help and assistance for educational services.\n  I hope our friends on the other side will tell us the things States \nare doing for homeless kids at the present time. I think we will wait a \nlong time. They have not done it in the past, and they are not doing it \ntoday. That is true with regard to the migrant children, 718,000 \nchildren. They live in poverty, and only 40 percent have completed \neighth grade. The instance of sickness among these children--not only \nphysical, but also in terms of mental needs--is overwhelming.\n  We are saying we will not continue that program as we know it. We are \ngoing to send the money targeted for that program back to the States. \nThe reason we created the program is because States were not doing \nanything for those students.\n  We have had 4 days of debate on this bill. I hope the other side will \ntell us--if not tonight, then tomorrow--what all the States are doing \nwith regard to homeless children. We are not taking care of these \nchildren in the way we should, even with the funds being provided under \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We are still reaching \nperhaps half of those children who need help and assistance. Is any \nperson going to tell us, Senator, when we send these funds back to the \nStates, the Governor will look out after the homeless children, the \nmigrant children, and the immigrant children? Can any person \ndemonstrate any history where the States have been willing to do it?\n  That is our challenge. We want to hear it. We have not been able to \nfind that. To block grant all of these funds, send them back to the \nStates, and say they will be able to deal with them, rather than at \nleast have coordinated programs that help track the children as they \nmove down from Florida, through Georgia, through the Carolinas, some \nall the way into New England and the west coast--they have worked with \ndifferent communities knowing when the crops change--try to coordinate \nthis.\n  There has been a positive response from some of the States to work in \na coordinated way. We have had some leadership from the Department of \nEducation. Why are going to leave that out? That does not make sense.\n  I hope when the time comes, there will be an acceptance of the Gregg \namendment and then we will look forward to having a good discussion on \nsome of the other matters as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I have really enjoyed listening to my \ncolleague from Massachusetts. He seems to think the only answer to \neducation, public education in this country, happens to be the Federal \nGovernment. Of course, those of us who really have watched it and \nobserved it over all these years realize that is not the answer.\n  The Federal Government spent, over the last 30 years, I guess, $120 \nbillion. And in almost every category in title I, poor kids do a lot \nworse. We had over 700 Federal programs--over 700--300 of them just in \nthe Department of Education alone. Yet we still have the same age old \narguments that the Federal Government is the last answer to everything \nand really parents and families just don't know what to do for their \nkids.\n  I know there is a legitimate feeling on the part of those on the left \nthat that is true, but there is more than a legitimate feeling on the \npart of us on the right who know that that is not true and literally \nthe Federal Government is not the last answer. My good friends talks \nabout block grants just being another name for revenue sharing--no, \nblock grants are a way of letting the State and local people take care \nof their educational processes and to find out how and then to use the \nmoney in the best interests of the State and local educational \nprocesses. It is a pretty pivotal, basic Federalist principle, it seems \nto me.\n  I rise today to talk about the education bill pending before the \nSenate today. S. 2, the Educational Opportunities Act, if enacted would \nmake a number of improvements to education. This bill that is on the \nfloor would really help education. S. 2 allows up to 15 states to shake \noff federal restrictions in exchange for increased accountability. It \nallows eligible parents to choose the provider of Title I services for \ntheir children.\n  This bill also gives parents the right to move their children out of \nschools that are failing them.\n  Why would we not want to do this? why would we not want to allow \nparents more control over the education of their children? I am \nsincerely baffled as to why this bill has attracted such opposition--I \ncannot believe that my colleagues are more interested in protecting \nbureaucracy instead of supporting teachers and students. Why should my \ncolleagues be more concerned with filling out forms than in getting \nneeded funds into classrooms?\n  I commend the Chairman and the hard working members of the HELP \nCommittee. This is one of the most difficult committees to chair and to \nwork on. I should know. I think the committee has put together a \ncommon-sense piece of legislation that, while not as sweeping as some \nwould prefer, moves us along in the right direction. I would like the \nopportunity to vote for this bill.\n  I listened with interest to the comments of my fellow Utahn, Senator \nBennett last week. I thought he made some excellent points, especially \nabout the voluntary nature of some of more controversial elements of \nthe bill. These really are very modest reforms, and this Congress and \nthis President should move ahead with them.\n  It may come as a shock to some here in the Emerald City, but the \nFederal Government did not invent the public schools. Education in our \ncountry is never going to get better if we do not stop spinning our \nwheels here in Washington and start supporting the innovative reforms \nbeing implemented at state and local levels.\n  There is a role for the Federal Government, but it is a supportive \none. And, many of those supportive programs are being reauthorized in \nthis bill.\n  Today, however, I would like to speak about my amendment to the Title \nI funding formula for economically and educationally disadvantaged \nauthorized in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--ESEA.\n  Before I get into that, though, I would like to note the Federal \nGovernment pays about 7 percent of the cost of education. Yet it \nrequires 50 percent of the paperwork. That is the equivalent of 267,500 \nfull-time teachers. We could go a long way towards solving some of the \nteacher problems in this country if we would get off the kick that the \nFederal Government is the last resort to everything. I think the \nFederal Government muddles in education where it should not. And many \nof the things it has done have not been fruitful or beneficial, even \nthough I admit that the Federal Government can have a supportive role, \nif it is truly supportive and not destructive.\n\n[[Page S3585]]\n\n  My amendment would make the Education Finance Incentive Grant \nProgram, EFIG, a permanent statutory factor in the allocation of \nresources in the Title I formula. The EFIG program is currently \nauthorized as a separate part of the Title I formula, which has never \nbeen funded. I believe that including it as a permanent factor in the \nTitle I formula has merit. The Education Finance Incentive Grant \nProgram distributes resources to states based on two important factors: \neffort and equity.\n  The effort factor measures a State's own fiscal commitment to \neducation. The equity factor is determined by a state's commitment to \nequitably distributing resources among its school districts. Unlike \ndemographic factors, both effort and equity can be controlled to a \nsubstantial degree by states as a matter of policy.\n  The equity factor is a crucial element of the EFIG program. It \nmeasures the ``coefficient of variation'' of funding among a state's \nschool district; i.e., the equity factor measures how well a state \nendeavors to even out education assistance between districts which have \nhigh property tax revenues and those which do not.\n  Let me reiterate my support and appreciation for the hard work done \nby the HELP Committee on this bill, which I support. But, I wish the \nCommittee had looked a little harder at the Title I formula. S. 2, as \nreported, does not change the fundamental problem of using State-per-\npupil-expenditure as a proxy for determining a state's financial \ncommitment to education.\n  What this expenditure proxy does is place a higher value on a child \nwho lives in a rich State than it places on a child from a poor state, \nwhich cannot spend a large amount. If a State can afford to spend more \nmoney per-pupil, it gets more money from the Federal Government. If a \nState has less capacity and cannot spend as much per-pupil, it gets \nless money under Title I. This seems backwards to me.\n  Second, use of per-pupil spending as the sole proxy for a State's \ncommitment to education ignores other important factors--such as tax \neffort. Thus ``effort'' is also a component of the EFIG formula, which \nmy amendment would finally incorporate into the Title I formula.\n  In my home State of Utah, education consistently ranks as one of the \nhighest priorities for Utahns. During this year's session of the Utah \nlegislature, Utah reaffirmed its commitment to improving education, \nreducing class size, and increasing salaries for teachers.\n  Utah takes its commitment to education funding very seriously. During \nthe 1995-96 school year, education expenditures in Utah amounted to $92 \nper $1000 of personal income. The national average was $62 per $1000. \nIn other words, Utah's education expenditure relative to total personal \nincome is 50 percent more than the national average. It is the third \nhighest in the nation.\n  In terms of education expenditures as a percent of total direct State \nand local government expenditures, Utah ranks 2nd in the Nation. Utah's \nexpenditure for education was 41.5 percent of the total amount spent \nfor government. The national average is 33.5 percent.\n  No one can tell me that Utahns are not serious about funding \neducation. And these efforts have garnered results. Utah's scores on \nACT tests are equal to or better than the National average in English, \nmath, reading and science. Utah ranks 1st in the nation in Advanced \nPlacement tests taken and passed.\n  Still, even with these efforts, Utah remains 1st in the Nation in \nterms of class size and last in per-pupil expenditure. This is due to \nUtah's unique demographic. Utah families are, on average, larger than \nany other state. Utah has the highest birth rate in the Nation.\n  But I am realist. While I would like to completely eliminate per-\npupil expenditure from the Title I formula, I understand that this is \nnot going to happen.\n  However, I do believe it is appropriate and very sound policy to \ninclude in the Title I formula a small measure of diversity, that is, \nother ways of measuring a state's commitment to education--namely, \neffort and equity.\n  Including the EFIG program as a permanent factor in the allocation of \nTitle I makes sense from this perspective.\n  Equity in education financing is receiving considerable attention \nboth in the media and in the courts. States are being compelled by the \ncourts to equalize resources. Most experts agree that the courts are \ntending towards equalization. To the extent reluctant states are having \nto equalize education funding to comply with court decisions, my \namendment provides these States with some measure of relief because \ngreater equity will increase their allocations under Title I. David \nGoodman in ``Mother Jones'' noted:\n\n       Since 1971, when the California Supreme Court declared in \n     Serrano v. Priest that using property taxes to finance public \n     education was a violation of the state constitution's equal \n     protection clause, all but six states have been sued over \n     educational equity. To date, school financing systems in 19 \n     states have been deemed unconstitutional, and the courts have \n     ordered these states to restructure their systems to improve \n     the quality of education for all.\n       The implication is clear: School funding and student \n     performance are believed to be directly and inextricably \n     linked and wide variances in school funding are thought to \n     both promote and maintain inequality of educational \n     opportunity.\n\n  Indeed, some States are increasingly compelled to demonstrate that \nnot only are they equalizing resources, but are providing an equal \nquality of education to all students.\n  I understand that these initiatives are causing some community \nconcerns. I know that the distinguished Chairman of the HELP committee \nis all too aware of the controversies associated with the legal ruling \nin his home State of Vermont. However, the increasing reliance on \nresolving these issues through the courts and the fact that the courts \nare tending to favor equalization as a means of mitigating educational \ndisparities lead me to conclude that legally requiring States to \nequalize resources among districts will continue to be a strategy \nemployed by those concerned about education equity.\n  I also conclude that it is an appropriate use of federal resources to \nprovide incentives for states to implement equalization programs as \nwell as to assist those implementing court-ordered policies.\n  Resource equity has been identified as an effective strategy to \naccelerate education reform, which was the theme of the 2000 education \nconference sponsored by the Aspen Institute. Included in the \nrapporteur's summary was the following:\n\n       In the effort to raise the achievement of all American \n     students, an extremely serious barrier is the huge \n     disparities in resources for education across districts and \n     states, It is not unusual for the per-student expenditure to \n     be three times greater in affluent districts than in poorer \n     districts of the same state. Although qualified, effective \n     teachers and principals are key to student achievement--even \n     more so for at-risk students--districts where salaries are \n     low continually lose teachers and principals to districts \n     that are able to pay more.\n       . . . Equally important is crafting finance equalization \n     strategies, such as allowing federal funds to go only to \n     those states that demonstrate equitable and adequate state \n     education funding.\n\n  A Rand report summarized that,\n\n       A . . . promising strategy would offer federal incentives \n     to states to equalize spending among their own districts. A \n     crude form of incentive would make a state's eligibility for \n     Chapter 1 funds contingent on a certain degree of \n     interdistrict fiscal equality.\n\n  The Rand report concludes, however, that\n\n       Potentially the most effective incentive-based approach \n     would build rewards for intrastate equalization into a new \n     program of general-purpose federal education aid to the \n     states. The size of each state's general grant would depend \n     on one of more indicators of school finance equity.''\n\n  This amendment that I will offer later in this debate is consistent \nwith the Rand report recommendation.\n  Let me make it clear that my amendment does not call for equalization \namong States. In essence, that is what Title I itself is supposed to \ndo--assist States and local education agencies to fund low-income \ndistricts and schools. My amendment is not even mandatory on the \nstates. Those states who wish to retain their current within-state \ndistribution plans, assuming the court has not compelled them to change \nthose plans, may do so.\n  I am not asserting the equalization of resources among \nschool districts is the answer to every education dilemma faced in our \ncounty. Indeed, like most\n\n[[Page S3586]]\n\nreform efforts, the data on its effectiveness are contradictory.\n\n  Moreover, I have always been a firm believer that states and school \ndistricts must be able to adopt school policies--including school \nreforms--that work for them. Whether or not we happen to like a \nparticular reform idea here at the national level should not matter. We \nshould not be drawn into the ``reform du jour'' mentality. Just because \nsomething is the latest idea flowing from academia doesn't mean it will \nwork for the Granite School District or any of the 41 local districts \nin my State or any other school district.\n  Equalization is not a silver bullet, and I am not claiming that it \nis. It is a very small modification. But, when equalization is combined \nwith other education reform efforts, such as in Texas, there is \nimprovement in education. The following from the National Journal \nilluminates the success Texas has had when the equalization of \nresources became the catalyst for other systemic education reforms.\n\n       Poor districts received substantially increased funds, but \n     no one in Texas got a lot of money for education, especially \n     compared with states such as New Jersey and Connecticut.\n       . . . Texas officials say the additional funds were crucial \n     for low-income schools. ``If you went to poor communities \n     that are doing well, they will point to programs they've \n     implemented, issues they've addressed, that they would not \n     have been able to address without the funding that's become \n     available to them in recent years,'' said Joseph Johnson, \n     director of the Collaborative for School Improvement at the \n     Charles A. Dana Center at the University of Texas (Austin) . \n     . . The crucial difference, he maintains, is focus, \n     especially on the ``academic success of every student and \n     making sure resources in those schools are very clearly, \n     deliberately focused on instruction.'' The moral of this \n     story: Money matters--but only if schools make it work for \n     them.\n\n  I believe that an equalization factor is consistent with the intent \nof this Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization to \nassist students at risk. I believe that the unequal distribution of \nresources among school districts disproportionately affects poor and \nminority students. A strong equalization factor will provide an \nincentive for States to address this.\n  A report prepared by the Policy Information Center of the Educational \nTesting Service, titled The State of Inequality, concludes that:\n\n       Thus, it can be established with national data that \n     educational resources are unevenly distributed. It is also \n     clear that, on average, students in poorer areas are likely \n     to have fewer educational resources than those in wealthy \n     areas. There are also wide variations in the effectiveness of \n     schooling, after differences in socioeconomic status are \n     considered.\n\n  Further studies have also determined that high poverty and minority \nstudents have fewer opportunities to take ``critical gatekeeping'' \ncourses in math and the hard sciences, thus preventing access to \ninstitutions of higher learning.\n  A report prepared for the House Committee on Education and Labor, \ntitled, Shortchanging Children: The Impact of Fiscal Inequity on the \nEducation of Students At Risk found that, ``Inequitable systems of \nschool finance inflict disproportionate harm on minority and \neconomically disadvantaged students.''\n  Additionally, as I have discussed, the EFIG program has been modified \nto include a poverty factor in the effort portion of this formula.\n  This continues to be a pressing issue. I was particularly moved by a \nrecent article I read in the Charleston, South Carolina, Post and \nCourier, that highlights once again, the glaring disparities between \nwhat poor children can except from schools and what rich children can \nexpect from school.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       [From the Charleston (SC) Post and Courier, Jan. 9, 2000]\n\n         Lack of Resources Hampers Students in Poorer Districts\n\n                             (By Sybil Fix)\n\n       Every morning, as the sun rises above the fields, students \n     in Marion County School District 3 journey to Centenary to \n     attend Terrells Bay School.\n       There, they could hope to find what other students in South \n     Carolina have--experienced teachers, a rich array of classes \n     and a chance for a good education. In their part of the \n     world, where 85 percent of the students are on free lunch and \n     few make it to college, that could change lives. But students \n     in Marion 3 will get something less. At Terrells Bay, \n     students learn physics, statistics, anatomy and biology via \n     interactive television because the district can't afford to \n     hire teachers for those subjects.\n       They study Spanish via television, too, and that is their \n     only foreign language choice.\n       They have no teacher for math above Algebra II. They have \n     no choir, no performing arts, no visual arts. They have no \n     debate team, no clubs of any kind. Boys can choose only \n     between basketball and football. The school has a successful \n     girls basketball program.\n       They have a tiny library, with stained ceilings and half \n     empty shelves, and bathrooms barely fit for use.\n       Principal Al Bradley gives thanks for a nucleus of good \n     teachers he says save the school.\n       But his is a constant struggle to make do.\n       ``The reality is that given the facilities and the money \n     and the programs, we cannot provide an education that is \n     equal in quality to what they get in Irmo or other schools,'' \n     said Bradley, 36, a soft-spoken man whose office looks like a \n     refurbished cubbyhole.\n       Outside, stray dogs wander between humble houses and \n     rundown shacks surrounding the red brick, flat-roofed \n     building a stone's throw from the town off S.C. Highway 41. \n     Cows and mowed fields are steps away and continue for miles.\n       Bradley's two sons attend Terrells Bay.\n       ``There is no way they are getting an equal education \n     here,'' he says, shaking his head. ``It seems to make no \n     sense. How do you explain it?''\n       In district after district across the state, educators face \n     the constraints of a school system that fixes haves and have-\n     nots in a pattern of inequity.\n       It is not only that less is spent on educating children \n     who, mostly poor and mostly black, live in poor school \n     districts. It is also that less is spent on addressing the \n     greater educational needs of children in concentrations of \n     poverty in districts with scant local revenues.\n       Poor districts have less to spend on teachers, materials, \n     building maintenance and capital projects.\n       Their academic programs lag behind; they have fewer and \n     less-experienced teachers; their schools are old and \n     decrepit; and most often, their performance is lower.\n       While per pupil expenditure doesn't tell the whole story, \n     few seem to believe that the spending levels in South \n     Carolina's poorest school districts can ensure an adequate \n     education.\n       ``My kids deserve the opportunity to consider Harvard, Yale \n     or Duke just like everyone else,'' said John Kirby, \n     superintendent of the Dillon 3 School District. ``But we are \n     like a poor country family. We have the good morals, we love \n     our children and we want the best for our children, but we \n     can only take them so far and they deserve so much more.''\n       He shrugs.\n       ``All of us here in South Carolina were invited to the \n     Kentucky Derby, but some of us were given thoroughbreds and \n     some of us were given mules. We might all get to the end . . \n     . but some of us might be cleaning up the track.''\n\n\n                         Inequity in the making\n\n       The inequities in South Carolina's school system were cast \n     with the birth of the state's free schools in the early \n     1800s.\n       ``A lot of the difficulties from the beginning are ones \n     that occurred throughout the South and throughout the United \n     States,'' said Dr. Craig Kridell, curator of the Museum of \n     Education at the University of South Carolina and a professor \n     of history of education.\n       Efforts were made to place a free school in each county, \n     but in rural areas the schools were too distant for many to \n     attend. Because they were labeled pauper schools, many \n     shunned them. And many of the families they targeted \n     preferred to keep their children at home to work.\n       The state provided money for free schools, but local need \n     wasn't considered. There were great differences in competence \n     among teachers and among local school commissioners, Kridell \n     said.\n       ``The History of South Carolina Schools,'' published in \n     part by the Department of Education, quotes governors and \n     superintendents throughout the 1800s remarking on the \n     scarcity of efforts made to educate the middle--and poorer--\n     classes, particularly in rural areas.\n       By the mid-1800s, when it became clear that funding schools \n     was too costly, the state shifted most of the burden to the \n     counties, through local property taxes.\n       The state did guarantee a minimum amount of state funds per \n     pupil per district, but the funds often were withheld, \n     Kridell said, and local funds were not shared equally between \n     black and white schools.\n       By 1900, education superintendent John McMahan reported to \n     the Legislature that ``each county supports its own schools \n     with practically no help from the state. Each district has as \n     poor schools as its people will tolerate, and in some \n     districts anything will be tolerated.''\n       At that time, school attendance was not mandatory, and \n     nearly 75 percent of children never went beyond fifth grade.\n       In the early 1950s, under Gov. James Byrnes and facing the \n     threat of integration, the state passed its first sales tax \n     to try to equalize conditions among school districts--\n     generating $100 million to build 200 black schools and 70 \n     white schools.\n       The number of official school districts, some without \n     schools, went from more than\n\n[[Page S3587]]\n\n     1,700 to 109--now 86--and a new bus system offered \n     transportation to black students for the first time.\n       But the quality of education was inconsistent, and teacher \n     quality was abysmal, Kridell said.\n       Between 1940 and 1970, because of the sales tax and \n     increases in federal Title I funding for disadvantaged \n     children, school funds went from $178 million to more than \n     $300 million.\n       But the gap between tax-poor and tax-rich districts \n     remained.\n\n\n                           Efforts to change\n\n       In 1977, under the leadership of Gov. James Edwards, South \n     Carolina passed the Education Finance Act, specifically to \n     address underfunding of schools in rural and black areas.\n       The law guaranteed a base amount for a minimum education \n     per student, and required that the state allocate a certain \n     portion of funds based on children's needs and the districts' \n     ability to raise local revenues.\n       The districts with the least property wealth and the \n     highest number of at-risk children were to receive more \n     money.\n       And they do.\n       The effort pumped $100 million into the school system over \n     the next five years. In 1983, an audit praised it for \n     bringing more equity to the system.\n       But a 1989 audit concluded that the money allocated for the \n     minimum education per student wasn't enough. Entire \n     categories of funding--transportation and teacher benefits, \n     for example--were exempt from equity formulas.\n       The poorest districts had 35 percent of the wealth of the \n     richer districts. To compensate fully for the difference, the \n     state would have had to give an average 39 percent increase \n     in funding to the poorer districts and a 33 percent decrease \n     in funding to the richer districts.\n       Passage under the leadership of Gov. Dick Riley of the \n     Education Improvement Act in 1984 provided an additional $217 \n     million to the schools, primarily aimed at increasing student \n     performance. The law called for stiffer graduation \n     requirements, teacher evaluations and salary increases, \n     grants for good schools and for gifted and talented students.\n       But the quality-based act included no equity formula, and \n     through the years it gave much more money to the better-\n     performing, wealthier districts, state data shows.\n       ``While poorer districts receive more total state funds per \n     pupil than wealthier districts, state funding does not fully \n     compensate for wealth disparity,'' the audit concluded. \n     ``There is less assurance that students from poor districts \n     are receiving comparable educational programs to those in \n     wealthy districts.''\n\n\n                              Funding now\n\n       The local ability to raise taxes still drives education \n     funding, and it is the prime source of inequity.\n       Operating expenditures per pupil vary from $8,062 to $4,769 \n     across the state. The amount per district is mostly \n     determined by the local tax rate plus the state allocation.\n       On average, the state pays about 52 percent of the cost per \n     district and the federal government about 8 percent. The \n     districts are expected to come up with the rest, said John \n     Cooley, the Department of Education's director of budget in \n     the Office of Governmental Affairs.\n       The problem is that many districts can't raise the \n     remaining 40 percent, and the state doesn't make up the \n     difference.\n       About 55 percent of all state school funding--or about $1.3 \n     billion--is distributed according to some consideration of \n     equity, Cooley said.\n       But here, as in most states, said Georgia State University \n     school finance expert Ross Rubenstein, there is no \n     consideration of simple poverty.\n       Education improvement money, which accounts for about a \n     fourth of all state education funding, is distributed without \n     any consideration of a district's finances.\n       In addition, revenue-hungry districts often have to compete \n     with wealthy districts to receive state grants for \n     necessities such as computers and software and computer \n     training for teachers. While priority sometimes is given to \n     poorer districts, wealthy districts often receive the same \n     amount.\n       Funds raised locally, meanwhile, are vastly different.\n       Districts with high assessed property values can collect \n     more money with low tax rates--and spend more money on \n     schools--than can school districts with low assessed property \n     values.\n       The value of the mill--the unit of taxation--ranges from \n     less than $10,000 in Clarendon 3 and Marion 3 and 4 to $1 \n     million in larger counties such as Greenville and Charleston. \n     Charleston has a legislatively imposed cap on the amount of \n     tax dollars that can be raised for schools.\n       Over the years, development in the wealthier districts has \n     brought in higher tax revenue than equity funding formulas \n     have been able to compensate for, Cooley said.\n       State data show that, over the past 10 years, the increase \n     in total revenue per student for the poorer districts is \n     barely comparable to and in some cases lower than the \n     increases in revenue per student for the richer districts.\n       For example, Spartanburg 7 school district has seen a \n     $3,082 per pupil revenue increase since 1988, while the \n     districts in Dillon, Marion and Clarendon counties have seen \n     increases ranging from $2,000 to $2,500.\n       While Lee County school district receives $3,469 more per \n     pupil from the state than the York 2 school district, York 2 \n     still receives more in local taxes per pupil--$4,426. In \n     total per pupil revenue, York 2 comes out ahead by $1,291.\n       What difference can $1,291 make per pupil?\n       In Lee, that amounts to $4.5 million that the district \n     could spend on everything from music and art rooms to science \n     labs and lighting, said superintendent Bill Townes.\n       ``Four and a half million would not address all of our \n     needs in this district, but it would go a long way,'' he \n     said.\n\n\n                             Teacher saints\n\n       In the evening, when the sun sets below the fields of \n     Orangeburg County, teachers at Elloree Elementary School wrap \n     up classroom activities and pack up their cars to take their \n     students home.\n       Were it not for the teachers, the students couldn't stay at \n     school to play, to work on reading, to get extra attention.\n       In countless poor schools around the state, from Memminger \n     Elementary School in downtown Charleston to Anderson Primary \n     School in Kingstree, teachers spend an inordinate amount of \n     their time and money to make up for what school systems don't \n     fund and what home lives don't offer.\n       ``You have to put forth a lot of effort to provide \n     experiences that they would otherwise not get,'' said Debora \n     Brunson, principal of Elloree Elementary School, which sits \n     on a sun-beaten field at the northeasternmost corner of \n     Orangeburg County.\n       Teachers in poorer districts have double duty, said Holly \n     Hill-Roberts High School Principal Patricia Lott.\n       ``You are supposed to teach them what you are supposed to \n     teach them at that particular time of their lives, and make \n     up for what they are not bringing with them when they come to \n     you.''\n       Schools in wealthy areas can rely on fees, fundraisers and \n     donations.\n       In poor districts, stories abound of teachers who spend \n     their earnings to buy children materials, clothes, food.\n       Yet teachers in those districts are paid much less than \n     those who teach less needy populations of students.\n       ``You find schools with the greatest needs, children with \n     the greatest needs and staff with the greatest needs all \n     together,'' Brunson said. ``What does a poor school do?''\n       Dillon 3 spends 69 percent of what is spent in Spartanburg \n     7 on instruction per student--$2,779 to $4,029.\n       The beginning teacher there makes $21,925. Teachers in \n     Horry County make $10,000 a year more because local money \n     covers hiring bonuses, Kirby said.\n       This year, for the first time, Kirby can offer an $1,000 \n     incentive to teachers with perfect attendance. But the \n     average contracted salary for longtime teachers there remains \n     at $30,858, compared to $36,816 in Lexington 5. Marion 3 \n     ranks last with $27,848.\n       The Dillon 3 district has cut all teacher aides except for \n     special education and kindergarten. So teachers are even more \n     burdened.\n       If, under those circumstances, teachers are actually good \n     at what they do, said University of New Hampshire sociology \n     professor Cynthia Duncan, ``they are missionaries. We should \n     not require people who teach in bad circumstances to be \n     saints.''\n       Attracting experienced teachers to poor and poor-performing \n     rural areas is nearly impossible. Marion 3 and other such \n     districts become training grounds for young, inexperienced \n     teachers who commute long distances.\n       Who wants to live there, asks Everett Dean, superintendent \n     of Marion 3, opening his palms to the countryside outside his \n     window.\n       ``People with master's degrees from prestigious \n     universities have the luxury of going to teach at really good \n     schools, and the kids who most need them are least likely to \n     have high quality teachers,'' said urban education professor \n     Gloria Ladson-Billings of the University of Wisconsin.\n       Ladson-Billings said children in poor schools are five \n     times as likely to have teachers who are not certified in \n     math and science--subjects that might help them break free \n     from lives of low expectations.\n       Terrells Bay School, which has abysmal student performance, \n     is allowed to use uncertified teachers because it is \n     considered a critical needs school that can't attract \n     teachers.\n\n\n                           Academic programs\n\n       In Marion 3, students who want to take anatomy sit in a \n     small room cramped with old equipment and stare at a \n     television screen.\n       There are simply not enough interested students to justify \n     offering certain courses, says Dean. Even if they had the \n     students, the district doesn't pay enough to attract teachers \n     for advanced courses.\n       Students who most need interactive classroom work get \n     distance learning. And students who wouldn't otherwise be \n     exposed to foreign cultures are offered only Spanish while \n     students in Lexington and Spartanburg, in addition to French \n     and Spanish, can study Japanese.\n       Dillon 3 has only two advanced placement courses. There is \n     no dance, no theater, no performing choir.\n       ``We have great singers and talented students here,'' Kirby \n     said. ``But I can't provide an environment where they can use \n     their skills.''\n       While his students perform at average level, ``I feel like \n     we are still handicapping\n\n[[Page S3588]]\n\n     them. The differences show up in the real world. They simply \n     don't have the same opportunities,'' Kirby said.\n       At nearby Rains-Centenary Elementary School in Marion 3, \n     there is no performing arts program, no arts or music \n     program, said Principal Linda Bell.\n       ``We don't have enough books. We are nowhere near where we \n     need to be,'' she said.\n       Patty Schaffer, principal of North Charleston's Ron McNair \n     Elementary School, another school with a high ratio of \n     students living in poverty, points out inequities in the \n     availability of arts and music teachers.\n       Her school has a music teacher and an arts teacher only two \n     days a week.\n       ``It is a huge equity issue,'' she said. ``We know that \n     this population should have more exposure to art and music \n     and it shows on the tests, but we give more art and music to \n     children who have piano lessons at home. We need to look at \n     what children already have, and that should drive the horse \n     as to what we give them.''\n       Because of the inequities in the system, those who have to \n     rely on schools for all their learning are at a huge \n     disadvantage, said University of Wisconsin literacy scholar \n     James Paul Gee.\n       ``Upper middle class families give their children \n     tremendous social and cultural and educational capital \n     outside of school, and many families are able to buy more and \n     more outside of school,'' he said.\n\n\n                            The social work\n\n       In a small room at Latta Middle School, six profoundly \n     mentally disabled students amble around, one practicing \n     walking steps, another wandering in circles, another sitting \n     idly.\n       Down the hallway, between the middle school and the high \n     school, there are four classes of learning disabled children.\n       Kirby calls it a disproportionate number of special needs \n     children--nearly 15 percent of his school population.\n       ``Our health problems are off the chart,'' Kirby said. \n     School districts with high concentrations of poverty and high \n     births to teens face the fallout of poor health services, \n     prenatal care and nutrition.\n       While they receive some federal and state funding for \n     special education, often it's not enough.\n       ``I have some students that cost me $20,000 a year to \n     educate,'' Kirby said.\n       ``When you are in a poor small rural district, often you \n     are the richest agency,'' he said. ``They see us as the hub \n     for services and they bring their needs to us.''\n       To care for them, the Latta school system has one social \n     worker per school and two shared mental health counselors. \n     Other schools have comparable numbers of people but fewer \n     students in need.\n       Ron McNair has 13 mentally disabled students and a full \n     class of emotionally disabled ones. Because of low pay, the \n     school is unable to attract a teacher for them. So they are \n     taught by non-certified substitutes with no training.\n       ``To put students who a regular teacher cannot handle in a \n     class with a non-certified teacher . . . it is a real \n     disservice to the child,'' Schaffer said.\n       North Charleston Elementary School has a comparable number \n     of students in special programs, said Principal Bill Hayes.\n       ``Most people have no idea of what we deal with these days. \n     We dispense enough medicine at lunchtime from this school to \n     run a drug store,'' Hayes said.\n\n\n                               Buildings\n\n       Dean takes a visitor around the Rains-Centenary Elementary \n     School, seeming almost ashamed.\n       ``I could tell you some facilities horror stories,'' he \n     said.\n       This year his district spent $494 in facilities per \n     student. But the buildings have not been renovated since \n     their construction in the 1930s and the 1950s. The need is \n     much greater than the spending.\n       ``The fact that we are educating our students in an old \n     dilapidated building affects everyone, even the recruitment \n     of teachers,'' said Bradley. ``It's a negative feeling when \n     you walk into a restroom and the commodes are 40 years old.''\n       For the first time in decades, South Carolina this year \n     begins distribution of $750 million in bonds for school \n     construction and renovation. The money is distributed among \n     districts based on need, on the number of students--with more \n     money going to children with greater educational needs--and \n     on past effort made to upkeep buildings. It also has an \n     equity component, and it appears that poorer districts will \n     receive more than wealthier ones.\n       But it is unclear if that will make up for the inequities \n     in conditions.\n       Marion 3 this year spent 71 percent of what was spent on \n     facilities per pupil in York 2. It spent $3 per pupil on \n     capital projects. Terrells Bay spent $70; Latta High, $24.\n       By contrast, Clover High School in York spent $2,270 per \n     student on capital projects last year.\n       Clover High has 17 empty classrooms for growth, a state-of-\n     the art library, a new 2,500-seat gym, a new cafeteria with \n     heated outside areas, a security system with 64 cameras, a \n     $7.5 million auditorium, and a lab for every science teacher, \n     said Principal Wayne Flowers.\n       To attract good teachers, in addition to considerably \n     higher salaries, Clover High offers an early childhood day-\n     care program for employees.\n       Clover High is in a district that receives high local tax \n     revenues--nearly $5,400 per student a year.\n       Not so in Dillon 3, with local revenues at $1,037 per \n     pupil.\n       Latta Middle and Latta High schools share the library, gym \n     and cafeteria. The library triples as a computer lab and a \n     tech prep construction site of sorts, and is cluttered with \n     piles of old books.\n       The cafeteria is bare, the hallways dismal. The window \n     treatments are yellowing and warped.\n       ``We have a lot of makeshift here,'' Kirby said, showing a \n     visitor an arts lab with tables from the old cafeteria.\n\n\n                              Stepchildren\n\n       When Dean gathers with other educators to talk about the \n     schools, he sometimes feels like an ugly stepchild.\n       ``You are not sure that people understand that you can't \n     change some of the things that are not providing \n     opportunities for our children.\n       ``Money alone does not solve the problem,'' Dean said, \n     ``but when you can't employ the best teachers because of your \n     location and your low salaries, yes, that is going to impact \n     the quality of the education you can offer.''\n       Since 40 of the state's school districts filed suit seeking \n     equitable funding, the General Assembly has been trying to be \n     more sensitive to wealth differences, Cooley said.\n       But South Carolina continues to contend with its history.\n       ``It has not been real important that all children be \n     educated. While it is changing slowly,'' Dean said, ``we are \n     still dealing with the economics of a system of the past. \n     Particularly when it comes to race, we have not understood \n     that it benefits everyone to be better educated.''\n\n  Mr. HATCH. The purpose of title I is to give educationally and \neconomically disadvantaged students additional assistance: teachers, \ntextbooks, and additional education resources. These resources were \nnever intended to comprise the entirety of aid to an educationally or \neconomically disadvantaged student.\n  Unless there is an equity factor used in their distribution so that \npoorer districts within a state can be brought closer to even, those \ntitle I funds that are provided will merely be a thin coat of paint \ncovering up the cracks. The layering of resources where resources are \nalready inadequate will not meet the needs of disadvantaged children. \nTitle I was meant to provide additional resources, not to compensate \nfor an inadequate financial commitment to poorer LEAs on the part of \nStates.\n  By directing resources to states where this is not the case, we are \nbeing true to the underlying intent of title I.\n  Indeed, as the following excerpts from the debate over the final \nconference report reveal, the addition of the effort and equity factor \nin the title I formula it was the reason why many Members of the Senate \nmay have voted for the conference report. However, title I funds have \nyet to be distributed using this factor.\n  I refer my colleagues to excerpts from the debate over the conference \nreport to ESEA and ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Appendix II\n\n       Mr. Grassley . . .  I am also concerned, Mr. President, \n     with the chapter one formula that came out of the conference \n     committee. I supported the Senate language added by Senator \n     Hatch, which removed the restrictions on the equity bonus. \n     Under the change made by Senator Hatch's language, each State \n     received the full benefit of its equalization effort.\n       Under the Hatch chapter one formula which passed the \n     Senate, 38 States would have received increased chapter one \n     allocations. Iowa would have received $2.5 million more than \n     the original formula in S. 1513.\n       Unfortunately, according to the Congressional Research \n     Service, Iowa is among 31 States to lose funds from 1996 to \n     1999 under this conference passed formula. Iowa loses almost \n     $10 million in funds from 1996 to 1999. The big winners under \n     the formula changes are New York, California, Texas, and \n     Illinois.\n       Mr. Harkin. Mr. President, as a member of the Labor and \n     Education Committee and also as chair of the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee that appropriates money for the \n     Department of Education, including title I, I would like to \n     correct the record. I have the greatest respect and \n     friendship for my colleague from Iowa. However, sitting here \n     listening to his remarks and comments, I certainly wish the \n     Senator, my colleague, had talked to me before he made those \n     comments. Maybe I would not have to stand up to correct them. \n     Because, frankly, what my colleague just said simply does not \n     comport with the facts.\n       The chart that Senator Coats sent out this morning, and \n     used this morning, it is like that old saying: In the Bible \n     it says `There is no God.' It says that in the Bible.\n       But the sentence before it says, `The fool hath said in his \n     heart, There is no God.'\n\n[[Page S3589]]\n\n       So, if you take things out of context you can prove the \n     Bible says `There is no God.' That is what Senator Coats did \n     this morning.\n       Senator Coats sent this notice around to our offices this \n     morning, ``Urgent, Members Attention Only,'' and it says, \n     ``Senator Harkin: Reasons to Vote No on Elementary-Secondary \n     Act; Iowa Would Lose $9.95 a million.'' I assume that is \n     where my colleague got that figure.\n       Senator Coats is only telling half the story. He is sort of \n     saying it says, in the Bible, ``There is no God,'' but he \n     does not tell you what the sentence before it says.\n       I tried to get the floor this morning to correct it. We \n     were under a time agreement, the time ran out and I could not \n     get the floor. Fortunately, I was able to talk to Senators as \n     they came to the well to let them know that the figures that \n     Senator Coats was putting out were wrong.\n       Let me correct that record now. Iowa does not lose $10 \n     million. I happen to chair the Appropriations Committee that \n     funds the money. There is no way this would have gotten \n     through if my State was going to lose $10 million, I can tell \n     you that, Mr. President. No, what we did and what is not \n     being said here and what is not understood--and I say this to \n     my friend from Iowa, my colleague--there are two parts to \n     this formula on title I. There is the targeted grant formula. \n     That is what Senator Coats is using. If you only look at the \n     targeted grant money, yes, Iowa and a lot of other States \n     lose money. But what we added in conference was another \n     portion of the formula called effort and equity, something I \n     feel very strongly about. I debated it on the Senate floor. \n     So when we went to conference, in trying to strike a deal \n     with the House, they only wanted targeted grants, but I \n     insisted that we also have a second formula for effort and \n     equity, and that is what we did.\n       So under the bill itself, there is money that goes for \n     targeted or for effort and equity. New moneys that we will \n     appropriate can be split by the Appropriations Committee. \n     Some can go to targeted, some can go to effort and equity. \n     The Appropriations Subcommittees will decide. First of all, \n     next year we have already appropriated the money for fiscal \n     year 1995. That is already done. For fiscal year 1996, there \n     is a hold-harmless clause. So no States are going to lose \n     money in 1996, not Iowa nor any other State can lose money in \n     1996. So, again, Senator Coats used this from fiscal year \n     1996 to 1999. You cannot use 1996 because there is a hold-\n     harmless clause.\n       Beginning in fiscal year 1996, the Appropriations \n     Committee, under the authorization of this bill, is allowed \n     to use whatever new moneys we appropriate, up to $200 million \n     in 1996, for effort and equity. Beyond that, such sums as are \n     necessary.\n       Senator Coats used a figure from CRS of $400 million. I can \n     show you the record in conference. They were talking about \n     $400 million increases in title I. I said, I don't know what \n     you are talking about. The average over the last 5 years has \n     been $275,000, and under the budget caps and the ceilings we \n     have, there is no way over the next 5 or 6 years that we are \n     going to have a $400 million increase in title I. I would \n     like to see it. If you are asking me if we can get the money, \n     would I like to put $400 million in title I, absolutely; but \n     we are not going to have that kind of money.\n       So in title I then, assuming we can get a $200 million \n     increase, the Appropriations Committee can put all of it into \n     effort and equity, 75 percent of it into effort and equity, \n     half of it into effort and equity--whatever we want to do.\n       So what we did is we prepared a chart showing what would \n     happen to the States if just half of the money went into the \n     effort and equity or if all of it went into effort and \n     equity.\n       Under either one of those scenarios, Iowa, instead of \n     losing money, makes money. In fact, I do not have the runs \n     for anything other than $400 million, but even under $400 \n     million, Iowa would gain about $400,000 a year; and if we put \n     the whole thing into effort and equity, Iowa would gain about \n     $1.8 million a year.\n       Mr. Grassley. Will the Senator yield?\n       Mr. Harkin. I will be delighted to yield.\n       Mr. Grassley. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n       Mr. Harkin. I will be delighted to yield.\n       Mr. Grassley. Prior to the question, if I can just say, \n     first of all, I compliment the Senator because I know when it \n     came out of committee the first time, that he got the formula \n     that was in the original bill introduced improved \n     dramatically. So our State would be helped and probably a lot \n     of other States would be helped. So I compliment him on that.\n       I do not know anything about his activity in conference or \n     any other process, but I did notice his work in that area, \n     and he did improve it and I compliment him for it.\n       My question is only this: Senator Coats and I are both \n     relying upon the work of the Congressional Research Service. \n     I have not found the Congressional Research Service to be \n     wrong very often, if at all, that I can recall. Has my \n     colleague from Iowa discussed this with the people in the \n     Congressional Research Service to see if they made a mistake \n     and how they made a mistake? Can you tell me how they made a \n     mistake?\n       Mr. Harkin. I appreciate the question. I will try to \n     respond to it. The figures I am using come from the \n     Congressional Research Service. What I am saying is that \n     Senator Coats only took one column.\n       Mr. Grassley. I think I have that chart here.\n       Mr. Harkin. If you look at the chart, what he did was he \n     took the second column over, which just says $400 million \n     under targeted formula. Senator Coats used that column. He \n     did not take the other two columns. The other two columns add \n     effort and equity; the third column over showing what would \n     happen if we split it in half; the last column showing if we \n     put it all into effort and equity.\n       I cannot in any way tell my colleague how much we will put \n     in. I can assure him it will be a minimum of 50 percent. I \n     suggest, knowing the members of the Appropriations Committee \n     and that 33 States will be helped by effort and equity, it \n     stands to reason that the bulk of the money will go into \n     effort and equity. So I would say we are probably close to \n     the column on the right-hand side, which shows Iowa getting \n     $54 million.\n       Keep in mind, that is based on $400 million. There is no \n     way we are going to get $400 million, but it gives you an \n     idea of what happens under this thing.\n       So what Senator Coats did is he simply took out of context \n     what CRS came up with. He took one column, and that is why I \n     tried to get the floor this morning to explain that is not \n     so. That is just not the way the Appropriations Subcommittee \n     is going to operate, and that is why we put the effort and \n     equity thing in there.\n       In no way is Iowa going to have their moneys reduced under \n     this effort and equity formula. That is the point I tried to \n     make this morning and I tried to make it in the well to the \n     Senators. As I said about my Biblical example, about taking \n     something out of context, sure you can take one column, but \n     that is not what we are operating under.\n       I hope that clears it up. Does my colleague have any \n     further questions on that?\n       Mr. Grassley. I do not have any further questions, Mr. \n     President. I will say, I hope it clears it up because I would \n     like to think we are passing legislation that will be more \n     fair to more States than that original chart that I saw. But \n     I also suggest that I have been informed that Senator Coats \n     is going to come over and try to discuss what interests my \n     colleague from Iowa in some further depth, and I think I will \n     defer to his discussion of that.\n       Mr. Harkin. I will be glad to. I talked about this with \n     Senator Coats in private. I will discuss it with him on the \n     floor and have him respond as to what CRS put in the other \n     columns because he just used one column, he did not use the \n     other two.\n       Mr. Grassley. Mr. President, if my colleague wanted to make \n     the point that what we came back with from conference was not \n     quite as good for certain States, including my own, as was in \n     the bill passed by the Senate, he is absolutely right. But \n     the reality is that the House would not accept that. So we \n     had to work it out with the House, and I think we worked it \n     out in a reasonably fair manner, I must say.\n       The original formula that came out of the Clinton \n     administration, what they had advocated, was devastating for \n     Iowa and for a number of other States.\n       But we worked with Senator Pell, Senator Kennedy, Senator \n     Hatch, Senator Kassebaum and Senator Jeffords. We worked this \n     whole thing out in committee on a bipartisan basis to come up \n     with a better formula. We did that. We had votes on it. We \n     had debates. We even had a debate here on the Senate floor. \n     We had a vote. But in going to conference it was clear that \n     the House Members were not going to accept in totality what \n     we had done in the Senate. And thus we came up with this new \n     formula. And, quite frankly, I must say I think the new \n     formula is fair.\n       I just want to say the Congressional Research Service, \n     again, will do any run that Senators ask for. If you ask for \n     a run on $500 million a year, they will do that. You can do a \n     run on $1 billion a year. They will do that. But just because \n     these tables are prepared does not mean that is actually what \n     is going to happen. As I said, they ran these tables based \n     upon a $400-million-a-year increase in title I. As the \n     chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds this \n     program, I can tell you right now, unless somebody comes \n     up with some magic money someplace, we are not going to \n     have that kind of money. We will be lucky to get the \n     average of the $275 million that we have gotten over the \n     last 5 years.\n       So we tried to do two things with title I: target our \n     scarce resources to areas where they have a high \n     concentration of eligible children, but then also to be fair \n     to rural States such as Iowa where we may not have high \n     concentrations but we certainly do have needy children, \n     children in poverty, title I eligible children, but they may \n     be in small towns and communities scattered around the States \n     and thus the formula does address that.\n       Mr. Harkin. I thank the Chairman, and I commend him again \n     for his work on this important legislation, and in particular \n     this provision. The problems of youth violence and drug abuse \n     are no longer contained within urban school districts, and \n     are rapidly spreading to suburban and rural communities. By \n     making a program available for statewide distribution, we can \n     better ensure that each student in a State will be reached by \n     a program, and that students throughout the State will \n     receive the same messages.\n       I was extremely impressed by Jonathan Kozol's ``Savage \n     Inequalities,'' and I know the Senator from Utah has also \n     done considerable research on school equalization. Is it\n\n[[Page S3590]]\n\n     his view that the concept of equalizing resources among \n     school districts as public policy is supported by experts in \n     the field?\n       Mr. Hatch. The Senator from Iowa is correct. The literature \n     in the education field is loaded with recent articles \n     suggesting that equalization is an important means of \n     addressing inequalities. In a statement I gave on July 28, \n     1994, I outlined the reasons, which are supported by the \n     literature in the education field, why I support equalization \n     as a sound policy.\n       Mr. Harkin. Does the Senator from Utah therefore support \n     effort and equity as factors in determining the allocation of \n     title I money?\n       Mr. Hatch. Yes, I do, provided that it is not mandatory. If \n     effort and equity were factors driving education dollars, \n     states would be encouraged to take steps toward equity on \n     their own. Education is primarily a state and local \n     responsibility to begin with. The equity factor included in \n     this authorization, unlike the State per pupil expenditure--\n     which I believe is an extremely poor and terribly unfair \n     measure of effort--can benefit a State even if its needs are \n     great and its tax base is small. This is because an \n     equalization incentive is based not on how much a State has, \n     but on how it distributes what it has. I confess that in many \n     areas of public policy I do not favor such an approach. In \n     many areas, I believe this type of allocation destroys \n     incentives to work hard and to do more that contributes to \n     our economy overall.\n       But, education is a legitimate function of State and local \n     governments. We do not need to be concerned with hindering \n     private sector incentives. Educational equalization--based on \n     a plan developed by the State itself--should be encouraged.\n       Some of our colleagues have expressed concern regarding the \n     equity factor. Does the Senator from Iowa believe that the \n     equalization of resources within a State is inherently \n     consistent with the premise of the title I program?\n       Mr. Harkin. I would respond to the Senator from Utah that \n     yes, I believe the equalization of resources is consistent \n     with the premise of the title I program which is to give \n     disadvantaged students additional help by directing \n     supplemental resources to them. If federal resources are not \n     supplementary, then States have absolutely no incentive to \n     deal effectively with education financing problems in their \n     own States. The Federal Government should not subsidize this \n     kind of inaction.\n       Mr. Hatch. I agree with the distinguished Senator from \n     Iowa. Many States have recognized the need to more fairly \n     redistribute their resources. I am very proud that Utah has \n     been a leader in just about every aspect of education--\n     achievement, graduation rates, school finance. Utahans long \n     ago developed a workable plan for school equalization. It is \n     working in our State.\n       I believe the title I formula should reward real effort and \n     real progress toward serving every child in a State equally.\n       I obviously would have preferred that the effort and equity \n     provisions that were included as an integral part of the \n     Senate-passed title I formula. However, it was the final \n     decision of this conference to include these factors in the \n     title I formula but to include them as a separate \n     authorization that is, based on the Senate-passed version of \n     the bill. This, I believe, is a step in the right direction.\n       I hope that this will not be a hollow authorization, that \n     is, one with no money. While I do not want to put my \n     colleague from Iowa on the spot because I know he is as \n     committed to this idea as I am, I wonder if he would comment \n     on this last point? He is in a position of some influence on \n     that subcommittee.\n       Mr. Harkin. The Senator from Utah is correct. I share his \n     commitment to education finance reform and I favor the \n     establishment of this effort and equity incentive in title I \n     of ESEA.\n       The Senator from Utah mentioned that he was proud of the \n     efforts his State has made to equalize resources among \n     schools. The State of Iowa revamped its State aid formula to \n     equalize funding in the 1970's. I am equally proud of efforts \n     in my State to provide a quality education for all students.\n       I will do what I can as chairman of the Labor, Health, and \n     Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee to support this \n     new authorization.\n       Mr. Hatch. I thank my colleague from Iowa for his analysis \n     and support.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I am pleased to point out that 30 States, plus Puerto \nRico, would increase their title I allocations under my amendment \nrelative to their allocations under the formula in S. 2. A number of \nthese beneficiaries are States with high poverty districts.\n  Moreover, as my colleagues will note, my amendment holds states \nharmless for funds going out under the remaining title I part A \nformula. Additionally, my amendment allows school districts affected by \ncensus changes to retain 95 percent of their FY 98 funds.\n  One of my priorities in crafting this amendment was to improve title \nI while preventing huge shifts in the allocation amounts. Of those \nStates which would currently stand to lose under my amendment, only one \nstate loses 7 percent of their allocation, 4 States lose an average of \nabout 5 percent of their allocation, 7 States lose about 3 percent of \ntheir allocation and 8 States lose under 1.3 percent of their \nallocation.\n  I reiterate that I have worked to adjust my proposal so that it not \nonly captures the benefits of including effort and equity in the \nformula but also so that the minority of states who would currently \nlose under these factors would lose as little as possible.\n  Again, I hasten to add that States can change their own circumstances \nunder my amendment. If States wish to access more Federal title I \nmoney, they can take steps to increase their effort and their equity. \nMy amendment provides a degree of control for States.\n  States can, and many have already, adopted financing systems to \nequalize resources among districts. States have chosen a variety of \nequalization systems of their own design. A fair equalization factor \nwill promote ``bottom up'' education reform that will help all kids \nmake progress towards achieving the national goals.\n  Real education reform must take place at the grassroots level. A \nseries of edicts issued from Washington, D.C. is not going to improve \neducation for Americans. State and local education agencies must take \non this challenge. But, the Federal Government should help--and at \nleast not plant obstacles in the way which cannot be overcome.\n  The degree to which a State equalizes funding for education is a \nfactor that a State can control. A State that equalizes is a state that \nwill benefit under a this improved title I formula.\n  Also, equalization is a factor that can be quantified. So much of \nwhat the Congress is asking the State and local education agencies to \ndo requires a judgment based a series of qualitative analyses. An \nequalization factor does not rely on subjective determinations.\n  An equalization factor does not rely on mandates or guidelines for \nhow a State should achieve equalization. I, for one, would oppose a \nmeasure that specified how a state was to engage in equalization. On \nthe contrary, I believe States are perfectly capable of figuring this \nout for themselves.\n  S. 2 is a good bill. It was thoughtfully prepared, appropriately \namended, and now after many days, is being thoroughly debated. I think \nmy amendment improves this bill. I sincerely believe that this \namendment will help needy schools make important improvements in \neducation for all children. I urge the Senate to support my amendment. \nI thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before the Senator from Utah leaves the \nfloor, I thank him for his discussion of his amendment. I was listening \ncarefully to his discussion, and his focus on providing States \nincentives for moving toward equity and his focus on what Jonathan \nKozol calls savage inequalities and the tremendous disparity of \nresources, depending on the wealth of the community in which a child \nlives, is right on the mark.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah for his words.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I notice probably one of the wealthiest \nStates in the Union, Connecticut, gets more money per pupil than any \nother State, and it does not even need the money. What about these \nStates that do? I hate to call it a stupid formula because it is in an \neducation bill, but it is really a dumb, stupid formula, and it ought \nto be changed. I thank my colleague for his kind remarks.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for the purpose of a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Senator Kennedy wants to ask the Senator from Utah a \nquestion, and then I will regain the floor after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand it, the Senator from Utah said 48 \npercent of the paperwork done by teachers and principals is mandated by \nthe Federal Government.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. That is in the neighborhood. That is what \nI have been led to believe.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This was a 1990 study done by the Ohio General Assembly \nLegislative Office, Education Oversight of Public Schools reporting \nrequirements. That study attributed only 20 percent of paperwork \nrequirements to the\n\n[[Page S3591]]\n\nFederal Government. If the Senator will be good enough to put in the \nRecord the authority for that, I am going to put in the Record the \nauthority rebutting that, and we will let the Members look at it.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to do that, and also it may be more than \n50 percent. All I can say is, all I get is complaints from the State \nand local people that they are being overrun with paperwork that seems \nsilly and nonproductive.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think it is worthwhile to know the authority for these \nallegations. I think it is important. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Since part of the remarks by the Senator from Utah \ndealt with the equity question, I just want to add to the Record a \nquote from John Powell, who is director of the Institute on Race and \nPoverty in Minnesota:\n\n       When low-income children are segregated into schools that \n     are predominantly poor, the students confront not only their \n     own individual poverty, but the effects of concentrated \n     poverty on the school system itself. This combination often \n     results in more drop-outs and teenage pregnancies, lack of \n     parental involvement, inability to pay for books, lack of \n     role models, and inability to afford college.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Teachers and staff in racially segregated and high poverty \n     schools are too often overwhelmed by student needs.\n\n  Let me take my remarks in a couple of different directions.\n  I want to first talk about a meeting I had with the National Alliance \nof Black School Educators who were here last week. I had a chance to \ndrop by and not talk at them but talk with them.\n  Since the Senator from Utah was talking about the whole question of \nequity, or lack of equity, let me, right away, say to colleagues that I \nreally hope we go forward with this debate. Sometime later on in the \ndebate, I am going to come out on the floor and talk about it and have \nsome amendments speaking to this question. It is the question of the \nreliance on high-stakes testing--the single measurement of standardized \ntests to determine whether or not children go from third grade to \nfourth grade, from eighth grade to ninth grade, whether they graduate, \nwhat grouping they are in.\n  I just want to point something out since Senator Hatch talked about \nthis. We ought to make sure we meet the opportunity-to-learn standard \nif we are going to be implementing these tests. In other words, we had \nbetter make sure we do not hold children responsible for our failure to \nadequately invest in their achievement and in their future.\n  If we just focus on tests and then flunk students who do not pass the \ntests, and we do not do what we should do both at the Federal level \nand, I say to my colleague from Arkansas, the State and school district \nlevel combined, to get the resources so that each one of these children \nhas the same chance to pass these tests, and to succeed, then, frankly, \nI think reliance on these tests alone is punitive. So you need to do it \nboth ways. Yes, you need to have standards, but you also need to make \nsure every child has the same opportunity to meet those standards.\n  I will say one other thing about the tests. I will have an amendment \nthat says these tests ought to meet professional standards. We want to \nmake sure they are implemented in the right way. I will have an \namendment that says we need to take into account especially learning \ndisabilities, which I think is the law of the land. I think we ought to \nmake that clear in this bill. We ought to speak to those students who \nhave a limited proficiency in English as well.\n  More than anything, I want to talk a little bit about this \nopportunity-to-learn standard that I do not think we are meeting. I \nthink it is so key to the whole discussion. I think it is key to what \nJohn Powell has said. I think it is key to what other Senators have \nsaid as well. I think it is key, actually, to at least part of what the \nSenator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, was saying as well.\n  We are out here debating this bill, and we should. In a moment I am \nabout to, one more time, say where I think the Republican bill is \ndeeply flawed and why I am so disappointed in it. But for a moment I \nwould like to just talk about the budget implications.\n\n  I do not know whether we are spending 1 percent of the Federal \nbudget--someone can help me--or thereabouts on education altogether. \nDoes that sound right? Is it 1 percent of the overall Federal budget on \neducation? It is 2 percent.\n  I argue that key to our national security is whether or not we are \ngoing to adequately invest in the skills and character of the children. \nI argue that key to our national security is not so many more bombs and \nmissiles and more money spent on the Pentagon; the key to our national \nsecurity is the security of local communities. I think that is what \nmatters first and foremost.\n  The key to security for local communities is good housing, reducing \nviolence, and having decent health care. But I think most importantly, \nthe key to our national security is the security of local communities. \nAnd the security of local communities means we have a commitment to \neducation second to no other nation in the world so that every child--\nevery single child--is full of hope, and every child has dreams, and \nevery child can do well.\n  I tell you, I think 2 percent of the Federal budget spent on \neducation is pathetic. I know the Senator from Vermont agrees because \nhe has been one of the Senators who has been most vocal in saying we \nought to get our priorities straight and we ought to be allocating more \nresources.\n  We are going to debate how we allocate those resources to States and \nlocal school districts. That is the debate on this bill. I will speak \njust for a few minutes. I said to my colleague from Arkansas I would \nnot take more than 20 minutes altogether, and I will not.\n  But I think the larger question is, Why in the world are we not \nallocating more of our Federal budget to education? Why aren't we \ngetting more of the resources back to the school districts, whether it \nbe for the IDEA program, kids with special needs--boy, that would help \nour school districts--whether it be moving beyond just 30 percent \nfunding for title I; whether it be a real investment in affordable \nchild care, prekindergarten, so kids come to school ready to learn; \nwhether it be some money we can leverage. Senator Harkin has that \namendment that will enable school districts to have more funding to put \ninto rebuilding crumbling schools, you name it.\n  I am just amazed that with a booming economy and the country doing so \nwell economically, we in the Congress, in the Senate, cannot invest \nmore than 2 percent of our overall budget in our children's education. \nThey are 100 percent of our future. I do not know how in the world any \nSenator believes, on a tin cup budget, we are going to be able to make \nthe kind of investment we should be making. That is my first point.\n  My second point is--Senator Kennedy spoke about this. My guess is we \nwill get a different point of view from some other Senators in just a \nmoment--I think the fundamental flaw of S. 2 is the abandonment of a \ncommitment we made over 30 years ago as a nation that we would have \nsome basic national standards, some basic protection, to make sure the \npoorest children in this country, the most vulnerable children in this \ncountry, would be well served or at least would be served. We do not \nserve them well, but at least to make sure that for the homeless \nchildren and the migrant children there would be programs that would \nspeak to the needs and circumstances of their lives, that we would \ntarget title I money to the neediest and poorest and most vulnerable \nchildren.\n\n  Do you know what. I sometimes think Senators are taking this too \npersonally because it is not necessarily an attack on my State or an \nattack on the State of Arkansas or an attack on the State of Vermont; \nit is just a matter of philosophy.\n  Over three decades ago, we made a commitment that the Federal \nGovernment, representing the national community, with certain core \nvalues, would make sure we provide some programs that really speak to \nthe most vulnerable children, that we are not going to abandon those \nchildren.\n  I said it last week; I will say it one more time. My colleagues keep \ntalking about change, change, change. I do not think it is a great step \nforward. I think\n\n[[Page S3592]]\n\nit is a great leap backward. That is why many of us oppose it. That is \nwhy I think the President opposes it. That is why I think we have \nstarted out on the wrong foot.\n  Going further than that--and this will be the last part of what I \nwant to say; I will just divide it in two quick parts--one, I say to \nSenator Lott and others, I look forward to having a chance to bring \namendments out here. I want to have some amendments that speak to the \ndiscriminatory effect of the standardized testing. I want to have some \namendments that provide support for children who witness violence at \nhome and, therefore, cannot do well in school.\n  I want to have an amendment that provides for more counselors in our \nschools. In some ways, I cannot think of a more important amendment. \nRight now, we have a ratio of 1 counselor for every 1,000 students, or \nthereabouts, in the country.\n  I want to have an amendment that speaks directly to the challenges of \nurban education. Some of my colleagues have put back language that \ndeals with the special challenges of rural education, which I also \nthink is a real challenge, but I also want to put a focus on urban \neducation as well.\n  As someone who was a teacher at the college level--but, boy, I will \ntell you, I came to respect teaching at the high school and middle \nschool level; I think sometimes even more at the elementary level, and \nthe pre-K level even more so, as well--I am interested in anything and \neverything that leads to better teacher quality, with the proviso that \nwe understand there are many really fine teachers right now in the \ncountry.\n  I said this last week, but I will say it again, too.\n  I don't mind holding everybody accountable if we do it in the right \nway. But I also think that some of the people who bash public school \nteachers couldn't last an hour in the classrooms which they condemn. I \nthink we have to be very careful in how we do it.\n  The other thing I want to mention beyond my amendment is to say one \nmore time to other Senators that I think there are some amendments we \nhave introduced and we will be introducing that certainly speak to many \nof the meetings I have had with people in Minnesota.\n  I have been ready for this bill to come to the floor for almost 2 \nyears.\n  I think all together in our State of Minnesota--between myself and \nstaff--we had meetings with close to 100 different school districts. It \nis incredible. We have been all over the State. People were genuinely \nexcited about this bill. They know that most of the money for K through \n12 is at the State level. They know that. But people have been very \ninterested in how we can provide more incentives for more teachers. \nThey are very interested in the whole question of what we can do about \nthe needs of physical infrastructure. They are very interested in \ntrying to get more counselors in our schools. They are very interested \nin the sense of getting more young people interested in education. They \nare very interested in what we did do in prekindergarten. They think \nthat would make a huge difference. They are very interested in \nafterschool programs. They are very interested in reducing class size.\n  Frankly, the Republican bill on the floor speaks to very little of \nthat--not directly. It assumes with sort of a blank check that it will \nall happen.\n  I say to my colleagues in the majority that you have not invested \nnearly enough money in your budget, nor will it be in the \nappropriations bill. We have too many speeches given about the \nimportance of children, but we are not matching the rhetoric with the \nresources.\n  The second thing I say to my colleagues is in terms of how you \nallocate the money. I think it is not a big step forward. I think it is \na great leap backward from the kind of commitment we have made to all \nof the children in the country, including the most vulnerable children \nand the poorest children in this country.\n  Third, and finally, there should be some decisive priorities in this \nbill. I have tried to outline some of those priorities. I don't see it.\n  We will move forward this week, next week, and I hope the next week \nas well. Maybe in 2 more weeks we will have amendments, votes, and see \nwhere we wind up.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as we continue to debate the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, and the Educational \nOpportunities Act, there are fundamental fault lines and differences \nbetween the Democrats and the Republicans on this very critical and \nvery important issue for this country and for our children.\n  I noticed when Senator Wellstone spoke that he said the Republicans \njust keep saying change, change, change. I plead guilty to that. We are \nsaying change. That is one of the very clear lines in this debate \nbetween those who are defending the status quo--defending the old \nsystem, defending the old model, who are saying create more programs, \nwho are saying pour more money into the old programs and the same \nmodels--and those of us who say, yes, let's fund education adequately. \nYes, let's increase our appropriations for education. But let's make \ncertain that we are using that money efficiently and effectively. If \nthe old model isn't working, it is time that we try something new.\n  That is the fundamental fault line in the debate that has gone on in \nthe Senate for the last week and will continue for the next few days.\n  I have to say that I believe there has been a lot of misinformation \nabout the Educational Opportunities Act that has been put forth on the \nfloor of the Senate. I understand that change is difficult and change \nis discomforting. There are those who are going to recoil at the \nthought that we might try something different. But there have been, in \nthe arguments put forward by the other side, several themes that have \nrecurred.\n  They said title I has enhanced academic achievement. That has been \none of the things they have argued consistently.\n  They said the status quo somehow guarantees student achievement.\n  They said parental control is something to be feared.\n  They said the contents of the Educational Opportunities Act contain \nno accountability safeguards.\n  I would like to, in their own words, go through those arguments and \nrebut them one by one in the few minutes that I have on the floor.\n  First of all, Senator Kennedy made, I think, one of the clear \nstatements last week when he said, ``We want to support tried and \ntested programs that have worked.''\n  The question that I have raised over and over again is, How has title \nI worked? How has title I been so successful that we want to continue \nit as it has been, and as Senator Kennedy suggests we should continue \nit?\n  After 35 years and $120 billion has been expended, we have seen no \nclosing of the achievement gap.\n  The original purpose of title I was that we would see those \ndisadvantaged students improve, we would see their academic performance \nelevated, and we would see the gap between the advantaged and the \ndisadvantaged closed. After 35 years, any objective assessment of what \nwe have done would have to say we have failed.\n  That is why it is so amazing to me to hear my colleagues and friends \non the other side of the aisle stand and say: We want to support tried \nand tested programs that have worked.\n  If they had worked, this debate wouldn't be going on. We would be \ndelighted to be supporting the status quo. But the status quo has \nfailed America's children.\n\n  Instead of letting States have flexibility under\n\n[[Page S3593]]\n\nStraight A's, requiring improvements in student achievement, the \nDemocrats would rather leave disadvantaged children the same programs \nthey have had for the last 35 years.\n  Senator Kennedy speaks movingly, and I know sincerely, about the \nhomeless, the migrant children, and the immigrant children, saying that \nthey are the ones who are going to be hurt most under the Educational \nOpportunities Act--the homeless, the migrants, and the immigrant \nchildren are the big losers.\n  I would suggest just the opposite is the case; that they have been \nthe big losers in a system that continues to fund a broken system, a \nbroken program; that for the first time under Straight A's we will \nrequire test scores to be disaggregated and broken down on the basis of \nthose who are disadvantaged and those who are advantaged based upon \ntheir backgrounds and economic backgrounds so that we will be able to \nsee clearly whether or not the educational curriculum, the textbooks, \nand the programs being utilized in a local school district are working \nfor the least advantaged and the most vulnerable in our society. These \nhomeless children, migrants, and immigrant children, to whom all of our \nhearts go out, are the ones who have been left behind under the status \nquo.\n  Of course, Senator Kennedy said, ``We want to support tried and \ntested programs that have worked,'' even though 35 years of these \nprograms has demonstrated they have not worked.\n  He said that block grants--he always likes to use that loaded term, \n``block grants''--have no accountability.\n  And then he uses the term ``blank check.'' This is a ``blank check.''\n  I suggest that trying to compare the Educational Opportunities Act \nwith any of the old block grant experiments of the past is as if to \ncompare apples and oranges. It is a total mismatch. It is an unfair \ncomparison.\n  These are exactly and precisely, word for word, the same arguments we \nheard against welfare reform. Welfare reform was block grants with no \naccountability. Welfare reform was a blank check to the Governors: You \ncan't trust the Governors--the same rhetoric that we heard for the last \nweek.\n  If you compare block grants, the Educational Opportunities Act has \nmore accountability than any of the existing title I programs or any of \nthe existing Elementary and Secondary Education Act programs because we \nrequire the testing. We require the States to say what they are going \nto do and how they are going to do it and then demonstrate that they, \nin fact, have done it. That is what has been lacking under the existing \nprogram.\n  As Senator Kennedy said, ``We are not prepared, with the scarce \nresources here, to try to turn that over to the Governors one more time \nand expect they are going to do the job. No.''\n  I can't reach his volume level when he said, ``No.''\n  But he said, ``We are going to insist that there will be incentives \nand disincentives for performance. That is what we do.''\n  Throughout this debate we have heard, ``We don't trust the Governors. \nYou can't trust the Governors.''\n  I remind my distinguished colleagues that the same people who elected \nus to the Senate elected those Governors to serve the same people. They \nare every bit as accountable to their constituents as we are \naccountable to our constituents. Yet it has been a recurring theme: Do \nnot trust the State; Do not trust the Governors; They won't have the \nmost vulnerable in their States in their concerns and in the programs \nthat they put forward.\n\n  I reject that. Then he said, ``We are going to downsize.'' He said, \n``We are going to insist that there will be incentives and \ndisincentives for performance.''\n  Where in the Democratic proposal are there incentives and \ndisincentives? Their proposals are for new teachers and for school \nconstruction and contain no requirements that student achievement must \nincrease--none.\n  If we want to talk about incentives for performance, and if we want \nto talk about disincentives, look at what the Republicans have proposed \nin our Straight A's plan and in our performance contracts and \nagreements because in that you find real requirements concerning \nstudent achievements and student elevation in academic performance.\n  Then Senator Kennedy said, ``Under Straight A's, the State could \ndemonstrate statewide overall progress based on progress being made by \nwealthier communities, while a lack of progress in disadvantaged \ncommunities remains statistically hidden.''\n  The irony of that criticism of the Republican bill is that is what \ncan happen under the current system where the performance of the \ndisadvantaged is hidden by aggregating the scores and concealing those \nwho are supposed to be targeted--those children we are supposed to be \nhelping the most--concealing those in the overall scores.\n  I think this is a very misleading charge against the Republican \nproposal.\n  Straight A's requires each participating State and local school to \nreport data by each major racial and ethnic group, gender, English \nproficiency, status, migrant status, and by economically disadvantaged \nstudent as compared to students who are not economically disadvantaged.\n  That language in our bill prevents what Senator Kennedy expressed \nfrom ever taking place. In fact, we are going to know much more about \nwhether we are really helping the disadvantaged under the Straight A's \nproposal.\n  Then Senator Kennedy said this last week: ``We are still finding out \nthat of the more than 50,000 teachers who were hired this past year, \nthe majority of those serving in high-poverty areas are not fully \nqualified.''\n  I will accept Senator Kennedy's statement as being accurate. But it \nraises in my mind this question: Why then are Democrats proposing their \nClass Size Reduction Program if in fact it has led to the hiring of \nunqualified teachers?\n  The evidence is that as much as we would all like to see school class \nsizes reduced, and while that is a desirable goal, one of the \nunintended consequences in Class Size Reduction Programs around the \nNation has been that it has resulted in unqualified teachers filling \nslots that have been opened up, and those who have been harmed the most \nare those who are in schools with a high percentage of disadvantaged \nstudents. That is the tragedy of it. That is acknowledged by Senator \nKennedy's statement.\n\n  He has repeatedly said only 7 percent of the funds come from the \nFederal Government. Then he suggests, because it is a relatively small \nportion of the local school districts' funding base and their budget, \nwe cannot expect whatever we do up here will have too much of an impact \nupon local school policy.\n  If, in fact, our influence over local schools and the States were \nproportionate to our funding about 7 percent, I would not be too \nconcerned, either. The reality is, though, we provide only 7 percent of \nthe funding; we provide a much higher level of the mandates under which \nthe local schools are laboring. It has been estimated we provide 50 \npercent of the paperwork that is required of the local schoolteachers \nfor the 7 percent of funding.\n  To diminish the importance of the debate because it is only 7 percent \nof the funding misses the point. The State of Florida takes six times \nas many personnel to implement a Federal education dollar as it takes \nto implement a State education dollar. I suspect that figure is typical \nacross the Nation.\n  Senator Murray made this statement regarding the Abraham teacher \ntesting and merit pay amendment:\n\n       It requires testing, and there is no money. That money will \n     have to come from somewhere in the districts. The districts \n     will not have the money, and likely they will require the \n     teachers themselves to pay for it. That has been the practice \n     in the past.\n\n  First, the Abraham amendment only made teacher testing and merit pay \nan option. They are in no way required to implement it.\n  Speaking of unfunded mandates on the districts, what about the class \nsize reduction mandate? What happens at the end of that program? I have \nraised that concern. When the authorization for the Class Size \nReduction Program ends, don't the schools then have to pick up the tab \nfor a program that they did not start?\n  Senator Dodd made this comment last week about the Abraham teacher \ntesting merit pay amendment which added teacher testing and merit pay \nto the list of optional uses of funds. Senator Dodd said:\n\n       What works best is a decision that ought to be left to the \n     local communities. For the Senate to go on record to decide \n     what will work best in the 50 States is in direct \n     contradiction to the arguments I hear being made in support \n     of the underlying bill, and that is: We do not know what we \n     are doing here; we ought to leave this up to the local \n     governments. Now we are going to decide, apparently, that \n     teachers ought to get a pay increase rather than leaving that \n     decision to the local level. It seems they have it backwards. \n     Those decisions are best left at the local level.\n\n  It takes my breath away. Amazing. Since the Democrats' proposal for \nteachers mandates separate funding streams, they mandate separate \nfunding streams for professional development, alternative \ncertification, teacher\n\n[[Page S3594]]\n\nrecruitment, and mentoring, separate funding for all of those, school \ndistricts must do each of these or they don't get any of their funding. \nOur proposal only adds teacher testing and merit pay to a list of \nallowable uses of funds. It is absolutely consistent with our belief in \nlocal control. It is an option. If we ought to leave this up to the \nlocal government, as Senator Dodd says, then why does the Democratic \nproposal provide repeated mandates on how to spend the money?\n\n  Senator Kennedy also said in the debate last week in his continual \ntheme that the Republican bill lacks accountability:\n\n       We asked our good friends on the other side how their bill \n     is going to solve the issue of accountability. They cannot do \n     it. We have been challenging them since the beginning of the \n     debate. They cannot do it. We can.\n\n  I remind my colleagues of the one single example I left before the \nSenate that I think is illustrative of the problem and the current \nsystem and lack of accountability in the current system: Holly Grove. \nOr think in your mind's eye of the pictures of treadmills, Nautilus \nequipment, StairMasters, and $239,000 in a Federal grant that could not \nbe spent for computers, for textbooks, for renovating a falling down \nbuilding, a dilapidated school building, could not be spent in those \nways, but could be spent on expensive exercise equipment when what was \nneeded was improving the school facility.\n  Senator Kennedy would dare to say that the current system provides \naccountability. I suggest when we tell the Governors they have to sign \na contract with the Federal Department of Education to state what they \nare going to do, how they are going to do it, how they will accomplish \nit, when they will achieve it, require testing the students, require \nbreaking down the test scores and show how every subgroup is performing \nand whether, in fact, the gap is being closed, I suggest that is far \ngreater accountability than the current system of categorical \nagreements that can be misused and used in inappropriate ways.\n  Senator Kennedy said last week:\n\n       I hope our friends on the other side of the aisle are going \n     to spare us a lot of discussion about local control and \n     parental involvement because it just isn't there, it just \n     isn't there.\n\n  We are not going to spare you; we are going to continue to talk about \nlocal control. We will continue to talk about parental involvement. \nThat is the key to education in the country and the key to making \nsignificant and meaningful education reforms.\n  When Senator Kennedy says it just isn't there, first of all, there \nhave been a number of speakers, and I will allude to their statements \nlater, who acknowledged parental control is at the core of the \nRepublican bill. Aside from that, I simply point out two things. The \nportability provisions provide the ultimate in parental control. If \nparents are unhappy with the services the school is providing their \nchild with Federal money, they can use that Federal money to improve \ntheir child's education in the way they best see fit. That is very \nconsistent with parental control.\n  I also point out the provisional public school choice where a failing \nschool that has been deemed failing, failing and failing, given years \nof opportunity to improve and they still don't improve, there is an \nexit, a way out. No disadvantaged child ought to be locked to a failing \nschool and consigned forever throughout their educational experience to \na school that is failing them. They shouldn't be required to do that. \nWe show them a way out.\n  I quote Senator Murray from last week:\n\n       I am looking at language of the bill. It says . . . that a \n     parent directs that the services be provided through a \n     tutorial assistance provider. It is not directed by the \n     school but is directed by the parent. I think that is one of \n     the underlying flaws and concerns that we have . . . \n     frankly, the parent is in control.\n\n  I wish I had another chart showing Senator Kennedy saying that the \nparental involvement is not there. Senator Murray said, ``. . . \nfrankly, the parent is in control,'' under the Republican plan.\n  Senator Murray is right. That is not bad. That is not something to \nfear, the fact that we increase parental involvement. Since when did \nparental control become a bad thing? It is part of the problem, that \nparents have too few choices when their child is forced to remain in a \nfailing school.\n  I have heard repeatedly, and I am paraphrasing, but this has been the \nmessage from the other side: We don't trust the Governors; we don't \ntrust the local educators; we don't trust the parents. We just trust \nourselves. We can make the decisions. We are the 100 Members of Senate, \nthe super school board for America. Let us make the decisions; let us \nprescribe the formulas.\n  That is what we have done for 35 years. If we want to stick with that \nformula, that failed formula, then the status quo is the way to go on \nand the Democratic counterproposal is the way to go. I think America \nsays no. Our children deserve better, American families deserve better, \nand we can do better by American education under the Educational \nOpportunities Act.\n  I commend Senator Reid last week with one last quote from the other \nside of the aisle. Senator Reid, the assistant minority leader, said:\n\n       One of the things I have tried to do following the \n     direction of the minority leader, in consultation with the \n     majority leader, is to keep this debate on this education \n     bill on education. We have worked very hard to keep other \n     matters off this bill, Patient's Bill of Rights, prescription \n     drug and minimum wage.\n\n  I commend Senator Reid. I think that is the right approach. I am \npleased we went through the first week of this debate without having \nextraneous amendments, nongermane amendments. I hope that will continue \nto be the case as we go through this second week of the most important \ndebate we will have in the Senate during this Congress.\n  Rather than kill the pending education bill by offering irrelevant \namendments, I ask my colleagues to complete the work we have been so \nsuccessful debating for the past week. We have the chance to help \nmillions of American students overcome illiteracy, to cite U.S. \nhistory, to master basic mathematical skills. Let's do our jobs and not \nfail these kids. Let's not put politics above American education and \nstudent achievement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all pending \namendments be temporarily laid aside, and it be in order for Senator \nCollins to call up her amendment, re: Straight A's, which is filed, \namendment No. 3104.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be up to 10 minutes for \ndebate on the Collins amendment, to be equally divided in the usual \nform, and following the use or yielding back of time, the amendment be \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and the \nSenate resume the pending question, all without any intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3104\n\n (Purpose: To modify the list of eligible programs that may be subject \n                to a performance partnership agreement)\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3104, which is \npending at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3104.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 657, strike lines 6 through 8.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me express my very sincere \nappreciation to the chairman of the committee and the ranking minority \nmember for their cooperation in accommodating my amendment this \nevening. I am very grateful for their efforts.\n  My amendment is very straightforward. It simply removes the Perkins \nAct from the programs listed under the Straight A's proposal that is in \nthis legislation.\n  I am a strong supporter of the Straight A's approach, but the Perkins \nAct simply does not belong in Straight A's, and I believe it was \nprobably included as an oversight. There are three\n\n[[Page S3595]]\n\nreasons why the Perkins Act should be separated from Straight A's.\n  First of all, the Perkins Act, which funds vocational education, is \nsimply not part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It is \nnot part of the programs that we are reauthorizing. In Maine, and in \nmany other States, secondary vocational education is operated on a \nparallel, independent system. In Maine, there are even restrictions on \nthe ability of an academic high school to offer vocational education. \nMoreover, the Perkins Act and the ESEA have very different specific \nobjectives, and they are not easily merged together.\n  The second reason is the Perkins Act authorizes programs at both the \nsecondary and the postsecondary levels. Each State decides how to \nallocate its Perkins grant. In fact, 56 percent of Perkins funds go for \npostsecondary education, and in at least one State, all of the Perkins \nfunds are used for postsecondary education.\n  In my State, the funds are allocated equally to secondary and \npostsecondary education, with the requirement that vocational high \nschools and technical colleges allocate 30 percent of their funding to \ntraining programs operated by the Maine adult education system.\n  The third reason is the Perkins Act was written to be part of the \nnational workforce development efforts and is designed to coordinate it \nwith provisions of the Workforce Investment Act, which the Senate \nsuccessfully passed in 1998. If we pull out the Perkins Act funding, we \nwill allow the intentions of Congress in redesigning the Workforce \nInvestment Act to go forward.\n  In short, the Perkins Act does not belong in this legislation. It \nmakes sense for us to take out the Perkins Act from the list of \nprograms under Straight A's. It is not part of the ESEA, and as it is \nused, at least 56 percent of the funds under the Perkins Act do not go \nto secondary schools but, rather, to postsecondary schools.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking minority member for their \ncooperation in this effort and particularly for accommodating this \namendment this evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the good Senator from Maine and \nour chairman of the committee for urging the Senate to accept this \namendment. I join with her in making that recommendation.\n  In 1998, with the reauthorization of the Perkins Act, we made \nimprovements in the coordination of vocational education, adult \neducation and job training. We did this in a bipartisan way with \nSenator Jeffords and Senator DeWine. We took valuable lessons that we \nlearned from the school-to-work program, emphasizing the importance of \npartnerships between education and business.\n  Unfortunately, the school-to-work legislation is not being considered \nfor reauthorization. I hope that my colleague will work with me to make \nsure this important program finds a way to exist in ESEA.\n  What we have found is the importance of integrating academic skills \nwith state of the art career and technical skills. Every child should \ngraduate from high school with the academic credentials necessary to \ngive him or her a wide variety of career choices within a given \nindustry. Children should be able to choose to go on to post-secondary \neducation or directly enter the workforce, with a competitive edge. So \nthere have been, as she pointed out, very important and significant \nchanges in these vocational and professional schools. I think we are at \na place where they are offering great opportunities for young people in \nan economic climate of higher academic challenge and higher skill \nchallenge. I think the value of her amendment is it is going to \ncomplete the process rather than undermine it, which I think was one of \nthe principal dangers of having it as a block grant.\n  I thank the Senator. We in Massachusetts, as in Maine, as in other \nStates in New England, place a very high value on these training \nprograms and academic programs. They have been a lifeline to many of \nour communities and to our economy over a very long period of time. \nNothing is more dramatic of an example than the ability to channel our \ncareer and vocational education students directly into high skill, high \nwage jobs in industry. They are enormously important and they do good \nwork and their work will be enhanced because of the Senator.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join in commending the Senator from \nMaine for this amendment. It certainly removes a serious problem I had \nin the bill. We have removed that from the bill, and it will be very \nhelpful in making sure our vocational education programs can do the \nbest possible for our young people. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank my two colleagues for their kind \ncomments and for agreeing to accept this amendment. I think it is very \nimportant to the future of vocational education, which, as the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts points out, is so important to so many students and \nso many adults in this country, and particularly in our section of the \ncountry, in New England.\n  With that, I yield the remainder of my time and I urge the adoption \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3104) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I think we are close to concluding this \nevening's presentation. I just told the Senator from Massachusetts I \nthink Senator Gorton has a comment or two to make. He should be here \nshortly.\n  There is some effort underway to have a vote on the Gregg amendment \ntomorrow between, say, noon and 2:15, if this is ultimately agreed to \non both sides. The Lieberman amendment, it is hoped, could be voted on \nin the same timeframe, but we do not know that yet. There are some \nnegotiations on the other side. This should clarify itself in the early \nevening here.\n  I thought I would take just a moment, while we are waiting for \nSenator Gorton, to talk about the amendment for which we are next going \nto vote, and that is the Lott-Gregg amendment, the Teachers Bill of \nRights, and of which the ranking member on the committee, Senator \nKennedy of Massachusetts, has indicated there will be broad acceptance, \neven though it will be a rollcall vote.\n  The amendment amends title II of S. 2 to ensure that States and local \ncommunities are able to use their portion of the $2 billion to hire \nhighly qualified teachers to address the teacher quality shortage \nfacing this country. It adds a strong accountability component. School \ndistricts must show they have increased student achievement with the \npercentage of classes in core academic subjects that are taught by \nhighly qualified teachers. It authorizes a new, up to $350 million \nrecruitment program. This language was inserted by Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison of Texas, Senator Frist of Tennessee, and Senator Crapo of \nIdaho. It encourages midcareer professionals and outstanding college \ngraduates to take teaching positions in tiny public schools and rural \nschools.\n\n  It includes the language I discussed at some length earlier this \nafternoon to protect teachers from frivolous lawsuits so they are not \ninhibited from doing the job they are supposed to do in school, that \nis, if they see a problem they avoid it or are silent about it because \nthey are afraid they are going to be the subject, as I said, of a \nfrivolous lawsuit.\n  This is a brief overview of the Teachers' Bill of Rights, the Teacher \nEmpowerment Act as it has been referred to in the past. It authorizes \n$2 billion a year for States and local districts to enable them to \ndevelop a rigorous, professional development program. Federal dollars \ncan only be used on professional development programs that increase \nteacher knowledge and are directly related to the curriculum and\n\n[[Page S3596]]\n\nsubject area in which the teacher provides instruction.\n  It enables them to retain, recruit, train, and hire highly qualified \nteachers and to hire teachers to reduce class size, which has, of \ncourse, been a goal of the other side of the aisle, and the President. \nIt enables them to assist innovative teacher reforms aimed at \nincreasing teacher quality, including mentoring and master teachers. \nThe Senator from Massachusetts talked about mentoring earlier today. \nStudies and teacher polls have found that hiring master teachers who \nmentor new teachers improves both teacher quality and the likelihood \nthat new teachers will stay and thrive at the school.\n  It enables them to provide merit pay and teacher testing and \nalternative certification programs. These are programs that provide \nopportunities for experienced professionals from other fields to enter \nteaching. It enables them to provide teacher opportunity payments, \nfunds that go directly to teachers so they can choose their own \nprofessional development. Teachers could select to use their payment at \na university that has a reputation for intensive professional \ndevelopment programs in math and science.\n  It incorporates the language of Senator Gregg of New Hampshire \ndealing with teacher quality provisions that are included in this \namendment, including addressing teacher shortages. Due to rising \nenrollments, many school districts are having difficulty filling \nhundreds of teacher slots, and of those teachers already in the \nclassroom, many lack the skills and knowledge to be effective teachers. \nEarlier, Senator Kennedy had very interesting data that demonstrates \nthis problem. The amendment clarifies that States and school districts \nare permitted to not only use the money to hire teachers to reduce \nclass size but to also use the money to hire teachers to address the \nshortage of high-quality teachers. If a school district wishes to use \nthese dollars to hire a teacher, they should have the freedom to hire \nteachers to reduce their class size or to address the shortage of high-\nquality teachers.\n  It includes compulsory language relating to class size, which \nexacerbates the shortage of high-quality teachers, in our view.\n  Requiring smaller class sizes would only exacerbate the teacher \nshortage because it forces school districts to hire more teachers when \nthey are already having enough trouble hiring teachers for the classes \nthey already offer.\n  During the next decade, enrollment growth and higher teacher \nattrition rates mean many districts will have the need for more \nteachers, obviously. Yet the real shortage in our country is not so \nmuch in the number of teachers as it is in getting qualified teachers \nto work in the classroom, especially in hard-to-serve areas, such as \ninner cities and rural schools.\n  That reminds me, during the debate on the education savings account, \nwhich was a tool this Congress passed at least two or three times and \nis yet to get past the President--but during that debate, Senator Byrd \nof West Virginia came to the floor. He ultimately supported the \neducation savings account. He said--and I am paraphrasing it; I hope I \nam correct; Senator Byrd is pretty much a stickler for being correct--\nbut he indicated he voted historically for all the funding measures \nover the last 30 years and he was not all that happy with what has \nhappened and he was ready to try some new ideas.\n  The telling thing about his commentary to the Senate that day, in my \njudgment, was to describe where he went to school. I do not believe \nanybody would argue Senator Byrd is among the most capable, \nintellectual in the Senate. When he took us back to his schoolroom, it \nwas a remarkable story.\n  He was educated in a one-room school for much of his early training. \nIt had no heat and no air-conditioning. The plumbing was outside. It \nhad a bucket of water which was the potable water--that was the \ndrinking water--and a ladle. Yet that environment produced one of the \nmost competent, intellectual Members of the Senate. It is something we \nshould all remember. He obviously had a quality teacher. He was \neducated in those circumstances and went on to become one of our more \nfamous Members of the Senate.\n  I repeat that during the next decade enrollment growth and higher \nteacher attrition rates mean many districts will have the need for more \nteachers. Yet the real shortage in our country is not so much in the \nnumber of teachers as it is in getting qualified teachers to work in \nthe classroom, especially in hard-to-serve areas, such as inner cities \nand rural schools.\n  Many teachers lack the necessary skills and knowledge to be a high-\nquality teacher. More than 25 percent of new teachers in our Nation's \nschools are poorly qualified to teach. Studies have shown the mastery \nof the subject is the most tangible measure of teacher quality. Many \nteachers lack either a major or minor in the subject in which they are \nteaching.\n  One-third of all secondary school teachers, grades 7 through 12, who \nteach math have neither a major nor a minor in math or a related field; \n25 percent of all secondary school teachers who teach English lack a \nmajor or minor in English or a related field; more than half of all \nphysical science teachers did not major or minor in any physical \nscience; and more than half of all history teachers neither majored nor \nminored in history.\n  The shortages are even more troubling in inner-city schools where \nstudents only have a 50-50 chance of being taught by a quality teacher. \nIn high schools where more than 49 percent of the students qualify for \nfree lunch, which are classified as high-poverty schools, 40 percent of \nall classes in those high-poverty schools are taught by underqualified \nmath teachers. In more affluent schools, only 28 percent of the math \nclasses are taught by unqualified math teachers.\n\n  I do not think either number is very impressive--the fact that nearly \none out of three math classes taught in our more affluent schools can \nonly muster two-thirds of the teachers who have the qualifications to \nteach the subject and that rises to nearly half in inner-city schools.\n  Nearly one-third of all English classes in high-poverty schools are \ntaught by underqualified teachers.\n  The sad fact is that this amendment actually worsens the shortage of \nhigh-quality teachers.\n  I will move on to accountability. The second half of the Gregg \nprovision in this amendment adds a strong accountability piece. The \namendment stipulates that States are to monitor the progress of school \ndistricts in increasing both student achievement and the number of \nclasses taught by high-quality teachers. If the school district fails \nto make progress after 3 years, the State is authorized to take control \nof the teacher dollars and use those funds on rigorous professional \ndevelopment, teacher reforms, such as merit pay, or other teacher \ninitiatives to ensure student achievement increases and the number of \nhigh-quality teachers increases.\n  We do not prescribe a Federal ratio as to how much school districts \nmust spend on recruitment versus how much to spend on professional \ndevelopment. We let States and districts set their own priorities. We \ndo not focus on input measures--how much money is spent on what. \nRather, we focus on outcomes and outcomes alone--student achievement \nand teacher quality. This accountability amendment ensures States and \nschool districts will be held accountable for increasing student \nachievement and the number of high-quality teachers.\n  The recruitment provisions include in this amendment a section \ndeveloped by Senators Hutchison of Texas, Frist of Tennessee, and Crapo \nof Idaho, which focuses on the need to recruit excellent teachers from \nother professions and from among our outstanding college graduates. \nRecruiting qualified people from other walks of life to enter the \nteaching profession will dramatically improve the quality of our \nteaching pool.\n  I outlined earlier the significant number of teachers teaching \noutside their subject area in schools throughout our country. The \nrecruitment provisions in this amendment address the serious problem of \nunderqualified teachers by attracting qualified teachers to step in and \nmeet the needs. This amendment gives teacher quality the attention we \nbelieve it deserves.\n  I am pleased the other side of the aisle is amenable to the \namendment.\n\n[[Page S3597]]\n\n  I yield the floor so the Senator from Massachusetts can make his \nclosing remarks, and then I believe we are getting close to coming to \nan end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we took a valuable and useful step a few \nmoments ago when we preserved the vocational education legislation \noutside of the block grant, the basic Perkins program, which affects \nsome 6 million children in the K-12 and some 3 million students in \npost-secondary programs.\n  I intend to offer an amendment on teacher quality tomorrow. I have \nspoken on it this afternoon.\n  Before this legislation is finished, there will be efforts made by \nmembers of our committee to also exclude the block granting of the \nMigrant Education Program and the homeless programs. I will take a \nmoment to mention what the current situation is with regard to the \nMigrant Education Program.\n  The Migrant Education Program provides financial assistance to State \neducational agencies to establish and improve programs of education for \nchildren of migratory farm workers that enable them to meet the same \nacademic standards as other children. To help achieve this objective, \nprogram services help migrant children overcome the educational \ndisruption and other problems that result from repeated moves. Program \nfunds also promote coordination of needed services across the States. \nThe most recent data reported by States indicate more than 750,000 \nmigrant children are eligible for services.\n  The Federal Migrant Education Program is the only ongoing source of \nsupport for these highly mobile migrant children. The poverty and \nmobility, and often limited English proficiency, characteristics of the \nmigrant student population combine to make demands for educational \nservices go well beyond the services traditionally supported under \nState and local education budgets.\n  No State currently provides ongoing funding for migrant programs to \nhelp these children. We are wiping out the Federal commitment. For \nexample, the Migrant Education Program supports supplementary \ninstruction in core academic subjects, beyond which title I typically \nprovides, often provided outside the regular schoolday and in the \nsummer designed to address the special educational needs of children \nwho move and are out of school frequently.\n  Without these funds, many highly mobile migrant children may attend \nschool sporadically throughout the year or not attend school at all. \nWithout the funds, the local education groups are unlikely to provide \nthe normal range of services to children who attend their schools for \nbrief periods of time, or go out to find and enroll migrant children \noutside of normal school enrollment procedures, or grapple with either \nthe school interruption problems faced by migrant children or their \nneeds for special summer programs.\n  Without this program, States and the local educational authorities \nwould have little incentive to identify and serve migrant children, who \ncross school districts and/or State boundaries.\n  No single local educational agency, and, in many cases, no single \nState, is responsible for the education of a migrant child. No single \nlocal educational agency, and, in many cases, no single State, provides \neducational services to a migrant child during a single year.\n  The Migrant Education Program encourages and supports collaborative \nefforts and interventions across State lines to accommodate the needs \nof migrant children.\n  The Migrant Education Program provides support services that link \nmigrant children and their families to community services. For example, \nduring the regular school year, almost half of migrant students receive \nsocial work/outreach services, about 30 percent receive guidance and \ncounseling, and almost a fourth receive health services under the \nMigrant Education Program.\n  Effectively, the point is that certainly at the national level we are \ndropping the commitment to try to do something about all of these \nchildren.\n  With regard to the homeless children, nationally there were 625,000 \nschool age children identified as homeless during the 1997-1998 school \nyear. Without separate funding for this national program, it is \nunlikely that significant numbers of these children and their unique \nproblems will be addressed. They have higher than average rates of poor \nhealth, anxiety, depression, withdrawal, delinquency, aggressive \nbehavior, learning disabilities, and suicides. Those problems will not \nbe addressed. Through participation in the existing program, the States \nare focusing on reducing the barriers homeless children face in \nenrolling in and attending school on a regular basis.\n  Because of national leadership, almost all the States have revised \ntheir laws. Almost all the States revised their laws, regulations, and \npolicies to improve the access to education for homeless students. \nTwenty-seven States changed their residency laws or regulations. \nOtherwise, the children would not be able to be eligible. Almost all \nState coordinators report either that all the students can enroll \nwithout school records--that previously stopped children from being \nable to participate in the schools--or that they have made special \nallowances to expedite their record transfers. Thirty-five States \neliminated the barriers of immunization and guardianship requirements, \notherwise some homeless children would be prohibited from participating \nin services.\n  These are enormously vulnerable children. There is absolutely no \nreason or justification to eliminate these programs, block grant them, \nand send them to the States. The States have not responded to this \npopulation's unique needs.\n  In the absence of the homeless program, I think States would not have \nthe resources to employ a State coordinator for homeless children and \nyouth, a position that is responsible for ensuring that homeless \nchildren and youth have access to a free, appropriate public education.\n  Without the homeless program, the local educational authorities that \nrely on Federal funds to provide services to homeless children would \nhave to find funds in their own operating budgets, which are already \noverextended, or stop providing supplemental services to these \nchildren, who are among the neediest.\n  Last year, we provided $29 million for the education of homeless \nchildren. That is going to be eliminated. These funds most likely will \nnot be made up by the States. These children are going to be ill \nserved. It is basically and fundamentally wrong. I think we are going \nto be abdicating our responsibilities if we do not target some \nresources to what I think has been an effective program.\n  We have had some hearings on this problem in the past. People have \njust been extraordinary in how committed and dedicated they have been \nand how they have stretched scarce resources to make a real difference \nin children's lives.\n  We in this body rarely go a day when someone isn't talking about our \nfuture being our children and our responsibility to them. We ought to \nunderstand what we are doing to the most vulnerable children in our \nsociety, the poorest children, the homeless children, the migrant \nchildren, the immigrant children, and others in failing to guarantee \ntheir protection. I take strong exception. And I will offer an \namendment, with others. Others have offered an amendment to restore \nthose programs. I look forward to that. Hopefully, we will have an \nopportunity to address that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the subject before the Senate this \nafternoon, and until the vote is taken on it tomorrow, is the Lott-\nGregg amendment to the Teacher Empowerment Act section of this bill.\n  The Teacher Empowerment Act itself is quite significant in a number \nof ways, primarily in focusing on increased teacher quality across the \nUnited States of America but, at the same time, allowing a maximum \ndegree of flexibility in local choices with respect to how that teacher \nquality is, in fact, enhanced.\n  It provides a significant amount of money for teacher training that \ncan also be used for increasing the number of teachers, for increasing \nthe competition of those teachers most prized by\n\n[[Page S3598]]\n\nour school districts across the country. For with the amendment that is \nadded today--with the recruiting of people in midcareer from other \nprofessions, who will be quality teachers of particular subjects--it \nwill provide a degree of protection against frivolous lawsuits when \nteachers or administrators or school authorities have taken actions \nthat will protect the safety and security of students in classrooms and \nof the faculty and administration of the schools themselves. We \nliterally have faced the situation in which actions taken in good \nfaith, and for valid reasons, have subjected teachers and \nadministrators to frivolous lawsuits brought by lawyers for highly \ndisruptive and destructive students.\n  It does seem to me that the specific amendment on which we are going \nto vote will be effective in providing that kind of protection, \nproviding a modest program to recruit quality people in midcareers into \nteaching, and to assure that the $2 billion authorization for teacher \nquality can be used in a widely significant fashion for increasing the \nquality of teaching, not only the quantity, though that is there, but \nthe quality of teaching in our public schools.\n  The accountability, in this case, again, is going to be a student \naccountability. Are the results positive, from the perspective of \nstudent achievement in our schools? In that respect, of course, both \nthe amendment that is before us at the present time and the portion of \nthe bill to which the amendment applies are consistent with the overall \nphilosophy of the bill, a philosophy that is perhaps summarized best by \nsaying that after 35 years of procedural accountability--that is to \nsay, proving that money was used for the precise purposes for which the \nauthorization was directed, with a seeming total indifference to \nwhether or not student achievement improved, a procedural \naccountability which was satisfied by filling out forms correctly and \nby having clean audits--now it is to be succeeded by a performance \naccountability, accountability that says, after all, that we aim our \nassistance to public education across the United States of America to \nsee to it that our students themselves are better educated; that their \ntest results in the multitude of achievement tests being developed \nacross the United States show actual progress; that this is the \naccountability we wish; that this is the accountability that is found \nin Straight A's; that this is the kind of accountability that is found \nin the Teacher Enhancement Act in this bill; and that this is the goal \nof these amendments today.\n\n  We have a curious debate on the other side, one speaking about the \nsuccesses of title I, a title with which all the goodwill in the world \nhas not reduced the disparity between its beneficiaries and other \nstudents in the extended period of time; a position that says the \nstatus quo is to be protected at all costs; and a position that says \nparental control and influence over public education is something to be \nfeared.\n  We on this side of the aisle have every hope that the rather dramatic \nchange from procedural accountability to performance accountability \nwill result in a true improvement in the quality of education being \ngiven to our schoolchildren as measured by their actual achievement. \nThat is, in fact, our goal.\n  Having said that, I should also say there are at least some signs \nduring this second week of debate over the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act that we may be able to reach across the political divide \nand find a way to satisfy a substantial number of members of both \nparties in a way consistent with the precise goals I have outlined here \nwith the proposition that we need to encourage innovation, that we need \nto encourage parental involvement, and that we need to provide a degree \nof trust and confidence in those men and women across the United States \nwho have devoted their lives and their professional careers to the \neducation of our children, together with those who volunteer for the \nslings and arrows of political campaigns and run for office as school \nboard members--that perhaps all wisdom with respect to education policy \ndoes not preside in this body and in the Department of Education down \nthe street; that perhaps those who know our children's names may very \nwell know best what priorities should be funded in 17,000 different \nschool districts with 17,000 different types of challenges across the \nUnited States.\n  The amendment before us at the present time leads us in that \ndirection. The Teachers Enhancement Act that is a part of this bill \nleads us in that direction. Straight A's leads us in that direction. I \nhope we will soon have a proposal involving some reason from both sides \nof the political aisle in this body that will lead us in that direction \nas well.\n  At the present time, however, I commend to my colleagues the Lott-\nGregg amendment. I think it improves an already very first-rate bill--\nthe product of a tremendous amount of work on the part of the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, one of the best pieces of \nworking proposals in this body and by one of its committees in an \nextended period of time.\n  I have a far greater hope today than I did 2 or 3 weeks ago that this \nbody may actually not only begin a debate on education but may conclude \na debate on education with a successful vote, and at the very least \nsend this thoughtful bill, slightly amended, to a conference committee, \nand one hopes from that conference committee to the President of the \nUnited States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nhis usual eloquence, as well as for his understanding and perception of \nthe education problems in this country.\n  I would like to speak about other areas I think are important. We \nmust look closely at these two areas during consideration of this \nlegislation.\n  We are talking today about the need for improving the quality of \nteacher education and further improvements in the legislation before us \nfor that purpose. I think we will find that we have reached agreement \non that. One of the most critical parts of the equation in improving \neducation is ensuring classrooms are led by quality teachers.\n  I am a member of the Goals 2000 panel. Here we are already in 2000 \nand we haven't reached these important education goals. I want to share \nwith you some of the concerns about some of the areas in education \nwhere we need improvement, and what we intend to do through amendments \nto try to move us forward in these most critical education areas.\n  We received notice in 1983. President Ronald Reagan called on the \nSecretary of Education to convene a panel to examine the quality of \neducation in our Nation. It was very tersely stated in a phrase that \nsays it all, if a foreign nation had imposed upon us the educational \nsystem that we had in the country especially our elementary and \nsecondary education, it would be considered an act of war.\n  Since 1983, we have seen measurable improvement across this Nation in \nreaching the goals that we set at that time. This bill provides us with \nan opportunity to reevaluate where we are. It is the year 2000 and we \nhave not achieved many of our most important and pressing educational \ngoals.\n  Still, we have learned a great deal since that time about the area of \nhuge need in this Nation involving preschool children--the 0 to 3, or 0 \nto 5 age group, depending on what you want to talk about. These are \nproblems that are created when the parents do not take a leadership \nrole in educating the children. Often times, sadly, it is because they \ndon't have a strong educational backgroud themselves. Some are \nilliterate and do not have the tools to help their children as they \ngrow up to enter school ready to learn.\n  The amendment that will be offered by Senator Stevens and myself, and \nothers will, on a voluntary basis--I want to emphasize over and over \nagain that it is a voluntary basis--to provide information for parents, \ninformation for child care providers, and information to schools to \nensure that as a child grows, they all have the basic educational \nopportunities to learn to read and achieve academically. The successful \npassage of this amendment will make sure that we take care of those \nchildren who currently do not have that kind of assistance and \neducational support in a variety of ways. It is a critical issue that \nmust be addressed.\n\n[[Page S3599]]\n\n  Some years ago, studies were done on the impact to the growth and \ndevelopment of a child's brain. A comparison was done between the brain \nof a child who received attention, support, nurturing and good care, \nand one who unfortunately, like too many, had little or no real \nnurturing as children. The brain of the well-developed child who had \nall the nurturing necessary was what we would like to see--a large \nhealthy brain. For comparison, they showed you one of an old man in his \neighties or nineties which was shriveled up and shrunk. The other \npicture was the brain of a child that was not nurtured and did not \nreceive the care that a normal child should receive from a parent. That \nchild's brain was just as shriveled up as the old man's. That is what \ncan happen to a baby, a very young person that does not receive the \ncare, attention and nurturing at home that it should.\n  We will have an amendment which will assist us in understanding that, \nand which will make sure that throughout that period of time, in a \nvoluntary way, the information will be available.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the document explaining the Early \nLearning Opportunities Act amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Early Learning Opportunities Act Amendment\n\n\n                                purpose\n\n       The purpose of this amendment is to increase the \n     availability of voluntary programs, services, and activities \n     that support early childhood education and promote school \n     readiness of young children (age birth to 6) by helping \n     parents, caretakers, child care providers, and educators who \n     desire to incorporate appropriate developmental activities \n     into the daily lives of pre-school age children, and to \n     facilitate broader involvement of the community to develop a \n     cohesive network of early learning opportunities. The \n     Secretary of HHS is responsible for administering this \n     initiative in collaboration with the Secretary of Education.\n\n\n                    coordination of federal programs\n\n       The legislation requires and provides the authority to the \n     Secretaries of the Department of Health and Human Services \n     and Education to develop effective mechanisms to resolve \n     conflicts between early learning programs and remove barriers \n     to the creation of a community-driven, unified system of \n     services, activities, and programs for young children and \n     their families.\n\n\n                  preserving parental rights and roles\n\n       While the legislation focuses on providing more \n     opportunities for parents to participate in activities \n     designed to promote early learning, it is essential that \n     participation be voluntary. The bill clearly states that \n     parents are not required to participate in any programs, \n     services or activities funded under this part and reinforces \n     that parents are their child's first and most effective \n     teacher.\n\n\n                            federal funding\n\n       $3.25 billion over three years for a discretionary grant \n     program to the states; $750,000,000 in the first year, \n     increasing to $1 billion in the second year and $1.5 billion \n     in year 3.\n\n\n                            grants to states\n\n       The federal share is 85% for the first two years of the \n     grant, decreasing to 80% in the second and third years, and \n     to 75% for the remainder of the initiative. There is a broad \n     definition of how states can meet the match requirements \n     including cash or in-kind facilities, equipment or services. \n     The funds are allocated to the states based equally on the \n     population of children aged 4 or under and the number of \n     children aged 4 or under who are living in poverty. There is \n     a small state minimum of .4% and a 1% set-aside for Indian \n     Tribes, Native Alaskans. Hawaii Natives, and the Outlying \n     areas. States are not permitted to use the funds to supplant \n     existing funding for child care, Head Start, and other early \n     learning programs.\n\n\n                     limit on administrative costs\n\n       Administrative costs are limited for both the Department of \n     Health and Human Services (3%) and the States (2% for state-\n     level coordination of services, 2% for administrative costs, \n     and 3% for training/technical assistance/wage incentives).\n\n\n                           state eligibility\n\n       To receive a grant allotment, States must submit an \n     application, designate a lead entity, ensure that funds are \n     distributed on a competitive basis throughout the state, \n     ensure that a broad array/variety of early learning programs, \n     activities, and services receive funds and develop mechanisms \n     to ensure compliance with the requirement of the \n     initiative. States also are required to develop \n     performance goals based on an assessment of needs and \n     available resources and annually report the State's \n     progress towards meeting those goals.\n\n\n                      awarding grant to localities\n\n       States must award grants consistent with the performance \n     goals set by the State. To the maximum extent possible, \n     states will ensure that a broad variety of early learning \n     programs which provide a continuity of services across the \n     age spectrum will be funded. The state must fund programs \n     that help increase parenting skills, that provide direct \n     activities for young children, as well as improve the skills \n     of child care providers. Local Councils receiving funds will \n     work with local educational agencies to identify cognitive, \n     social, and developmental abilities which are expected to be \n     mastered prior to a child entering school. Programs, services \n     and activities funded under this initiative will represent \n     developmentally appropriate steps to mastery of those \n     abilities. Preference is given to grants which include \n     services to areas of greatest need (as defined by the state), \n     and to grants which increase local collaboration to maximize \n     the use of existing resources. There is no definition of \n     entities eligible to receive grants, in order to facilitate \n     the broadest possible participation among local community \n     resources.\n\n\n                              use of funds\n\n       Local Councils receiving funds from the State grant \n     allotment will distribute the funds to community resources \n     to:\n       (1) Help parents, care givers, child care providers, and \n     educators increase their capacity to facilitate the \n     development of cognitive, language comprehension, expressive \n     language, social-emotion, and motor skills and promote \n     learning readiness in their young children;\n       (2) Promote effective parenting\n       (3) Enhance early childhood literacy\n       (4) Develop linkages among early learning programs within a \n     community and between early learning programs and health care \n     services for young children\n       (5) Increase access to early learning opportunities for \n     young children with special needs, by facilitating \n     coordination with other programs serving this population\n       (6) Increase access to existing early learning programs by \n     expanding the days or times that the young children are \n     served, by expanding the number of children served, or \n     improving the affordability of the programs for low-income \n     children; and\n       (7) Improve the quality of early learning programs through \n     professional development and training activities, increase \n     compensation, and recruitment and retention incentives, for \n     early learning providers.\n       (8) Remove ancillary barriers to early learning, including \n     transportation difficulties and absence of programs during \n     non-traditional work times.\n\n\n                             accountability\n\n       The State is primarily responsible for monitoring the use \n     of funds by state grantees. If the State determines that the \n     grantee is not complying with the requirements of the grant, \n     the state must inform the grantee of the problems, provide \n     training and technical assistance to help them correct the \n     problems, and if that fails, terminate the grant.\n\n\n                         availability of funds\n\n       The State has 3 years to expand the funds received under \n     the State's allotment. Any unexpended funds will be used by \n     HHS to fund research-based early learning demonstration \n     projects.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in \nrelation to the Gregg amendment occur at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, May 9.\n  In addition, it would be my hope that by late morning tomorrow the \nSenate would be in a position to conduct a second vote to be scheduled \nfollowing the 2:15 vote which will be relative to the Lieberman \namendment. However, while that consent is being worked out, I ask \nunanimous consent that the next two first-degree amendments in order to \nS. 2 be the following, limited to relevant second degrees following a \nvote in relationship to the amendment.\n  The amendments are the Stevens-Jeffords amendment on early childhood \ninvestment, and the Kentucky amendment on teacher quality.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have just been discussing the \namendment which we just got unanimous consent to consider.\n  I would like to briefly discuss another amendment that I am hopeful \nthat I will have an opportunity to offer this week. It addresses \nanother significant educational problem we face in this nation.\n  As I said, on the goals panel we studied what is happening with our \nyoung people. It is telling when one considers those young people who \nend up incarcerated.\n  Eighty percent of the individuals incarcerated in jail in this \ncountry are school dropouts.\n  Consider those students that don't drop out. Far too many of our \nstudents who stay in high school are not receiving the kind of \neducation they need to prepare them to enter the workforce.\n  Therefore, I will have an amendment that tackles these critically \nimportant\n\n[[Page S3600]]\n\nproblems. We must do what we can to make sure that young people stay in \nschool and we must do what we can to ensure that students receive a \nrelevant education in high school. Students graduating from high school \nmust be literate. At the same time, we have got to strive for \nimprovement in our high schools so that our nation's young people will \nhave the skills they need to graduate and get a job.\n  Since 80 percent of people incarcerated in our institutions are \nschool dropouts, it is essential we pay more attention to those young \npeople as well. Those institutions must have the capacity to provide \nthose completing their sentences with literacy skills and are job \nskills so that they can enter the workforce and not return to crime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I once again come before the Senate to \ndiscuss an often-overlooked population in our schools, talented and \ngifted students. It's time that we recognized the nearly three million \nstudents who are talented and gifted and provide them with the \nassistance they need.\n  For the past three years, I've been working to change the way people \nthink about talented and gifted students. In order to do this, several \ndestructive myths must be dispelled.\n  Currently, many schools operate under the false assumption that these \nstudents are just ``extra-smart'' and can fend for themselves with a \nlittle help. One such example of this faulty thinking is giving a \ntalented and gifted third grader a fifth grade math textbook.\n  Students who display gifted qualities look at the world and think in \na very different way from other pupils. Instead of thinking in a \nsequential or linear fashion like most students, they jump from one \nconcept or idea to another. Specialized teaching and activities, \ndesigned for their thought process, will help these students excel.\n  In addition, these students often have problems fitting in socially \nbecause they are `different' and suffer emotionally from peer rejection \nand stigmatization. Tragically, as a result, some talented and gifted \nstudents experience depression, eating disorders and high levels of \nanxiety. Some are also vulnerable to violence and antisocial behavior.\n  Another myth is that gifted and talented programs only help middle \nand upper-class white students. Talented and gifted students cover the \nentire spectrum in terms of race, background, geographical region, and \neconomic status. In other words, gifted students can be found in every \nclassroom.\n  Along with getting rid of false notions and stereotypes about gifted \nand talented students, we need to direct resources to these kids to \nensure that they will have an educational program that fits their \nneeds.\n  I would like to thank Senator Jeffords for his leadership and for \nincluding provisions to help talented and gifted students in the \nEducational Opportunities Act, S. 2. The provisions found in S. 2 are \nbased on a bill I introduced as the Gifted and Talented Education Act, \nS. 505.\n  These provisions establish a program through which states can apply \nfor grants in order to fashion their own talented and gifted programs. \nStates can use the money for a number of activities such as teacher \ntraining, equipment, materials, and technology. Under this program, \nstates have a great deal of leeway in determining how best to meet the \nneeds of their students. It also ensures that 88 percent of these funds \nwill go toward enhancing student learning, not administrative costs.\n  These talented and gifted student provisions fill a gap in current \neducation policy. There is no federal directive to serve this student \npopulation. The only federal program dealing directly with talented and \ngifted education is the Jacob Javits Program. However, that program is \ndirected toward research, not the students themselves.\n  Furthermore, there is a great deal of disparity between the programs \navailable to meet the needs and quality teacher preparedness of \ntalented and gifted students. While most states do have some kind of \ntalented and gifted program, the programs are not uniform across school \ndistricts and grade levels.\n  I think all of us, regardless of party affiliation, agree that all \nstudents should get the education they need. While all students have \nthe potential to make great contributions to society, the reality, Mr. \nPresident, is that talented and gifted students have the greatest \npotential to be either the leaders of tomorrow or a burden to society. \nThese students will either put their talents to good use or they will \ndirect their energy and gifts toward destructive, wasteful activities. \nIt's important that we help to direct these students in a positive way.\n  As a fiscal conservative, I have always fought for the wise and \nefficient use of the public's money. Investing in our future leaders, \nartists, scientists, and law enforcement officials, among others, is \nthe most sound investment we can make. Again, I applaud Senator \nJeffords for including this important provision in the bill and I urge \nyou to join us in making a commitment to our nation's talented and \ngifted students.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator for those pertinent and eloquent \nremarks.\n  I deeply appreciate the effort the Senator has gone to, making sure \nthe talented and gifted program is improved to meet the goals for which \nit was intended. We have a tremendous opportunity now with modern \ntechnology to be able to link people up and broaden the availability of \ngifted and talented programs through the State and the country.\n  If we fail to do that, we will not be maximizing the opportunities we \nhave to give these young people who are the best hope--in many cases, \nfor leadership in the future--to be able to reach the goals they \nchoose.\n  I thank the Senator for the excellent words and what he has given to \nthis bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator has expressed a perception that is very \nimportant. It is because of that perception that the Senator was able \nto include this in the bill.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I have an amendment to the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act Reauthorization bill. My amendment would \nincrease the authorization for the Comprehensive School Reform Program \nfrom $200 million to $500 million. I believe that there are few areas \nof this bill that can have a more positive impact on education in \nAmerican than the Comprehensive School Reform Program.\n  Educators in this country are trying hard to improve the success of \ntheir schools. Teachers, administrators, and parents routinely organize \nand staff tutorial programs, remedial classes, after-school programs, \nand innumerable other initiatives designed to bolster school \nperformance. But in most cases, achieving breakthrough results requires \nresearch-based reform that embraces innovation and instills discipline \nin both the children and the methods of the schools.\n  School-wide reform programs effectively implemented through the hard \nwork of administrators, teachers, and parents have transformed many \nstruggling schools. Unfortunately, some schools--especially poorer \nTitle I schools--lack the means to pay for these programs. The \nComprehensive School Reform Program, CSRP, was established three years \nago to help public elementary or secondary schools pay for the initial \ncosts of implementing comprehensive strategies for educational reform. \nUnder CSRP, grants to individual schools are to be at least $50,000 per \nyear (renewable up to three years), in addition to all other federal \naid for which they may be eligible.\n  Schools that adopt comprehensive reform plans generally have searched \nthe education landscape for effective methods. They have studied \nintensively the reform programs that have been developed by educators \naround the country. And they have chosen the program that they believe \nwill produce the best results in their school.\n  Most schools that adopt a comprehensive reform plan do so based on \ntwo premises: first, that significantly improving the performance of \ntheir school demands a complete reorientation of its resources, \nmethods, and culture; and second, that the reform plan should be based \non a body of sound research and should have a proven record of success.\n\n[[Page S3601]]\n\n  Many reform plans focus on reading, because it is the critical \nfoundation for success in other subjects and in later grades. In most \ncases, the problems of a student who fails begin early. So must the \nsolutions. We should start by ensuring that all students are able to \nread by the end of the third grade. Educators widely proclaim that this \nis a crucial goal. If students have not achieved this standard, they \nhave a very hard time catching up in later grades. The inability to \nread well handicaps the rest of their studies, and their employment \nprospects later in life are greatly diminished. In Indiana, as many as \na third of all students fall behind by the end of the third grade. \nIndiana's performance is not unusual--the entire country is failing to \nmeet the challenge of educating all our children.\n  Mr. President, my first elective office was as a member of the \nIndianapolis Board of School Commissioners in the mid-1960s. At that \ntime, our school board struggled with basic questions of improvements \nin educational standards, desegregation of schools, and getting \nchildren proper nutrition and immunizations. Since that time, as a \nmayor and as a Senator, I have followed closely the development of \neducation in America. In some areas we have done well. In other areas, \nour progress has been disappointing.\n\n  But during that time, few developments have encouraged me as much as \nthe advances in comprehensive school reform. There are many reform \nprograms achieving positive results. But to illustrate the concept, I \nwould like to describe one in particular. This is ``Success for All,'' \nwhich was developed by Dr. Robert Slavin at Johns Hopkins University in \nBaltimore. Success for All is a great idea that has proven its value in \nmany schools across the country, including 13 in Indiana.\n  Reading is serious business at a Success for All school. For 90 \nminutes each day, students are grouped by their reading ability rather \nthan their grade level. This allows students who excel at reading to \nprogress at their own rate, while ensuring that students who fall \nbehind will receive intensive attention to stimulate their progress. To \nset the tone and importance of the reading period, students proceed \nsilently and purposefully through the hall to their reading group \nclassroom.\n  Once the period begins, there is a rapid-fire of sequential lessons. \nEach segment is short enough to maintain the interest and attention of \neven the most distracted student. The lessons are fun but rigorously \nstructured. Teachers read a story. Then students are involved in \nreading the words to the story in unison, discussing the story with a \npartner, then answering questions to test comprehension. At the \ncompletion of a successful lesson segment, students choose one of many \ngroup cheers. This positive reinforcement both encourages children, and \nfosters group cooperation.\n  During the reading period, every staff person in the school is \ninvolved in reading. The art teacher or gym teacher may be tutors, for \nexample. Parents also agree to have their children read to them for 20 \nminutes each night. If this doesn't happen, adults are available to \nwork with the students during the morning school breakfast period.\n  Because Success for All depends on the commitment of the entire \nfaculty and because it requires such a fundamental change in the way a \nschool operates, Dr. Slavin requires that at least 80 percent of the \nfaculty must approve Success for All by secret ballot.\n  The discipline and accountability of the program greatly reduce the \npossibility that students will fail. If a student falls behind, \ntutoring sessions are set up to get the student caught up. By teaching \nchildren to read in the early grades, our schools can avoid holding \nstudents back, promoting them with insufficient ability or transferring \nthem out of the normal curriculum to special education courses. \nReferrals to special education in Success for All schools have been \nshown to decrease by approximately 50 percent. In schools where Success \nfor All is taught, students learn to read by the third grade. By the \nfifth grade, students in these schools are testing a full grade level \nahead of students in other schools.\n  I would strongly encourage each of my colleagues to visit a Success \nfor All school, if they have not already done so. I have had the \npleasure of visiting Maplewood Elementary School in Wayne Township, \nMarion County, Washington Elementary in Gary, and Fairfield Elementary \nin Fort Wayne, which has had Success for All since 1995. In my \njudgment, anyone who sees Success for All in action will become a \nbeliever. I have contacted every school district in my state to suggest \nthat they take a look at Success for All or another comprehensive \nschool reform program based on rigorous research.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today would allow more \nstruggling schools to adopt comprehensive school reform programs. These \nprograms are a comparative bargain for our schools and our children \nwhen one considers their success at preventing the enormous costs of \nretention, special education and illiteracy. But many schools need help \npaying for the start-up costs and the reading materials associated with \ncomprehensive reform programs.\n  Most of the more than 1,500 schools nationwide that use Success for \nAll fund it with the Federal Title I program. Others have tapped \nprivate sources. But increasing funding for the Comprehensive School \nReform Program is the most direct way to give more local schools the \nchance to embrace school-wide reform and transform the lives of their \nstudents. The program deserves more support because its positive impact \non literacy and the ultimate success of students is so demonstrable.\n  Each child must learn to read. The quality of life for that child \ndepends upon that single achievement, as does the economic future of \nour country. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/08/senate-section/article/S3601-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I am here to discuss the achievements of \nan outstanding student athlete at an outstanding institution.\n  Tony Davis, a secondary education major at the University of Northern \nIowa--my alma mater--was recently named the NCAA Champion for wrestling \nin the 149-pound division.\n  Tony was born and raised in Chicago.\n  Before coming to UNI, he wrestled at Mount Carmel High School in \nChicago and Iowa Central Community College, where he received two \nnational junior college championships.\n  Tony chose to come to UNI for two reasons: to wrestle at a Division I \nschool and to study to be a teacher and coach.\n  Before the 1999-2000 season, Tony was ranked first in the nation in \nhis weight division. And, he maintained that ranking and came to the \nNCAA finals with a 26-1 record.\n  Tony's life philosophy is this: focus and dedication lead to success \nat all levels.\n  Looking at the road Tony has traveled to reach this point, it is \nevident focus and dedication played a large role in his success.\n  And, to quote Tony:\n\n       God played a big role in . . . getting on the right track \n     of life. I have a lot of people to thank along the way. It \n     was a long way to come. The most important thing is I got \n     here.\n\n  This past week was finals week at UNI. And, I want to commend Tony \nDavis for his commitment and dedication--not only to sports but also to \nacademics.\n  Next year, Tony Davis will return to UNI--again for two reasons.

And, he maintained that ranking and came to the \nNCAA finals with a 26-1 record.\n  Tony's life philosophy is this: focus and dedication lead to success \nat all levels.\n  Looking at the road Tony has traveled to reach this point, it is \nevident focus and dedication played a large role in his success.\n  And, to quote Tony:\n\n       God played a big role in . . . getting on the right track \n     of life. I have a lot of people to thank along the way. It \n     was a long way to come. The most important thing is I got \n     here.\n\n  This past week was finals week at UNI. And, I want to commend Tony \nDavis for his commitment and dedication--not only to sports but also to \nacademics.\n  Next year, Tony Davis will return to UNI--again for two reasons. Tony \nwill be finishing up his academic degree while also serving as an \nassistant wrestling coach.\n  UNI has a long tradition of excellence in training teachers.\n  This legacy of excellence in education will be continued as Tony has \nan opportunity to train wrestlers to succeed--both on and off the mat.\n  And so, I salute Tony Davis, his teammates, Coach Mark Manning, and \nthe University of Northern Iowa for supporting each student on and off \nthe mat.\n  Go Panthers!\n\n[[Page S3602]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/08/senate-section/article/S3602-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  SHOTINGS IN PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to speak about \nan incident that has sent shock waves throughout the conscience of our \nNation. On April 28th, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, five of my \nconstituents were brutally murdered and one critically injured in what \nseems to be a hate crime. Reports indicate that the perpetrator \nactively and methodically sought out his minority victims during the \n72-minute rampage. The victims of this brutal rampage were a 63-year-\nold Jewish woman, a 31-year-old man of Indian descent, a 22-year-old \nAfrican-American student, a 27-year-old Vietnamese man, and a 34-year-\nold Chinese-American man. In addition to the five people killed, \nanother 25-year-old man of Indian descent was shot in the neck and \ncritically injured. The alleged killer also fired rounds at two \nsynagogues and spray-painted the word ``Jew'' and two swastikas on the \nwall of one of them.\n  The alleged murderer was arraigned on five counts of homicide, seven \ncounts of ethnic intimidation, three counts of criminal mischief, two \ncounts each of arson and institutional vandalism and one count each of \nattempted homicide, firearms violations, reckless endangerment and \naggravated assault. This senseless rampage that left five people dead \nand one in critical condition poses some of the most important and \nvexing law enforcement challenges currently facing our Nation. Such \nheinous hate-filled acts of violence divide our communities, intimidate \nour citizens, and poison our collective spirit. While our hearts are \ngrieving for those who have lost loved ones, we must try and find some \nconsolation by using this atrocity to send a strong message that hate \ncrimes will not be tolerated.\n  Such vicious attacks are a form of terrorism that threaten the entire \nNation and undermine the ideals on which we were founded. I am a \nprincipal sponsor of S. 622, the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999. I \nwas the District Attorney in Philadelphia for eight years and I did not \nlike Federal encroachment on State jurisdiction--but there are some \ninstances when Federal intervention is necessary. Some of the ugliest \ninstances of violence in our nation have been motivated by hatred based \non race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, and \ndisability. It is in the case where it is plain that it was a hate \ncrime situation--in these extremely usual situations, the I believe \nFederal authority ought to be present where it is necessary.\n  I know that there are those that are concerned about the expansion of \nFederal jurisdiction, which is something that we should be very careful \nabout. It is with this very concern in mind that this legislation has \nbeen narrowly tailored to target a very, very important area--it has \nbeen done with a scalpel and not a meat axe. We need to let people out \nthere know that if the crime is bad enough and the local prosecutors \nwon't act that there is a Federal authority to come in where absolutely \nnecessary. Current law, 18 United States Code, Section 245, permits \nfederal prosecution of a hate crime only if the crime was motivated by \nbias based on race, religion, national origin, or color and the \nassailant intended to prevent the victim from exercising a ``federally \nprotected right.'' These activities are: (A) enrolling in or attending \na public school or public college; (B) participating in or enjoying a \nservice, program, facility or activity provided or administered by any \nstate or local government; (C) applying for or enjoying employment; (D) \nserving in a state court as a grand or petit juror; (E) traveling in or \nusing a facility of interstate commerce; and (F) enjoying the goods or \nservices of certain places of public accommodation. The statute's dual \nrequirement that the government has to prove that the defendant \ncommitted an offense not only because of the victim's race, color, \nreligion, or national origin, but also because of the victim's \nparticipation in one of six narrowly defined ``federally protected \nactivities'' substantially limits the potential for federal prosecution \nof hate crimes, even when the crime is particularly heinous. The Hate \nCrime Prevention Act will make it easier for the Federal government to \nsuccessfully prosecute ate crimes by amending current law to eliminate \nthe dual requirement and by expanding the list groups entitled to \nprotection under Federal law to include women, homosexuals and the \ndisabled. Under this bill, hate crimes that cause death or bodily \ninjury can be investigated federally, regardless of whether the victim \nwas exercising a federally protected right. In cases involving violent \nhate crimes based on the victims gender, sexual orientation, or \ndisability, the bill would make it a Federal crime to willfully cause \nbodily injury to any person, or attempt to do so through use of a \nfirearm or explosive device, whenever the incident affected or involved \ninterstate commerce. No longer would Federal criminal civil rights \njurisdiction hinge upon whether a racial murder occurs on a public \nsidewalk versus a private parking lot. No longer would the Federal \ngovernment be without the power to work with State and local officials \nin the investigation and prosecution of a racist who targets and \nassaults an African American. Criminals will no longer be able to evade \nFederal prosecution simply because their victims were not enrolling in \na public school, using a place of public accommodation, or \nparticipating in any of the six federally protected activities at the \ntime they were assaulted.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a bill that is narrowly tailored to reach only \nthe most egregious forms of hate crimes. It is important to note that \nthis bill does not impact issues such as job discrimination, political \nspeech or graffiti.\n  America is the great melting pot. People of different races, \nreligion, and creed join together from all around the globe seeking \nfreedom--religious freedom, political freedom and economic freedom. But \nunfortunately in our society today there are those who harbor animus \ntowards others because of the color of their skin or the church they \nattend. Few crimes tear more deeply at the fabric of our Nation than \ncrimes motivated by such hatred. We must continue to work towards \nfreeing our Nation from such violence, discrimination, hatred, and \nbigotry through education and public awareness. However, while we work \ntowards this goal we must ensure that each and every American is \nprotected from crimes based on race, color, religion, national origin, \ngender, sexual orientation, or disability.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/08/senate-section/article/S3602-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3602-S3603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RICHARD B. HARVEY\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I honor Dr. Richard B. \nHarvey, Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science on the \noccasion of his retirement from Whittier College. Over the span of four \ndecades, Dr. Harvey has also served as Assistant Dean, Dean of Academic \nAffairs and Chair of the Political Science Department of Whittier \nCollege.\n  In addition to his academic pursuits, Dr. Harvey is the accomplished \nauthor of The Dynamics of California Government and Politics, a well \nknown textbook in its sixth edition, Earl Warren, Governor of \nCalifornia, and a number of articles and book reviews. He is also a \nradio commentator, delivering political analysis of election results.\n  His educational leadership has inspired countless young students to \npursue civic opportunities. Dr. Harvey's Politics Outside the Classroom \ncourse exposed students various powerhouses in the Los Angeles and \nSacramento areas. Students met and discussed California politics with \nsome of the state's most influential political officials, learning more \nabout the practical world of politics than a textbook or lecture can \noffer.\n  Dr. Harvey's dedication to educating students and his belief in the \nsignificance of the political process are worthy of recognition. He \nearned a B.A. degree from Occidental College, and M.A. and Ph.D. \ndegrees from the University of California, Los Angeles.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Dr. Richard \nHarvey best wishes on his retirement and in all of his future \nendeavors. His dedication and commitment to teaching California \npolitics for over forty years has set an example that will be emulated \nfor years to come.\n\n[[Page S3603]]\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO NATIONAL LIFE\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an \norganization that has served the state of Vermont, and the nation, for \n150 years. National Life has served the needs of millions of Americans \nduring this time, starting with its first policy, issued in 1850, and \ncontinuing into the contemporary insurance business. As Chairman of the \nSenate Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee, I can personally \nattest to how valuable their services have been and continue to be. \nHowever, National Life is more than just a business, it is an archetype \nof community relations and a leader in the promotion of ethical market \nconduct.\n  National Life was founded in 1848 by Dr. Julius Dewey as a mutual \nlife insurance company. The first claim was paid to a policy owner who \nhad traveled to California for the Gold Rush. From this beginning, \nNational Life has expanded to include 800 career and general agents, \nand over 3,000 independent brokers. National Life has also grown to \ninclude some of the most prestigious services in America, including the \nSentinel Fund--established in 1968, the American Guaranty and Trust--\nchartered in Delaware in 1914, and the national Retirement plan \nAdvisors--founded in 1940.\n  In 1998, National Life joined the Insurance Marketplace Standards \nAssociation. This group promotes ethics in market conduct of the life \ninsurance industry. Among the criteria that National Life had to meet \nwere high standards of honesty in fairness to customers, fair \ncompetition, quick resolution of customer disputes and complaints, and \ncustomer-focused sales and service. Needless to say, National Life met \nthe criteria in 1998, as they have throughout their long and \nprestigious history.\n  This 150th Anniversary also marks a rare meeting of past, present, \nand future, in 1960, the National Life building was opened. At the \ndedication ceremony, a time capsule was interred in the floor of the \nlobby. This time capsule will be opened on May 12, 2000, and we will be \nable to compare where we are today with where we thought we would be. \nThe hopes and wishes of yesterday have evolved into today's reality, \nand the year 2000, once an incomprehensible milestone, is no longer the \ndistant future.\n  While the past and present will merge at this ceremony, the \nanniversary also provides an opportunity to look forward. True to form, \nNational Life again initiates a bond with the community; among the \nentries in the Year 2000 time capsule will be the predictions of \nchildren of Central Vermont. The hopes and wishes of these children for \nthe future are significant, as they will be the ones living it. \nRecognizing this, National Life is also contributing money to each \nparticipating public elementary school. The students' whose predictions \nwill be included in the time capsule, along with their respective \nschools, will receive an additional contribution.\n  On this occasion of celebrating the venerable and storied past of \nNational Life, let us pay tribute to their Vermont roots and their \ncontributions to the Vermont economy during the past century and a \nhalf. Far from simply administering to their community, National Life \nis a part of it. National Life has realized from the start that the \ninvestment we make in the children of today will pay dividends in the \nleaders of tomorrow. For their continued commitment to the community \nand their customers, they should be commended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/08/senate-section/article/S3603-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    A TRIBUTE TO THE SOUTH DAKOTA STATE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ALLIANCE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nSouth Dakota State Medical Association (SDSMA) Alliance. This year the \nSDSMA Alliance will celebrate its 90th anniversary, making it the \noldest continuous medical Alliance in the United States. For ninety \nyears, this physicians' spouses organization has proudly been the \nvolunteer hands and voices of the South Dakota State Medical \nAssociation.\n  Though their accomplishments may not be always easily enumerated or \nquantified, their impact has been felt across every mile of the state \nof South Dakota. The SDSMA Alliance has led or united with other \norganizations in an effort to insure that our communities are healthier \nand safer. Members of the SDSMA Alliance have always reached out to \nfeed the hungry, give warmth to those who were cold, provide shelter \nand safety to the abused, and bring smiles and joy to children in need \nof books or toys. Health promotion and community projects are, indeed, \nthe cornerstone of the Alliance.\n  Oftentimes, the mission statement of an organization tells us all we \nneed to know about the character of the individuals who have joined \ntogether. In the case of the SDSMA Alliance, this statement holds true \nonce again. Their mission to promote public health, create safer \ncommunities, protect the patient-physician relationship, and generate \nfunds to help educate future physicians is a testament to their desire \nto positively impact every South Dakota community in which their work \nis done.\n  As just one example of the Alliance's hard work and dedication, last \nJune they declared-not war-but peace on all school campuses throughout \nout state. Their focus was not just on guns and grenades, but bullying \nand fist fights, taunting and threats, intolerance and isolation, \nbecause that, as we all know, is where the problems usually begin.\n  To emphasize the need to provide our children and educators with a \nsafe school environment, the SDSMA Alliance launched a campaign to \nprovide K-3rd grade students with conflict resolution and self-esteem \nbuilding activities. Thousands of ``I Can Choose,'' ``I Can Be Safe,'' \n``Hands Are Not For Hitting,'' and ``Be A Winner'' workbooks were \ndistributed to schools and shelters throughout our state. Their goal \nwas to arm children with self-esteem and to teach them how to make \nhealthier and safer choices. It is efforts such as these that weave the \nfabric of our communities closer together and promote safe, learning \nenvironments for South Dakota's children.\n  Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise today to recognize \nthe South Dakota State Medical Association Alliance for ninety years of \nhard work and dedication to the health and safety of the people of \nSouth Dakota. I applaud the SDSMA Alliance's efforts to combat those \nforces in our society which would jeopardize the mental and physical \nwellness of any citizen. I sincerely thank the Alliance for their \npositive contributions to South Dakota's communities, and I hope that \none day we can stand together and say, ``Mission \naccomplished.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/08/senate-section/article/S3603-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3603-S3604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO STERLING EDWARDS RIVES, JR.\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a friend \nand patriot Sterling Edwards Rives, Jr. of Petersburg, Virginia who \ndied on February 13, 2000, at the age of 78 years.\n  A native of Surry County, sterling served in the Army at the close of \nWorld War II and then spent a year building airfields in the \nPhilippines. He returned to a position as an inspector with the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture traveling with his wife Virginia Anne and \nnewborn son Sterling III throughout the Southeast grading peanuts, \npotatoes and produce. Two more sons Andrew II an Bailey were born as \nthey moved to Petersburg where he began his 35-year career where he \nheld leadership positions in the Christ and Grace Episcopal Church.\n  Sterling Rives served on the Virginia Republican State Central \nCommittee, as a delegate to four national conventions, vice-chairman of \nthe Petersburg Electoral Board, and as a delegate to the White House \nCouncil on Aging.\n  President Ronald Reagan once told me that ``Politics is not a \nspectator sport.''\n  No one took that more to heart than Sterling Rives who believed that \nit was his civic responsibility and patriotic duty to contribute freely \nhis time and talents to elect those he supported to public office. I \nwas privileged to be one of those public servants whom Sterling took by \nthe hand and guided towards election day after election day.\n  Sterling Rives drove the original footings for the foundation of the \nRepublican Party of Virginia. He and his family gave tirelessly in \nelection after election.\n  Just last year Virginians elected a Republican Governor, Lt. \nGovernor,\n\n[[Page S3604]]\n\nAttorney General and a new Republican majority in the House of \nDelegates and the Senate for the first time in our state's history. \nThat impressive victory was a most appropriate tribute to Sterling \nRives' long public service encouraging people to be active in politics.\n  We have far too few citizens who recognize the importance of the \npolitical process in preserving our democracy and our freedom. The life \nof Sterling Rives will stand as a model for patriots who seek to \npreserve our liberty. I know my colleagues join me in paying tribute to \nSterling Rives and extending to his family our deepest \nsympathy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/08/senate-section/article/S3604-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNITION OF MOUNTAIN HOME JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am honored to rise today to pay \ntribute to an exceptional group of students from Mountain Home Junior \nHigh School in my home state of Arkansas. These students won first \nplace in the state competition of the ``We the People . . . The Citizen \nand the Constitution'' program. I am proud to report that the following \nstudents will represent my home state at the national competition this \nMay 6-8 in Washington, DC:\n  Matthew Brinza, T.C. Burnett, Patrick Carter, Cody Garrison, Meredith \nGriffin, Kayla Hawthorne, Delia Lee, Megan Matty, Zachary Milholland, \nStacy Miller, Jennifer Nassimbene, Rebeca Neis, Patty Schwartz, Carrie \nToole, and Kris Zibert.\n  I also want to say a special word of thanks to their teacher, Patsy \nRamsey, who deserves much of the credit for the success of the class.\n  The We the People . . . program is an outstanding educational \ninitiative developed specifically to educate young people about the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights. Students who compete at the three-\nday national competition, which is modeled after hearings in the U.S. \nCongress, testify as constitutional experts before a panel of judges \nrepresenting various regions of the country. The students are then \nasked a series of challenging questions to test their depth of \nunderstanding and ability to apply their constitutional knowledge.\n  Teaching students about the benefits of public service and the value \nof representative government is essential to the long-term viability of \nour nation's democracy. Since its inception in 1987, more than 26 \nmillion students and 75,000 educators nationwide have participated in \nthis worthwhile program designed to encourage civic awareness and \nunderstanding. I am extremely proud of the Mountain Home students who \nhave earned the opportunity to compete in the We the People . . . \nfinals in Washington, DC. I wish them well in their endeavor and know \nthey will provide an excellent example for others in my state and the \nnation to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/08/senate-section/article/S3604-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GOODWILL INDUSTRIES WEEK\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate Goodwill \nIndustries Week and call attention to a leader in job training and \nemployment services for people with disabilities and other barriers to \nemployment.\n  Nearly a century ago, Reverend Edgar Helms, a Methodist minister from \nBoston, founded Goodwill on the premise of reusing household goods and \nclothing from wealthy neighborhood homes to create a system that \nprovides the poor with training, jobs, and self-esteem. The Goodwill \nphilosophy of ``a hand up, not a hand out'' was born, and has blossomed \ninto a $1.5 billion non-profit organization. Dr. Helms' own words \ndescribed Goodwill Industries as both an ``Industrial program as well \nas a social service enterprise . . . a provider of employment, training \nand rehabilitation for people of limited employability, and a source of \ntemporary assistance for individuals whose resources were depleted.''\n  Just a few of the programs offered include retail skills training \nthrough a partnership with Target stores, service technician training \non-site at Valvoline Instant Oil Change locations, and construction \nskills training at Habitat for Humanity building sites. These programs, \nmatched with Goodwill employment services, prepare people to enter the \nworkforce in high-demand fields.\n  Goodwill Stores funnel nearly 84 cents of every dollar spent at \nGoodwill towards employment and training programs for people faced with \nbarriers to employment. This includes individuals with disabilities, \npeople with limited work history, those who have experienced corporate \ndownsizing, and recipients of government support programs. By operating \nautonomously, each of the 182 Goodwill member organizations adapts its \nservices to meet the needs of its local community. This allows them to \ndesign specific programs and services that give Goodwill graduates the \nappropriate skills they need to find work close to home.\n  Goodwill programs may not be for everyone, but Goodwill Industries \nInternational, through its employment and training efforts, provided \nnecessary services for nearly 321,000 people worldwide in 1998, people \nwho now have the tools to accomplish the goals in life that were once \nbeyond their grasp.\n  For this week of May 7-13, I commend those who have made a difference \nin someone's life through the services of Goodwill Industries and those \nwho accomplish new heights in their careers thanks to these much-needed \nprograms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/08/senate-section/article/S3604-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SISTER CITIES OF NORTH ADAMS, MASSACHUSETTS AND NOISIEL, FRANCE\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege for me to commend \nthe new sister cities of North Adams, Massachusetts and Noisiel, \nFrance. They will officially establish a sister-city relationship on \nMay 20. I extend my warmest congratulations to both cities as they \nembark on this excellent opportunity.\n  North Adams and Noisiel have a great deal in common. They have \nsimilar population sizes, and they are communities that worked \neffectively to overcome economic difficulties during the 1980's. Both \ncities have revitalized former manufacturing plants to create \ncontemporary arts facilities that will attract visitors from many other \nnations. These two cities have shared remarkably similar experiences, \nand I commend them both for their impressive success.\n  Last year, the City of North Adams welcomed Deputy Mayor Daniel \nVachez of Noisiel. He visited the many cultural and historic treasures \nthat make North Adams a wonderful example of New England's history and \nheritage. Mayor John Barrett III has done an outstanding job of \nsupporting impressive development initiatives for the city, and I \ncommend him for his leadership.\n  I'm sure that the new sister city relationship will be a successful \ninitiative. The relationship is a tribute to the vision and dedication \nof Mayor Barrett, Deputy Mayor Vachez and the many others in both \ncities whose enthusiasm and energy have made this project possible. I'm \nconfident that both North Adams and Noisiel will benefit significantly \nfrom this relationship, and that their program will be an outstanding \nexample to cities worldwide.

Events have been \nscheduled throughout this week, providing administrators, teachers, \nstudents and parents an opportunity to reflect upon the history of \ntheir elementary school, and at the same time witness how far it has \ncome in seventy years.\n  The roots of Wayne Elementary School lie in a two room portable \nbuilding near the heart of Detroit, where Mrs. Jessie Baum and Ms. Etta \nCoetzer, under the guidance of Principal Ms. Florence Kessler, began \nteaching kindergarten through fifth grade students in March of 1928. \nTheir efforts led to the construction of a six-room building at 10633 \nCourville Street in February of 1930, officially marking the birth of \nWayne Elementary School.\n  Though the face and shape of the building have been forced to change \noften to accomodate a growing number of students, the teachers and \nadministrators of Wayne Elementary School\n\n[[Page S3605]]\n\nstill instill the same values into their students as did Ms. Kessler, \nMrs. Coetzer, and Mrs. Baum: learning two different sets of three R's, \nnot only the traditional writing, reading, and arithmetic, but also \nrights, responsibility, and respect.\n  To this end, Wayne Elementary School encourages parents and other \nmembers of the community to become involved with the education of their \nchildren. In 1998, working in cooperation with the Greening of Detroit \nand the Ford Motor company volunteers, the children planted trees, \nbushes and wild flowers during the month of May. The habitat area now \nserves as an outdoor classroom and each spring the students intend to \nplant more trees, bushes and flowers.\n  Two other important programs have recently been developed at Wayne \nElementary School. Academic Games, started by Ms. Nicole Stewart, \nencourages learning achievement while at the same time demonstrating to \nstudents that learning can indeed be fun. And in 1995, two chess teams \nwere formed by Mr. Carter and Mr. Cook, a primary team (K-3) and an \nupper elementary team of fourth and fifth graders. On May 11, these \nteams will send ten students to Dallas, Texas, to compete against the \nnation's best elementary school chess players. I would like to wish \nthem the best of luck in that competition.\n  Mr. President, I applaud all of the teachers, parents, students and \nadministrators whose hard work over the years has made this anniversary \npossible. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish Anthony \nWayne Elementary School a happy 70th birthday, and continued success in \nthe coming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/08/senate-section/article/S3605-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                       Executive Message Referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/08/senate-section/article/S3605-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE FISCAL YEAR 2000 BUDGET REQUEST FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n              COURTS--A MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 103\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Government Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the District of Columbia Code, as amended, I am \ntransmitting the FY 2001 Budget Request of the District of Columbia \nCourts.\n  The District of Columbia Courts have submitted a FY 2001 budget \nrequest for $104.5 million for operating expenses, $18.3 million for \ncapital improvements to courthouse facilities, and $41.8 for Defender \nServices in the District of Columbia Courts.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislation of \n     the State of Idaho relative to the Northern Rockies \n     Protection Act; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial No. 6\n\n       Whereas, on February 2, 1999, H.R. 488, known as the \n     ``Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act,'' was introduced \n     in the U.S. House of Representatives;\n       Whereas, the Act is far reaching and would designate \n     wilderness, wild and scenic rivers, national park and \n     preserve study areas, wildland recovery areas, and biological \n     connecting corridors in five northwest states: Idaho, \n     Montana, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming;\n       Whereas, the Act would create over eighteen million acres \n     of new wilderness alone, approximately five million acres of \n     which would be in Idaho, more than in any other state;\n       Whereas, the Act also designates over a million acres along \n     the Idaho-Oregon border as the Hells Canyon/Chief Joseph \n     National Preserve;\n       Whereas, the Act, a concept presented by the Montana-based \n     environmental group, the\n\n[[Page S3606]]\n\n     Alliance for the Wild Rockies, was first introduced in 1992 \n     to oppose a bill designating wilderness areas only in the \n     state of Montana;\n       Whereas, the members of the Idaho congressional delegation \n     opposed the Act in 1992 and continue to oppose it now;\n       Whereas, the Act is also opposed by the majority of \n     representatives in the Congress from the other affected \n     states: Montana, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming;\n       Whereas, the lands addressed by the Act closely resemble \n     those at issue in President Clinton's current roadless lands \n     initiative, which is also opposed by the state of Idaho and \n     the Idaho congressional delegation;\n       Whereas, setting aside so much acreage in Idaho as \n     wilderness, wild and scenic rivers, national park and \n     preserve study areas, wildland recovery areas, and biological \n     connecting corridors would severely reduce employment and \n     income in many areas of the state in which it is difficult to \n     replace the lost money by other means, and would landlock \n     thousands of acres of state endowment land, thereby reducing \n     funds for public education in Idaho. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Fifty-fifth Idaho Legislature, the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, that we \n     urge the Congress of the United States to oppose H.R. 488, \n     known as the ``Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act.'' \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, that the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Fifty-fifth Idaho Legislature, the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, that we \n     urge the Congress of the United States to oppose H.R. 488, \n     known as the ``Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act.'' \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, that the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Fifty-fifth Idaho Legislature, the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, support \n     natural resource planning and environmental management \n     featuring site-specific management decisions made by local \n     decision-makers, local citizens and parties directly and \n     personally affected by land and resource management \n     decisions.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Idaho relative to additional de facto wilderness \n     in Idaho; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial No. 7\n\n       Whereas, Idaho is a state which has sixty-six percent of \n     its landmass controlled by the federal government; and\n       Whereas, access to Idaho's public lands is a vital part of \n     Idaho's natural resource economy as well as an important part \n     of our citizens heritage, recreation and enjoyment; and\n       Whereas, Idaho currently has 4,081,315 acres of wilderness \n     which is sufficient; and\n       Whereas, President Clinton has proposed to establish \n     another nine million acres of defacto wilderness in Idaho by \n     declaring certain public lands in the state to be roadless; \n     and\n       Whereas, Idaho Governor Dirk Kempthorne requested a longer \n     comment period for Idaho citizens to study and comment on the \n     roadless plan and his request was summarily denied by the \n     United States Forest Service; and\n       Whereas, the state of Idaho has been compelled to initiate \n     a lawsuit to protect its interests in Idaho land designated \n     as public; and\n       Whereas, roadless areas prevent access to the forests of \n     Idaho and negatively affect forest health by preventing \n     intervention in disease, insect infestations and fire \n     suppression. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Fifty-fifth Idaho Legislature, the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, that the \n     Congress of the United States is urged to pass legislation \n     negating any Presidential Executive Order President Clinton \n     may issue regarding additional defacto wilderness and \n     instructing the United States Forest Service and the Bureau \n     of Land Management to maintain roads and access into the \n     public lands in Idaho. Be it further\n       Resolved that the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed \n     to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of \n     Congress, and the congressional delegation representing the \n     State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-493. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Idaho relative to extending the deadline on the \n     notice of intent to solicit comments on two draft \n     environmental impact statements, one set of draft rules and a \n     draft environmental assessment; to the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources.\n\n                     Senate Joint Memorial No. 105\n\n       Whereas, on October 19, 1999, the United States Forest \n     Service announced a vast ``rulemaking process to propose the \n     protection of the remaining roadless areas within the \n     National Forest System.'' 64 FR 56306. This rulemaking \n     purportedly includes two draft environmental impact \n     statements, at least one set of draft rules, and a draft \n     environmental assessment; and\n       Whereas, the Notice of Intent (NOI) solicits comments ``on \n     the scope of the analysis that should be conducted'' and ``on \n     the identification of alternatives to the proposal'' that \n     will be set out in this multitude of documents. The NOI then \n     provides prospective commentators with slightly more than \n     sixty days to comment on this enormous and poorly defined \n     proposal. The NOI is an unacceptable affront to the promise \n     of meaningful public participation that is the centerpiece of \n     the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); and\n       Whereas, more than forty million acres of land in the West \n     could be affected by the actions contemplated in the NOI. A \n     permanent moratorium on Forest Service road development will \n     have a devastating impact on timber communities in the West. \n     The proposed moratorium will destroy attempts to develop \n     recreational economies in the West and deny access to huge \n     areas of the West to all but the able-bodied. The sum, the \n     moratorium will deny thousands of citizens the opportunity to \n     use, enjoy and benefit from the land; and\n       Whereas, the process used by the Forest Service to consider \n     such a potentially severe decision must reflect absolute \n     fairness and deliberation. The NOI demonstrates neither of \n     those traits. No specific proposals are identified. No \n     preliminary findings are referenced; and\n       Whereas, these failures violate one of NEPA's primary \n     objectives of encouraging and facilitating ``public \n     involvement in decisions which affect the quality of the \n     human environment.'' 40 CFR 1500.2(d); and\n       Whereas, the NOI states that it ``initiates the scoping \n     process.'' 64 FR 56307. However, the NOI does not identify \n     ``the significant issues related to [the] proposed action,'' \n     as is required by federal regulations. 40 CFR 1501.7. The NOI \n     does does not encourage ``the participation of affected \n     federal, state and local agencies'' and the regulations \n     implementing NEPA anticipate. 40 CFR 1501.7(a)(1); and\n       Whereas, the ambiguity and confusion that characterize the \n     NOI are compounded by the fact that the comment period is so \n     brief. Title II 40 CFR 1501.8(b)(1)(i)-(viii) specifically \n     set out considerations that the Forest Service should be \n     using in determining the time limits for soliciting comments \n     on the NOI.\n       ``(b) The agency may:\n       (1) Consider the following factors in determining time \n     limits:\n       (i) Potential for environmental harm.\n       (ii) Size of the proposed action.\n       (iii) State of the art of analytic techniques.\n       (iv) Degree of public need for the proposed action, \n     including the consequences of delay.\n       (v) Number of persons and agencies affected.\n       (vi) Degree to which relevant information is known and if \n     not known the time required for obtaining it.\n       (vii) Degree to which the action is controversial.\n       (viii) Other time limits imposed on the agency by law, \n     regulations or executive order.''; and\n       Whereas, it should be obvious that all of these factors \n     support a careful, deliberate, consideration of the \n     environmental impacts of the proposed permanent moratorium. \n     The expedited deadline in the NOI is completely inconsistent \n     with 40 CFR 1501.8(b); and\n       Whereas, in an October 28, 1999, letter to forest service \n     managers, Mike Dombeck, Chief of the U.S. Forest Service \n     suggested that the Forest Service is attempting to complete \n     the environmental analysis of a permanent moratorium in a \n     ``short time frame.'' The U.S. Forest Service should not be \n     trying to ramrod a decision that will shut down forty million \n     acres of western lands into ``a short time frame.'' You \n     should be honoring the spirit, not to mention the clear \n     mandate, of NEPA by providing meaningful opportunity for \n     public participation and careful, principled, environmental \n     analysis; and\n       Whereas, the closing date for public comments was set for \n     December 20, 1999. With decisions on the management of over \n     forty million acres of land in the West at stake, the time is \n     clearly not adequate time for officials to thoroughly review \n     and analyze the proposal, and to provide the Forest Service \n     with informed and substantive comment. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Fifty-fifth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives concurring therein, that we respectfully \n     request that the U.S. Forest Service extend the deadline to \n     submit comments on the NOI by one hundred twenty days. An \n     expedited consideration of this request is appreciated. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved that the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is \n     hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this \n     Memorial to the President of the United States, the Chief of \n     the United States Forest Service, President of the Senate and \n     the Speaker of the House of Representatives of Congress, and \n     the congressional delegation representing the State of Idaho \n     in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-494. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Idaho relative to a United States Forest Service \n     proposed rule regarding forest service land and resource \n     management planning; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n[[Page S3607]]\n\n                     Senate Joint Memorial No. 106\n\n       Whereas, the United States Forest Service (USFS) published \n     in the Federal Register on October 5, 1999, a proposed rule \n     regarding forest service land and resource management \n     planning; and\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the State of Idaho advocates \n     improvements to the forest planning regulations; and\n       Whereas, the USFS needs to simplify, clarify and otherwise \n     improve the planning process as well as reduce the burdensome \n     and costly procedural requirements, and strengthen \n     collaborative relationships with the public and other \n     governmental entities; and\n       Whereas, the USFS organic act calls for multiple use in \n     managing the national forests with meaningful public input; \n     and\n       Whereas, the proposed rules are inconsistent with the \n     legislative direction for multiple uses and high-level \n     sustained yield outputs of the renewable timber resource; and\n       Whereas, timber production must remain a primary use in the \n     National Forest System; and\n       Whereas, the proposed rules would alter the multiple use \n     and sustained yield mandate prescribed by Congress. Moreover, \n     they reverse the multiple use priorities set by Congress by \n     subordinating timber production to achievement of biological \n     diversity and similar ecosystem goals; and\n       Whereas, no other law provides authority for the Forest \n     Service to alter the course of management and primary \n     purposes set by Congress for management of the National \n     Forest System; and\n       Whereas, the proposed rules lack commitment to carrying out \n     economic multiple uses; and\n       Whereas, the proposed rules fail to provide direction on \n     which plan revisions and amendments require environmental \n     impact statements. Procedures and standards should be revised \n     for significant plan amendments; and\n       Whereas, the proposed rules provide no effective date for \n     the adoption of an amendment or plan revision. Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Fifty-fifth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives concurring therein, that we request the \n     United States Forest Service not move forward with final rule \n     based on the October 5, 1999, proposal. Ecological \n     sustainability must start looking at current conditions of \n     the national forests and determining the desired future \n     conditions, which should be healthy forests for the American \n     people to use and enjoy. There should be aggressive, active \n     management, rather than passive management, to restore the \n     health of all land identified as being high risk to insect \n     and disease infestation and/or catastrophic wildfire. \n     Prohibiting management puts our forests at risk to insects, \n     diseases and fire. These proposed rules will cause greater \n     damage to our forests in the long run. Be it further\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of the State of Idaho \n     encourages the agency to readdress its entire approach to \n     ecosystem management. The agency needs to streamline and \n     clarify the forest planning and decision-making processes, \n     strengthen relationships with the public, ensure long-term \n     sustainability of forest ecosystems, and promote adaptive \n     management. The proposed rules cannot accomplish these \n     critical goals in its current form. Ecosystem management and \n     forest planning cannot be successful if the process becomes \n     the goal. Ecosystem management must instead be considered a \n     tool to accomplish the goals which are set in law and through \n     the development of forest plans. Be it further\n       Resolved that the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is \n     hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this \n     Memorial to the President of the United States, President of \n     the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of \n     Congress, and the congressional delegation representing the \n     State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-495. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Idaho relative to the Bureau of Land Management \n     actions relating to grazing in Owyhee County; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                     Senate Joint Memorial No. 107\n\n       Whereas, a developing scenario in Owyhee County has been \n     brought to the attention of the Legislature, and it is \n     appropriate that public attention be drawn to this situation \n     as representative of other similar events occurring in Idaho; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Bureau of Land Management is charged with \n     management of lands in Owyhee County known as the Cliffs \n     Allotment; and\n       Whereas, the BLM has notified holders of grazing permits in \n     the Cliffs Allotment that the grazing season will be reduced \n     by two and one-half months which is a 53% reduction in the \n     grazing allotment; and\n       Whereas, the area is managed to meet a requirement of six \n     inch stubble height at the end of the grazing season, a goal \n     which the BLM says has not been met despite photographic \n     evidence and independent monitoring to the contrary; and\n       Whereas, federal law requires one year's notice before any \n     significant reduction in grazing is ordered, a requirement \n     which has clearly not been met in this case; and\n       Whereas, a reduction of the size now contemplated would \n     effectively put five ranching families, with a long history \n     in the Cliffs Allotment and evidence of management efforts \n     which have actually improved the conditions of the allotment, \n     out of business; and\n       Whereas, the BLM is acting with callous disregard of the \n     local economy, the law, and the best interests of the land \n     and the people of Idaho; and\n       Whereas, the BLM must be brought to recognize and consider \n     all of the interests which are indigenous to the locale \n     including the legitimate goals of citizens who make their \n     living off the land. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Fifty-fifth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives concurring therein, that we join together \n     with the citizens of Owyhee County in their grievance against \n     the untenable action of the Bureau of Land Management in \n     limiting grazing permits with a reduction of the grazing \n     season by two and one-half months. Further, we urge \n     thoughtful reconsideration not only of this decision, but the \n     accumulating body of management decisions made by the Bureau \n     of Land Management which are resulting in further reductions \n     in the resources available to Idahoans who live off the land. \n     Be it further\n       Resolved that the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is \n     hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this \n     Memorial to the Director of the Idaho Office of the Bureau of \n     Land Management, the President of the Senate and the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives of Congress, and the \n     congressional delegation representing the State of Idaho in \n     the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-496.

Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Fifty-fifth Idaho Legislature, the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, that we \n     support the agreements made at the Idaho-Canada Summit, and \n     urge the United States Congress and the United States trade \n     representative to meet with the Canadian government to review \n     and reconcile their statistics concerning the cattle and beef \n     industry, so that the industries on both sides of the border \n     have access to accurate, comparable and timely data. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the states and provinces involved in the \n     Pacific Northwest Cattle Project meet and develop a \n     consistent set of cattle statistics and a single methodology \n     for gathering and reporting these statistics, and also \n     improve communication through regional meetings, tours and \n     exchanges. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the United States Department of Agriculture \n     and Agriculture Canada work towards the removal of federal \n     certificates and federal endorsement requirements for the \n     movement of cattle between Canada and the United States \n     within the Northwest region. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the states and provinces involved should be \n     encouraged to expand the Pacific Northwest Cattle Project for \n     feeder cattle from six months to twelve months access and \n     expand the project to include other classes of cattle. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed \n     to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of \n     Congress, and the congressional delegation representing the \n     State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-497.

Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Fifty-fifth Idaho Legislature, the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, That we \n     support the agreements made at the Idaho-Canada Summit, and \n     urge the United States Congress and the United States trade \n     representative to urge the government of Canada to remove the \n     prohibition on bulk shipment of potatoes between the United \n     States and Canada; and to recognize that United States \n     Department of Agriculture marketing orders should be \n     considered as a quality assurance measure and not as a \n     technical trade barrier. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the United States government should make \n     every effort to quickly harmonize and equalize laboratory \n     testing of potatoes so that there is mutual acceptance of \n     each country's respective test results. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the dialogue initiated during these meetings \n     should be continued through further meetings of smaller \n     working groups comprised of industry, state and provincial \n     representatives and that their recommendations should be \n     given great weight by their respective national governments. \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed \n     to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of \n     Congress, and the congressional delegation representing the \n     state of Idaho in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-498. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Idaho relative to full deductibility from \n     federal income taxes of health insurance premiums for \n     individuals, the self-employed small groups; to the Committee \n     on Finance.\n\n                     Senate Joint Memorial No. 108\n\n       Whereas, the Health Insurance Premiums Task Force was \n     established to identify, explore and address causes of the \n     alarming increase in the costs of health insurance; and\n       Whereas, in the course of its examination the task force \n     received extensive information, data and testimony from \n     consumers, employers and representation of the health care \n     industry, including carriers, agents, pharmaceutical \n     manufacturers, pharmacists, hospitals, physicians and other \n     health care providers; and\n       Whereas, the task force found that federal and state \n     reforms and mandates, including those requiring guaranteed \n     issue of insurance policies in the individual and small group \n     insurance markets, have created a segment of high risk \n     individuals who must be insured, causing the entire \n     population, and particularly the healthy, to pay much more \n     for health insurance; and\n       Whereas, the task force further found that the dramatic \n     increase in premium rates has driven expanding numbers of \n     healthy individuals into the ranks of the uninsured, \n     resulting in even greater costs to insurers to provide \n     required coverage for the high risk unhealthy population, and \n     greater costs to the remaining insured population; and\n       Whereas, the task force also determined that costs to \n     provide health care and treatment for uninsured individuals \n     is another significant factor in the high cost of health \n     insurance; and\n       Whereas, the task force concluded that among other possible \n     solutions, providing full deductibility from federal income \n     taxes of health insurances premiums for individuals, the \n     self-employed and small employers would bring the healthy \n     back into the insured market, lower costs to employers who \n     must provide coverage, reduce the uninsured population, and \n     restore a balance of risk in the market that will make health \n     insurance more affordable and accessible. Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Fifty-fifth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives concurring therein, That federal \n     legislation be enacted providing full deductibility from \n     federal income taxes of health insurance premiums for \n     individuals, the self-employed and small groups. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is \n     hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this \n     memorial to the President and Vice President of the United \n     States, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives of Congress, the congressional \n     delegation representing the state of Idaho in the Congress of \n     the United States, the President of the Senate and the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives of each State \n     Legislature, and to the presidential candidates.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-499. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the State of Illinois relative to Social \n     Security; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 32\n\n       Whereas, Social Security provides American workers and \n     their families with universal, contributory, wage-related, \n     inflation-adjusted benefits in the event of the retirement, \n     disability or death of a wage earner; and\n       Whereas, Social Security is more than a retirement program, \n     it is a family program; without Social Security, about 54 \n     percent of the population aged 65 and over, and more than 15 \n     million beneficiaries overall, would be living in poverty; \n     about 98 percent of children under age 18 can count on \n     monthly cash benefits if a working parent dies; seven and a \n     half million Americans with disabilities currently benefit \n     from the program; and\n       Whereas, throughout its existence as a federal program, \n     Social Security's trustees and administrators have carefully \n     modified the benefit and financing structure to ensure the \n     program's viability in light of demographic and economic \n     developments; and\n       Whereas, congressional leaders and the President are \n     seeking to engage the American people in a dialogue about \n     Social Security that could lead toward enactment of \n     bipartisan legislation ensuring Social Security's long-term \n     solvency; and\n       Whereas, Social Security is not in crisis and, without any \n     changes, could pay full benefits until 2032 and 75 percent of \n     benefits thereafter based on the most recent projections of \n     the Social Security Board of Trustees; and\n       Whereas, the long-term solvency of Social Security can be \n     ensured for future generations with measured and timely \n     adjustments to the program made by Congress; and\n       Whereas, the federal Medicare program provides health care \n     for the nation's citizens who qualify for Medicare benefits; \n     and\n       Whereas, Medicare benefits are the subject of reform \n     discussions in the United States Congress; and\n       Whereas, participants in the federal Medicare program do \n     not currently enjoy full coverage for prescription \n     medication; therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate of the ninety-first general \n     assembly of the State of Illinois, the House of \n     Representatives concurring herein, That the Congress of the \n     United States of America is hereby petitioned to preserve \n     Social Security as a contributory social insurance system \n     where risk is pooled among all workers and participation is \n     mandatory within a covered group; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Congress of the United States of America \n     be urged to ensure the long-term financial viability of \n     Social Security, as described above, and restore public \n     confidence in the future of the program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Social Security must continue as a federal \n     program, having a unified program allows for the portability \n     of benefits, disability and family support protections, and \n     maximum retirement security for low and moderate wage \n     earners; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge the Congress of the United States of \n     America to provide full benefit coverage for prescription \n     medication under the federal Medicare program; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     delivered to the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and \n     each member of the Illinois congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-500.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to Mortgage \n     Revenue Bonds; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 139\n\n       Whereas, State and local governments sell tax-exempt \n     Mortgage Revenue Bonds (MRBs) and pass on the interest \n     savings in discount mortgages to low income first-time home \n     buyers for rehabilitation and energy improvements for \n     existing homes, and to older home owners to use to draw on \n     their home equity for living costs; and\n       Whereas, Each state's annual supply of MRBs is grouped \n     under a more than 12-year-old limit with tax-exempt bonds for \n     industrial development, public-private partnerships for \n     municipal services, redevelopment of blighted areas, and \n     student loans. This limit is $50 per state resident and has \n     never been adjusted for inflation. Last session, the federal \n     Omnibus Appropriations Act contained partial, phased-in cap \n     relief, but it does not take full effect until 2007; and\n       Whereas, Since 1986, when the limit was enacted, the \n     economy has doubled in size, home prices for first-time \n     buyers have nearly doubled, and inflation has increased by 50 \n     percent. As a result, MRBs have lost nearly 50 percent of \n     their purchasing power. Moreover, the bond limit is \n     curtailing Michigan's ability to meet its housing needs; and\n       Whereas, More than 67 percent of low and moderate income \n     renters desperately want to own their own homes. Yet, \n     millions of teachers, fire fighters, police officers, and \n     industrial, service, and agriculture workers are denied the \n     opportunity of home ownership because their incomes are \n     insufficient; and\n       Whereas, MRBs have made first-time home ownership possible \n     for 2 million low-income families, about 125,000 every year. \n     A typical MRB mortgage saves as much as $100 a month in \n     comparison to a conventional mortgage.

Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Fifty-fifth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives concurring therein, That federal \n     legislation be enacted to increase Medicare reimbursements to \n     levels allowing providers to fully recover the actual costs \n     of providing necessary health care services to Medicare \n     eligible patients. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the Idaho Legislature \n     respectfully suggest that if the President and Congress are \n     sincere in their resolve to find solutions to the health care \n     crisis they should start by funding Medicare at appropriate \n     levels.

Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Fifty-fifth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives concurring therein, That we strongly \n     support efforts by the Idaho Department of Environmental \n     Quality to assert and maintain the leadership role in \n     designing and implementing a solution to the multiple \n     dilemmas in the Coeur d' Alene Basin. Be it further\n       Resolved, That we request the Environmental Protection \n     Agency to use its authority to support efforts by the Idaho \n     Department of Environmental Quality to resolve this problem \n     and to refrain from any strategic delays, unilateral \n     decisions or media manipulation.

Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Fifty-fifth Idaho Legislature, the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, That the \n     United States Environmental Protection Agency should, in \n     partnership with the states, reconsider and significantly \n     revise its TMDL proposed regulations and guidance, while \n     taking a more reasonable approach that:\n       1. Recognizes the limits of the TMDL statutory tool and \n     relies on the many effective approaches states have \n     undertaken under the Clean Water Act and other statutory \n     authorities in partnership with local government, federal \n     agencies and the private sector;\n       2. Uses Section 303(e) rather than Section 303(d) to \n     inventory water quality generally and establishes a more \n     focused basis for listing of waters under Section 303(d);\n       3. Provides states the ability to deal, in the most \n     reasonable, cost-effective manner possible, with complex or \n     difficult water quality situations, such as where legacy \n     pollutants, air deposition and nonpoint sources contribute to \n     impairment;\n       4. Provides fair and workable procedures for issuing new or \n     renewed permits, which allow flexibility in making reasonable \n     progress in reducing loadings, without imposing unnecessary \n     restrictions stifling economic growth;\n       5. Postpones the April 2000 listing of 303(d) waters for \n     which TMDLs will be required until two years after \n     promulgation of changes to the existing regulations;\n       6. Is performance based, enabling states to take \n     alternative ``functionally equivalent'' approaches through \n     regulatory and other means states deem appropriate so long as \n     their water quality standards will be achieved; and\n       7. Focuses the federal government on the priority need for \n     better funding of state monitoring and watershed technical \n     assistance. Be it further\n       Resolved That we request the congressional authorizing \n     committees and other interested committees to conduct \n     comprehensive hearings on the proposed rules and the Section \n     303(d) program in general, and ensure that a comprehensive \n     analysis of the economic and program impacts of the entire \n     TMDL program is completed; and be it further\n\n[[Page S3611]]\n\n       Resolved That due to the continued proliferation of \n     lawsuits, court orders and consent decrees that are placing \n     an onerous burden on many states, the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency should support state efforts to renegotiate \n     those requirements based on improvements made to the national \n     program. Be it further\n       Resolved That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed \n     to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of \n     Congress, and the congressional delegation representing the \n     state of Idaho in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-507.

A bill to fund task forces to locate and apprehend fugitives \nin Federal, State, and local felony criminal cases and give \nadministrative subpoena authority to the United States Marshals \nService; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   fugitive apprehension act of 2000\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Biden that will help address the growing \nproblem of fugitives by giving the U.S. Marshals Service tools they \nneed to apprehend fugitives from justice. Senator Biden and I have \nworked together many times over the years in support of Federal law \nenforcement.\n  Fugitives are those who the courts have found warrant prosecution or \nhave already been found guilty, but are attempting to beat the system. \nThese are individuals who, by their conduct, have indicated a complete \nlack of respect for our Nation's criminal justice system. This \nsituation represents not only an outrage to the rule of law but also a \nthreat to the safety and security of Americans. Fugitives from justice \noften continue to commit additional crimes while running free on the \nstreets.\n  According to some estimates, there are approximately 45,000 fugitives \nfrom justice in Federal felony cases. The number of serious Federal \noffense warrants received by the U.S. Marshals Service has increased \neach year for the past 4 years. Also, over one-half million fugitives \nin State and local felony cases have been entered into the database of \nthe National Crime Information Center or NCIC. This number is up from \n340,000 reported in 1990. Also, the NCIC receives only about 20 percent \nof all outstanding State and local felony warrants in the country. If \nthe NCIC estimates are correct, then there could be over 2.5 million \nState local fugitive warrants in felony cases alone. This does not even \ninclude misdemeanor warrants.\n  Mr. President, this is a serious problem. We must do more to address \nthe growing threat of fugitives on the State and Federal level. It is \ncritical to our fight against crime.\n  Task forces have been shown to be successful in tracking fugitives. \nThis legislation would create more multi-agency task forces around the \ncountry to locate and apprehend the enormous number of fugitives \nnationwide. The marshals involved would be directed by headquarters, so \nthey would not be diverted to tasks such as courtroom security. Also, \nthe task forces would be a joint effort, staffed by U.S. Marshals and \nState and local law enforcement authorities. These task forces would \nshare case workload and intelligence to locate and apprehend fugitives \nwanted in their jurisdictions.\n  Fugitives are the one investigative priority of the U.S. Marshals \nService. Because of this expertise, the marshals have been able to \nspecialize their personnel and investigative techniques to deal with \nthis one critical mission. Conducting an investigation to make a \ncriminal case against someone is nothing like trying to find a person \nwho does not want to be found. The same techniques used to conduct \ncriminal investigations cannot be used successfully in fugitive \ninvestigations. This puts the majority of law enforcement agencies at a \ndisadvantage, especially State and local law enforcement, who are \nforced to put their resources into a wide variety of normal police \nduties. These task forces can help State and local law enforcement \ndevelop greater expertise in this area so they can be more efficient \nand successful in tracking fugitives.\n\n  Fugitive investigations are very fluid and time sensitive. The \ndifference between locating and apprehending a fugitive or missing the \nindividual can be merely a matter of minutes.\n  The time-sensitive nature of these investigations often creates \nproblems under current Federal law. As a general matter, if there is no \nintent to indict the fugitive for escape, which is true in most \nfugitive cases, investigators may not use a grand jury subpoena to \nobtain information on the fugitive. Although investigators can get \ninformation through application to the court, the time necessary in \nseeking Federal court orders can make the difference between \napprehension and further flight of the fugitive.\n  This bill would remedy this deficiency in the law by providing the \nU.S. Marshals Service administrative subpoena authority in fugitive \ninvestigations. This subpoena authority is based on the same authority \ncurrent law already provides to the Drug Enforcement Administration in \ndrug investigations.\n\n[[Page S3613]]\n\n  In summary, this bill would help bring to justice dangerous fugitives \nthat are roaming the streets of America. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport this important initiative.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print into the Record a copy of the bill \nand a section-by-section explanation of its provisions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2516\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fugitive Apprehension Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

The attendance of witnesses and the production \n     of records may be required from any place in any State or \n     other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States \n     at any designated place where the witness was served with a \n     subpoena, except that a witness shall not be required to \n     appear more than 500 miles distant from the place where the \n     witness was served. Witnesses summoned under this section \n     shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid \n     witnesses in the courts of the United States.\n       ``(c) A subpoena issued under this section may be served by \n     any person designated in the subpoena to serve it. Service \n     upon a natural person may be made by personal delivery of the \n     subpoena to that person or by certified mail with return \n     receipt requested. Service may be made upon a domestic or \n     foreign corporation or upon a partnership or other \n     unincorporated association that is subject to suit under a \n     common name, by delivering the subpoena to an officer, to a \n     managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized \n     by appointment or by law to receive service of process.

The court may issue an order requiring the \n     subpoenaed person to appear before the Attorney General to \n     produce records if so ordered.

Administrative subpoenas to apprehend fugitives.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Section-by-Section Analysis--Fugitive Apprehension act of 2000\n\n     Section 1. Short title\n       The title is the ``Fugitive Apprehension Act of 2000.''\n     Section 2. Fugitive apprehension task forces\n       The purpose of this provision is to assist Federal, state \n     and local law enforcement authorities by forming several \n     multiagency task forces around the country to locate and \n     apprehend fugitives wanted by their jurisdictions.\n       The bill would authorize to be appropriated to the U.S. \n     Marshal Service funds to establish new permanent Fugitive \n     Apprehension Task Forces and supplement task forces already \n     operating in areas throughout the United States. The task \n     forces would be totally dedicated to locating and \n     apprehending fugitives under the direction of a National \n     Director and not under a specific District to insure that \n     they are not utilized for other USMS missions.\n     Section 3. Administrative subpoena authority\n       As a general matter, under Federal law, if there is no \n     intent to seek Federal indictment--as is true in a great \n     majority of fugitive apprehension investigations--law \n     enforcement officers may not use a grand jury subpoena to \n     obtain information relevant to a fugitive investigation. \n     Indeed, to do so would constitute abuse of the grand jury \n     process. Although there are some mechanisms to obtain this \n     information through application to the court, time spent by \n     law enforcement seeking state and federal court orders to \n     obtain the release of information can make the difference \n     between apprehension or further flight of a fugitive.\n       This provision would remedy the current deficiency in the \n     law by providing for administrative subpoena authority in \n     fugitive investigations. The provision is based on the \n     administrative subpoena authority provided in title 21, \n     United States Code, Section 876, which authorizes the \n     Attorney General to issue administrative subpoenas in \n     controlled substance related criminal investigations and \n     administrative proceedings. However, this provision \n     incorporates significant restrictions on its use in order to \n     satisfy concerns over an expansion in the use of \n     administrative subpoenas.\n       First, this is more narrowly tailored than Title 21, United \n     States Code, Section 876. The proposed section 1075 \n     authorizes the Attorney General to obtain only documents in \n     response to the subpoena, not testimony.\n       Second, the statute is limited in its application to \n     fugitives in Federal and state felony cases, not just those \n     suspected of committing crimes. The authority would only \n     apply to those who had been indicted.\n       Third, the statute strictly controls any delegation of the \n     Attorney General's authority to issue such subpoenas, by \n     requiring that any such delegation be accomplished only \n     through formal Attorney General guidelines that would be \n     subject to scrutiny. These guidelines would require that an \n     official at the level of Assistant Director in the Marshals \n     Service must approve any such subpoena.\n       Fourth, the statute requires that before a subpoena can be \n     issued, the Attorney General must find that the records \n     sought are ``relevant or material,'' i.e., there are \n     ``articulable facts'' that show the fugitive's whereabouts \n     may be discerned from the records sought.\n       Fifth, the statute makes clear that an administrative \n     subpoena issued under this section does not ``trump'' \n     protections accorded records under existing statutes, such as \n     electronic records whose production is covered by section \n     2703 of Title 18 and financial records whose production is \n     covered by section 3402 of Title 12. Rather, this statute is \n     to be construed and applied consistent with such existing \n     statutes.\n       Sixth, the statute requires the Marshals Service to report \n     to the Attorney General quarterly regarding the number of \n     administrative subpoenas issued, and this report will be \n     submitted to the Congress.\n\n[[Page S3614]]\n\n       This provision would help bring to justice the larger \n     number of federal fugitives whom the government has already \n     decided merit prosecution insofar as they have been \n     charged with and or convicted of a Federal felony offense \n     or have escaped after having been convicted of such an \n     offense. By their conduct, these individuals have \n     indicated a complete lack of respect for our nation's \n     criminal justice system. As to these fugitives, the \n     government does not need proof that they have moved in \n     interstate commerce prior to issuing a subpoena.\n       The provision also would allow Federal law enforcement \n     officials to issue an administrative subpoena to assist state \n     law enforcement officials in apprehending state fugitives \n     when they affect interstate commerce or when there is a \n     request for assistance from the appropriate state official, \n     and the Attorney General finds that the request gives rise to \n     a Federal interest sufficient to warrant the exercise of \n     Federal jurisdiction under section 1705. This portion of the \n     statute is modeled on similar provisions in Title 28 U.S.C. \n     sections 540 and 540a. It responds to the need of state \n     officials to use the unique, nationwide detection and \n     enforcement capabilities of Federal law enforcement agencies \n     in apprehending fugitives, many of whom cross state lines to \n     avoid capture. It also recognizes the importance of, and \n     provides additional support for, ongoing cooperation between \n     state and Federal officials in capturing fugitives, \n     particularly in joint Federal/state task forces.\n       Under Title 28 U.S.C. Section 566(e)(1)(B), the U.S. \n     Marshal Service has authority to investigate fugitive matters \n     ``as directed by the Attorney General.'' The FBI has \n     authority to investigate fugitive matters (in violation of \n     Title 18 U.S.C. section 1073) under Title 28 U.S.C. section \n     533(1). This bill would neither increase nor decrease the \n     Attorney General's authority under those statutory provisions \n     to direct the activities of the Marshal Service and the FBI.\n       Finally, it would provide investigators a mechanism to \n     obtain documentary information in cases alleging a violation \n     under the Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution (UFAP) statute \n     for fugitives fleeing from the testimonial responsibilities \n     or to avoid lawful process, 18 U.S.C. section 1073(2) and \n     (3). For this lower priority category of fugitives, it \n     incorporates by reference the UFAP interstate movement \n     requirement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 2517.

A bill to provide for the technical integrity of hte FM \nradio band, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                          FM RADIO ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. McCain: Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nto resolve the controversy that has erupted over the Federal \nCommunications Commission's creation of a new, noncommercial low-power \nFM radio service.\n  As you undoubtedly known, the FCC's low-power FM rules will allow the \ncreation of thousands of new noncommercial FM radio stations with \ncoverage of about a mile or so. Although these new stations will give \nchurches and community groups new outlets for expression of their \nviews, commercial FM broadcasters as well as National Public Radio \noppose the new service. They argue that the FCC ignored studies showing \nthat the new low-power stations would cause harmful interference to the \nreception of existing full-power FM stations.\n  Mr. President, legislation before the House of Representatives would \ncall a halt to the institution of low-power FM service by requiring \nfurther independent study of its potential for causing harmful \ninterference to full-power stations, and Senator Gregg has introduced \nthe same legislation in the Senate. While this would undoubtedly please \nexisting FM radio broadcasters, it understandably angers the many \nparties who are anxious to apply for the new low-power licenses. Most \nimportantly, it would delay the availability of whatever new \nprogramming these new low-power licensees might provide, even where the \nstation would have caused no actual interference at all had it been \nallowed to operate.\n  With all due respect to Senator Gregg and to the supporters of the \nHouse bill, I think we can reach a fairer result, and the bill I am \nintroducing, the FM Radio Act of 2000, is intended to do just that.\n  Unlike Senator Gregg's bill, the FM Radio Act would allow the FCC to \nlicense low-power FM radio stations. the only low-power FM stations \nthat would be affected would be those whose transmissions are actually \ncausing harmful interference to a full-power radio station. The \nNational Academy of Sciences--an expert body independent of the FCC--\nwould determine which stations are causing such interference and what \nthe low-power station must do to alleviate it.\n  It gives full-power broadcasters the right to sue any low-power FM \nlicensee for causing harmful interference, and stipulates that the \ncosts of the suit shall be borne by the losing party. Finally, to make \nsure that the FCC does not relegate the interests of full-power radio \nbroadcasters to secondary importance in its eagerness to launch the new \nlower-power FM service, the bill requires the FCC to complete all \nrulemakings necessary to implement full-power stations' transition to \ndigital broadcasters no later than June 1, 2001.\n  Mr. President, this legislation strikes a fair balance by allowing \nnon-interfering low-power FM stations to operate without further delay, \nwhile affecting only those low-power stations that an independent \nscientific body finds to be causing harmful interference in their \nactual, everyday operations. This is totally consistent with the fact \nthat low-power FM is a secondary service which, by law, must cure any \ninterference caused to any primary, full-power service. This \nlegislation will provide an efficient and impartial means to detect and \nresolve harmful interference. By providing a judicial remedy with costs \nassigned to the losing party, the bill will discourage the creation of \nlow-power stations most likely to cause harmful interference even as it \ndiscourages full-power broadcasters from making unwarranted \ninterference claims. And for these reasons it will provide a more \ndefinitive resolution of opposing interference claims than any number \nof further studies ever could.\n  Mr. President, in the interests of would-be new broadcasters, \nexisting broadcasters, but, most of all, the listening public, I urge \nthe enactment of the FM Radio Act of 2000.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",
