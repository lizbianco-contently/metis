Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 434, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of H.R. 434, an act \n     to authorize a new trade investment policy for sub-Saharan \n     Africa.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes for debate equally divided.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the motion to proceed \nto H.R. 434. As I indicated on Friday, when we proceeded to the bill, I \nwill offer a substitute to the House language that consists of the \nFinance Committee-reported bills on Africa, CBI, GSP renewal, and the \nreauthorization of our Trade Adjustment Assistance programs.\n  Each one of these measures deserves our support. What each represents \nin its own way is an attempt to reach out and provide not just a \nhelping hand, but an opportunity--an opportunity for millions around \nthe world to seize their own economic destiny.\n  Africa has for too long suffered from our neglect. The continent \nfaces daunting political, economic, and social challenges. Yet, African \nleaders are seizing the opportunity to press for political and economic \nchange.\n  The goal of the Finance Committee's Africa bill is to meet Africa's \nleaders half way. It is not a panacea for Africa's problems; rather, it \nis a small downpayment--an investment--in a partnership that I hope we \ncan foster through our actions here.\n  The Finance Committee's CBI bill does much the same. It builds on an \neconomic foundation begun with the passage of the original CBI in 1983, \nbut responds as well to the efforts of Caribbean and Central American \nleaders to rebuild their economies in the face of incalculable \ndevastation their countries faced this past year. The bill would afford \nthe same basic package of enhanced trade preferences offered to Africa \nunder the Finance Committee's bill.\n  The economic opportunities offered by the Finance Committee Africa \nand CBI bills extend to U.S. industry as well. According to the \nAmerican Textile Manufacturers Institute, the Finance Committee bills \nwould lead to an increase in their sales of $8.8 billion over 5 years \nand an increase in employment of 121,000 jobs. The bills are expressly \ndesigned to ensure that they are a benefit to Africa and the Caribbean, \nand to the United States as well.\n  The renewal of the Generalized System of Preferences would continue \nthe longstanding policy of the United States of opening our market to \ncreate economic opportunity throughout the developing world and merits \nour continued support.\n  The renewal of the Trade Adjustment Assistance programs is entirely \nconsistent with the theme of creating economic opportunity, but it is \nfocused on\n\n[[Page S13110]]\n\nhome. I have always maintained that those who benefit from trade should \nhelp those who are adversely affected. The TAA programs have lapsed and \nmust be renewed if we are to fulfill that commitment.\n  Now, much has been made in this debate of the fact that Finance \nCommittee bills entail a unilateral grant of preferences. The \nimplication is that there is nothing in this for the United States. In \nfact, the economic growth fostered by this legislation create new \nmarkets for our goods and services, as well as help create more \nprosperous and stable neighbors.\n  That is an investment I will make any time. I strongly encourage my \ncolleagues to support the cloture motion and the motion to proceed to \nH.R. 434.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield myself so much time as is \nallotted.\n  Mr. President, right to the point made by our distinguished chairman, \nthe expression was used, ``meeting halfway.'' I am of the school that \nNAFTA did not work. But assuming it did work, it at least included the \nside agreements with respect to the environment, side agreements with \nrespect to labor, and reciprocity with respect to the actual tariffs. \nThis particular bill has no reciprocity, whether it be in the \nCaribbean--we are prepared now to list the various tariffs there, \nminding you that the United States average textile tariff is about 10 \npercent.\n  I am looking at lists of the sub-Saharan Africa tariff rates: \nEthiopia, the average there would be about--I see some 65, but most of \nthem on apparel are 80 percent; other made-up products, textile, home \nfurnishings, 80 percent; Gabon, 30 percent for an average there; Ghana, \n25 percent. We are going to do away with the Ivory Coast, which has a \nmarkup also, a tariff; Kenya: 50, 50, 50, 62 percent on laminated \nfabric, 50 percent on apparel; the textile, home furnishings, another \n50 percent; Madagascar: 25 percent, 30 percent; Mauritius, 80 percent \nfor man-made filament yarn, textile floor coverings, apparel, textile; \nhome furnishings, 80 percent--I ask unanimous consent a summary of \nthese tariffs be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                APPENDIX\n\n                SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA TARIFF RATES--SUMMARY\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 Tariff rate\\1\\ (percent\n                                                       ad valorem)\n             HS Chapter and product             ------------------------\n                                                              Average\n                                                  Range     (estimate)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n50--Silk fiber, yarn and fabric................  0-100               15\n51--Wool yarn and fabric.......................  0-100               18\n52--Cotton yarn and fabric.....................  0-65                18\n53--Other vegetable fiber yarn and fabric......  0-100               15\n54--Manmade filament yarn and fabric...........  0-65                17\n55--Manmade staple fiber yarn and fabric.......  0-80                17\n56--Wadding felt & nonwovens, yarn, twine,       0-100               19\n cordage.......................................\n57--Carpets and other textile floor coverings..  0-100               34\n58--Special woven fabric, tufted fabric, lace,   0-100               24\n tapestries....................................\n59--Impregnated, coated, laminated fabric......  0-100               22\n60--Knit fabrics...............................  0-80                28\n61--Knit apparel...............................  0-100               31\n62--Apparel, not knit..........................  0-100               27\n63--Other made-up products, textile home         0-100               27\n furnishings...................................\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Summary of 28 countries' tariff rates (South Africa, Botswana,\n  Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, Central African Republic, Burkina Faso,\n  Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Ivory Coast,\n  Kenya, Madagascar, Malawai, Mali, Mauritius, Mozambique, Nigeria,\n  Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe).\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is for the sub-Sahara. Later, when we have more \ntime I will be delighted to list in there, too, what we have down in \nNicaragua and Panama, and the other so-called Caribbean Basin \nInitiatives.\n  The truth of it is, in the initial observation of our distinguished \nchairman that this is going to give millions around the world a chance \nto seek their economic destiny, my problem is it is going to sink the \neconomic destiny of the United States, particularly in the textile \nfield, as it were, and many other fields as we set the case for so-\ncalled free trade.\n  I wish I had the time to emphasize the fact there is no such thing. \nStarting with Alexander Hamilton, in the earliest days of David Ricardo \nand comparative advantage, and just after the fledgling colonies had \nwon their independence, that the Brits corresponded with Alexander \nHamilton saying now what you should do is trade best with what you \nproduce and we will trade back from the mother country with what we \nproduce best. In a little booklet, ``Reports On Manufacturers''--there \nis one copy left there at the Library of Congress--Alexander Hamilton, \nin a line said: Bug off. We are not going to remain your colony. We are \nnot going to continue to ship our wheat and our corn and our coal and \nour timber, our natural resources, like some kind of infant republic, \nand let you have the manufacturing strength.\n  As a result, on the 4th day of July, 1789, the second bill to pass \nthe National Congress after we had adopted the Resolution for the Seal \nof the United States, the second bill was a tariff bill of 50 percent \ncovering some 60 articles. We built this economic giant with \nprotectionism.\n  We maintain certain protections, oh, yes, we make sure we protect \nintellectual property, you know, that brainy crowd, that Microsoft \ncrowd that has 22,000 employees who are all millionaires; 22,000 \nmillionaires working for you. I wish I were one of them. That is a \nwonderful situation, when you have all that manpower. But the real \nstrength of our democracy is our middle class. Henry Ford said: Pay \nthem enough so they can buy what they are producing. That is how we \ndevelop, with our manufacturing strength, this industrial power, the \nUnited States of America.\n  Now there is a zeal for continuing foreign aid as foreign trade. This \nis not a trade bill, it is an aid bill. It is unilateral. It is a one-\nway street. It is not even like NAFTA. There are not any side \nagreements whatever, yet you do not find some of our leaders in the \nenvironment and in labor. I know not why the chairman mentioned ATMI. \nNo one has worked more intimately with ATMI than myself, until we got \nto NAFTA. Then the fabric boys said: The dickens with you apparel boys, \nwe are going for broke. Certain it is they can sew down in Mexico as \nwell as they do in the United States. That is your problem. Our problem \nis, with all this fine manufacturing, where we can produce the fabrics \nand continue to make a fortune.\n  So they just dropped their political strength. As the principal \nauthor of five textile bills that passed in this Senate in the last 30 \nyears or more, I know better than any that we have the votes from up in \nthe Northeast. The apparel boys--Saul Chaikin would turn over in his \ngrave at this particular bill. Herman Staorbin, Jack Sheinkman--real \nleaders. I don't know where they are today. I cannot find them around. \nThey seem to go along with foreign aid, export some more jobs. Yes, \nunder NAFTA, we lost 420,000 textile jobs. The chairman is quoting ATMI \nthat it is going to produce 121,000 jobs. That is pure poppycock. I \nmake a bet on it. Let him bet on his words, any odds he wants and I \nwill cover the bet. I can tell you here and now there is no chance of \ncreating the jobs. This is a one-way export of jobs.\n  That Finance Committee comes around and says: Exports, exports, we \nhave to emphasize exports. We do not have anything left to export. We \nare not exporting any software. We are not exporting the computers or \nanything else such as that. We had to put in Semitech to save the \nsemiconductor industry. They talk about aid and subsidies and \neverything else--oh, they are all for themselves but they are not for \nworking Americans.\n\n  It is unique. Here I am--I voted for the right-to-work law and I am a \nstrong supporter at the State level, not at the Federal level; I want \nmy advantage down there in South Carolina because that is how we are \ngetting a lot of good industry there; I want that individual decision--\nbut this so-called conservative southern Governor is now having to \nprotect organized labor when there is no one around this morning at \nall. There is no voice to be heard to save the jobs up there in the \nNortheast or anywhere else.\n  This is a sad occasion. Let me try to list some of those things we \nhave imported now, from the Center of Domestic Consumption, the various \nproducts there, to show you exactly where we are. With respect to the \nmachinery sector--48.9 percent of the machinery sector is represented \nin imports. I know with respect to textiles it is over 66 and two-\nthirds.\n\n[[Page S13111]]\n\n  I told the Members on Friday we were alarmed when it reached 10-\npercent import penetration in textiles. Now two-thirds of the clothing \nI am looking at is imported; 86 percent of the shoes. I know with \nrespect to electronic products it is 57.9 percent.\n  It is sad. We invented the radio and electronics, and the Japanese \nhave taken over in those areas. These things are too detailed to put in \nthe Congressional Record. I will have a better listing. Sometimes when \nyou try to get information, you get so much information it is totally \nuseless.\n  My point is, the strength and security of the United States of \nAmerica is like a three-legged stool: One leg is our values as a \nnation. That is unquestioned. Everyone knows America will commit in \nSomalia and help bring about freedom and democracy in Bosnia. As we \ntravel the world as Senators, we see we are the envy of the world with \nrespect to individual rights, freedom of mankind, and equal justice \nunder law. They all acknowledge that. We do not have to worry about \nthat leg.\n  The other leg, of course, is the military leg or military power. As \nthe one remaining superpower, that is unquestioned.\n  But the third leg, the economic leg, has been fractured. We have had \nforeign aid. It worked. This Senator is not complaining about it. I am \nmaking a factual observation as to where we are. Yes, we started after \nWorld War II and taxed ourselves some $85 billion for the Marshall \nPlan. We sent over our machinery, the best of our machinery, the best \nof minds, the technology, the managers, and capitalism has conquered \ncommunism in the Pacific rim and in Europe. We continued.\n  I will never forget, as a Governor, they said: Governor, come on, \nwhat do you expect these recovering and emerging nations to make, \nairplanes and computers? We will make the airplanes and computers, and \nthey will make the shoes and the clothing. My problem today is, they \nare making the shoes, they are making the clothing, they are making the \ncomputers, and they are making the airplanes. They are dumping them.\n  We are finally getting the attention of the Senators from Washington \nand Boeing. They are beginning to understand. I have had their \nopposition over many years with respect to trade because they like the \nFederal Government, in defense, doing all their research, they like the \nFederal Government putting in the Eximbank to subsidize their sales \noverseas. We never had subsidized sales for textiles. They love all of \nthat. Then they said: Oh, we have to get to work; we have a global \neconomy, competition, competition.\n  The textile industry--look at the record--for 15 years has reinvested \nan average of $2 billion a year modernizing. I told the story of the \nClinton plant the other day. It is 100 years old. It looks like from \nthe outside it will fall down, but it has the most modern machinery. \nThere was no one in the card room. Where they once had 125 in the weave \nroom, there are no more than 15. They have mechanized, computerized, \nand electronically controlled operations.\n  Those companies that have survived are the most productive, \ncompetitive textile industry in the entire world. Our problem is, it is \nnot going to pay to invest and continue to compete and survive for the \nplain and simple reason that this one-way street of foreign aid--I wish \nit were going to aid those countries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I will continue at the appropriate time. \nI thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to transfer my hour under \ncloture. I ask unanimous consent that the hour transfer to the \nDemocratic manager so it can be yielded to another Senator today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It is just a transfer of an hour. I do not think \nanybody will object to it. I have to make an appearance before the city \ncouncil of Isle of Palms relative to the loss of my home. I have to \nleave to make that appearance and come back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Paul \nHamrick, a congressional fellow in Senator Graham's office, be granted \nthe privilege of the floor during debate on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this side yields back what unexpended \ntime we have.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, under the previous \norder, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 215, H.R. 434, an act to authorize a \n     new trade and investment policy for sub-Sahara Africa:\n         Trent Lott, Bill Roth, Mike DeWine, Rod Grams, Mitch \n           McConnell, Judd Gregg, Larry E.

On this vote, the yeas are 90, the nays are 8. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I believe strongly in free trade. I \nbelieve in the productivity of the American worker. I believe in \nAmerican ingenuity and technology and I believe that, if we\n\n[[Page S13112]]\n\neliminate the barriers, our industry and our workers can compete \neffectively with anyone in the world.\n  I have always supported fast-track legislation to give the executive \nbranch the freedom to negotiate trade agreements with other nations.\n  But back in 1993, despite my inclination to support free trade, I \nwrestled long and hard with the facts and the figures and I determined \nthat NAFTA--the North American Free Trade Agreement--was not a good \nagreement for us.\n  It was a hard vote for me--in 1993--but I ended up voting against \nNAFTA. I was convinced that it would indeed cost this Nation jobs.\n  Unfortunately, time and the trade statistics have proven me right. \nNAFTA was a bad agreement. Since the implementation of NAFTA, we have \nmanaged to turn a trade surplus with Mexico of $1.7 billion a year into \na trade deficit that, this year, will exceed $20 billion.\n  The giant sucking sound has been heard in Kentucky--5,000 jobs from \nthe apparel industry--sucked out of the State and the Nation. Thousands \nof appliance manufacturing jobs have drifted south to Mexico. At least \n7,000 Kentucky jobs are gone.\n  In particular, the apparel and textile industries have been \ndevastated. In the last 56 months--since the implementation of NAFTA, \nthe apparel industry has lost 305,000 jobs, and the textile industry \nhas lost 125,000 jobs.\n  They are just gone, disappeared.\n  Now, we are being asked to expand portions of this agreement to \ninclude the other Caribbean and Central American countries--and to \nprovide new trade preferences for the 48 countries of Sub-Saharan \nAfrica.\n  Basically, we are being asked to take a failed policy--NAFTA--and \nexpand it dramatically. That makes absolutely no sense at all.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this expansion of NAFTA and the \nguaranteed loss of additional U.S. jobs.\n  The CBI parity portion of this legislation is based on the premise \nthat we need to spur economic growth in the Caribbean and Central \nAmerica. The same arguments are used in favor of this bill that were \nused in support of NAFTA.\n  Supporters say that economic growth and investment in our neighbors \nto the south will benefit us in terms of increased exports and \nincreased domestic employment because of those exports. And that logic \nis very difficult to dispute--over the long haul.\n  Certainly, healthy economies in the Caribbean and Central American \ncountries would open new export opportunities for U.S. goods and \nservices. Certainly, expanding economies in the area would reduce the \npressure of immigration--legal and illegal alike.\n  Certainly we want healthy economies in this area to help strengthen \nthe growth and stability of democracy in our neighborhood.\n  We do need to do everything we can, within reason, to encourage \neconomic growth in the Caribbean. It makes sense.\n  But it doesn't make sense to sacrifice an entire U.S. industry and \nhundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs to do it. And that is what this bill \nwill do.\n  The Caribbean Basin apparel and textile business is already booming. \nLast year, apparel and textile exports from the Caribbean and Central \nAmerica to the United States grew 9 percent, a growth rate double that \nof the U.S. economy.\n  At $8.4 billion in 1998, textile and apparel exports from the \nCarribean Basin countries to the United States already exceed the $7.5 \nbillion in textiles and apparel exported to our Nation by Mexico.\n  When it comes to helping expand the economies of the Caribbean \ncountries and Central American countries, the American textile and \napparel workers have already given at the office--430,000 jobs have \nbeen lost to help fuel this exodus.\n  Expanding NAFTA in this way, at this time, will simply reward the \ncompanies that have already left the United States and sent their \nmanufacturing facilities to the Carribean Basin because of lower wages.\n  In the process, we stand to lose another 1.2 million jobs in the \napparel and textile industry.\n  Ask the people in Campbellsville, Kentucky if that makes sense to \nthem.\n  It doesn't.\n  The African trade portion of this bill doesn't make much more sense.\n  I think that everyone certainly agrees that we need to encourage \neconomic development in Africa. It is in our long-term best interests \nto establish strong trade linkages with Africa because it is a huge \npotential market for U.S. goods.\n  And if this bill simply provided incentives for increased \nmanufacturing and production of African products, I would probably not \nhave any problem with it.\n  But this bill doesn't just open the door for increased trade with \nAfrica--it opens, even wider, the door to a flood of Asian products \nthat could further devastate our domestic textile and apparel industry. \nSo, our good intentions would, in all likelihood benefit Asia much more \nthan Africa.\n  The bill creates a huge new incentive for transshipments of Asian \ngoods through Africa.\n  Transshipment is nothing new. Asian manufacturers have been illegally \ntransshipping goods into the United States through Africa for more than \n15 years.\n  Customs has estimated that transshipments from Asia have grown from \n$500 million in 1985 to $2 billion, and possibly as much as $4 billion \na year. Africa has been one of the major transshipment routes into this \ncountry.\n  This bill, because it lowers tariff duties dramatically, would create \nan almost irresistible incentive to cheat even more.\n  And ironically that cheating will actually undermine NAFTA and the \nCaribbean Basin Initiative which include strict anti-fraud provisions \nthat safeguard our domestic producers to some extent.\n  Because it offers lucrative incentives for Asia to transship and no \nrealistic methods to prevent transshipment, billions of dollars of \nillegal Asian imports will enter the United States duty free and quota \nfree from Africa in direct competition with NAFTA and Caribbean Basin \nproducts.\n  And no matter how good U.S. workers are, they can't compete against \nAsian imports that are subsidized from fiber production on down.\n  The U.S. Customs Service doesn't have the resources to stop illegal \ntransshipment. Local African customs officials don't have an incentive \nto stop it.\n  Asian manufacturers, who dominate world trade in textiles and apparel \nare unlikely to invest money in Africa if it is more cost effective to \ntransship through Africa.\n  And that means the Asian manufacturers will either transship the \nentire garment or they will only do minor assembly work in Africa. \nEither way, the yarn, the fabric and most, if not all, of the labor \nwill come from Asia.\n  A couple buttons or a zipper here and there might be added in Africa, \nbut this trade bill will benefit Asia much more than Africa and African \nworkers.\n  So, here we have two trade bills wrapped into one. Both are flawed. \nBoth jeopardize domestic industries and domestic workers who have been \ndevastated already.\n  The Caribbean Basin Initiative portion of this bill expands NAFTA--\nwhich has already been costing us thousands--hundreds of thousands of \njobs--many of them from my home State of Kentucky.\n  It rewards companies which have already moved their jobs from the \nUnited States to the Caribbean and for what purpose?--to expand growth \nin an industry which is already growing very nicely in those Caribbean \nnations.\n  More U.S. jobs will be lost as a result.\n  The African trade provisions in this bill are designed to increase \ninvestment and expand the manufacturing base in Africa. But in the \nabsence of strong, realistic restrictions on transshipment of Asian \nmanufactured products, this bill would, in all likelihood, benefit Asia \nmore than Africa.\n  And it would further devastate the apparel and textile industries in \nour own country.\n  I still believe in fair trade. But there is nothing fair about this \nbill for the U.S. apparel and textile industries.\n  We keep talking about creating a level playing field when it comes to \nfair trade. But this bill pulls the field right out from under U.S. \nindustries which have already had an uphill fight just to stay alive.\n\n[[Page S13113]]\n\n  It doesn't make any sense. And I urge my colleagues to vote against \nit. NAFTA should have taught us a lesson.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have a question. If the Senator from \nFlorida is going to speak now, I am not actually trying to get the \nfloor ahead of him. I wanted to ask the Senator from Florida, is it his \nintention to speak on this legislation now?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am prepared to yield time to the Senator if he is \nprepared to speak at this time.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield? I had indicated to \nour colleague, the Senator from Louisiana, who wishes to make a \nmemorial statement for our colleague, Senator Chafee, that he would \nhave an opportunity to do so at this time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Absolutely. Of course.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13113-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13113-S13116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF SENATOR JOHN CHAFEE\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to rise to express \nmy thoughts about the loss of a great friend and a dear colleague, \nSenator John Chafee. The Senate has lost a great Senator and this \ncountry has, indeed, lost a great American. All of us in the Senate \nfamily have lost a great friend.\n  John Chafee was a Senator who thought of what was best for his \ncountry first and thought about the politics, if he did at all, last. \nAll of his colleagues, I know, will have great personal memories of \nSenator Chafee, how their paths crossed over the years, and the work he \ndid as a leader of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. \nOn our own Senate Finance Committee, when we had such historic debates, \nSenator Chafee was always in the midst of them. I know his work on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee will ensure all Americans in the \nfuture will breathe cleaner air and drink cleaner water and have to \nworry less about their health because of the environment in which we \nall live. He always was a leader in the environmental area and will \nalways be noted for that. It is true; all of us are better off for the \nservices he provided in that capacity.\n  I remember John Chafee and the efforts he and I undertook together. \nIt was, indeed, my privilege to work with him on what became known as \nthe Centrist Committee, a centrist coalition. Senator Chafee was \nenthusiastic about finding a consensus on the difficult issues that \nfaced our country, but he was concerned about more than just trying to \nfind a consensus; he was really concerned about creating a consensus. \nHis efforts in our little coalition produced some dramatic results \nbecause he, in hosting these meetings with our colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle, truly recognized solutions to difficult problems \ncannot come from the far left or the far right. These difficult \nsolutions must be found in the center, and that is where I think he \nfound himself most comfortable.\n  We used his hideaway office here in the Senate almost on a weekly \nbasis, as I said, to host meetings between Republicans and Democrats \nwho worked together. We talked to each other rather than merely \nlistened to echoes of ourselves. We actually spoke about the issues and \ntried to find and recommend solutions that were not necessarily good \npolitical solutions but were the right thing to do for this country.\n  I think his greatest accomplishment in this area that I remember was \nthe recommendations that he helped guide in the area of health care. We \nultimately brought them to the floor of the Senate and they were \nadopted by a very strong majority of this Senate, to a large extent \nbecause of the credibility John Chafee brought when he was listed as \nbeing one of the principal cosponsors. Unfortunately, those \nrecommendations did not become the law of the land, but I am certain, \nand very confident, that one day they will.\n  So John Chafee will be missed by all of us. He served his State and \nhe served his Nation very well. I look to the day in the Senate when \nthere will be more John Chafee's. Certainly this Nation and this \ncountry needs them and we deserve them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing my \nprofound sadness on the passing of our good colleague and our great \nfriend, Senator John Chafee, and to offer my most sincere condolences \nto his wife Ginny, their 5 children, and 12 grandchildren, the entire \nChafee family, and also people in Rhode Island, who have lost a strong \nadvocate, a compassionate leader, and a true friend.\n  This body and this Nation are diminished today by the loss of one of \nthe finest people I have ever had the privilege to know in politics.\n  Senator Chafee's life was an ode to the finest ideals of public \nservice. He fought in World War II and Korea because he believed in \nfreedom. He served in the State legislature and as Governor of Rhode \nIsland because he loved his State. He answered the call to become \nSecretary of the Navy because he wanted us to have the best defensive \nforce in the world. He ran for the Senate because he thought he could \nmake a difference, and what a difference he has made.\n  I had the honor of working with Senator Chafee in this body for only \na little under 5 years, but as did everyone else on Capitol Hill, I had \nlong known of his reputation for thoughtfulness and reason. Indeed, for \nanyone who really cared about the art of legislating, John Chafee was a \nhousehold name.\n  I consider myself fortunate for the opportunity to have worked with \nthis great American and to have seen firsthand why he engendered such \nrespect and affection from both sides of the aisle and from all \npolitical persuasions. He was an extraordinary man of sincere humility, \nboundless energy, and steadfast integrity. It was difficult enough \ncoming to terms with his impending retirement from the Senate. Now it \nwill be immeasurably more difficult to come to terms with his passing.\n  Throughout my tenure in the Senate, I have felt a special kinship \nwith Senator Chafee on a number of levels. For one thing, he and his \nwife Ginny have long had a home in my State of Maine, a home that has \nbeen in his family more than 100 years, in the beautiful town of \nSorrento just across the bay from where my husband's family has a \nplace. And we had a chance to see them during the course of the summer. \nClearly, I knew from the start that Senator Chafee was a man of \ndiscerning taste.\n  In fact, he would often say--only half-jokingly--he considered \nhimself the third Senator from Maine. If such a thing were really \npossible, we could not have been more honored, and we certainly could \nnot have had a better advocate for our great State.\n  On the political front, I always saw Senator Chafee as something of a \nkindred spirit. He epitomized what it meant to be a modern, moderate \nRepublican. For him, compromise was a way things got done. It was the \nway we distilled all the opinions, all the issues, all the viewpoints, \nand arrived at legislation that could change America and change lives \nfor the better. For John Chafee, there was strength in compromise, \ncourage in compromise, honor in compromise, and he was right. He viewed \nit not as an abdication of principle but a catalyst for constructive \npolicy.\n  Senator Chafee was willing to take risks in order to do what he \nbelieved was in the best interests of Rhode Island and our country. For \nhim, leadership and the public good were two concepts forever and \neternally intertwined. Sometimes that meant being a lone voice in the \nwilderness, and he was willing to be that voice.\n  Time and again, John Chafee was there, both out in front and behind \nthe scenes, as Senator Breaux just mentioned, forging consensus, \nbreaking deadlocks, and bringing people together on countless issues \nthat were key for Americans, issues that resonate today in people's \ndaily lives and will continue to resonate for generations to come.\n  John Chafee always put ideas ahead of ideology. That is why he was at \nthe forefront of the legislative and political debates in Congress. He \nproposed sensible, viable, and realistic alternatives. I well remember \nin the budget\n\n[[Page S13114]]\n\ndebates of 1995 and 1996 when Senator Chafee joined Senator Breaux to \nform a bipartisan group of Senators to bridge the political gulf that \nhad opened in the aftermath of the Government shutdown. I was proud to \nbe a member of that group because John Chafee was never about making \nthe political points; John Chafee was about making the process work, \nand that is precisely what he did during the budget debate and \nthroughout his entire 23 years in the Senate.\n\n  He was a tireless advocate on so many issues vital to the future of \nthis country, perhaps none more important than the health of our \nNation's environment. In fact, when it comes to the protection of our \nnatural resources, it can truly be said that John Chafee has left a \nlasting mark on the landscape of America.\n  He was a strong voice for the environment, shepherding the Clean Air \nAct of 1990 and consistently supporting the preservation of our \ncountry's precious wetlands and open spaces. He has played a role in \nevery major Federal initiative to control pollution and protect our \nnatural resources over the past 20 years, and it is testament to his \nvision that generations of Americans not even born will have John \nChafee to thank for a healthier world.\n  Of course, it is not only the health of our environment he sought to \nprotect. Until the very end, John Chafee was a champion for those less \nfortunate, and that includes health care for low-income families and \nexpanded health coverage for uninsured low-income children. He was a \nvisionary on the issue of child care. He knew we had to make it safer, \nmore accessible, more affordable, and it was my privilege to join him \nin that fight.\n  More recently, just last week, I joined him on a bill he and Senator \nRockefeller introduced that will help foster children make the \ntransition to independent living. Just shortly after I learned of \nJohn's passing, I had to get on a plane yesterday, and I picked up a \nnewspaper and read an editorial in the Los Angeles Times, in fact, \npraising this legislation, saying this is not extending a welfare \nproject but building a bridge to independence. That is the type of \napproach John would take on issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Oct. 25, 1999]\n\n                         Fostering Life Skills\n\n       Every year 20,000 foster children, in the United States \n     turn 18 and are ``emancipated.'' It's a cheerful euphemism \n     for loss--of shelter, health care and their foster parents.\n       Federal Health and Human Services statistics show that many \n     former foster children lack the resources and training to \n     make much of their abrupt freedom. In Los Angeles County, for \n     instance, fully half of the 1,000 foster children who are \n     ``aged out'' of the system every year end up homeless within \n     six months.\n       Legislation now pending in the Senate Finance Committee, by \n     Sens. John Chafee (R-R.I.) and John D. Rockefeller (D-W. \n     Va.), gives Congress a chance to recognize what any parent \n     raising an adolescent already knows: Yanking the whole safety \n     net at age 18 can be a recipe for disaster.\n       Since 1992, Washington has allocated $70 million a year to \n     states that want to help foster children ages 16 to 18 \n     prepare for independent living by teaching them how to budget \n     money, prepare for college and find a job. The modest Chafee/\n     Rockefeller bill would double funding to $140 million a year, \n     allow that money to be spent helping those over 18 and extend \n     Medicaid eligibility to those ages 18 to 21.\n       This is not extending a welfare crutch; it's building a \n     bridge to independence. ``Bridges to Independence'' is in \n     fact the name of a nonprofit program in Los Angeles that has \n     successfully given older foster children the tools they \n     need--from a sympathetic ear to job-interview counseling and \n     apartment-hunting skills--to lead productive lives.\n       Chafee and Rockefeller have asked Congress to approve their \n     bill by voice vote and send it to President Clinton this \n     week.\n       Congress is scrambling to approve several higher-profile, \n     multibillion-dollar spending bills before recessing next \n     week. And fast-tracking the bill, which largely mirrors \n     President Clinton's fiscal year 2000 budget requests for \n     foster care, means getting the approval of fervent anti-\n     Clinton Republicans like House Majority Whip Tom Delay (R-\n     Texas). However, the bill is gaining broad support in \n     Congress and was championed in Senate testimony last week/19 \n     by none other than Delay. Delay explained that, as the foster \n     father of two adolescents himself, he understands the \n     problems of the foster children who testified before him. One \n     ``emancipated'' foster child told legislators how she ended \n     up sleeping behind McDonald's, in laundry rooms and hospitals \n     ``because they were safe and they were warm.''\n       The United States can surely do better by its most \n     vulnerable youth than a ``safe, warm'' laundry room to call \n     home.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, that was typical of John Chafee. He saw the \npotential of people--the best in people--and did everything he could to \nenhance their lives. He did not just root for the underdog; he was on \nthe field helping the underdog. We can attribute more than a few upset \nvictories over the years to his efforts.\n  It is hard for me to believe it was just 6 days ago I saw John at the \nweekly lunch we moderate Republicans hold every Wednesday. We take \nturns holding them in our offices. Last week, it was in John's office. \nLittle did we know it would be for the last time.\n  It was a tradition he started in 1995. Back then, our circle included \nSenators Cohen and Kassebaum. We always looked forward to them. They \nwere our refuge to discussions of what was happening on the floor, in \nthe Senate, and in the country. It was a refuge from the ``hurly-\nburlyness'' of the process in the Senate with like-minded Senators. It \nwas a tradition we looked forward to every week. I know it will not be \nthe same without him.\n  At these luncheons, John always brought to the table the issues about \nwhich he most cared. We would also expect he would have a list of \nissues and legislation he was promoting that he thought was important \nto bring to our attention and to get our support. In fact, John was \njust speaking last week, as I said, about the foster children \nlegislation, and I joined him on that issue because he was so \npassionate, as he was on all of the issues, whether it was child care, \nthe environment, or families on welfare looking to make a better life \nfor their family. Such talk never surprised any of us in the room \nbecause it was the essence of the man; it was what drove him.\n  Once again, it was also revealed in words forged by deep compassion \nand unyielding humanity in so many respects. Maybe it sounds trite in \nour world at the end of the 20th century, maybe it sounds old fashioned \nin a time when cynicism is celebrated over optimism, but John Chafee \ncared. He was a good man who believed he had something to offer the \nNation in which he felt privileged to live, and he saw public service \nas a noble calling. Ironically, perhaps, it is precisely because of \npeople such as John Chafee that public service remains a noble calling.\n  So today, there is a hole in the Senate where this great man once \nwas. There is an empty desk on this floor where a remarkable leader \nonce stood. There is a hollowness in our hearts.\n  But even in the midst of our sadness, let us also celebrate the life \nof a man who brought such extraordinary credit upon himself, his \nfamily, his State, and this institution. Senator Chafee now and forever \nwill be a part of this Chamber. His compassionate and reasoned voice \nwill forever echo from these walls, and his legacy will endure. It is a \nlegacy we would all do well to follow.\n  We measure success in our lives and in this body by many different \nstandards. But at such a solemn time as this, I cannot help but think \nof the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson who wrote:\n\n       . . . to know even one life has breathed easier because you \n     have lived. . . . This is to have succeeded.\n\n  So many lives have breathed easier because John Chafee lived, because \nJohn Chafee cared, because John Chafee was a United States Senator.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Florida.\n  Yesterday, as I was driving with my wife to the airport in \nSpringfield, IL, to catch the plane, we were listening to National \nPublic Radio and heard that my friend and colleague, Senator John \nChafee, had passed away. I turned to my wife and said: This was a \nreally special guy. I am sorry you didn't get to know him.\n  I have only served in the Senate for a little over 2 years. I look \nover there at his desk, which now has a bouquet of flowers, and realize \nthat just a few days ago we were on the floor together talking about \nlegislation and votes.\n  He was such an extraordinary man. In the 2\\1/2\\ years I have been \nhere, I\n\n[[Page S13115]]\n\ncame to know him and developed a friendship across the aisle, Democrat \nto Republican. I really came to respect John Chafee. He has an amazing \nstory. Tom Brokaw has a famous book that is very popular called ``The \nGreatest Generation,'' about the men and women who served our country \nin World War II and what special people they were. John Chafee was one \nof those people. To leave Yale and enlist at the age of 20, to go into \nthe Marines and be part of the invasionary force on Guadalcanal, and \nthen to come back and complete his education but to consider his \nobligation to his country so paramount he left again to serve in the \nKorean war under some very difficult circumstances, it shows a special, \npersonal commitment to public service. Many of us, myself included, \nstand in awe when we consider that.\n  Then, of course, he served as Secretary of the Navy during the \nVietnam war, a very controversial period in our history, and was \nregarded as a fair and honest man in that responsibility. Three times \nGovernor of his State of Rhode Island, four times elected as Senator \nfrom a State which has historically elected more Democrats than \nRepublicans, it was quite a tribute to John Chafee that he was elected \ntime and again by his neighbors and friends in the State of Rhode \nIsland.\n  Here on the Senate floor he played an important role. In my mind, he \nwas a constant reminder of what the Senate could be on a good day; that \nthere could be people of like mind on both sides of the aisle coming \ntogether to find bipartisan solutions. When I would have a gun control \nbill I wanted to offer to try to reduce gun violence, I would look \nacross the aisle. I always knew John Chafee would stand up and come to \nthe press conference. We would announce the bill. As we would leave, he \nwould say: I know I am going to hear it again from the National Rifle \nAssociation back home but, he said, I just think this is the right \nthing to do.\n  It wasn't just on issues of gun violence. You could find the same \nthing when it came to issues to protect the environment. John Chafee \nalways stood out from the pack. He was always a special person, trying \nto build an alliance, trying to build a coalition.\n  I recall when he came to me and asked me to do him a personal favor. \nAs a junior Member of the Senate who respected him so much, I wasn't \ngoing to say no. But he told me he had been chosen by the Chicago \nCouncil on Foreign Relations to head up an Atlantic Forum that took \nplace every 2 years, bringing together political leaders from Europe, \nSouth America, and North America to talk about the future. He asked me \nif I would be kind enough to attend that conference in Portugal.\n  I thought about it and realized if it was important to him, it should \nbe important to me. We went to Portugal together. John Chafee presided \nover about the 150 gathered to talk about some very involved political \nissues. He did it with such grace and style, such knowledge of the \nsubject. It was one of the more successful conferences I ever attended. \nWhen it was over, he announced, shortly thereafter, that he was going \nto retire from the Senate. He came and asked me, as a favor, would I \nconsider taking over the chairmanship of this forum.\n  It was a great honor that he would even ask me to consider following \nin his footsteps, after he had written such an envious record as the \nchairman of the Atlantic Forum. I have agreed to do that. I hope it \nwill continue in his memory.\n  As he tried to bridge the ocean to make sure people in North America \nand South America and Europe came together to find common ground, he \ndid the same thing day in and day out in the Senate.\n  Just a few months ago we had a contentious debate over gun control. \nAt the last moment, Vice President Gore came in to cast the deciding \nvote. An important bill left the Chamber, but before that vote was \ncast, I was talking to John Chafee about this issue on which we held \ncommon views. He talked to me about what we could accomplish on the \nSenate floor and how we shouldn't go too far. He said: A lot of my \ncolleagues over here on the Republican side disagree with me on this \nissue. I think we ought to stop at this point. I think we have made our \npoint, and we have a good bill. We should proceed.\n  When I came back over to the Democratic side, I said: This is the \nadvice of John Chafee. A lot of Democratic Senators looked and nodded \nbecause they knew it was good advice. It was not only good advice from \nthe head; it was advice from the heart. That was the kind of person he \nwas, respected so much for his intelligence but respected even more for \nhis kindness and his compassion.\n  I am honored to serve in the Senate. There are moments in public life \nwhen each of us think twice about whether we chose the right career. \nBut there are also moments that are ennobling moments, when you feel as \nif you were part of a great institution for a great Nation. I always \nfelt working with John Chafee embodied those moments. He spoke to the \nbest of the Senate.\n  He was a good friend, a great colleague, and he was a great American \nwho served his Nation in so many ways. We are going to miss John \nChafee, but his memory will endure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, before yielding time to the Senator from \nMinnesota, I will take a few moments to also share some thoughts about \nour departed colleague, John Chafee.\n  I had the great privilege of serving with John Chafee for nearly 13 \nyears. We served together on the Environment and Public Works Committee \nand on the Finance Committee and had many opportunities to work closely \ntogether.\n  John Chafee was the kind of public servant whom citizens in a \ndemocracy hope to have representing them. He represented a small State, \nboth geographically and relatively, in population. It is the kind of \nState where the citizens have an intimate relationship with their \nelected representatives; they know them personally; they can evaluate \ntheir character; they are not dependent on a flickering 30-second \ntelevision ad to give them information about the people who are seeking \ntheir vote.\n  Election after election, in a largely Democratic State, Republican \nJohn Chafee received the vote of the people of the State of Rhode \nIsland, a great tribute to the fundamental character of the citizens of \nthat State and the man who gave his life in the service of that State.\n  John Chafee's life was epitomized by the word ``service.'' As \nGovernor, as Secretary of the Navy, as a Senator, he displayed wisdom, \ndedication, and patriotism. Those qualities had been molded in the \nflames of World War II and the Korean war, where he served in some of \nthe most intense combat. I imagine when some people suggested that a \nvote in the Senate was a testing vote, a difficult vote, he might have \nput that in the context of what he experienced in his young adult life \nat Guadalcanal.\n  As a colleague, I particularly admired the thoughtful, pragmatic \nmanner in which he approached his duties in the Senate. He was a \nmentor. I remember the first committee meeting in which I participated, \nwhich was a markup, a meeting in which legislation was before the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee for action and then \nrecommendation to the full Senate. It was the 1987 version of the \ntransportation bill, always a controversial matter.\n  I had come to that committee with a number of ideas from my previous \nState experience in Florida. I was enthusiastic and had some amendments \nto propose. On the first day of committee consideration of this \nlegislation, I was fortunate to get two of my amendments adopted. After \nthe vote on the second amendment, Senator Chafee, speaking across the \ncommittee room from his position on the Republican side, said to me: \nGood work; now I recommend you quit.\n  That was good advice for that day.\n  His willingness and distinctive ability to reach out to Senators with \nall points of view kept the Senate at the reasonable center of American \npolitics. John Chafee was proud to be categorized a moderate, proud to \nassume the label of a centrist. He brought common sense to our \ndeliberations.\n  The Senate has sometimes been analogized to ``the saucer,'' as in a \ncup and saucer. It is the place where the hot tea or coffee is poured \nso that it can be cooled before it is consumed. That was\n\n[[Page S13116]]\n\none of the rationales of our Founding Fathers, establishing a bicameral \nlegislature with one house being very close to the people and one house \nbeing, hopefully, a more deliberative body. John Chafee epitomized that \nconcept of the place where the hot passions are reconciled.\n  John Chafee was also the kind of person who was more interested in \nresults than with recognition. There probably are some pieces of \nlegislation that are known as the Chafee act, or have his personal name \nassociated with them. But, frankly, today, I cannot recall what that \nmight be. I think John Chafee is perfectly satisfied with that. His \ngoal was not to have his name etched in legislative marble or stone \nbut, rather, to achieve a result. He was interested in building the \nedifice, not whose name was on the cornerstone of the edifice. That was \nthe kind of human being John Chafee was.\n  As a result of his commitment to results rather than recognition, in \nfact, some of the Senate's most memorable achievements in recent years \nbear his imprint. Expanded environmental protections, a balanced \nbudget, and an improved transportation system were the results of his \nleadership and influence.\n  As with all of us, John Chafee was a good friend, a trusted \ncolleague. John will be sorely missed. He leaves a legacy that adds \ndistinction to this body and to the title of public servant. We all \nsend our deepest sympathy and best wishes that solace will be found in \nthe great accomplishments of this truly great man, and that his family \nand the thousands of persons fortunate enough to call John Chafee a \nfriend will find a solace and a capacity to deal with the grief that we \nall suffer today.\n  Mr. President, I yield such time as he may wish to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, for those who might be \nwatching our deliberations, I had a chance to speak yesterday about \nSenator Chafee. I will get back to the debate on this legislation.\n  As I listened to my colleagues, I was reminded of a press conference \nthat we had several months ago on some work I have been doing with \nSenator Domenici. The legislation is called the Mental Health Equitable \nTreatment Act, which we very much want to pass this year. Certainly, we \nwon't get it done in the next 2 weeks, but I hope we will when we come \nback. I remembered that one of the original cosponsors was Senator \nChafee. I agree with what everybody has said about him. It will be a \ntremendous loss for the Senate and our country. Again, today, I extend \nmy love to Senator Chafee's family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13116-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13116-S13119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED Continued\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, both colleagues have been gracious to \nthose of us who are in opposition to this legislation. We will be \ntaking some time to lay out our case against the legislation. Senator \nHollings, of course, is one of the leading opponents. Because of the \nnecessity to go back to his family experience of the real agony of \nhaving a home burned down, he needs to be away for this afternoon. A \nnumber of us will be here because a number of Senators want to speak. I \nwill divide up my time and take about a half hour now, and I will be \nback this afternoon as other Senators speak.\n  I have a letter that went out to Senators, signed by many African \nAmerican religious leaders who oppose the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act and support the HOPE for Africa Act. That is the title.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n   African-American Religious Leaders Oppose the ``Africa Growth and \n   Opportunity Act'' (AGOA) and Support the ``HOPE for Africa Act'', \n                            October 20, 1999\n\n       Dear Senator: We are a group of religious leaders who share \n     with other community leaders, scholars and activists, grave \n     concerns about the various proposed versions of the ``Africa \n     Growth and Opportunity Act'' (AGOA: H.R. 434, S. 1387, S. \n     666). We urge you to oppose the AGOA approach to U.S.-Africa \n     relations.\n       We support an alternative legislative proposal, the ``HOPE \n     for Africa Act'' (HOPE meaning Human Rights, Opportunity, \n     Partnership and Empowerment) S. 1636 introduced by Senator \n     Russ Feingold (WI). The HOPE for Africa bill has been \n     developed with colleagues and other public interest \n     advocates, human rights and community groups in Africa and \n     the United States.\n       We have been very clear about our opposition to H.R. 434, \n     the ``Africa Growth and Opportunity Act'' that has now come \n     over to the Senate. We view this controversial bill, which \n     was accurately dubbed the ``African Re-colonization Act'' \n     last year, as actually damaging to the interests of the \n     majority of African people.\n       The AGOA's sponsors have refused to seriously address the \n     concerns of its prominent critics, such as TransAfrica \n     President Randall Robinson, Professor Ron Walters, President \n     Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Rev. William Campbell, Clergy \n     and Laity United for Economic Justice and Rep. Jesse Jackson \n     Jr., and many of his colleagues in the Congressional Black \n     Caucus including Rep. Maxine Waters, and Rep. John Lewis.\n       Over the course of the last and current Congress, African \n     American leaders and organizations concerned about Africa \n     have carefully studied the actual provisions of the different \n     versions of the AGOA. Close analysis of the bills reveals \n     that although they are wrapped in rhetoric about helping \n     Africa, these bills are designed to secure U.S. business \n     interests, often at the expense of the interests and needs of \n     the majority of African people and at the expense of African \n     nations' sovereignty and self-determination. They have thus \n     been rightly designated as ``corporate bills'' rather than as \n     measures promoting justice or fair trade.\n       Incredibly, the House version of AGOA, which its proponents \n     insist will be preserved in any House-Senate conference \n     process, imposes substantial burdens on the sub-Saharan \n     countries, burdens which are not imposed on other U.S. \n     trading partners. That the U.S. should condition trade with \n     African nations alone on demands that these countries \n     reorganize their domestic policies and priorities is \n     offensive. To add injury to insult, these burdens are in \n     exchange for meager trade benefits--two of the 48 sub-Saharan \n     countries would have quotas for textiles and apparel removed, \n     yet all such quotas expires when the Multifiber Agreement \n     sunsets in 2005.\n       The Senate versions of the ``Africa Growth and Opportunity \n     Act'' effectively eliminate even the meager trade benefits \n     the House version of AGOA could provide African countries. \n     After all, it is highly unlikely that manufacturers will \n     assume the expense of shipping product to Africa (as opposed \n     to the Caribbean) just for the limited purpose of assembly, \n     as provided in the bill.\n       The people of Africa must have our support as they strive \n     to build democracy and improve the standard of living in \n     their nations. Certainly it would be a travesty if U.S. \n     policy actually undermined the future prospects of most \n     Africans, which is why many on the continent oppose AGOE.\n       Given our opposition to the AGOA approach and our strong \n     desire for a mutually beneficial U.S.-Africa policy, African \n     colleagues participated in crafting a proposal aimed at \n     promoting equitable, sustainable, sovereign African \n     development. The key elements of ``The HOPE for Africa Act'' \n     are the African priorities of debt relief and self-\n     determination of those economic and social policies best \n     suited to meeting the needs of African people. These include \n     strengthening and diversifying Africa's economic production \n     capacity (for instance in the processing of African natural \n     resources and manufacturing), and fair trade in sectors \n     (unlike textiles and apparel) promising a long term \n     opportunity for African economic development.\n       We urge you to support S. 1636, the forward-looking ``HOPE \n     for Africa Act,'' that would meet the needs and interests of \n     the people of both Africa and the United States, and to \n     oppose the various outstanding versions of the AGOA approach.\n           Sincerely,\n       Rev.

Mr. President, I want to say to my colleague from \nFlorida, given the remarks I am about to make, that I know when it \ncomes to the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act, \nalthough we have a number of trade bills that are lumped together right \nnow--he is interested in one of the questions that I am going to be \nraising today and one of the reasons I oppose this. I certainly hope we \ncan have some enforceable labor standards. I will talk about that in a \nmoment.\n  I want to say one of two things. Either the debate on S. 1387 and S. \n1389 is not the debate that we should be having now, or if we do move \non to this legislation--I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to \nproceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If we go forward, I want to make the case that either \nwe should not be considering this legislation, or if we go forward, a \nnumber of Senators are very anxious to have the opportunity to bring \namendments to the floor that are all about our work and representation \nof the people in our States. In particular, I want to make the case \nthat I have an amendment that I have said to the majority leader for \nthe last 4 weeks--I have had to even put holds on other bills of some \nSenators, making the point that I am not opposed to your legislation. I \ndon't want it going through by unanimous consent, and I only want an \nopportunity to have an up-or-down vote on this amendment that deals \nwith the mergers and acquisitions that are taking place in agriculture.\n  My view is we ought to have a moratorium on these mergers and \nacquisitions at least for the next 18 months. We ought to do that \nbecause, right now, this frightening concentration of power on the part \nof these packers and grain companies and on the part of these middle \nmen, on the part of these exporters is driving our family farmers and \nproducers off the land--that along with record low prices. The two are \ninterrelated. I certainly, as I speak today--and probably this \nafternoon--will talk about that amendment and talk about why I believe \nso strongly that I should have the opportunity to--and I intend to--\nbring that amendment out on this legislation if we go forward.\n  I also want to say I don't think the debate on campaign finance \nreform should be over. It is too central an issue to politics and \npublic life in America. I think it is the core problem. I think it is \none of the major reasons why people are so disillusioned. I had an \namendment that I brought to the floor, which basically went down when \nthose who were opposed to campaign finance reform were able to block \nthe legislation.\n  The amendment I am focused on says, look, if we are not prepared to \nenact bold reform, then at least let's not get in the way of citizens \naround the country who, at the grassroots level, are making a \ndifference. And if the people in Maine, Vermont, Missouri, \nMassachusetts, and other States are going to go forward with the clean \nmoney/clean election initiative, which is a way of getting the big, \nprivate interest money out and basically making sure the public \nfinancing means these elections belong to the people, they ought to be \nable to apply that to Federal races as well, the Senate races and House \nraces. For any Senator or Representative, it would be voluntary on our \npart as to whether we want to be part of that system. But States ought \nto be able to pass legislation to present that option. I will have that \namendment, and I will be ready to introduce that amendment to this \nlegislation. I don't think the debate on campaign finance reform should \nbe over. I hope other Senators will come out here with other amendments \nto deal with campaign finance reform.\n  If we think this is such a central issue, if we think this is an \nissue perhaps of the same importance as the civil rights question and \nlegislation that we passed in 1964 and 1965, we ought not to be \nabandoning this fight. And there are a number of us with amendments.\n  For me, again, my answer on that is, first and foremost, the \nproducers and the family farmers of my State are being driven off the \nland. I think the farm policy is a miserable failure. I think we have \nto make some changes. I am hoping people on both sides of the aisle \nwill agree. I am not interested in pointing fingers and saying you cast \nthe wrong vote X number of years ago; you are wrong, and you are wrong. \nI am interested in making some modifications and changes to get farm \nprices up and farm income up to give our producers a fair shake. That \nis what I am interested in. I certainly am interested in this whole \nquestion of campaign finance reform.\n  I also want to say to colleagues that I certainly hope we consider an \namendment on raising the minimum wage. We have been trying to get this \namendment up for some time now.\n  Senators should have an up-or-down vote. If Senators are opposed to \nraising the minimum wage $1 over 2 years, then Senators can come out \nhere and say they are opposed and make their case. I think that is the \nway it should be. I am sure I will hear some good arguments on the \nother side of the aisle, or maybe even among some Democrats. I don't \nknow why they oppose raising the minimum wage. I think some of them \nwill be forceful arguments. But the point is, we ought to be \naccountable. The point is, we ought to be willing to have an up-or-down \nvote. I am assuming there will be Senators who will want to have an \namendment on raising the minimum wage, Senator Kennedy being the leader \nof this effort with any number of us joining in.\n  Finally, before I get to the substance of this bill, I want to bring \nup another topic which I am sure some of my colleagues are tired of. \nThis will be the fourth round where I have been making the appeal that \nwe ought to have the courage to do the policy evaluation to know what \nis happening with the welfare bill. Every time I do this, I am either \ndefeated by a close vote or it is\n\n[[Page S13118]]\n\npassed and then dropped in conference. I think that has happened again. \nTo me, it is outrageous. I will have an opportunity to talk about this \nwhen I introduce this amendment.\n  But to make a very long story short, to cut the welfare rolls in half \ndoes not necessarily mean we have success. We have success when we have \ncut poverty in half; we have success when welfare recipients, who by \ndefinition are basically single-parent families--women and children \nprimarily--are better off economically. So we ought to know, as women \nand children are essentially no longer receiving welfare assistance, do \nwomen have jobs now? What kind of wages do they pay? We need to \nunderstand. The Families U.S.A. study says 670,000 of America's \nchildren have no medical assistance because of this bill. Do they still \nhave health care coverage or not? In addition, we ought to know with \nthe 30- to 35-percent drop in food stamp participation--the Food Stamp \nProgram being the major safety net program for children's nutrition--\ndoes this mean more children are now going hungry today in our country?\n  Finally, we need to know whether or not there is affordable child \ncare. We ought to at least do the honest policy evaluation. Given, \nagain, the conference committee dropped this, I will be back with this \namendment.\n\n  After having said that, in particular, again, let me emphasis my \nprimary focus--there are a number of amendments--which is, more than \nanything else, I want to make the fight on agriculture. I want to have \nthe opportunity to bring to the floor of the Senate an amendment and \nlegislation that I think will help alleviate some of the suffering \namong family farmers. I want to do that. I think we should have, before \nwe leave, the opportunity to have a debate about ways in which we can \nchange agricultural policy for the better. If other Senators have other \nideas, I think that is great as well. I do not want to see us leave \nwithout trying to take some positive action.\n  After having said that, I think this debate about the CBI and the \nAfrican trade bill could be useful and enlightening. I said this on \nFriday as well. The question really is, when we talk about trade \npolicy, we want to know whether we can make the global economy work for \nworking families. That is the test: Can we make this new global economy \nwork for working families in our country. I am an internationalist. I \nargue for the people of the other countries as well.\n  Senator Feingold introduced an impressive and innovative bill based \non legislation that was introduced in the House by Jesse Jackson, Jr., \nthat blazes a trail for U.S. trade policy. It is truly ground breaking.\n  Finally, people who want our trade policy to work for working \nfamilies will have an alternative that I think they can wholeheartedly \nsupport. I don't think the issue is whether or not we expand trade. I \ndon't think the issue is whether or not the United States of America is \npart of an international economy. I certainly don't think the issue is \nthat we should put walls up on our borders. I think the issue is, on \nwhose terms are we going to expand trade? What are the rules and who \nbenefits from those rules? I am interested in the rules of trade. I am \nnot interested in trade without rules. Let me say that again. I am \ninterested in the rules of trade, which means I am interested in trade. \nI am not interested in trade without rules.\n  In this case, the choice could hardly be clearer. The Feingold-\nJackson legislation, called the HOPE for Africa Act, says the expansion \nof trade should benefit working families and poor families in America \nand in Africa. Trade agreements should be about making the global \neconomy work for ordinary citizens. The HOPE for Africa bill says if \nyou are really serious about raising labor and environmental standards \nacross the globe, then we have to have enforceable--let me mention that \ntwo or three times--enforceable protections built into our trade \nagreements. The HOPE for Africa bill says that we can't be serious \nabout wanting to help African countries develop economically if we \ndon't do anything about their crushing debt burden. The HOPE for Africa \nbill says that the lives of Americans or the lives of Africans \nsuffering from AIDS are more important than the monopoly profits of the \npharmaceutical companies. The HOPE for Africa bill has its priorities \nset straight. It expands trade the right way by putting people first. \nWe have heard that before. Why don't we make it a reality?\n  Our other option, I fear, is more of the same, more NAFTAs--NAFTA for \nthe Caribbean, NAFTA for all of South America, NAFTA for Africa. I \ncertainly don't want to see IMF-style economic policies that I think \nhave been impoverishing one country after another all over the world \nwith the austerity measures--raise interest rates, try to export your \nway out of a crisis, and more investment protections for multinationals \nto export jobs overseas so they can avoid complying with American-style \nlabor and environmental standards. That is what we are talking about--\nmore investment protection for multinationals to export jobs overseas \nso they can avoid complying with American-style labor and environmental \nstandards--more trade incentives so multinationals can shift those \ngoods right back into the United States, competing against American \nworkers trying to organize a union.\n\n  The message is: Try to organize a union and we go to another country. \nMore enforceable protections for the interests of multinationals and \nforeign investors and more unenforceable lip service for the interests \nof working families. This is a policy that says to working Americans: \nDon't even try to organize a union.\n  This is the main basis of my opposition. Do that and we will move \njobs overseas with special trade and investment incentives. It says to \nworkers overseas, don't try to organize a union; the only way to \ncompete for foreign investment is by accepting rock bottom wages.\n  That is the flaw in this trade legislation. It is a pretty good deal \nfor an investor who wants to save labor costs, but it is a pretty \nrotten deal for an American worker or worker overseas. That is what is \nat issue. We are basically saying to working Americans: Don't even try \nto organize a union; do that and we will move your jobs overseas. That \nis what we are saying.\n  It says to the workers overseas: Don't try to organize a union; the \nonly way to get the foreign investment is by accepting rock bottom \nwages.\n  It is great for the investors who want to save labor costs, but it is \na rotten deal for an American worker and it is a rotten deal for a low-\nwage worker in another country.\n  I want to see a global trade policy that works for workers. I want to \nsee a trade policy that lifts the living standards of workers. This is \na developmental model that has failed time after time. This is the way \nof the past. It is time to say good riddance once and for all.\n  It is not as if we don't have any choice. The Feingold bill gives a \nclear alternative. It is called the HOPE for Africa Act. We need \nsomething similar for the Caribbean. I know my colleague from Florida \nis now working on trying to have some enforceable labor standards. That \nwould make a huge difference.\n\n  We have a World Trade Organization meeting coming up in Seattle. I \nhear the discussion from the administration and others who want this \ntrade legislation to pass. They think it is possible we could push for \nmeaningful and enforceable labor and environmental standards.\n  What kind of message are we now conveying, with about a month to go \nbefore this critical WTO meeting, when we are talking about a bilateral \ntrade agreement which does not have any enforceable labor and \nenvironmental standards? I ask the administration: Where are you going \nwith this? What is your message to labor? What is your message to the \nenvironmental groups? What is your message to the human rights groups? \nWhat is your message to all the nongovernment organizations that are \ngoing to be out in Seattle?\n  As a Senator, I will be proud to join them. On the one hand, we have \nthe rhetoric that says we think it is possible through WTO to have \nenforceable labor and environmental standards. That is implied in the \nrhetoric. At the same time, we have some trade bills that the \nadministration is saying we have to pass; this is a No. 1 priority; we \nhave to pass them before the WTO, which communicates the exact opposite \nmessage. They basically say we are not interested in enforceable labor \nstandards; we are not interested in enforceable environmental \nstandards.\n\n[[Page S13119]]\n\n  And, by the way, the message for farmers and producers in my State: \nIf we don't have an opportunity to offer amendments, we are also not \ninterested in trade policy that gives them any kind of fair shake. Both \nSenator Dorgan and Senator Conrad will be out here, as well.\n  I will say that 1,000 times over the next X number of hours: If we \ndon't have the commitment to enforceable labor and environmental \nstandards in our bilateral trade agreements, how can we credibly expect \nto include them in multilateral agreements?\n  I think this legislation in its present form sets a terrible \nprecedent. I think it goes in exactly the opposite direction from the \nwords I hear the administration speak. I think it goes in the exact \nopposite direction from the rhetoric of at least some of my colleagues.\n  I am interested in negotiations. Senator Graham has talked about the \nUnited States-Caribbean trade agreement and is trying to work on \nenforceable labor standards. However, I don't now see it in any of \nthese trade bills. From my point of view, I think we have to have some \nenforceable labor standards that give working people in these other \ncountries the right to organize and bargain collectively.\n  If someone in the Senate says that my insistence as a Senator from \nMinnesota on some enforceable global labor standard is protectionist \nand that is the case, then we might as well say the Fair Labor \nStandards Act is also protectionist. That is the piece of legislation \nthat relates to commerce in States in our country. We are saying we are \ngoing to apply this to all the States. Companies are not going to be \nable to have these atrocious child labor conditions. We will have \nprotection dealing with child labor. Senator Harkin will probably be \nhere with an amendment dealing with that. We will make sure people have \na right to organize and bargain collectively.\n\n  If we live in a global instead of a national economy--haven't I heard \nall Members say that--then we need the same kind of rules on the global \nlevel that we have on the national level for exactly the same kinds of \nreasons.\n  I will come back later this afternoon to critique the legislation. I \nam preparing amendments to introduce.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Wellstone, for his graciousness in yielding the floor. I \nrealize this is somewhat inconvenient for him, but I deeply appreciate \nhis kindness in yielding at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13119-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF SENATOR JOHN CHAFEE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate today is a sadder, lesser place. \nLike many others, I am shocked and saddened by the sudden loss of \nSenator John Chafee. My thoughts, and my wife Erma's, go out to his \nfamily--to his wife, Virginia; his sons, Zechariah; Lincoln; John, Jr.; \nand Quentin; and his daughter, Georgia.\n  I understand the funeral will take place this coming Saturday in \nProvidence. Senator John Chafee is the eighth Senator from Rhode Island \nto die in office, the second in this century, since Senator LeBaron B. \nColt on August 18, 1924.\n  Since his first election to the Senate in 1976, Senator Chafee was \nthe kind of Senator upon which the smooth running of the Congress has \nalways depended. He was a man of great humor, gentleness, \nthoughtfulness, and compromise--none of which detracted from his clear \nviews and opinions as to what the best course of action was for the \nnation. He could disagree with his colleagues and still find a way to \nmove forward on issues that were important to him.\n  This was a man devoted to the well-being of his country, in war and \nin peace. As others have stated, Senator Chafee served in World War II \nand in Korea. He also served as Secretary of the Navy. He served in the \nstate legislature and as Governor of Rhode Island before his election \nto the Senate. He is a man who heard the clear call of duty and of love \nfor his country and its people like a church bell ringing over the \ngentle hills of his beloved Rhode Island. His acts of faith came daily \nin his service to that calling bell.\n\n     His golden locks time hath to silver turn'd;\n     O time too swift, O swiftness never ceasing!\n     His youth 'gainst time and age hath ever spurn'd\n     But spurn'd in vain; youth waneth by increasing:\n     Beauty, strength, youth, are flowers but fading seen;\n     Duty, faith, love, are roots, and ever green.\n\n  So wrote poet George Peele in the 16th century. But surely John \nChafee's sense of duty and his faithful service to the nation will \nprove equally evergreen, living beyond his untimely demise in laws and \nlegislation that bear his stamp of compromise and caring for even our \nsmallest and most helpless citizens.\n\n     We live in deeds, not years; in thoughts, not breaths;\n     In feelings, not in figures on a dial.\n     We should count time by heart-throbs. He most lives\n     Who thinks most--feels the most--acts the best.\n\n  Senator Chafee was consistent in his feelings, in his outlook, and in \nhis actions. He always looked out for children in the health care \ndebates that have consumed the Senate. His love of nature and his \nchampioning of environmental causes is well known, but tempered by his \nsense of fairness and practicality. He supported the Clean Air Act and \nthe Rio treaties on global climate change and biodiversity, but he also \nsupported requiring cost-benefit analyses of Environmental Protection \nAgency regulations and voted in support of the Byrd-Hagel Resolution \nrequiring developing nation participation and a cost-benefit analysis \nof the Kyoto Protocol on global warming before the Senate would \nconsider that treaty. Senator Chafee was a principled man. He was true \nto his bedrock beliefs, but he was not so idealistic that he would \nsacrifice success for unyielding principle. In doing so, he advanced \nhis causes most effectively.\n  For a man as battle-tested as his history suggests, Senator Chafee \nwas known for his civility and his ability to seek a gentler, more \ncivil path in the often strife-torn and partisan Senate. I have not \nserved on any committees with Senator Chafee, but I was well aware of \nhis ability to work with colleagues from both sides of the aisle to \nensure the success of his legislative agenda. This talent ensured that \nhe would be sorely missed upon his retirement from the Senate next \nyear. Upon announcing his retirement plans last March, he made it clear \nthat he was not ``going away mad or disillusioned or upset with the \nSenate. I think it's a great place,'' he said. I think it was a greater \nplace for his presence. It is merely unlucky chance that he is gone \nbefore we could all savor our last months in his company.\n  Now, we must instead hold close our best last memories of this kind \nand gentle man, crusty New Englander that he was. We must measure the \nlegacy that he leaves in legislation and in the fine example that he \nset with his life. Only thus can we, in the poet William Wordsworth's \nwords, aspire to ``Intimations of Immortality:''\n\n     Though nothing can bring back the hour\n     Of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower;\n     We will grieve not, rather find\n     Strength in what remains behind;\n     In the primal sympathy\n     Which having been must ever be;\n     In the soothing thoughts that spring\n     Out of human suffering;\n     In the faith that looks through death,\n     In years that bring the philosophic mind.\n\n  Senator John Chafee leaves behind a rich legacy that honors his name, \nhis State, and the United States Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this sad and somber day, we recall our \nwonderful friend John Chafee and begin to appreciate how much he will \nbe missed. We extend our love and respect to his family. I suspect John \nwould like us to move forward with the business of the Senate. As \nSenator Byrd has just said, he was a crusty New Englander, and I \nbelieve John would be very happy with that description. One of the many \nadmirable traits of crusty New Englanders is that they like to get down \nto business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13119-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13119-S13122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, one of the last conversations I had with \nJohn\n\n[[Page S13120]]\n\nChafee just a few days ago was about the legislation we are now \nconsidering. John Chafee, as in all things, was a commonsense \npragmatist. I do not know how he would have voted on these measures, \nbut I think he would have been appealed to by the practical rationale \nfor the United States moving forward in the way this legislation \ndirects us.\n  This legislation, which was a product of the Committee on Finance, on \nwhich Senator Chafee served with such distinction, a committee in which \nhe had voted for this legislation as a member of the committee during \nthe time it was being considered there, I believe embodies many of the \nprinciples for which John Chafee stood. I want to particularly talk \nabout one component of this legislation, and that is the United States-\nCaribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act component.\n  Since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, our \nCaribbean and Central American neighbors have been at a competitive \ndisadvantage. There is now a benefit of in the range of 5 percent to 10 \npercent, having the identical production factories located in Mexico as \nopposed to in Central America or Caribbean nations which are members of \nthe Caribbean Basin Initiative. It has been stated we should have dealt \nwith this issue when the North American Free Trade Agreement was first \nadopted. Unfortunately, we did not. Today, we have the opportunity to \nbegin the consideration of the restoration of parity and balance within \nour region.\n  I thank Senator Lott for his support in bringing this important \nlegislation to the floor. I also thank Senator Roth and Senator \nMoynihan for the leadership which they have provided through the \nconsideration of this legislation in the Senate Finance Committee.\n\n  Over the last 5 years, I have worked to enhance and build upon our \nexisting trade relationship with our neighbors in the Caribbean Basin \nregion. On February 3 of this year, in response to the overwhelming \ndevastation and destruction caused first by Hurricane Georges and then \nby Hurricane Mitch, I introduced the Central American and Caribbean \nRelief Act. This bill represented a broad and comprehensive strategy to \nprovide immediate disaster relief, economic and infrastructure \nrecovery, and long-term trade enhancement that would benefit both the \nUnited States and the countries in the region.\n  On March 23, 1999, we passed legislation that provided immediate \ndisaster relief to the countries in the region that were impacted by \nHurricanes Georges and Mitch. This legislation included $41 million of \ndebt relief. We wiped out all of the bilateral debt of these countries \nto the United States and contributed to a Central American relief fund \nwhich will be beneficial in terms of reducing other forms of \nindebtedness of those countries that were so ravaged by the hurricanes.\n  I am pleased that now we are considering a bill that includes many of \nthe long-term trade enhancement provisions that were part of the \nCentral American and Caribbean Relief Act. Enacting this legislation is \ncritical to the continued economic growth and health of our Nation and \nthe economic health of our closest neighbors in the Caribbean and Latin \nAmerica. It is also in the national security interest of the United \nStates of America.\n  Let me review what are some of the compelling reasons for the \nadoption of this legislation.\n  First, humanitarian. I have made three trips to Central America and \nthe Caribbean since the devastation of Hurricane Georges and Hurricane \nMitch. As a Floridian, I have had some exposure to the destruction that \nhurricanes can inflict upon a community. I can say I have seen nothing \nthe likes of which I saw in Honduras after Hurricane Mitch. I know that \nmany of my colleagues have also seen the destruction caused by these \nhurricanes. These two destructive storms caused a level of death and \ndevastation not seen in the Western Hemisphere in over 200 years.\n  We have all heard of the tremendous loss of life, the economic \ndisruption, the human suffering caused by these hurricanes. As a \nneighbor, a friend, and a great Nation, the United States has both a \nhistory and a current obligation of response with assistance to those \nin need, especially those nations and those peoples who are our closest \nneighbors. Providing enhanced trade benefits will be a significant part \nof that humanitarian response. It will allow nations that had major \nparts of their economies, particularly agricultural economies, \ndevastated by these hurricanes to begin to rebuild on a more \ndiversified and stable economic basis.\n  A second reason to pass this legislation is economic. Caribbean Basin \nenhancements are in the best economic interest of the United States. \nExperience shows us that providing trade benefits to the Caribbean \nBasin is good business for the United States. Following the enactment \nof the Caribbean Basin Initiative in 1983, our trade position with the \nregion has improved from a trade deficit of $3 billion with the \nCaribbean Basin, which we suffered in 1983, to today approaching a \n$3.5 billion trade surplus. These are not only good neighbors, but they \nare good trading partners. They are trading partners who, on a per \ncapita basis, have consistently outpaced all other regions of the world \nin terms of the U.S. trade surplus.\n\n  Between 1983 and 1998, U.S. exports to the region increased fourfold, \nwhile total imports into the U.S. region grew by less than 20 percent. \nIn fact, since 1995, U.S. exports to the CBI countries have increased \nby approximately 32 percent. There are over 58 million consumers in the \n24 countries represented by the CBI region. Seventy percent of their \nnonpetroleum imports come from the United States.\n  Let me repeat that: 58 million consumers in 24 countries close to the \nUnited States; 70 percent of their nonpetroleum imports come from the \nUnited States. Yet there is another reason to strengthen the Caribbean \neconomies, and that is the importance of the stability of our closest \nneighbors.\n  When the CBI bill was adopted in 1983, the Caribbean Basin, \nparticularly Central America, was in flames with violent conflicts and \nrampant drug trafficking. The primary goal of the initial CBI \nlegislation was to stabilize the region by building stronger, more \ndiverse economies. These economies were seen as a critical element in \nsupporting democratic governments.\n  Our national security and our continued interest in reducing the \nlevel of flow of illegal drugs and illegal immigrants into the United \nStates was also at stake in the stability of the region.\n  According to the Department of State's Bureau of International \nNarcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, increased law enforcement \nefforts along the Southwest border of the United States have again \nencouraged drug traffickers to reactivate their old, well-established \nsmuggling routes in the Caribbean and Central America. Recent cocaine \nseizures in the regions bear this out. In 1998, authorities in the \nDominican Republic seized 2.4 metric tons of cocaine. During the same \nperiod, Guatemalan authorities seized 9.2 metric tons of cocaine, and \nPanamanian authorities seized 11.8 metric tons of cocaine. Cocaine \nseizures in the Bahamas during 1998 totaled 3.7 metric tons, the \nhighest level in that country since 1992, while at the same time an \nestimated 54 metric tons of cocaine flowed through Haiti.\n  Experience tells us the vast majority of this cocaine was destined \nfor the United States of America. Without assistance to restart the \nregional economy, without assistance to make it possible for people to \nprovide for their families, the nations in this region will be even \nmore susceptible to the scourge of drug trafficking. The people of this \nregion must have opportunities in the legal economy so they may feed \ntheir families and resist the financial temptations associated with \ndrug trafficking.\n  Failing to enact CBI enhancements will increase the pressure for \nillegal immigration into the United States. The people of the CBI \nregion must have the real opportunity at home so they are not forced to \nturn to illegal immigration to find employment and feed their families.\n  The painful lessons of the 1980s need not be repeated as we move into \nthe new century. We can act--we must act--to prevent it.\n  Today, I want to focus on yet another reason why passing the \nCaribbean Basin Initiative enhancement legislation is so critical. The \nreason can best be demonstrated by looking at these two shirts. This \ngolf shirt is made in\n\n[[Page S13121]]\n\nChina. It is made from fabric that was grown by Chinese farmers, woven \nin Chinese textile mills. This shirt costs approximately $4.75 to \nproduce. This shirt was made by a Caribbean Basin country, similar \nplant. It was made with fabric that was grown on U.S. farms, and it was \nspun in U.S. textile mills. This shirt costs approximately $5 to \nproduce. Both of these shirts were imported into the United States for \nsale at U.S. retail stores. There is no significant difference between \nthese shirts, save the location, China and Nicaragua, where they were \nmanufactured, and where the components were grown and spun into \ntextile--China, the United States of America. Each of these shirts \nsells for approximately $19. That is the price the law of supply and \ndemand has set upon these items.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to present these \nshirts before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. One might ask the question of basic economics. If the \nChinese shirt is identical to the Nicaraguan shirt, if the Chinese \ncotton that is spun into this shirt is to the consumer essentially the \nsame as the American cotton, which is spun into the Nicaraguan-\nassembled shirt, and yet the Chinese shirt costs 5 percent less to \nproduce, sells for the same price, why is it there are any shirts being \nproduced in Nicaragua or in the other Caribbean Basin countries?\n  Well, there are several reasons why there is a market for the more-\nexpensive-to-produce CBI shirt. Transportation costs between the \nCaribbean Basin and the United States are less than the transportation \ncosts between China and the United States. The proximity of the \nCaribbean Basin to the United States means that transit time for \ntextile products manufactured in the CBI region and destined for sale \nin the United States is significantly less than transit time for \nChinese products. This is a particularly important factor in the \napparel industry with its rapid style changes. But neither of those are \nthe most important reason.\n  The most significant reason why there is a market for the Caribbean-\nassembled shirt, the shirt which assembles U.S. cotton which is milled \nin U.S. textile mills, the most important is because there is a \nlimitation on the number of these shirts which can be imported from \nChina.\n  In 1999, the import quota for Chinese-manufactured shirts, such as \nthe one I hold today, the exact number of these shirts which can be \nimported from China to the United States is 2,336,946 dozen per year. \nImports of the shirt manufactured in Nicaragua, as well as other \nCaribbean Basin countries, where U.S.-grown and processed cotton is the \nbasis of manufacture, are not subject to quota restrictions. The \ndifference represented by these two shirts will become much more \napparent in the year 2005, a watershed year for the textile and apparel \nindustry in the United States and the Caribbean Basin.\n  Why is 2005 such a significant date on the calendar? The import \nquotas which are currently applicable to textile products of most Asian \nnations, originally imposed under the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, now the \nAgreement on Textiles and Clothing, will be phased out. There will no \nlonger be, for most Asian nations, a quota limitation on the number of \nitems such as this golf shirt which can be imported into the United \nStates. At that time, textile production in the Caribbean Basin will \nbe placed in a distinct and growing disadvantage due to its higher cost \nof production. Disinvestment in the region is a real potential, \nreducing the incentive to use any material from U.S. textile mills or \ncotton grown in the United States. We face the prospect in the year \n2005, with the lifting of the quotas, that the already 5-percent \nproduction cost advantage of Asian countries will expand, as they are \nable to spread their production cost over an unlimited number of \napparel items to be imported into the United States.\n\n  The transportation and proximity advantages of the CBI country will \nnot be able to sustain the raw economic advantage of the lower cost of \nproduction under current standards in Asia.\n  That is why passing CBI enhancement legislation now, in 1999, is \ncritical to U.S. textile and yarn industries as well as to U.S. cotton \ngrowers. There are 64,000 U.S. textile workers who are dependent on \nthis partnership of textile produced in the United States and assembled \nin the Caribbean for their jobs. Overall, 400,000 U.S. jobs are \ndependent upon textile exports to the CBI region. Last year, $4.5 \nbillion worth of U.S. textile and apparel products were exported to the \nCBI region for assembly. Only by providing incentives for the \ndevelopment of stronger relationships with apparel manufacturers in our \nhemisphere will we have any chance of maintaining a market for U.S. \ncotton and textiles after the quotas are eliminated in 2005.\n  We must see this 5-year period as a period of challenge, a period in \nwhich we must increase the production competitiveness of U.S. textiles \nand Caribbean apparel. If we squander these 5 years, we face the very \nreal prospect that we will be having a debate over nothing because, \nwith the lifting of the quotas, there will be a strong incentive for \nthis industry and the cotton farmers and the textile workers who \nsupport it to move from the Caribbean to Asia.\n  Developing strong relations with the countries in the Caribbean \nBasin, therefore, will not only promote political stability, will not \nonly be in our humanitarian tradition, but will also be critical to the \neconomic health of an important American industry.\n  An independent economic analysis funded by the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank and prepared by Professor Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda of the \nUCLA School of Public Policy and Social Research and Professor Robert \nK. McCleery of the Monterey Institute for International Studies makes \njust this point. The numbers are clear.\n  According to the American Apparel Manufacturers Association, without \nCBI enhancement, U.S. textile and agriculture will be adversely \naffected, and the U.S. economy will suffer. Currently, 50 percent of \nthe apparel items consumed in the United States are manufactured with \nU.S. cotton. Industry estimates indicate that if we can increase the \nattractiveness of the Caribbean Basin as the place of assembly, that \nnumber will grow from 50 percent of U.S.-consumed apparel made with \nU.S. cotton to 70 percent. But if we fail to act, if we allow this \npartnership of U.S. textile and Caribbean assembly to wither, this \nnumber will drop to 30 percent. Without these enhancements, the U.S. \ncotton content will continue to decline, as apparel producers look to \nreduce costs and will move towards products made from cheaper labor and \ncheaper materials, primarily in Asia.\n  The impact of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing and year 2005 \nchanges on man-made fiber industries will be comparable to the cotton \nsituation. Without CBI enhancements, the U.S. man-made fiber content of \nimported apparel will continue to significantly decline. Without CBI \nlegislation and in the face of year 2005 quota reductions, producers of \nman-made fibers will be inclined to relocate their production \nfacilities in order to take advantage of lower wages and production \ncosts. If we begin to work to establish stronger relationships with the \nnations of the Caribbean Basin, we will be able to provide incentives \nto sustain these industries in our own hemisphere.\n  Inherent in our CBI enhancement efforts are public and private \ninvestment incentives that will increase productivity and the quality \nof life within the region. We anticipate the textile industry will \nprovide investment capital targeted for the construction and \nmaintenance of schools, health and child care facilities, and \ntechnology enhancements to increase the productivity of both workers \nand existing manufacturing facilities. A well trained and healthy \nworkforce will be more productive and efficient as Caribbean Basin \nproducers compete for shares of the international textile market.\n  We have an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen our economic and \nnational security through the enhancement of our trade relationship \nwith our neighbors in the region. We must act prior to 2005 to build a \ndynamic, formidable Western Hemisphere trade alliance that encourages \nU.S. industry to invest in the region and to make commitment to \nrebuilding the industrial infrastructure in the region.\n  We are about to make a fundamental decision that will impact our \nclosest neighbors, a decision that will impact a significant part of \nthe economy of the United States. We can choose to create\n\n[[Page S13122]]\n\na climate where the United States and our neighbors can be competitive \ninto the 21st century or we can repeat the same turmoil of the 1980s. \nThe choice is clear, it is stark, and I think it is beyond reasonable \ndebate: Will we engage or will we retreat?\n  I urge you to extend this assistance to our neighbors to expand \ncommerce and promote economic and political stability in the region. A \nprimary beneficiary of that stability and expansion, a primary \nbeneficiary of the new enhanced partnership between the United States \nand our neighbors in the Caribbean, will be the United States of \nAmerica and its citizens.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13122-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13122-S13127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF SENATOR JOHN CHAFEE\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a friend, \nan athlete, a scholar, a lawyer, a Governor, a Secretary of the Navy, a \nSenator, and a marine--not necessarily in that order.\n  The Senate and our country have lost a great man with the passing of \nJohn Chafee. He exemplified everything that is so good and decent and \nhonorable about our country. A man born to privilege, he also \nrecognized a duty and an obligation to serve his country. As a young \nfreshman at Yale, he was moved to action by the Japanese attack on \nPearl Harbor. He became a marine because he wanted to fight, and they \npromised him he would do just that in the Pacific.\n  So many of our World War II generation, called by Tom Brokaw ``our \ngreatest generation,'' did exactly what John Chafee did. They left \ntheir ivy league campuses and their State universities, their jobs and \ntheir families, and they saw it as their duty to serve.\n  The Marines delivered on their promise; they gave John Chafee a \nchance to fight. Soon after his initial training, he found himself as a \nyoung private on the beach at one of America's bloodiest battles, at \nGuadalcanal. Several years ago, at a program at the Smithsonian, \nSenator Chafee joined a group of World War II veterans who discussed \ntheir memories of the war. John Chafee related that the lesson he \ncarried with him was that there was no rhyme or reason to who lived and \nwho died in combat. He said he learned that it didn't matter how good a \nmarine you might be, the incoming artillery rounds and the enemy \nbullets did not discriminate among good and bad marines and that if one \nsurvived it was not though personal merit but by the grace of God. He \ncame away from that experience with a commitment to live honorably and \nwell because he recognized that every day was a gift and because he \nowed that to those who he left behind on those fields.\n\n  He went on to receive a commission as a lieutenant and the Marines \ncontinued to provide those opportunities to fight in other bloody \nbattles in the Pacific theater including Okinawa.\n  When the war ended, he took off his uniform, returned home, and \npicked up where he left off. He graduated from Yale where he \ndistinguished himself as a collegiate wrestler and captain of the Yale \nwrestling team. Although a supremely modest man, the one honor for \nwhich he was always very proud and willing to talk about was his \ninduction several years ago into the Collegiate Wrestling Hall of Fame \nin Oklahoma.\n  After Yale, he went on to Harvard and graduated in a class filled \nwith many other veterans with similar war records including Senator Ted \nStevens. But soon after graduating from law school, John Chafee learned \nthe Marines weren't done with him and their promise to give him a \nchance to fight.\n  In fact, John Chafee related this experience to me when we were \ndriving together in a car to see the mustering out of one of my \nfavorite aides, my legislative aide Dave Davis, whose wife happened to \nbe John Chafee's personal assistant. We were going out together because \nthis was a big day for Dave Davis. He was going to leave the Army and \nto come with me full time. I must say it was a great day for me. John \nChafee said: You know, I left after World War II, and I thought I was \nfinished. I didn't sign any papers saying I had left the service; I \ndidn't think it was necessary. And all of a sudden, one day during the \nKorean war, I get a notice from the U.S. Marines saying you never left \nthe marines, and we are going to send you to Korea. He said: My gosh, I \nwas so surprised.\n  He was no longer an 18-year-old who was looking for a place to fight. \nHe had a wife and child. He had just graduated from Harvard Law School \nwith a bright future ahead. John Chafee said: I still have a commitment \nand I am going to keep it.\n  He said he had a responsibility to young marines to teach and tell \nthem what he knew from his own combat experience because he knew that \nwould be helpful. He answered the call without complaint and once again \ndistinguished himself as a marine company commander in battle against \nthe Chinese in North Korea in the mountains of Korea.\n  One of his young lieutenants in that company in Korea was the \nnovelist and writer James Brady. Brady wrote a book about his \nexperience in the Korea war entitled ``The Coldest War'' and John \nChafee is the hero of that story. Brady writes.\n\n       That's how it is in the Marine Corps. There are rules and a \n     subtle understanding some of them are to be broken. Colonels \n     broke rules, I suppose generals did, enlisted men broke them, \n     I broke them whenever I could with circumspection, but Chafee \n     never. Captain Chafee kept the rules. Not that he was prissy. \n     It simply did not occur to Chafee to cut corners.\n\n  Brady also writes about not having a chance to tell John Chafee how \nmuch he meant to him in a way in which many of us in the Senate can \nidentify with today.\n\n       There was so much I wanted to say: what his confidence \n     meant to me, how I admired him, how much he'd taught all of \n     us. He was the only truly great man I'd met in my life, and \n     all I had the time to do was say thanks. Maybe he understood.\n\n  We all know his incredible achievements after returning from battle. \nHe continued to serve his native Rhode Island well as a three-term \nGovernor and then Senator for 23 years. He also continued to serve his \nbeloved Marine Corps as the Secretary of the Navy.\n  He kept faith with all those marines who paid the supreme sacrifice \nin the Pacific and in Korea by living a good life and representing them \nwell. He was always Semper Fi to the Corps.\n  One story recalled by another member of the platoon years later at a \ngathering of Korean war veterans told of how John Chafee's Marine \ncompany was moving across snow-covered ground that was believed to be \ncovered with landmines. No one in the company was eager to march \nthrough the area so Captain John Chafee, showing no fear, took point \nand led his men through the snow. When the marines reached the top of \nthe hill, someone looked back and observed that the entire company had \nleft only one set of tracks as each marine had carefully stepped \nexactly in Captain John Chafee's footprints.\n  This lieutenant observed nearly 50 years later that he and the others \nwere still trying to follow in John Chafee's footsteps.\n  As did his marines so long ago, many of us are trying to follow in \nJohn Chafee's footsteps, setting a standard of decency, civility, and \nkindness, remembering how to disagree without rancor. This is something \nall of us in the Senate need to remember when we think of John Chafee. \nIt is the lesson all of us could relearn as we are going into some very \ntough times in the Senate. He loved this institution. He loved what it \nmeant. We have all been enriched and blessed by his presence.\n  I hope his legacy will be that all of us will be better for John \nChafee having been here because he is known as one of the kindest, most \ncivil, and absolutely great Members of this body by everyone who knew \nhim. I have never heard anyone say John Chafee was not a superior \nperson. Whether or not you agreed with him on the merits of an issue, \nyou could never say he wasn't the best of us.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Ohio.\n\n[[Page S13123]]\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to John Chafee. \nAlthough I am a new Member of the Senate, I worked with John for many \nyears as Governor of Ohio and as vice chairman and chairman of the \nNational Governors' Association. I worked with him to reform Medicaid \nand welfare and to reform our laws to protect the environment.\n  I always found him to be a gentleman, a thoughtful man who listened \nand gave a fair hearing, whether it was in his office or before his \ncommittee. I also found him to be a man of profound principle with a \ndeep and abiding sense of care for the less fortunate and the \nenvironment.\n  No environmental legislation emerged from this Congress without his \nimprint. I am sure he looked at the improving environment in this \ncountry as part of his public service legacy. In particular, I remember \nworking closely with him on the effort to reform the Safe Drinking \nWater Act. I was one of the leads for the Governors of the State and \nlocal government coalition, and John, of course, was chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n  John was a visionary leader insisting on enhancing protection of \npublic health and, for the first time, requiring the use of cost-\nbenefit analysis and risk assessment in setting environmental \nstandards.\n  When we in the State and local government community started out, we \nwere told we wouldn't succeed; that the environmental community would \nnever accept these far-reaching reforms.\n  However, due to John's hard work and credibility, we did succeed and \nthe enactment of the bill was celebrated at The White House. The result \nwas that the bill was viewed as a model for environmental reform by \nstate and local elected officials and as an advancement in the \nprotection of public health by the environmental community.\n  Since I arrived in the Senate earlier this year, I have been \nprivileged to serve on John's Environment and Public Works Committee. \nWe had many oars in the water, so to speak, bills that we were working \non. I am saddened that I did not have more of an opportunity to work \nwith John as a colleague here in the Senate, as so many others did, who \nhave spoken so eloquently of their high regard and treasured friendship \nwith him.\n  However, it has been a privilege to work with him and serve with him. \nI have learned from him and his example. There is no one who ran a \nbetter or fairer hearing than John. When John chaired a hearing, you \ncould count that it would start on time. In fact, I tried to get there \nbefore him to let him know that first, I respected his chairmanship \nand, second, to take advantage of his ``early bird'' rule. For those of \nyou who are unaware of the chairman's ``early bird rule,'' it was his \nway of specially recognizing those who made the effort to show up on \ntime for his hearings. The ``early bird rule'' provided that he would \nrecognize Senators in the order they arrived--regardless of seniority--\nalthough on occasion he did make exceptions if a ``late arrival'' had a \nspecial issue to bring before the committee.\n  John reminded me of my father-in-law--if you weren't 5 minutes early \nfor a scheduled meeting, he would be standing there waiting for you \nwhile looking at his watch.\n  I have decided that in the future I will no longer refer to the \n``early bird rule,'' but will begin a new tradition honoring the \nchairman by now referring to the ``Chafee rule.''\n  Others have spoken of John's military and civic service to his \ncountry with beautiful oratory, but I simply want to say that as a \nfreshman he was my role model. John Chafee was an honest, hard working, \ndecent, principled, and straight-forward man. I will miss him and the \nSenate will surely be the less for his loss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, there have been a number \nof my colleagues who have spoken about a wonderful man and a good \nfriend and colleague, Senator John Chafee. I will take a few moments to \ntalk about John Chafee the friend, John Chafee the legislator, and the \nman who served as a role model for all in public service, regardless of \nthe partisan affiliation, ideology, or views on any particular issues.\n  I happened to be in New Hampshire yesterday morning--ironically, \ndiscussing the possibilities of attending a function in New England \nhonoring Senator Chafee--when I heard the tragic news of his passing. \nIt was, indeed, a shock. I saw John in his wheelchair on the subway \nafter the last vote on Friday. He was engaged in conversation with some \nconstituents, visitors to the Capitol. I didn't interrupt him because I \ndidn't want to interrupt that conversation. I wish I had. That would \nhave been the last opportunity to say goodbye to him.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with his family, with Ginny and the \nchildren and the grandchildren, but also with Senator Chafee's very \ndevoted staff, both on the Environment and Public Works Committee and \nin his personal office.\n  Others on the floor have reviewed Senator Chafee's record of \nachievements. It is an inspiring record. Others have dwelled on it \nextensively. It stands in stark contrast to what many Americans today \nthink about politics, politicians, and political leaders.\n  I want to emphasize the qualities of public service and patriotism \nthat motivated John Chafee. In the spirit of Jimmy Stewart, who \nbelieved that good leaders should occupy the offices here, John Chafee \nwas in that tradition. As a young man of 20, John left college to \nenlist in the Marine Corps after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He fought \nat Guadalcanal, and after that he resumed his studies. After the war, \nhe earned an undergraduate degree from Yale and a law degree from \nHarvard. He again served his country in the Korean conflict where he \ncommanded Dog Company, a 200-man rifle unit in the first marine \ndivision. That is not easy duty.\n  After serving his country with honor in the military, he embarked on \nwhat would be another honorable career for John Chafee; 6 years in the \nRhode Island House of Representatives, including the rise to the post \nof minority leader. He ran for the Governor of Rhode Island and was \nelected by a 398-vote margin in 1962. His constituents recognized John \nChafee's leadership, integrity, and intelligence by rewarding him with \ntwo more terms as Governor--in both cases by the largest margins in the \nState's history.\n  In 1969, President Richard Nixon appointed John Chafee as Secretary \nof the Navy where he served with and was succeeded by our mutual \nfriend, John Warner. John Chafee was elected to the Senate in the \nbicentennial year of 1976 as the first Republican to be elected Senator \nfrom Rhode Island in 46 years. His work as a Senator was rewarded with \nreelection in 1982, 1988, 1994, and he would have been reelected again \nin 2000 had that been in the cards.\n  He was looking forward to spending more time with Ginny and the \ngrandchildren. I think that is the greatest tragedy of all, that they \nwill miss a wonderful husband and a wonderful father and grandfather.\n  I first got to know John Chafee when I was elected to the Senate in \n1990. I served on the Environment and Public Works Committee where he \nwas a ranking member and then chairman. We worked together on all of \nthe environmental bills that come down the pike: Clean Air Act, Clean \nWater Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and, most importantly, on \nSuperfund, where we shared the frustrations of working and fighting the \ngood fight, where we had differences on the other side of the aisle. \nBut John was a patient legislator in spite of the frustrations, in \nspite of the times he could have been angry--politically angry--at \nthose on the other side of the aisle. He never was. One couldn't get \nhim to say one cross word about anybody on that committee no matter \nwhat. He wouldn't do it.\n\n  I was taking the subway and saw John talking to a person, perhaps \nposing for a picture. And sometimes the people were not sure who he \nwas. One time a person asked: Do you know which Senator that was, sir? \nAnd I said: I do. That is Senator John Chafee. They said: What do you \nknow about him? I said: He is the nicest man in the Senate, and don't \nforget it.\n  He was. He looked after his colleagues.\n  In 1996, when I ran for reelection, there were attacks on my \nenvironmental record that were not justified.\n\n[[Page S13124]]\n\n He came to my aid in New Hampshire and spent a day up there with me \ndeflecting those attacks. Although he was criticized for doing it, he \ndid it anyway. He was glad to do it. I will never forget it.\n  Both New Englanders, Chafee and Smith, both veterans, both committed \nto protecting the environment, John a far greater leader than I in that \nregard, we did have a lot in common. We disagreed on issues, as well. \nIf there was anyone who ever lived who perfected the art of disagreeing \nwithout being disagreeable, it was John Chafee. Many times I marveled \nat his ability to participate in a heated debate, in close quarters, \nsometimes without losing his composure and his good humor. One of the \nqualities I will always remember about John was his demeanor and good \nhumor.\n  When I first came to the Senate--and Senator Warner referred to this \nyesterday--one of his favorite expressions was, ``Oh, dear.'' Senator \nWarner spoke eloquently about it yesterday. I had a personal experience \nwith ``Oh, dear'' when I first came to the Senate in 1990 and we \nreorganized the Senate. I didn't know people that well. I was getting \npressure from some Senators on one quarter to vote for one person for \nleadership and others were suggesting I vote for Senator Chafee. As I \nwent into the last moments before the vote in the Republican \nconference, I still had not made up my mind.\n\n  Finally I decided. My decision was to vote against Senator Chafee. So \nI said: I have to tell him this. My conscience would bother me too much \nif I didn't walk up and tell him before the vote because it was a \nsecret ballot. I walked up and I said: John, I just want to let you \nknow I decided to vote for the other guy, and he just said, ``Oh, \ndear.'' And he lost by one vote.\n  It really was the beginning of a long friendship which I will always \ncherish. There will be a lot of tributes to Senator Chafee over the \nnext several months. None of them will do justice to the memory of his \nlegacy. I would like to propose one myself today, as one small way to \ndeal with that legacy. As we all know, throughout his career John \nfought for the protection of our natural resources. One initiative many \nAmericans may not appreciate that was sponsored by Senator Chafee in \n1982 was the Coastal Barrier Resources Act. I know enacting that into \nlaw was one of the proudest moments of Senator Chafee's tenure here.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues who are not familiar with this act, \nits primarily purpose is to restrict Federal expenditures and financial \nassistance that encouraged the development of undeveloped coastal \nbarriers. Development in ecologically critical coastal barriers along \nthe Atlantic and Gulf coasts not only damaged fish and other natural \nresources but often resulted in the loss of human life as well.\n  The act permitted Federal expenditures for energy resource \ndevelopment, military activities, channel improvements, conservation \nactivities, emergencies, navigation aids, and scientific research \nprojects. It permitted, but did not require, interested private \nlandowners to enter the system on a voluntary basis. The Coastal \nBarrier Resources System comprises approximately 3 million acres and \n2,500 shoreline miles.\n  This act was vintage Chafee. It was balanced. It was fiscally \nprudent. It was environmentally protective. I can think of no more \nfitting tribute to Senator John Chafee than to name the system created \nby that legislation the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources \nSystem. I intend to introduce legislation to that effect and look \nforward to its quick passage with the support of my colleagues.\n  In closing, I say to Ginny and to the children and grandchildren, our \nthoughts and prayers are with you. All of us are proud to have called \nyour husband, your father, and your grandfather, a friend. He was a \ndecent, wonderful man. I am proud to call him a friend.\n  I would like to close reading Psalm 15, which the Chafee staff read \nin an effort to comfort one another about their leader. The Psalm is as \nfollows:\n\n     Lord, who may dwell in your tabernacle? who may abide upon \n           your holy hill?\n\n     Whoever leads a blameless life and does what is right, who \n           speaks the truth from his heart.\n\n     There is no guile upon his tongue; he does no evil to his \n           friend; he does not heap contempt upon his neighbor.\n     In his sight the wicked is rejected, but he honors those who \n           fear the Lord.\n     He has sworn to do no wrong and does not take back his word.\n     He does not give his money in hope of gain, nor does he take \n           a bribe against the innocent.\n     Whoever does these things shall never be overthrown.\n\n  It is a wonderful tribute from the Chafee staff to their friend and \ntheir boss. I don't think it could be said any better than that.\n  We will miss you, John, but we are a lot richer because you were here \nwith us.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield? I want to tell the Senator what a \ngracious suggestion he has made, naming the Coastal Barrier Resources \nSystem after Senator John Chafee. I cannot think of a more fitting \ntribute with respect to legislation with which he has been associated. \nI hope, therefore, we can bring that bill out quickly--I do not think \nit is controversial at all--and pass it in this session of this \nCongress. I thank the Senator. I express my appreciation to the Senator \nfor such a gracious thought, and I will join with him, moving as \nquickly as we can to make that become law with John's name on it.\n  All of us are at a loss to find the words. We dig down deep to try to \nascertain the meaning of John's death. It was so sudden. It happened so \nquickly, and to such a wonderful, decent, good man. I think basically \nall of us are going to be remembered to some degree by who we are as \npeople, more than what legislation we passed. We all work together here \nto pass legislation, but it is really the character of the person that \nis remembered by family, friends, associates.\n  I can think of no person for whom I presently do have a fonder memory \nor more respect than John Chafee. There is no man who was more of a \ngood man than John Chafee. His decency, his civility--they do not come \nany better. They just don't. We are all thinking about John. Words \ndon't come to us--certainly not to this Senator at this moment--but we \nall know what a good man he was. We cherish those memories very deeply.\n  He was a great Senator.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to remember our friend John \nChafee. The state of Rhode Island and the United States have lost a \ngreat man--a valiant soldier, a dedicated statesman and a gentleman of \na breed we don't see enough of these days.\n  I always felt an affinity with John because our political careers \nfollowed similar paths. Like me, he returned from military service \noverseas and soon began his political career in his home state of Rhode \nIsland, eventually serving as Governor and then as a United States \nSenator.\n  The courage and integrity that earned John accolades in the Marine \nCorps marked his tenure in the Senate, where he stood up for issues he \nbelieved in, no matter the opposition, and worked to break gridlock \nbetween Democrats and Republicans and forge partnerships amid \npartisanship. He knew when to be a leader in his party and when to be a \nloner, and most people respected him dearly for it. A former Secretary \nof the Navy, he steered his own course.\n  Environmentalists will remember John Chafee as their chief Republican \nally, a man whose vision led to the crafting of numerous pieces of key \nlegislation, including the 1988 law against ocean dumping, the 1989 oil \nspill law and most notably the Clean Air Act of 1990. More recently, he \nled successful efforts to enact oil spill prevention and response \nlegislation and a bill to strengthen the Safe Drinking Water Act. His \nyears of commitment to the protection of the nation's wetlands and \nbarrier islands are also tributes to his environmental legacy.\n  John had many visions, one of which was providing all Americans with \ncomprehensive health care. His hard work in drafting a Republican \nhealth care package and pushing for a bipartisan compromise will not be \nforgotten. Neither will his efforts to expand health care coverage for \nwomen and children, improve community services for persons with \ndisabilities and reduce the federal budget deficit.\n  Democrats and Republicans alike in John's home state of Rhode Island \nknew they had a friend in their Senator. He fought for local issues \nwith\n\n[[Page S13125]]\n\nthe same vigor as national ones. When he announced this March that he \nwould not seek a fifth Senate term in 2000, he became emotional as he \nexplained, ``I want to go home.'' In many ways I think John has gone \nhome, in that he took his deep love of Rhode Island and its residents \nwith him as he left this earth on Sunday.\n  As a Marine, John Chafee followed the motto ``Semper Fi,'' or \n``always faithful.'' He carried that motto with him throughout his \nlife. He was always faithful to his state, his country and his family. \nI will miss him and his statesmanship on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, even now that we've had a moment to pause \nand reflect, it's hard to believe just how quickly John Chafee was \ntaken from us. His passing, without any warning, caught us all \nunawares, and it leaves a hole in our lives and our work that will not \nbe easily filled.\n  Like so many of my colleagues, I will always recall John's friendly, \ncourteous personality--the way he listened carefully to what you had to \nsay and explained any differences he had in position or philosophy. His \ninterest in a vast variety of subjects and the knowledge and insight \nthat he shared on them made him both a friend and a teacher to his \ncolleagues in the Senate.\n  I remember my first year in the United States Senate. I was working \nhard on an issue I really wanted to make some progress on. In an effort \nto encourage people to clean up environmental hazards, some States had \nprovided a way where businesses could search for problems, identify \nthem, begin to correct them, and then have reduced or no fines \ndepending on the severity of the situation. The language of this \nregulation varied from State to State. Then the Environmental \nProtection Agency started coming into the States following these \nenvironmental audits and fining people. They were also threatening to \ntake away the State's ability to continue to allow these audits.\n  I drafted a bill to make the environmental audits federally accepted. \nI wasn't on the right committee for this legislation and I hadn't had \nan opportunity to get my bill taken up for consideration when the \nappropriations process came around. So, I submitted my bill as an \namendment. Senator Chafee had me meet with him. He explained the \nappropriations process, and then explained the complexities of taking \nup my bill as an amendment. He said if I would withdraw my amendment he \nwould hold a hearing in his committee. I withdrew my amendment certain \nthere would be no further action taken on it that session.\n  Shortly after my visit with Senator Chafee, and without any \nadditional urging on my part, he had set a date for a hearing on \nenvironmental audits. During the hearing, Senator Chafee's indepth \nquestions helped to bring focus and perspective to the issue at hand. \nWhen the hearing was gaveled to a close, everyone had a better \nunderstanding of the problem and what we needed to do to correct it.\n  A few months later, Kyoto, Japan became the site for the Global \nClimate Change Conference. Senator Chafee and I and several others went \nto Kyoto to reaffirm our position and deliver the message included in \nthe Senate resolution dealing with global climate change. While we were \nthere I attended several meetings with him. I also spent some time \noutside of the meetings with him. It was a good opportunity to break \nbread with him and get to know this very fine man a little better.\n  I recall our first night to Kyoto. Several members of the delegation \nchecked on places to eat and they had selected a restaurant. Senator \nChafee checked to see how expensive the restaurant was. He thought that \nwas too much money to spend on any dinner. So, he had his dinner in the \nhotel lobby. I joined him and appreciated very much the evening of \ndiscussion that we had on Japan, global climate change, and a variety \nof environmental issues. Eating our dinner and sharing our views gave \nme a little more insight into the character of this phenomenal man who \nsat next to me.\n  John had a remarkable ability to bring people together--and keep them \ntogether. He also had a gift for putting into words that one, deep, \nprobing question that got right to the heart of the matter. And, in \nthese days when it is sometime more popular to cling to what is \npolitically correct than what is right--John never wavered in his \nbeliefs and he never compromised his principles. He always stood tall \nand proud for what he believed in. That's why he was always so deeply \nrespected by this colleagues and his constituents.\n  Something tells me that God must have had a special need for someone \nwith John's unique skills, so He called him home. I wouldn't be \nsurprised if right now, John is chairing a meeting with God's angels in \nheaven to help get them more organized and focused, too. That would be \njust like him.\n  In the years to come, I think what I will miss most about John will \nbe his warmth, his laugh, his voice, and his walk before and after the \ncane. John was both a gentleman and a gentle man and his remarkable \npersona will be greatly missed. For the moment we will each cling to \nthe instant replay memories we have of him to help to fill the void his \npassing leaves behind.\n  John, your service in the Senate leaves us all with a good example \nfor us to follow in the way you always gave totally of yourself to your \nfamily, to your state, to each of us, to your country and to the world \naround us. Thanks for all the ways you've served us all. Thanks for all \nthe things you've done. So much of your State, our country, and parts \nall around this great world of ours bear your mark for your having \npassed by. Thanks for the seeds that you planted that will effect the \nfuture. Because of them, you will never be forgotten.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning \nthe recent passing of Mr. Chafee.\n  Mr. Chafee was one of a kind. His life was a life of service. He \nserved in two great wars--World War II and the Korean conflict, rising \nfrom private to captain. He served Rhode Island as a member of the \nRhode Island House of Representatives and as Governor, then as its \nUnited States Senator.\n  He has left a most positive legacy for the citizens of this land to \nemulate. But his greatest legacy was a legacy of decency. It mattered \nvery little to Mr. Chafee whether a proposal was made by the Democrats \nor the Republicans. His only question was: Is this program or project \nin the best interest of this nation?\n  Our nation has lost a great leader and a most dedicated public \nservant. The State of Rhode Island has lost its most brilliant star. \nBut for many, many of us--we have lost a friend. I will miss him.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are all deeply saddened by the sudden \nloss of our colleague and friend, John Chafee. He was a very special \nMember of the Senate who embodied the noblest traditions of this \ninstitution. He would fight with great vigor and passion for the \nprinciples he believed in, trying to persuade colleagues to adopt his \npoint of view. But his devotion to a cause never made him intransigent \nor unwilling to consider competing ideas.\n  John Chafee had a unique ability to build consensus, and he was \nforever searching to find common ground across partisan and ideological \nbattlelines. He was a student of history, and he knew that principled \ncompromise was essential if the legislative process is to serve the \npublic interest. He understood that a Congress mired in gridlock could \nnot solve the Nation's problems.\n  He cared far too deeply about the country he served to accept \npolitical stalemate. Because of his deep commitment to these abiding \nprinciples, he held the trust and respect of colleagues across the \npolitical spectrum, and he was often able to find that common ground \nwhen others could not.\n  John Chafee's 23 years in the Senate have truly made a difference. \nThe American people enjoy cleaner air and cleaner water because of his \ntireless and skillful efforts to protect the environment. Foster \nchildren are treated more humanely because he assumed the role of their \nlegislative guardian. Poor families who must depend on Medicaid have \nmore secure access to health care because of his concern for their \nwell-being.\n  While John Chafee was a skilled consensus builder, he was never \nreluctant to speak out on controversial issues. His gentle and gracious \nmanner was accompanied by a very strong will. His political courage was \nevident on a broad range of issues--from his outspoken advocacy of \nbanning the manufacture and sale of handguns, to his\n\n[[Page S13126]]\n\nvigorous defense of abortion rights, to his steadfast support for \nnuclear weapons control. He was a man of principle, whose strength was \nevident to all who knew him. I will always remember his extraordinary \nefforts in 1993 and 1994 to enact health insurance coverage for all \nAmericans. Through that battle, John Chafee never gave up and never \ngave in. He showed great perseverance under exceptional pressure, and \ngreat commitment to a cause he believed in deeply.\n  His ideals and patriotism was shaped as a young soldier in combat on \nGuadalcanal and Okinawa during World War II and in the Korean conflict. \nTom Brokaw has called John Chafee's generation ``The Greatest \nGeneration.'' In his well-known book by that name, Mr. Brokaw wrote:\n\n       They came of age during the Great Depression and the Second \n     World War and went on to build modern America--men and women \n     whose everyday lives of duty, honor, achievement, and courage \n     gave us the world we have today.\n\n  John Chafee symbolizes those eloquent words. As a state legislator, \nas Governor of Rhode Island, as Secretary of the Navy, and as a four-\nterm United States Senator, John Chafee devoted his entire adult life \nto public service. He gave our nation not only length of service, but \nservice of the highest caliber. He believed in the capacity of \ngovernment to improve the lives of its citizens, and he worked every \nday to make it so. His distinguished service will leave a lasting \nlegacy.\n  We all feel his loss today. But it will be felt even more deeply by \nthe Senate as time passes. We will miss his wise counsel, we will miss \nhis political courage, and we will miss his extraordinary ability to \nbuild bridges across partisan and ideological divides.\n  I extend my deepest sympathy to John's wife, Virginia, and to his \nchildren and grandchildren. Our Senate family truly shares your loss.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, our friend and colleague John Chafee was a \ngood man, a first among equals. He was a statesman and a public \nservant. He dedicated his professional life to the service of his \ncountry. He was a good friend to colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  John Chafee was respected by all who knew and served with him. And he \nreturned that respect in kind. He was a bridge builder, always looking \nfor a way to craft consensus.\n  He set aside partisanship and put his energies into working for the \ngreater good. And he won high praise from a wide spectrum of admirers, \nfrom the ACLU to the Chamber of Commerce!\n  John had an early and lifelong sense of duty to his country. He left \ncollege in 1942 to join the Marine Corps. He fought in the U.S. \ninvasion of Guadalcanal and later on Okinawa. He returned to active \nmilitary duty in 1951 in Korea. Between his tours of duty, John earned \nhis bachelor's degree at Yale and his law degree at Harvard.\n  He built a career of distinguished service to his state and his \nnation. He served in the Rhode Island House of Representatives (1957-\n63), as Governor of Rhode Island (1963-69), as Secretary of the Navy \n(1969-72). And in 1977, John Chafee came to the United States Senate, \nthe first Republican Senator elected in his state in 46 years.\n  No matter where public service took him, his heart was always in \nRhode Island. And it was to Rhode Island that he planned to retire next \nyear.\n  John Chafee wore many titles in his lifetime, and he wore them all \nwith distinction: Captain, Governor, Secretary, Senator.\n  But I believe that John was proudest of being a husband, father, and \ngrandfather. He was devoted to his family--to Virginia, their five \nchildren, and twelve grandchildren. Their loss is tremendous, and I \nhope in the days and weeks ahead they take some small comfort in John's \nmagnificent legacy.\n  When the major achievements of the 20th Century are recounted, many \nof them will bear the mark of John Chafee: the Clean Air Act, the \nSuperfund, Social Security, fair housing, civil rights.\n  He played a major role in every major piece of environmental \nlegislation that has passed during the past two decades. He fought for \nhealth care coverage for low income families and expanded coverage for \nuninsured children.\n  He fought for the Family and Medical Leave Act. John made it his \nmission to ensure that no American fell between the cracks. And \nAmerica's women, children, and families are the beneficiaries.\n  John Chafee and I worked together long and hard to protect kids from \ntobacco addiction. In 1998, we introduced the first comprehensive \nbipartisan tobacco prevention bill--the Kids Deserve Freedom from \nTobacco Act.\n  Our bill--also known as the KIDS Act--was designed to cut tobacco use \nby kids in half over a three-year period. John took some risks in \njoining this bipartisan effort, but he did it because he was a \npassionate advocate for children.\n  I also had the privilege of working with John on disability issues. \nHe was a major champion for creating alternatives to institutions for \npeople with disabilities.\n  Senator Chafee's work to create the Medicaid home and community-based \nwaivers opened the doors to independent living for tens of thousands of \npeople with disabilities. His efforts in this area alone are too \nnumerous to recount.\n  In addition, he worked in true bipartisan manner to promote maternal \nand child health programs and to protect thousands of children with \ndisabilities from losing SSI.\n  John Chafee's commitment to fighting for what he believed in was \nmatched by the dedication of his longtime, loyal staff. Our hearts go \nout to all of them.\n  Mr. President, John Chafee was a humble giant. He had a broad, \ninclusive vision. He was principled and thoughtful. He asked and gave \nthe best of himself in everything he did. He didn't seek recognition. \nHe just rolled up his sleeves and got to work. His spirit and his voice \nwill be sorely missed. I am privileged to call him my friend.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nmourning the untimely death of our friend, John Chafee. Today, we \ncelebrate the enthusiastic spirit he brought with him each day to the \nSenate, and the generous public spirit exemplified by his work.\n  With John's passing, the State of Rhode Island has lost a leader, the \nSenate has lost a statesman, and the Chafee family has lost a loving, \ndedicated husband, father, and grandfather. As the Senate family, the \nprayers of John's colleagues and our staffs are with Ginny and her \nentire family.\n  Many of my colleagues have recited the accomplishments of John \nChafee. They bear repeating, however.\n  Before his achievements as a legislator, John was a leader in the \nMarines. He served in the original invasion at Guadalcanal, and when he \nwas recalled to active duty in 1951, he commanded a rifle company in \nKorea.\n  John then turned his service to the State of Rhode Island, first as a \nmember of its House of Representatives, where he eventually attained \nthe rank of Minority Leader. In 1962, John ran for Governor and won--\nthough it was a very close race. He increased that margin of victory \nsignificantly in the following two elections, in 1964 and 1966, when he \nwas reelected with the largest margin in the State's history.\n  Following his governorship, John Chafee went on to serve as Secretary \nof the Navy for three and a half years.\n  Beginning in 1976, John began his long career in the U.S. Senate. As \nthe only Republican elected from Rhode Island in the past 68 years, \nJohn vigorously pursued the interests of his constituents, including \nenvironmental issues, health care concerns, and efforts to reduce the \nFederal budget deficit. Through his position on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, and mine on the Foreign Relations Committee, we worked \nclosely together on a number of fronts to support free trade and oppose \nunilateral sanctions. I recall at one point we were two of five \nSenators who opposed a resolution we both thought was harmful to our \nrelationships with another country.\n  John Chafee's contributions to this Senate, however, go much deeper \nthan just those outlined within the pages of his impressive biography.\n  I remember when I moved from the House to the Senate, and those \nearly, confusing days working out of the cramped Dirksen basement. John \nChafee was moving his office at the same time, and he invited me up to \nlook his over. He made this new Senator feel welcome in a place where\n\n[[Page S13127]]\n\nbonds between the ``old-timers'' are strong and newcomers can sometimes \nfeel intimidated. Ultimately, I didn't take John Chafee's office, but I \ngladly accepted his friendship. When I last spoke to John, during a \nshort conversation in this Chamber late last week, he talked about his \nson, Lincoln, and the possibility that son would replace father in the \nSenate. I think he took great pride in the thought of his family \ncarrying on his tradition of public service.\n  I was moved by the words of John Chafee's staff in a statement they \ncollectively issued on Monday. It said, in part: ``His sense of public \nspirit was infectious, and we have all learned a great deal from him. \nBut more important than any lesson in civics is the example he set for \nall of us about how to conduct our lives: listen to both sides; do \nwhat's right; always look for the good in people; and, even if you \ndon't prevail, be of good cheer.''\n  Mr. President, John was a tireless advocate for his constituents, a \nman who sought agreement in the often-acrimonious atmosphere of \nWashington, a man who brought meaning to the idea of giving one's word \nand standing by one's principles. And he was consistently of good \ncheer. I was proud to serve with him, and proud to consider him a \nfriend.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the life and \nlegacy of a dear friend and colleague, Senator John Chafee.\n  I was deeply saddened yesterday to hear of Senator Chafee's passing. \nThe Chafee family lost a dear husband, father and grandfather. My \nthoughts and prayers go out to Virginia, his children, and his \ngrandchildren. The Senate lost one of our most principled and reasoned \ncolleagues. Senator Chafee will be greatly missed here. The people of \nRhode Island, whose needs and concerns guided his actions on a daily \nbasis, lost an admired Senator. His impact will be felt in Rhode Island \nfor generations to come. Our country lost a tireless leader who \nconsistently fought for what he believed in, and for that, I am deeply \nsaddened.\n  Senator Chafee was the kind of Senator that this country needs. In \ntimes of increasing partisanship, John Chafee always reached across the \naisle to form alliances, to build compromises, to get things done. He \nlet principles, not politics, be his guide. And that enabled him to be \nan unbending bridge between both sides that we have so desperately \nneeded.\n  Senator Chafee's politics was the kind of politics this country \nneeds. He inspired voters on both sides of the party line with his \nhonest, independent politics. Senator Chafee always believed that \npersistent honesty and unshakeable integrity were the cornerstones of \npublic life. His was always the quiet voice of reason.\n  And Senator Chafee was the kind of person this country needs. John \nChafee devoted his life to public service--as a Marine, as a State \nlegislator and minority leader in the Rhode Island House, as Governor \nof Rhode Island, as Secretary of the Navy, and as a United States \nSenator. He and his wife Virginia raised a beautiful family, and \ninstilled in them the values of public service and integrity. I am \nproud to have worked with such a distinguished man.\n  We will always celebrate, and never forget, the work that was born of \nhis public service, his commitment to his family, and his commitment to \nhis principles. Senator Chafee's work here in the Senate has had a \ntremendous impact on our nation. He leaves a remarkable legacy.\n  We will always celebrate Senator Chafee's leadership on the Clean Air \nAct. We will always celebrate his fight to strengthen the Safe Drinking \nWater Act. We will always celebrate his hard work in authoring the \nSuperfund program. The air we breathe and the water we drink is cleaner \nand safer because of his landmark efforts.\n  We will always remember his unwavering advocacy for a woman's right \nto chose. We will always remember his fight to enact the Family and \nMedical Leave bill. We will always remember his important work to curb \ngun violence in America. Our families are stronger, our constitutional \nrights have been protected, and our streets are safer because of his \nsteadfast devotion to these causes.\n  In these ways and more, Mr. President, we will always remember and \ncelebrate his quiet strength, his unwavering commitment to the people \nof his state, and to his own principles. Senator Chafee has had an \nindelible impact on our policy and our politics, on our culture and our \ncountry. And for that, we will always be grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13127-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern about \nthe President's latest Social Security proposal as outlined in his \nrecent radio address. I hope Congress will resolve to oppose this \nproposal unless it can be significantly modified, and it does not \nappear the President wants to modify it.\n  I am greatly disappointed with the decision by the President to bring \nforward this proposal. I had hoped to work with the President in a \nbipartisan manner to resolve the Social Security issue. There are a \nnumber of us in the Senate who are willing to go forward in a \nbipartisan manner on this issue. For example, Senator Kerrey, Senator \nBreaux, Senator Grassley, and I have introduced a comprehensive Social \nSecurity reform bill. I have been pleased with this bipartisan effort, \nat least in the Senate, but I have been extremely disappointed by the \nWhite House's continued partisan approach toward the Social Security \nproblem and especially their most recent proposal, which is, to say the \nleast, a sham proposal. My goal today is to make absolutely clear for \nmy colleagues just why this proposal does not work.\n  This is not an easy task because it is a complicated and confusing \nissue, but it is something that must be done. Regrettably, I think the \ncomplicated and confusing nature of the proposal was intentionally \ncreated in that concept so the people would not understand it, so it \nwould be confusing, and so that, therefore, by glossing over it with \nterms such as ``saving Social Security,'' they could attempt to hide \nthe underlying documents and energy of it, which is to basically \nundermine Social Security.\n  Thus, it is vitally important that we all understand exactly what is \nat stake. So I am going to go back to basics and try to simplify this \nas much as I can.\n  In its simplest terms, the Social Security system has enough money to\n\n[[Page S13128]]\n\npay benefits today but does not have enough money to pay the projected \nbenefits in the future, beginning in the year 2014. That is the entire \nproblem.\n  What will we do in the year 2014 under the current law? We will have \nto raise additional money through the income tax, through the general \nrevenues of the Federal Government. The gap between benefits promised \nand the Social Security taxes will get bigger and bigger every year. It \nwill be $200 billion annually by the year 2020 and $666 billion \nannually by the year 2030. Under the current law, we will simply keep \nraising revenues every year until the Federal Government has paid \neverything it owes to the Social Security system in the year 2034.\n  When we reach that point, we declare insolvency, the Government of \nthe United States, and the benefits would have to be cut, and Social \nSecurity would basically go into a tailspin. These funding gaps are so \nlarge, it would be unfair to a future generation to wait until that \ntime and do the drastic cuts in benefits or radical increases in taxes \nwhich would occur in order to pay for the system. That is why so many \nof us have been calling for a comprehensive reform, a reform that will \nbegin now, when we have time to work on the system and to make it work.\n  What has the President proposed? The President has proposed that as \npart of any lockbox legislation we accompany the lockbox with a \nprovision that will transfer interest payments to the Social Security \nsystem. It is vital that my colleagues understand two things: This \nproposal would do nothing, absolutely nothing, to fund the future \nSocial Security benefit; in fact, it would undermine the Social \nSecurity system by giving the false assurance of improvement. Secondly, \nthis proposal would formally commit tens of trillions of dollars in new \nincome taxes, simply through some accounting sleight of hand. That \nmeans that future generations, our children, our grandchildren, would \nget a tax increase as a result of this President's proposal which would \nrun into the trillions of dollars.\n  To understand why, let me first show my colleagues this quote from \nthe President's budget of last year. It was tucked away on page 337 in \nthe analytical perspective section. Some budget analyst must have \nexperienced an attack of truth in budgeting and included the language. \nIt is definitive.\n\n       Trust Fund balances are available to finance future benefit \n     payments and other trust fund expenditures--but only in a \n     bookkeeping sense . . . They do not consist of real economic \n     assets that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits. \n     Instead, they are claims on the Treasury that, when redeemed, \n     will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the \n     public, or reducing benefits or other expenditures. The \n     existence of large trust fund balances, therefore, does not, \n     by itself, have any impact on the Government's ability to pay \n     benefits.\n\n  That last sentence is the clearest explanation of what the problem \nis. No matter how large the trust fund stated number is, it does \nnothing to pay down the benefits, if there are not assets to back it up \nwhich can be drawn on without raising taxes.\n  I hope every Member of Congress understands this. I hope the American \npeople understand it. If we use our power to artificially inflate the \nbalance of the trust, it does not do the beneficiaries one bit of good. \nIf we decree that it is a $1 trillion or a $10 trillion or even a \nnothing number in the trust fund, it has exactly the same financial \nimpact. It has no impact on the outyear benefit structure. So the \nPresident's proposal to credit the trust fund with the interest savings \nwill have no impact at all on the structure of the system and the \nliability which the American taxpayer will have to pay to support the \nsystem in the outyears.\n  What it would do, however, is give a false impression that we have \ntaken some substantive action. And that, of course, is the goal of this \nPresident--politics over substance. We already have a problem of \nunderstanding. Already the Social Security system's problems are \npapered over by the declaration of actuarial solvency through the year \n2034. This disguises the fact that the real problem for us and for the \nnext generation begins in the year 2014. What the President is \neffectively saying is that we should now paper over the problem even \nfurther, that we should wait until the year 2050.\n\n  Earlier this year, the Comptroller of the United States, David \nWalker, testified before the Senate Finance Committee. He was speaking \nabout the President's proposal of earlier this year, but his comments \nare equally valid regarding the most recent proposal he has put \nforward. He said:\n\n       . . . it is important to note that the President's proposal \n     does not alter the projected cash-flow imbalances in the \n     Social Security program. Benefit costs and revenues currently \n     associated with the program will not be affected by even one \n     cent.\n\n  In other words, the proposal the President is putting forward has \nabsolutely no impact on the ability to pay the benefits that are going \nto be required to be paid to maintain the Social Security system in the \noutyears.\n  Moreover, he went on to say: One of the risks of the proposal is that \nthe additional years of financing may very well diminish the urgency to \nachieve meaningful changes in the program. That would not be in the \noverall best interest of the Nation. It would be tragic, indeed, if \nthis proposal masked the urgency of the Social Security solvency \nproblem and served to delay the much-needed action.\n  In other words, even though this proposal would not do anything for \nSocial Security, it would make the representation to the public that we \nhad. This would become a license for irresponsibility. It would break \nthe faith of the Social Security beneficiaries by representing that the \nproblem had been solved for another 50 years, even though we have taken \nabsolutely no real action.\n  Here is a chart that shows the workings of the Social Security system \nin a simplified form and represents the problems we confront. On the \nleft of the chart, we can see the projections under the current law. On \nthe right-hand side of the chart, we can see projections under the \nPresident's proposal. There is absolutely no difference. The \nPresident's proposal has no effect on the problems of the system. \nCurrent law problems which caused the system to go into insolvency are \ngoing to exist in the same form if we follow the President's proposal.\n  The numbers are startling. We term it insolvent in the year 2040 \nbecause the cost is so high. Under the President's proposal, it is a \n$1.1 trillion increase in the year 2040 on the taxpayers of America, \nwhich, in my opinion, represents an insolvency event, if we follow the \nPresident's proposal.\n  What is the President's argument? He is arguing that his program \nprovides for additional reduction in public debt and that we can \njustify these additional income tax liabilities by the fact that the \npublic debt has been reduced and debt service has also been reduced. \nBut, once again, the reality is different from the claim. If you study \nthe Social Security actuary's memo in the President's plan written last \nSaturday, October 23, you would find the following information. I hope \nthe press will pick up on this. Transfers are not contingent on actual \namounts of reductions of debt held by the public. Transfers are assumed \nto be as indicated, regardless of the effect on the budget balances.\n  Now, it may well be the President will yet propose a way to require \nthat only a reduction in public debt will trigger the transfers he has \nsuggested, but that is not what his current proposal says. His current \nproposal only issues this new debt and these new liabilities and does \nnot make them in any way contingent upon public debt being reduced. \nThis is not a plan to reduce public debt. It is a plan to issue new \ndebt. It creates new income tax obligations, regardless of what happens \nwith the overall budget balance. It has nothing to do with \nstraightening out the Social Security system by reducing public debt. \nIt is simply an increase in income tax obligations as a result of an \nincrease in debt obligations of the Federal Government.\n  One other point: The President believes it is appropriate to reward \nSocial Security by giving it the interest savings from the reduced \npublic debt. Current law already credits Social Security with interest, \nas if we had saved the surplus, whether we do or do not. This is \ncurrent law. What the President is proposing is that we give a second \nround of transfers to the Social Security system. We are already \ncrediting Social Security with interest saved. That is what produced \nthe finding that the system is sound until the year 2034.\n\n[[Page S13129]]\n\n  The President is simply proposing that we arbitrarily issue a second \nround of credit, not justified or contingent upon anything happening in \npublic debt reduction, and increase the income tax obligations to the \nprogram. Remember, again, all the taxes the President is talking about \npouring into this program as a result of this accounting process \ngimmickry are income taxes; they are not payroll taxes.\n  So we are shifting the burden, under the President's proposal, of the \nSocial Security system from being a payroll tax system to being an \nincome tax system, from going to a system where the people who receive \nthe benefit under the retirement process and pay for it during their \nworking lives are now receiving a benefit from the general revenue fund \nand the income tax fund versus the payroll tax fund. That is a huge \nchange in the basic philosophy of the way we have supported the Social \nSecurity system. The President does this with his proposal, which is to \ncreate a new accounting mechanism.\n  So the practical effect of the President's proposal is to do \nabsolutely nothing in the way of resolving the fundamental problems \nthat confront Social Security. The practical effect of the President's \nproposal is to create an accounting gimmick that makes you feel as if \nyou have done something. The practical effect of the President's \nproposal is to undermine the momentum for fundamental, fair, effective \nSocial Security reform in exchange for a political statement that may \nget you through the next election but which is going to create major \ncrises for the system in the outyears.\n  The President's proposal fails any form of accounting test. The \nPresident's proposal fails any form of a reasonable review. The \nPresident's proposal, most importantly, fails the next generation and \nthe generation behind it because what it does is transfer onto their \nbacks, for the sake of a political statement today, a tax burden that \nwill amount to trillions of dollars. It is an action that is absolutely \ninappropriate and which I hope this Congress and the American people \nwill reject.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13129-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I want to address the subject of Social \nSecurity, as my colleague from New Hampshire has so eloquently \naddressed a few minutes ago. It is a matter about which we are all \nconcerned. We all agree that something is going to have to be done \nabout it because the numbers simply don't work. We all know that the \nmoney needed to pay to more and more retirees is not going to be \nsufficient because we are not going to have a sufficient number of \npeople paying into the trust fund. We are going to have more and more \nretirees and fewer and fewer workers in the future. The numbers simply \nare not going to add up.\n  We all recognize that a day of reckoning is coming, and many of us \nhave been struggling to try to decide what to do about it. It seems as \nif there are really only three choices.\n  One is to raise taxes. We pay for Social Security with Social \nSecurity taxes, FICA taxes. We could raise them astronomically on \nfuture workers.\n  The second is to cut benefits, which, of course, nobody wants to do.\n  The third choice is to have some kind of fundamental restructuring \nand reform. I think more and more people have concluded that is what \nhas to happen.\n  A lot of people, including myself, think we have to have some system \nwhereby the worker can invest some of that money in those FICA taxes \nfor something that will have a much greater return than they are \ngetting today.\n  We were hoping that before the President left office, there would be \nsome leadership from the President in making some of the hard choices \nwe all know are going to have to be made. Any one of those choices I \nhave just described is not an easy political choice to make. It will \nnever be made unless we get some leadership from the President, at \nwhich point I think a lot of people will fall in line.\n  We have, on a bipartisan basis in the Senate, already been trying to \nwork toward that end. Frankly, I don't think the political risks are as \ngreat as a lot of people think. I think we should tell the people the \ntruth and do something, go ahead and do it. There is not a lot of risk \nto that. Most people believe otherwise. But we will have to have \nPresidential leadership under any circumstances.\n  The President has come forth with a plan which does not really do \nthose three things I mentioned before in terms of the alternatives, but \nhe seeks to basically put the problem off to another day. It is a good \nstrategy in a year before an election because it avoids the problem \nwhile pretending to solve it. But it certainly doesn't do anything to \nsolve it.\n  I think we can reach agreement on that with a pretty wide consensus \non a bipartisan basis in this body because too many Democrats and \nRepublicans have been working together and concluding that the approach \nthat has recently been suggested by the President is something that \njust won't work.\n  Here is the basic situation. Right now, mandatory spending programs \nsuch as Social Security and Medicare consume two-thirds of our Federal \nbudget. In 1980, it was 53 percent; 1990, 63 percent; today, 66.5 \npercent. By 2030, if no changes are made, mandatory spending, including \nSocial Security and Medicare, will eat up 100 percent of Federal \nrevenue.\n\n  We know we cannot go down that route forever. At the same time, we \nare facing a demographic time bomb that will place unprecedented new \nburdens on the Federal budget. The number of Americans over the age of \n65 will more than double between now and 2030. Also, during the same \nperiod, the working age of Americans will only increase by 25 percent. \nThis means there will be fewer people paying into the system to support \nmany more beneficiaries. Most everyone, myself included, argues that \nmore people living longer is not a bad problem to have. But it will \nplace tremendous strain on the Social Security Program and on our \nFederal budget, neither of which is particularly well equipped to deal \nwith it.\n  I cannot agree with the President when he said in his radio address \nthat his proposal to transfer general revenue credits--getting away \nfrom the FICA self-financing system that we have now, but dipping into \ngeneral revenue credits, coming in from income taxes because we have a \nsurplus now, that to transfer these credits into the Social Security \ntrust fund is ``the first big step toward truly saving Social \nSecurity.''\n  Let me first point out the general revenues the President wants to \ntransfer to Social Security come from the very same projected budget \nsurplus he said we could not count on for tax cuts. Now he is using \nthose same uncertain surpluses to so-called save Social Security. The \nPresident cannot have it both ways.\n  I will quote from testimony of David Walker, Comptroller General, \ntestifying before the Finance Committee in February. The Senator from \nNew Hampshire quoted Mr. Walker saying ``this does not represent a \nSocial Security reform plan.'' I will not quote all of his statement at \nthis point, but an additional statement he made was that ``the changes \nto the Social Security Program will thus be more perceived than real,'' \ntalking essentially the same as the President's plan. Although the \ntrust funds will appear to have more resources as a result of the \nproposal, in reality nothing about this program is changed. He \nconcluded that\n\n[[Page S13130]]\n\nthe proposal does not present Social Security reform but, rather, it \nrepresents a different means to finance the current program.\n  It is not Social Security reform and will not save Social Security. \nOne of the risks of the proposal is that the additional years of \nfinancing may very well diminish the urgency to achieve meaningful \nchanges in the program. That would not be in the overall best interests \nof the Nation. In other words, whether it is designed to have the \neffect of convincing people we are doing something that we are not, \nthat we don't have to address the problem for a while, when, in fact, \nwe are not taken care of, thereby makes the problem worse when we \nfinally do get around to instituting some responsible reforms.\n  I don't know if I can say it any better than the Comptroller. What \nthe President is proposing is to add more debt to the Social Security \ntrust fund, more paper IOUs that one day will have to be redeemed. What \nis different about these paper IOUs is that they do not represent \nexcess FICA taxes--money collected for the specific purpose of \nfinancing the Social Security Program. For the first time, the \nPresident is proposing to inject general revenue dollars into the trust \nfund, based on a calculation of interest savings we will realize as a \nresult of paying down the debt.\n\n  There are several problems with this. One, as the Comptroller General \npointed out, adding more IOUs to the trust fund may give the impression \non paper of extended solvency but it does not change by one minute the \nday on which the cash-flow problem comes home to roost; that is, the \nday on which payroll taxes will not be sufficient to cover benefit \npayments and we will have to begin redeeming the IOUs in the trust \nfund.\n  In the absence of real reform, as I said, there are only three ways \nto redeem the IOUs. Rather than taking steps to reduce the program's \nunfunded liability, the President's proposal makes us more reliant on \nthe unhappy choices of raising taxes or cutting benefits. Rather than \nacknowledging that we will have to either raise payroll taxes, adjust \nbenefits, or find a way to enable people to earn a higher return on \nFICA taxes, the President makes the program more dependent on future \ninfusions of general revenues from the Treasury--income taxes from \nyoung workers that will come into the system later on. That will only \nexacerbate the trend I discussed earlier in which an ever-increasing \nportion of the overall Federal budget is being dedicated to entitlement \nprograms for the elderly.\n  Everyone believes Social Security is a vitally important program, and \neveryone is committed to making sure that it is there for current \nseniors and future generations to rely upon. I am not sure we are all \ncommitted to the proposition that 100 percent of the Federal budget \nshould be dedicated to Social Security and Medicare. In fact, I am \npretty sure most believe the Federal Government has other \nresponsibilities as well, such as national defense, national parks, \ninfrastructure, and schools. That is the direction in which we are \nheaded and the President's proposal gets us there more quickly.\n  The second problem with transferring general revenues into the Social \nSecurity trust fund, as David Walker pointed out, is that will, in all \nlikelihood, diminish the momentum for real reform. If we continue to \navoid real reform, we only have to look at countries in western Europe \nto catch the glimpse of the problems we face: Pension benefits that are \non average 1\\1/2\\ to 2 times as generous as our Social Security; \nastronomical payroll taxes to fund the benefits; 40 percent in France; \n42 percent in Germany; 39 percent in Italy, on top of other taxes \nimposed by the government, and an average unemployment rate across \nEuropean Union countries that will be double that of the United States \nthis year, 9.1 versus 4.3.\n  According to a recent series in the Washington Post, it simply costs \ncompanies too much to create jobs in Europe. In Germany, the textile \nindustry, for example, payroll taxes and fringe benefits add 70 percent \nto the average salary. These countries have promised more than they can \nafford, just as we have.\n  We need to have a debate about structural reform of our Social \nSecurity Program. It needs to be a bipartisan debate. We need to have \nreal options on the table, not gimmicks designed to give one party \npolitical advantage over the other. I hope the President will agree to \nwork toward that goal, but until he does I hope we do not fall into the \ntrap of instituting something that makes the situation worse. That is \nwhat this proposal will do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, let me thank President Clinton for \nprovoking debate about Social Security and what we ought to be doing to \nextend the solvency of the program. I don't support the proposal he has \nmade, but I suspect there are many people in this body who don't \nsupport the proposal that I have made either. At least the President \nhas put on the table an idea, and it is an idea that enables us, if we \ntake a bit of time, to see what is wrong with the funding of this \nprogram and why there is an urgent need to fix it.\n  First, what the President does is exactly what I just heard the \nSenator from Tennessee say; what the President would do through his \nproposal is give beneficiaries who are alive between 2035 and 2050--\nbeneficiaries who are, today, between the ages of 30 and 45--an \nadditional $20 trillion claim on the income taxes of future working \nAmericans. That is how the President's proposal would be funded.\n  Under current law, we will need $6 trillion worth of income taxes to \npay beneficiaries between 2014 and 2034--this is above and beyond the \nrevenue beneficiaries can claim from the 12.4% payroll tax on all \nworking Americans. Today, there are 44 million beneficiaries: 39 \nmillion are old-age beneficiaries, 6.5 million are disabled, and 7 \nmillion are survivors. These beneficiaries receive the proceeds of a \n12.4-percent payroll tax on the wages of most working Americans.\n  I suspect most Members of Congress didn't realize that back in 1983 \nwe made a change in the law to assess a payroll tax that was larger \nthan needed to pay the bills. Since then, those extra payroll tax \ndollars have been spent on other things. Between 2014 and 2034, we will \nhave to pay back those borrowed Social Security payroll tax dollars \nwith interest--and we will do so by either increasing income taxes, \ncutting other spending, or increasing our national debt. This year, for \nexample, we will take in about $513 billion in revenue into the \nprogram--but we only need about $387 billion to cover expenditures. My \nguess is most Members of Congress didn't realize that the Treasury can \nonly use these excess payroll tax dollars to buy special-issue Treasury \nbonds. Eventually, the Treasury has to reconvert those bond assets to \ncash--and it does so by using income tax dollars. Starting in 2014, \nTreasury will have to use income taxes and corporate income taxes to \nconvert each and every single one of those bonds into cash that they \nwill then use to pay beneficiaries--about $6 trillion worth.\n\n  If that does not bother you that we have to use an additional $6 \ntrillion to pay benefits between 2014 and 2034--money that could have \nbeen spent on important discretionary spending programs, then you \nprobably like the President's proposal. If you want the Social Security \nprogram to become more and more a program that uses both payroll taxes \nin addition to individual and corporate income taxes, you probably like \nthe President's proposal. The President's proposal allows you to avoid \nmaking the difficult choices necessary in reforming Social Security, \nsuch as either explicitly raising the payroll tax--and I haven't heard \nanybody actually support that, although some have supported increasing \nthe wage base--or making benefit adjustments out in the future; or a \nthird way, which the Senator from Tennessee and I and half a dozen \nothers in this body have chosen to do, is to use a combination of \nbenefit adjustments out in the future, holding harmless everybody \ncurrently over the age of 62, and establishing retirement savings \naccounts--designed in a progressive way. Our plan ensures that women \nand low income individuals will receive significantly larger benefits. \nThat is the purpose of these savings accounts--to help all working \nAmericans build wealth for themselves. Privatization is just an attempt \nto give, especially that lower-wage individual, more than just the \npromise of a transfer payment coming from Social Security taxes. Our \ngoal is to make individuals less dependent on the government for their \nfinancial security at retirement.\n\n[[Page S13131]]\n\n  One of the most difficult and important things to understand in the \nSocial Security debate is this idea of solvency. Solvency is an \naccountant's term. There are 270 million Americans today--nearly all of \nwhom will be beneficiaries of the Social Security program at some point \nduring their lifetimes. More than 44 million are eligible today. That \nmeans there are 230 million beneficiaries who will be eligible at some \npoint in the future. That is the way to think about solvency--we have \nto make the program solvent for all retirees current and future. The \nidea is to keep the promise for every eventual beneficiary, whether you \nare 20 years old or 70 years old. Right now we cannot keep the promise \nto all 270 million Americans. There are approximately 145 million \nworking Americans under the age of 45 to whom we cannot keep the \npromise of paying benefits. According to the Social Security \nAdministration, these 145 million Americans will experience somewhere \nbetween a 25- and a 33-percent cut in benefits at some point during \ntheir retirement.\n  So when we talk about solvency, it is a real human issue. There are \n145 million Americans today to whom we are not going to be able to keep \nthe promise we made back in the 1930s. That is why a large percentage \nof young people say they don't believe Social Security will be there. \nThey are partly right--Social Security will be there, but in a much \nsmaller form as a consequence of Congress simply not having enough \nrevenue in the system to be able to cover the bills.\n  What the President says is that he doesn't want to propose a payroll \ntax increase, or benefit reductions. He doesn't want to support the \nidea of individual wealth accounts. What he wants to do is give the \nSocial Security beneficiaries out in the future a larger claim than \nthey would have under current law on income taxes--on the wages of \nfuture working Americans.\n  I believe we made a mistake in 1983; that diverting $6 trillion of \nindividual and corporate income taxes into the Social Security program \nmakes our tight discretionary budget problem even worse. The \nPresident's plan exacerbates this problem by saying what we should give \nan additional $20 trillion in income tax dollars to extend the solvency \nof the trust for another 20 years.\n  I will reiterate what I said at the beginning. I still appreciate the \nPresident's contribution to the debate. He has provoked, for a short \nperiod of time at least, a real debate about what we are going to do to \nsolve the problem of Social Security insolvency. I disagree with one \nelement of his proposal because I think it takes a necessity and \nconverts it into a virtue. I do hope, at least for a short period of \ntime, we will discuss and debate Social Security reform. I hope we can \ndiscuss in a constructive fashion, what we are going to do to reform \nthe program--rather than just talk about needing to fix Social \nSecurity. We need to discuss what we are going to do to finally change \nthe law to keep the promise to all 270 million American beneficiaries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask consent I be permitted to speak \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I did not come to the floor to speak \nexclusively on the issue of Social Security and the President's \nproposal. But before my good friend from Nebraska leaves, I wish to \nmake a couple of comments. Then I would like to share with the Senate \nsome very optimistic information with reference to our fiscal house and \nhow well we are doing in terms of growth of government.\n  I suggest Republicans did a good job when they came up with the idea \nof locking up these Social Security trust funds so they wouldn't be \nspent. Frankly, even as short a time ago as last year, nobody thought \nwe could quickly come upon a year when we would not spend a bit of the \nSocial Security trust fund money in paying for our Government and would \neven have some left over to start a pay-down of Social Security. But in \nthe year just passed, that actually happened. Things changed so much \nfor the positive that last year we did not touch Social Security trust \nfund money and we accumulated $1 billion in surplus on budget, and it \nhas nowhere to go except to pay down the debt--which helps with Social \nSecurity.\n  Frankly, I do not quite understand why, in the waning moments of this \nyear, over the weekend in his weekly radio address, the President came \nup with a new idea about Social Security. I speculate maybe the idea of \nthe lockbox and not spending any Social Security money was beginning to \ntake hold and, of course, his new proposal takes 15 years, not 10 \nyears, to get his job done that he perceives to be in the interests of \nSocial Security solvency.\n  I remind everyone, if in fact the President has a way, with no new \ntaxes, which none of us want, no benefit changes, no increases in what \neach particular citizen of the United States who puts money through the \npayroll account--they don't have any share of the profits and the \nincreases that come, either from Wall Street or from investing in \ndebt--somehow the Wizard of Oz came upon us and all of a sudden we can \ndo this by just investing IOUs. As my friend from Texas said, you just \ntake them as a piece of paper, walk them across the street, put them in \na cabinet, and say: We have given them to the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  The President has one better. At a point in time way out there \nsomewhere he is going to say: That is not the only thing I am doing. I \nam going to credit the Social Security account for the interest that \nwas saved on the national debt by us putting those IOUs in that box.\n  Over the weekend I had a chance to discuss this. I look forward to \nseeing some details. I cannot believe what I am hearing. But I \nnicknamed this proposal and I think it is so. I think it is the \n``Godzilla'' of all gimmicks. That is the way I would classify it, for \nthose who are wondering about gimmicks.\n  I am not going to talk much more about that. But I will say to the \nPresident, if you have a little time left before you leave, and if you \nwould like to fix Social Security, then engage in a bipartisan way, \nwith Senators on both sides of the aisle, who would like to do \nsomething that would help make Social Security a better investment for \nthe millions of Americans who are having this money taken out of their \npayroll and put in an account that yields them little or nothing.\n  If you had sitting in front of you a group of 22-year-olds, 25-year-\nolds, just starting out their work years in the American marketplace, \nand you said to them: For all of you, what is one of the worst \ninvestments you could make, in terms of putting money away until you \nare 65 and then drawing on it? anybody looking at it would have to say \nit is the Social Security system.\n  It is one of the worst investments you could make because you do not \nget anything on your investment. Sooner or later, somebody is going to \ncome into the Presidency--if this President would like to do it, he \nought to change his mind again and come to the party--and say we have \nto make that a better investment. By making a better investment, you \nenhance the value of the trust fund and thus make it more solvent over \ntime.\n  Republicans invented the Social Security lockbox; Democratic Senators \noppose it. Republicans support locking away every penny of the Social \nSecurity surplus--we have made that clear repeatedly to the President. \nIn fact, we came up with the idea of the Social Security lockbox and \nhave tried to pass legislation in the Senate on at least five \noccasions. This lockbox would stop the President and Congress from \nspending any of the Social Security surplus. Unfortunately, Democratic \nSenators have filibustered the lockbox.\n  The President wants to spend Social Security Surpluses. Congress has \nnearly completed action on all 13 appropriations bills, and we will do \nit without touching Social Security. But the President and his staff \nare demanding that we spend more on scores of government programs, \nincluding foreign aid, but they have yet to provide any credible \nproposals as offsets. Republicans and many Democrats have made it clear \nthat we will not raise taxes to support the President's spending \nprograms. If the President persists in demanding new spending without \nspecifying a credible offset, I can only conclude that he wants to tap \nSocial Security for his programs.\n  The President's proposal for Social Security solvency is the \n``Godzilla'' of gimmicks. The President proposes no\n\n[[Page S13132]]\n\nchanges whatsoever in the structure of Social Security, and yet he \nwants the American people to believe he has made ``tough choices'' to \nsave the program. It is simply not credible. In fact, for all the talk \nabout gimmicks, it seems to me that this is the ``Godzilla' of \ngimmicks--a $34 trillion gimmick. The President's plan is nothing more \nthan paper transfers from the general fund of government to Social \nSecurity, amounting to a cumulative $34 trillion in new IOUs in Social \nSecurity between now and 2050. At some point, when Social Security \nneeds those IOUs to pay benefits, a future President and a future \nCongress will have to raise taxes to meet those obligations. So, in \neffect, this proposal is a $34 trillion tax increase on America's \nfuture.\n  There is bipartisan opposition to this gimmick in the Senate, \nincluding Senators Breaux, Kerrey, and Robb, all of whom are on the \nFinance Committee with jurisdiction over Social Security.\n  Let me read some quotes from the experts:\n  David Walker, Comptroller General GAO, in testimony before Senate \nBudget Committee, February 1999:\n\n       [President Clinton's Social Security proposal] does not \n     come close to ``saving Social Security''.\n       Under the President's proposal, the changes to the Social \n     Security program will be more perceived than real: although \n     the trust funds will appear to have more resources as a \n     result of the proposal, nothing about the program has \n     changed.\n\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in Q before Senate Banking \nCommittee, July 1999, when asked if he supported using general revenues \nto shore up Social Security--which is the basis of the President's SS \nIOU scheme--the Chairman said this:\n\n       I would very much prefer that we did not move in the \n     direction of general revenues because in effect, once you do \n     that, then you've opened up the system completely and the \n     issue of what SS taxes are becomes utterly irrelevant. And \n     I'm not terribly certain that serves our budgetary processes \n     in a manner which I think is appropriate.\n\n  Federal Reserve Board Member Edward Gramlich and Chairman of the \n1994-1995 Social Security Advisory Council, in testimony before Senate \nFinance Committee, February 1999:\n\n       During the deliberations of the 1994-1996 Social Security \n     Advisory Commission, we considered whether general revenues \n     should be used to help shore up the Social Security program. \n     This idea was unanimously rejected for a number of reasons . \n     . . there are serious drawbacks to relaxing SS' long-run \n     budget constraint through general revenue transfers.\n\n  The Concord Coalition, in a press release, September 27, 1999:\n\n       . . . we do not agree that [the President's] plan to credit \n     Social Security with new Treasury IOUs representing interest \n     savings from presumed debt reduction does anything to save \n     the program . . . All it does is simply paper over Social \n     Security's looming shortfalls.\n\n  Gene Steuerle, senior fellow, Urban Institute, in testimony before \nSenate Finance Committee, February 1999:\n\n       My own assessment is an additional transfer from the \n     government's left hand (Treasury) to its right hand (Social \n     Security) . . . tends to mask too much. The simple fact is \n     that future taxpayers must cover the cost of the interest and \n     principal on any gift of bonds from Treasury to Social \n     Security.\n\n  The President could have had a legacy if he had shown leadership. The \nPresident spent most of 1998 telling the country he would show true \nleadership on Social Security. If he had proposed real reform, many in \nCongress were ready to work with him. Unfortunately, he chose this non-\nreform, dooming his chances of any real legacy in Social Security.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator entertain a question or two about Social \nSecurity?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Absolutely. Surely.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We are, obviously, all aware Senator Domenici has been \nchairman of the Budget Committee longer than anyone has ever been, or \never will be again, under our new rules. We know he, of all people, \nknows how the budget works.\n  If you wanted to write a proposal and implement it in the future, \nafter its potential impact on anything we are doing now would be zero, \ngiven our budget rules about things that affect taxes and entitlements, \nwhen would you let it go into effect?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You have to tell me.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will tell you. Under our current rules, we budget on \nentitlement and taxes for 10 years; right?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAMM. So that anything we do today that has any effect prior to \n2011 has an impact on our current budget.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAMM. When do you think the President starts this godzilla of \nall phony proposals?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. 2015.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Exactly. Actually, he begins on 2011 and then changes the \nformula on 2015. The first point is that one indication it is phony is \nthat he does not start it until enough time has elapsed that it will \nhave no impact on anything we are doing now.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The reason I did not understand the Senator's question \nis that sometimes we use 5 years. The President came along early this \nyear for the first time in history and used 15 years. Thus, we said 15 \nis too long; let's do 10. But I am not sure where we are going to be on \na permanent basis because we are looking at this to see what makes \nsense. I think what the Senator just said is absolutely right.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me pose another question. I have a memorandum to the \nchief actuary at the Social Security Administration which analyzes the \nPresident's proposal. I will read one part of a paragraph that analyzes \nthe point the Senator from New Mexico outlined, and that is, the \nPresident is saying that in the future, long after it could have any \nimpact on the amount of money we are spending now, we should pay the \nSocial Security Administration for the interest savings we are accruing \nin the budget from using Social Security surpluses to pay down the \ndebt.\n  When the Social Security Administration in their memorandum of \nOctober 23 analyzed that, they concluded the following:\n\n       Calculation of the assets in the combined trust funds on \n     September 30 of the year 2011 through 2015 would treat all \n     amounts transferred as if--\n\n  ``As if''--\n\n     they had been invested in special obligations of the United \n     States. This provision is not likely to have any effect under \n     enactment of this bill alone because the managing trustee of \n     the Social Security trust funds is not authorized to invest \n     any asset of the fund in stock, corporate bonds under either \n     current law or this proposal.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right.\n  Mr. GRAMM. In essence, the Social Security Administration says the \nproposal acts as if there is a transfer that can be invested, but since \nit cannot be invested, what you are doing is simply giving Social \nSecurity more meaningless IOUs, and the net result is no impact on \nanything.\n  When the President said in his State of the Union Address now 3 years \nago, ``Save Social Security first,'' we never heard a program as to how \nwe were going to save it. When he said last year, ``Save it now,'' we \nhad all of these meetings and all of these proposals, and the President \nultimately proposed nothing.\n  Now what we are seeing, sadly, is another gimmick where we do not do \nanything until the year 2011, and then it is simply a meaningless IOU \nwhere the Government owes Social Security but no money is available to \npay for it other than if we raise taxes or cut Social Security benefits \nor cut another program in the future.\n\n  I thank the Senator for yielding. If there has ever been a fraudulent \nproposal, this is it. The tragedy is, the President had an opportunity \nto lead on this. There were Democrats and Republicans willing to follow \nhim, and he did not do it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  I want to take a few minutes and look at this simple chart. We have \nbeen engaged for many years--in this Senator's case, 26 years--in \ntalking about getting the expenditures of our Government down so we do \nnot continue to incur huge deficits that force our children in the \nfuture to pay for our bills. We got to the point where that was \nsomething being spread across this land and everybody understood it. \nThey said: Let's stop spending more than we take in.\n  Have we succeeded? Are we really doing something about how big \nGovernment was growing, and have we taken it by the horns and said we \nare going to do something about it or not?\n  This is a simple bar graph which shows in 1970-1975, the combined \ngrowth in Government for all of the entitlements--military and \ndiscretionary spending--was almost 11 percent. In\n\n[[Page S13133]]\n\n1975-1980, it was up even from that. It grew 12.2 percent. From 1980-\n1985, looking at this chart that has it in detail, all spending grew at \n10 percent. From 1985-1990, all spending grew at 5.8 percent. It kept \ncoming down.\n  Guess what it is for the last 5 years, I say to my friend from \nTennessee. The combined growth of Government--entitlements, domestic \nand military--is now down to an annual spending of 2.8 percent, and \nthat is made up of defense spending at 1 percent growth and nondefense \ndiscretionary at 1.4 percent annually.\n  I know we get into arguments on the floor and those who are worried \nabout spending try to outdo each other as to how much we are going to \nsave and make arguments of every single proposal that comes along in \nterms of cutting more--let's take some out of this program. All of \nthose are good ideas. We are governed by a majority, so eventually \nwhatever ideas you have, you have to get at least 51 votes.\n  Success in terms of getting Government down in size so we can live \nwith it and do not have to incur significant deficits every year has \noccurred most significantly in the last 5 years. I remind everyone, \nthroughout all these other years, we have had either a Republican \nPresident and both Houses Democrat, a Democrat President with both \nHouses Democrat, or a Republican President with one House Republican. \nAnd guess which combination has been most effective in getting spending \ndown. It is when the Congress has Republicans in the House and Senate.\n  For 5\\1/2\\ years, we have had the lowest growth in Government at \nevery level since 1970. It is pretty revealing. I share with anybody \nwho wants to go through it--and we can talk more about how it has \nhappened--but when people think the Congress did not do much, we were \nnot big players in getting us a balanced budget, I submit this is a \npretty big part of it. If those went back up to the levels that were \nhere 15, 20 years ago, we would sure be looking around wondering, are \nwe ever going to stop spending Social Security money to pay for the \nexpenses of our ordinary Government?\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am going to address the Senate on the issue of the \nCaribbean Basin Initiative and the related parts of that package. But I \nappreciated being in the Chamber for these last few minutes to hear \nsome of the discussion on Social Security and budgetary items.\n  I say with regard to Social Security--and I do not sit on a major \ncommittee dealing with the Social Security issue--all I know is, in the \nlast few weeks, the Congressional Budget Office reported that while \nthere may be a lockbox, apparently only one side has the keys to it \nbecause some $18 billion has already been dipped into in order to pay \nfor spending in the present budget.\n  While we have a lockbox, apparently only a handful of people have the \nkeys to be able to dip into it when it becomes necessary to find \nfunding. I hope, as well, we can find common ground solutions to the \nSocial Security issue. As the Senator from Nebraska has pointed out, \nthe long-term interests of all Americans depend upon our ability to \nmake sure we have a trust fund that is sound and in good shape.\n  I also recall a few years ago when there were proposals to amend the \nConstitution of the United States to require a balanced budget. The \nadvocates of that proposal, of course, included that Social Security be \ncalculated in reaching a balanced budget. There were those who argued \nthat you couldn't do that because Social Security ought not to be used \nfor that purpose. But those who were the authors of the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget are some of the same ones today who \nargue on the lockbox. It wasn't a lockbox when we were talking about \nbalancing the budget with a constitutional amendment. It is today. \nNonetheless, I hope we can come up with some answers to this for the \nlong-term.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13133-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13133-S13137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to address the issue of the Caribbean \nBasin Initiative and the African Growth and Opportunity Act which is \npending before the Senate. The package of incentives the Senate is \nconsidering this week includes the African Growth and Opportunity Act, \nthe United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act, and the \nreauthorization of the Generalized System of Preferences and Trade \nAdjustment Assistance. Those are the four pieces of the proposal before \nus.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance dates back to 1962, when we decided \nto provide assistance to men and women in this country who had been \nadversely affected as a result of trade policies and who lost jobs. \nTrade adjustment allows for those individuals and companies that may be \nadversely affected to get some help. It has been a good law for almost \n40 years, and I am confident this piece of the package is one all of \nour colleagues will support.\n  The matter dealing with the Generalized System of Preferences, the \nGSP, is also pretty routine, and one that we need to have enacted. I \nam, again, confident that this provision will also enjoy broad-based \nsupport.\n  The two pieces that are provoking the debate have to deal with the \nenhancement of the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the Africa Growth and \nOpportunity Act.\n  I will spend a couple minutes talking about both of those provisions. \nI support them. I think they are important pieces of legislation that \nare going to accrue to the benefit of our country. I know there are \nthose who are going to argue that somehow this is going to cause great \ndamage to certain workers in the country. I don't believe it to be the \ncase. In fact, I argue that if we were to defeat the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative and the Africa Growth provisions, that they will actually \naccrue to the detriment of workers.\n  These are two important provisions which are going to enhance job \nopportunities in this country and are not going to harm people. I \nnotice the presence of the distinguished Senator from Delaware, \nchairman of the Finance Committee. I commend him and his colleagues on \nthe Finance Committee for dealing as expeditiously as they did with \nthis trade package. This is the only piece of trade legislation I am \naware of that we will deal with in this session of this Congress. I am \nhopeful that a good, strong majority of our colleagues will support \nthese two provisions on the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the Africa \nGrowth and Opportunity Act.\n  First, let me share some factual information so people can put this \nwhole effort into context. Today, the Caribbean countries and the \nCentral American nations comprise about 1.9 percent of all of the \nimports that come into the United States, 1.9 percent total. Of the 48 \ncountries in sub-Saharan Africa that will be affected by this \nlegislation if it is adopted, more than 700 million people who are the \npoorest in the world, live in these 48 countries. These countries make \nup .86 percent of 1 percent of textile and apparel imports to the \nUnited States. So between the 48 countries and more than 700 million \npeople in the sub-Saharan Africa region and the 24 countries that make \nup the Caribbean Basin and the Central American nations, we are talking \nabout something around 2.75 percent of imports that come into the \nUnited States.\n\n  We are talking about millions of people who live in these nations. We \nhave a provision that would allow for the duty-free import of products \nthat come out of these two parts of the world. But it isn't just duty \nfree. It doesn't mean anything they produce automatically comes to this \ncountry. In this provision, there is a very important clause regarding \ntextiles, which is the source of most of the argument, I think. The \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware can correct me if I am wrong, but I \nthink the textile provisions are probably provoking the most debate. In \nthe textile provisions, we say that the fabric and the thread that is \nused to assemble the product in the 48 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa \nand the 24 countries in the Caribbean, that fabric and that thread must \nbe made in the United States. You can then assemble the product in \nthese other countries and it will come into the United States.\n  Why is that important? Today, we have a massive amount of imports \nthat come into this country from the Pacific Rim, Asian countries. \nThere is no\n\n[[Page S13134]]\n\nsuch requirement in those trade agreements, while there are quotas. In \nthe year 2005, the quotas come off entirely. If we don't pass the \nCaribbean Basin Initiative and the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, \nby 2005, we are going to find our markets flooded by products made in \nthe Pacific Rim, where there is no U.S. content requirement.\n  There are some 400,000 jobs in this country that make fabric and make \nthe thread used in the production of these textile products that would \ncome out of Africa and the Caribbean Basin. If we don't pass this \nlegislation, those 400,000 jobs are in jeopardy. That is why this bill \nis important. First and foremost, this bill is important to America. As \nwith any piece of legislation, the first consideration is, does it do \nany good or do no harm, but most especially, does it do any good for \nthe people of the United States of America? I argue this bill is \ncritically important to the well-being of almost a half million workers \nin the United States. Our failure to enact this legislation places \nthose 400,000 jobs in jeopardy.\n  There are other reasons why I think this is important, aside from our \nown interests. We spent $6 billion of U.S. taxpayer money in the 1980s \nin one of these Caribbean Basin countries, El Salvador; $6 billion from \nthe U.S. Treasury went to finance a war basically in the one country of \nEl Salvador. Today, there are some 335,000 Salvadorans living in the \nUnited States. In fact, there are 1 million illegal aliens from the 24 \nCaribbean Basin countries living in the United States. And every day, \nmore come.\n  Why do they come here? Why did my great-grandparents come here? Why \ndo the grandparents of parents of most people, with the exception of \nAfrican Americans, come to America? My great-grandparents left Ireland \nnot because they did not love Ireland any longer. It was because they \nwere discriminated against. They couldn't get work. They weren't \nallowed to be educated. So they were left with no choice but to leave \nthe country they loved to come to America. That is true for millions \nand millions of people in this country.\n  Why do Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, people of the Dominican Republic and \nother nations leave to come here? It is not because they don't love \ntheir own countries, but the opportunities in these nations are almost \nnonexistent in many cases. That is why they come here. Do you want to \nstop that flood from coming? You have to create economic opportunity or \nthat flood is going to continue, as sure as I am standing here.\n  This effort doesn't solve that problem entirely. It would be \nludicrous to suggest it would. But it would start to create economic \nopportunities in these countries that would allow their people to have \nsome future without looking for the next boat or raft or plane in which \nto escape the economic deprivation they see in their own nation and to \nseek what millions have done over the years; that is, to come to this \nland of opportunity. If we are going to stem that tide, we have to \nbegin by creating economic opportunity, or at least assisting in that \nprocess. I think this bill attempts to do that and does begin that \nprocess.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that many of these Caribbean countries \nover the last few years have been devastated by natural disaster.\n  These hurricanes that have swept across these islands and across \nthese countries have left thousands homeless, without any future \nwhatsoever.\n  I recall that only about a year ago at this time, or a little less--\nactually in early November of last year--I flew down to Nicaragua, \nafter the hurricane hit there, with the wife of our Vice President, \nMrs. Gore, Tipper Gore, and a group of Members of Congress. We went \ndown for a weekend to help out with the international relief \norganizations to try to see what we could do as volunteers to provide \nsome assistance.\n  I will never forget, there were six or seven of us inside a one-room \nschoolhouse in Nicaragua, outside of Managua. It took us an entire day \nwith shovels to shovel out the mud in a one-room schoolhouse. That is \nhow thick it was. It took six people almost an entire day to shovel the \nmud out of what had been a one-room schoolhouse a few days earlier.\n  We were looking over a small community that had just been devastated, \nwith tent cities going up. Most of them were made of whatever scrap \npieces of metal and cardboard people could find.\n  So we talk about these neighbors of ours to the immediate south in \nthis hemisphere who have been devastated by these natural disasters and \nevents and our efforts to try to help them get back on their feet. We \ncould write a check, although I suspect we would not come up with $6 \nbillion in aid relief, as we did during the guerrilla conflict in \nCentral America, for one country. We probably could not get that \npassed.\n  What we can do is try to provide some opportunity for jobs to be \ncreated, using U.S. content product, that would put some people to work \nin these countries, which keeps people working in America, and will \nprovide some ray of hope for millions of people in these countries.\n  I commend the chairman of the Finance Committee and those who worked \nwith him. This is a good bill. It is not perfect, and there may be some \namendments that would be offered. My good friend and colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Feingold, has an idea that is a different approach \nto what is included in the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. I like \nwhat he is going to propose. I don't know if he will offer it as an \namendment or not. My concern is that it probably would not pass. It has \na factor of aid written into it, and I don't think there are 51 votes \nfor a massive aid package here, nor does it exist in the House.\n  So while I like what he proposes, I am concerned that would not make \nit, and what we have here, I think, can. I am attracted to what he is \nsuggesting, but I don't necessarily believe that is going to be the \nanswer in terms of how to do it. In the long term, it is creating \neconomic opportunity in these countries that makes the most difference.\n  We now have a balance of payment and trade in the 24 Caribbean \ncountries that is positive. We talk about a mounting trade deficit, and \nit is true; but now if we are going to attack the trade deficit, we are \naiming at the wrong target.\n  To give you an idea where the numbers are, in the last several years, \nthe trade surplus with the 24 Caribbean Basin countries is over $2 \nbillion. In the first 6 months of 1999, the surplus stands at $830 \nmillion for this year alone. That is getting near $3 billion in a trade \nsurplus with these 24 countries.\n  It seems to me, if you want to deal with the trade deficit, maybe you \nought to be aiming your sights on other parts of the world, although I \nam not advocating you do it. But if you do, that is where we ought to \nbe looking. We have a trade surplus, and it is only a small amount of \nimports; 1.9 percent of the total imports come out of these 24 \ncountries. Nonetheless, we have a trade surplus.\n  It seems to me that trying to expand trading opportunities is one of \nthe few bright spots around the globe when it comes to expanding job \nopportunities here by providing new markets where American-produced \nproducts can be sold.\n\n  With regard to these African countries, all of us have seen these \nphotographs. You don't have to go to Africa or necessarily become a \ngreat student of what is going on in the sub-Saharan region. But \nanybody with even a passing awareness of what has happened to these \ncountries over the last number of years has to be moved by it. They \nhave to be moved by what they see.\n  When you see more than 700 million people living under the most \nabject conditions of poverty imaginable in the world, with less than 1 \npercent of textile and apparel imports coming from those 700 million \npeople--I think .86 percent is the number; that is all it is coming \ninto this country. If we can't say to these 700 million people in these \n48 countries, look, take our fabric and our threads, and if you can \nproduce a product to sell into this country, keeping the jobs here at \nhome and enhancing your economic opportunities, then what do we stand \nfor? How else do we really, in the long term, provide assistance to \nthese people?\n  Does anybody really believe we are going to take out a check and \nwrite out an aid program to provide assistance to this many people in \nthose countries? I don't think so. Ironically, only two of the \ncountries in the sub-Saharan region have any kind of trading \nrelationship with us at all. The\n\n[[Page S13135]]\n\nother 46 have virtually no trading relationship. While this bill would \npotentially affect 48 countries, in fact, only 2 of the 48 really have \nany kind of involvement in terms of trading. Again, it is almost \nexclusively in the textile area.\n  Again, I will make the point I tried to make at the outset. This \nbill, first and foremost, is good for this country. In the year 2005, \nthe quotas come off. Again, my colleague from Delaware has forgotten \nmore about this issue than I know. He can correct me if I am wrong. In \nthe year 2005, as I understand it, the quotas on trade from the Pacific \nrim come off. There are no content requirements, as I understand it, \nwith product produced in the Pacific rim.\n  So if we don't provide an offsetting market to the Pacific rim market \nin the Caribbean Basin Initiative in the sub-Saharan region, come the \nyear 2005, the people today who produce the fabric and produce the \nthreads that would be used to produce the products out of the nations \naffected by this bill would have their jobs in jeopardy because that \ncontent requirement is not there on the Pacific rim nations. The quotas \ndo come off, and we could be adversely affected, in my view, by such an \nevent. So it is going to be critically important that we start to build \nup an alternative market that has U.S. content requirements in it.\n  I know some of my colleagues have raised the issue of labor \nstandards. They are legitimate issues to raise. I point out that, to \nthe best of my knowledge, all 24 countries in the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative are signatories to the international labor agreements. They \nare already on the line for supporting those labor standards. There is \na legitimate issue about enforcement of the standards; that is a \nseparate issue.\n  But the fact is, there are labor standards here. The issue is whether \nor not you can enforce them and see to it that people are going to be \nprotected to the extent possible by those labor standards. I hope we \nwill figure out a mechanism to enforce the standards in those laws. The \nlaws do exist to require these countries to meet those labor standards.\n  Again, I commend those who have been involved. I will have more to \nsay on the bill as the debate moves forward.\n  For those who think that somehow this is a giveaway, this is just a \nfavor we are doing for people who live in the island nations of the \nCaribbean or the Central American countries, nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. This bill is good for America. It protects jobs in \nAmerica, expands growth and opportunity for businesses to be able to \nsell into these markets.\n  The best social welfare program is a job. That is the best social \nwelfare program. Nothing does more for a nation, for a family, or for \nan individual than to give them an opportunity to have a job, where \nthey are self-sufficient and providing for their families and \nthemselves. This proposal that increases a trading opportunity with \nthese poor countries in Central America and the Caribbean and in the 48 \nnations of sub-Saharan Africa gives them an opportunity to have a job \nwhich, in the long-term, is what preserves democracy and creates the \nkind of wealth and education necessary for nations to prosper and to \ngrow.\n  Again, with only 1.9 percent of all the imports coming from the \nCaribbean, those 24 countries, and less than 1 percent of textiles and \napparel coming from the 48 nations in the sub-Saharan Africa nations, I \nthink this country of ours and the Senate should support this \ninitiative and say to the nations and the people: We want you to be \npartners with us. We want you to have the chance to provide for your \nown people.\n  We want to do so without costing jobs for hard-working Americans. \nThis bill does both of those things, and for those reasons is richly \ndeserving of the support and votes of Members of the Senate.\n  For those reasons, I urge adoption of this bill when the appropriate \ntime comes to vote aye.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I understand that I am entitled to up to \n1 hour under the rules at this point, or at any point during the debate \non the motion to proceed. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during debate of H.R. 434 \nthe following members of my staff have access to the floor: Mary \nMurphy, Tom Walls, Mary Ann Richmond, Linda Rotblatt, Sumner Slichter, \nand Michelle Gavin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act and the Africa trade debate.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act's supporters believe that this \nlegislation is a landmark--that it represents a real opportunity for \ngrowth on the continent, a new way of thinking about Africa.\n  And they want us to believe, as they believe, that to reject it, or \ntry to improve it, would be to reject all engagement with the continent \nand indeed to reject all of the African people's enterprise and energy.\n  On that they are wrong. This bill is deeply flawed, and must be \nchanged in a number of fundamental ways or, quite frankly, if we can't \ndo that, I think it should be defeated.\n  For 7 years I have served on the Subcommittee on Africa and I have \ncommitted myself to supporting democratization, peace, and development \nin the many varied countries of that continent. I support engagement \nwith Africa as strongly as any Member of this body.\n  I am deeply concerned about the dearth of economic ties between the \npeople of the United States and those of the African continent. The \ncurrent level of trade between us is depressingly small. Africa \nrepresents only 1 percent of our imports, 1 percent of our exports, and \n1 percent of our foreign direct investment.\n  Should something to done to stimulate our trade with Africa? \nAbsolutely.\n  But I urge this body--let's not pretend that we are now debating a \ncomprehensive trade package for Africa, for this bill is not in the \nleast comprehensive. Let's not fail to address the need to build an \nenvironment that will foster and sustain mutually beneficial economic \nrelationships. If we fail to assemble the components of that \nenvironment in this trade package, it cannot be called comprehensive, \nand I don't think it should even be passed.\n  There really are only two defensible views of this bill. It either \ndoes virtually nothing at all or, worse, it actually does harm.\n  This legislation actually does very little for Africa. The trade \nbenefits we are talking about are not terribly significant. The African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act makes African states eligible for temporary \npreferential access to the U.S. market for textiles and apparel only.\n\n  Many of Africa's primary exports are not addressed at all by this \nlegislation.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity is silent on the subject of \ncorruption. But surely corruption ranks right beside instability as one \nof the primary disincentives for American companies to get involved in \nAfrica.\n  In fact, of the 17 sub-Saharan African states rated in Transparency \nInternational's 1998 Corruption Perception Index, 13 ranked in the \nbottom half. Shouldn't a major piece of U.S.-Africa trade legislation \nat least mention this issue? Shouldn't it at least take a stab at \naddressing the corruption that impedes healthy commercial \nrelationships?\n  Mr. President, this legislation does nothing at all to address the \nAfrican context for economic growth. That context is a challenging \none--it is a context of boundless potential amid a web of obstacles.\n  Economic growth in Africa faces the obstacle of a devastating HIV/\nAIDS epidemic. In the course of 1998, AIDS was responsible for an \nestimated 2 million African deaths. That's 5,500 deaths a day.\n  Eighty-seven percent of the world's HIV-positive children live in \nAfrica. Their lives are that continent's future. Their chronic illness \nand their deaths each day erode a little more of Africa's promise. It \nis difficult to see how the United States can enjoy mutually beneficial \ntrade relations with Africa unless we commit ourselves to addressing\n\n[[Page S13136]]\n\nHIV/AIDS crisis on a scale beyond anything we have done before.\n  Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa faces the obstacle of a \nstaggering $230 billion in bilateral and multilateral debt. Africa's \ndebt service requirements now take over 20 percent of the region's \nexport earnings. How can Africa become a strong economic partner when \nits states must divert funds away from schools, away from health care, \nand away from infrastructure in order to service their debt burden?\n  How can we talk about economic engagement and simply ignore these \npainfully obvious realities?\n  Mr. President, in several ways, I believe that this legislation \nactually would do harm.\n  By seriously addressing only the textile industry, it would \ndiscourage the kind of diversification that African economies need to \ngain strength and stability.\n  AGOA also fails to adequately tackle the problem of transshipment. \nTransshipment is a practice whereby producers in China and other third \nparty countries establish sham production facilities in countries which \nmay export to the United States under more favorable conditions. Then \nthese producers ship goods made in their factories at home and meant \nfor the U.S. market to the third country, in this case an African \ncountry, pack it or assemble it in some minor way, and send it along to \nthe United States marked ``Made in Africa,'' enjoying all of the trade \nbenefits that label would bring.\n  As my colleagues know, transshipment is a very serious problem. \nApproximately $2 billion worth of illegally transshipped textiles enter \nthe United States every year.\n  The U.S. Customs Service has determined that for every $1 billion of \nillegally transshipped products that enter the United States, 40,000 \njobs in the textile and apparel sector are lost.\n  I'd like to share some words from the Peoples Republic of China with \nmy colleagues.\n  It is a pretty startling example of what can happen.\n  This is a quote taken from the official website of the Chinese \nMinistry of Trade and Economic Cooperation. It says, and this is a \ndirect quote:\n\n       There are many opportunities for Chinese business people in \n     Africa. . . . Setting up assembly plants with Chinese \n     equipment, technology and personnel could not only greatly \n     increase sales in African countries, but also circumvent the \n     quotas imposed on commodities of Chinese origin imposed by \n     European and American countries.\n\n   Mr. President, it's not hard to see that those who would engage in \ntransshipment aren't too worried about the protections we currently \nhave in place to guard against it.\n  If nothing else raises a red flag for my colleagues when they \nconsider the African Growth and Opportunity Act, this should be a \ncrystal clear signal. Whatever opportunities this legislation creates \nby and large will not be opportunities for Africans.\n  In fact, the African Growth and Opportunity Act does not require that \nAfricans themselves be employed at the firms receiving trade benefits.\n  While it is utterly silent on African employment, AGOA actually takes \na step backwards for Africa with regard to content. The GSP program \nrequires that 35 percent of a product's value-added content come from \nAfrica. This legislation lowers that bar to 20 percent. This is \nprogress?\n   Mr. President, AGOA also contains weak provisions for ensuring \nworkers' rights. It relies on GSP provisions to protect African labor. \nBut some countries--like Equatorial Guinea--have GSP today, and still \ndo not allow the establishment of independent free trade unions.\n  AGOA could lead to exploitation in the name of increased trade. AGOA \ndoes not mention environmental standards at all. Any plan for \nsustainable economic development must include some notion of \nenvironmental protection. This is particularly true of a continent like \nAfrica, where in some countries 85 percent of the population lives \ndirectly off the land.\n  We are all affected when logging and mining deplete African \nrainforests and increase global warming; we all lose when species \nunique to Africa are lost to hasty profitmaking schemes, hatched \nwithout regard to sustainability or long-term environmental effects.\n  Environmental quality also has serious implications for peace and \nstability in the region. As we have seen in the Niger Delta, \nenvironmental degradation can lead to civil unrest.\n  Responsible trade policies must adequately address human rights and \nenvironmental issues--not just because it is the right thing to do, but \nalso because, in the long run, it will create a better business climate \nfor Africans and Americans alike.\n  In addition, the failure of the African Growth and Opportunity Act to \nmention the critical role that development assistance plays in \npromoting African growth and opportunities has raised alarm here at \nhome and internationally. The perception is that the United States has \ndeluded itself into believing that a small package of trade benefits--\nbenefits which may not actually affect Africans themselves--can replace \na responsible and well-monitored program of development assistance. \nThis inevitably must cast doubt on the United States commitment to \ndevelopment in Africa.\n  I care deeply about Africa and about United States policy towards \nAfrica, and my colleagues know that. But I am here today not just \nbecause of my own concerns, but because of others--because I know how \ndeeply they care about Africa, and I have heard them voice their very \nserious concerns about AGOA.\n  African-American leaders ranging from Cornel West to Randall Robinson \noppose the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, a group of African-American ministers representing \ncommunities from Massachusetts and Mississippi, California and New \nJersey, Virginia and Illinois came to Capitol Hill to express their \nopposition to the African Growth and Opportunity Act. I will read \nbriefly remarks of Rev. Alexander Hurt of the Hurt Inner-City \nMinistries, Church of God and Christ on the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act:\n\n       I have never fully felt like an American until the day that \n     I watched my President land in the land of my fathers. It was \n     like introducing two old friends to each other. That the AGOA \n     is in any way associated with that trip is the saddest part \n     of this debate. There are millions of African-Americans who, \n     like me, connect the President's trip to Africa with a start \n     of a new kind of relationship between not only Africa and \n     America, but Africa and the West. AGOA closes that \n     possibility. For it represents not a new future, but a return \n     to the past.\n       America in a period of abundance that is unknown in human \n     history, can not be moved to reach out to Africa to help \n     starving nations. In the end we must decide if we will have a \n     foreign policy that reaches out with a hand toward nations as \n     equals, or with a hammer and pound them into subjection.\n       Few things have changed with America's position toward \n     Africa. What was once done with the canon and the gun is now \n     being done with medicine and debt.\n\n  I have heard African voices raise the alarm about AGOA as well as \nAmerican ones. The Congress of South African Trade Unions has issued a \nstatement opposing the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n  A statement issued by 35 African NGO's--including Angola's \nJournalists for the Environment and Development, Kenya's African \nAcademy of Sciences, South Africa's International People's Health \nCouncil, and Zambia's Foundation for Economic Progress--strongly \nopposed AGOA.\n  Women's groups have spoken out as well. Women in Law Development in \nAfrica, a coalition of African women and women's advocacy groups, \nopposes the African Growth and Opportunity Act, as does Women's EDGE, a \ncoalition of international development organizations and domestic \nwomen's groups.\n\n  The Africa-America Institute organized focus group discussions in \neight African countries and the United States to foster discussion of \nproposed United States-Africa trade legislation. They found that AGOA \nwill not contribute to African development unless the United States and \nother donor countries also increase investments in African human \nresource development and take measures to relieve Africa's debt burden.\n  I know others have voiced support for AGOA, and I don't question \ntheir motives. Some of those supporters believe that this is the only \ngame in town, and that a deeply flawed Africa trade bill is better than \nno bill at all. I think they are wrong. This Senate has a \nresponsibility either to make this bill better, or to refuse to let it \nbecome law.\n\n[[Page S13137]]\n\n  I want to take a positive approach and make this bill better. \nTherefore, I have proposed alternative legislation, S. 1636, the HOPE \nfor Africa Act. It was based largely on the efforts of my colleague \nfrom the House, Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr., and I am grateful to \nhim for his leadership on this issue.\n  The provisions of the HOPE bill point the way toward a truly \ncomprehensive and a more responsible United States-Africa trade policy. \nI intend to use elements of HOPE to try to amend and improve AGOA.\n   Mr. President, I want to amend AGOA to make goods listed under the \nLome Convention eligible for duty-free access to the United States, \nprovided those goods are not determined to be import-sensitive by the \nPresident. These provisions would mean more trade opportunities for \nmore African people.\n  At the same time, AGOA must be changed to reflect the importance of \nlabor rights, human rights, and environmental standards. My proposals \nwill clearly spell out the labor rights that our trade partners must \nenforce in order to receive benefits. They will also contain a \nmonitoring procedure that involves the International Federation of \nTrade Unions, so that violations will not be glossed over at the \nexpense of African workers.\n  I will propose stronger human rights language, and incentives for \nforeign companies operating in Africa to bring their environmental \npractices there up to the standards that they adhere to at home.\n  I will propose tough transshipment protections that give American \nentities a stake in the legality of the products they import. I want to \nbe sure that Africans and Americans really do benefit from our United \nStates-Africa trade policy.\n  In that same vein, I will propose that trade benefits be contingent \nupon African content and the employment of African workers.\n  I will propose that the United States reassert its commitment to \nresponsible, well-monitored development assistance for Africa.\n  I would be irresponsible if I did not propose changes to AGOA that \nwill address the factors crippling Africa's economic potential today--\ndebt, HIV/AIDS, and corruption.\n  I will urge this Senate to include anticorruption provisions that I \nwill offer as an amendment to the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n  I will propose that we address debt relief in this legislation so \nthat, at the very least, we can put ourselves on the path toward taking \nwell-thoughtout and responsible action.\n  For all its wealth of natural resources, Africa's people are its most \nvaluable resource. I will support measures to prioritize HIV/AIDS \nprevention and treatment in AGOA. In addition, I want to address the \nissue of Africa's intellectual property laws, to ensure that United \nStates taxpayer dollars are not spent to undermine the legal efforts of \nsome African countries to gain and retain access to low-cost \npharmaceuticals.\n   Mr. President, if all of this sounds ambitious, it is. Any plan to \nseriously engage economically with Africa must be ambitious. My bill \nand the amendments I will offer to AGOA are the minimum we must do to \nknock down the obstacles to a healthy, thriving, and just commercial \nrelationship between the countries of Africa and the United States. The \nbill before us falls short of the minimum meaningful effort. The \nrhetoric that surrounds the African Growth and Opportunity Act is \ncertainly ambitious. It is the content that is insufficient.\n  We must demand more of a United States-Africa trade bill than AGOA \nhas to offer. Ambitious plans can lead to rich rewards for both America \nand Africa. Anything less promises failure, despair, and decades more \nof lost opportunity.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13137-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13137-S13139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF SENATOR JOHN CHAFEE\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it is with great sadness I rise to mourn \nthe passing of Senator John Chafee. Senator Chafee was much more than a \ncolleague to me. Senator Chafee was a very close friend as well. The \nSenate has lost a giant, and I assuredly have lost a friend.\n  John Chafee will go down in history as one of the best U.S. Senators \nto ever grace this Chamber. Senator Chafee was one of those rare people \nwho was able to rise above partisanship and work constructively with \nothers on both sides of the aisle to achieve important things for the \nAmerican people.\n  John Chafee always had a smile, he always had a feeling of the \npossible, and even in the darkest times when it seemed as if there was \nno way to bring people together in this Chamber, John Chafee had the \nconfidence that if we just reached out, if we were rational and \nreasonable and talked to each other, we could accomplish great things. \nThat was the spirit of John Chafee, and it will be in this Chamber long \nafter he has left us.\n  I look at his desk now and I see the bouquet of flowers there. What a \nfitting tribute to John Chafee because he graced any room he entered. \nThat is the way I remember John. When I learned yesterday that he had \ndied, I was thinking of my last encounter with John, which was on the \nfloor last Thursday. I was exiting the Chamber with a group of \nSenators. I walked past him and he said: Hey, don't you talk to me \nanymore? Because I hadn't exchanged our usual greeting.\n  I came back and I reached out to him. We shook hands, had a brief \nconversation, and I told him: John, you know I'll always talk to you. \nWe had a little conversation about what was occurring in the Senate and \nwhat might be done to improve things. That was John Chafee. That was \nquintessential John Chafee. How are we going to make things better?\n  He never spent a lot of time ruminating and worrying. Instead, he \nspent time figuring out how we were going to make things better. That \nis what I so admired about John Chafee, that and his basic human \ndecency. You could not find a more decent person to work with in this \nSenate or in any other forum than John Chafee. I admired him so much \nbecause he really gave a life of dedication to public service.\n  John Chafee, we all know, was very fortunate. He grew up in a family \nof means. He did not have to spend his life in public service. He could \nhave been on ``easy street.'' But that is not the way John Chafee chose \nto lead his life. Instead, John determined he would take on one public \nchallenge after another, whether it was serving in the Marine Corps, of \nwhich he was very proud, or whether it was serving his State as \nGovernor, or serving as Secretary of the Navy, or serving here in the \nSenate. John Chafee had a life dedicated to public service. His State \nof Rhode Island and our country are the richer for it.\n  I served on the Finance Committee with John. It was the only \ncommittee assignment we shared. But I soon became a partner and ally of \nJohn Chafee's on the Senate Finance Committee because we thought about \nissues in much the same way. John Chafee was somebody who believed \ndeeply in fiscal responsibility. He felt very strongly that was \nsomething we should pursue. But at the same time, he had a progressive \nagenda. He was really the leading advocate for the mentally ill, the \ndisabled, and the retarded. As the Finance Committee considered changes \nto Medicare and Medicaid, I was honored to work closely with John to \nmake sure that changes did not negatively impact those groups.\n\n  Together, I remember well, we sponsored an amendment to ensure that \ndisabled children would not be removed from the Supplemental Security \nIncome Program. As a result of John's leadership, more than 100,000 \ndisabled children were able to maintain critical benefits to help their \nfamilies afford the costs associated with their disability. That was \nJohn Chafee. He cared about other people--and really cared, not that \nsuperficial ``just talk the talk.'' John Chafee cared enough to take \nrisks and to make a difference in people's lives.\n\n[[Page S13138]]\n\n  We all know John was also a strong advocate of health care. In many \nways, he became the leader on the Finance Committee on issues of health \ncare and especially health care as it related to low-income Americans. \nHe wanted to make certain people had a chance, an opportunity. Oh, yes, \nJohn believed in personal responsibility; there was no question of that \nwith John Chafee. But he also believed there were people who were less \nfortunate in life who also deserved a hand up--not a handout but a hand \nup. That, too, was John Chafee.\n  I especially remember back in the early 1990s when we had a series of \nvery thorny health care issues to work out. A group was formed on the \nSenate Finance Committee, the Centrist Coalition. That group worked \nunder the leadership of John Chafee and John Breaux on a series of \nbudget questions. That group was preceded by what we called the \nMainstream Coalition, a group of Senators, Democrats and Republicans, \nwho worked together to try to rescue health care reform when it looked \nas if it was going down the tubes.\n  In fact, the Senate Finance Committee recessed and gave the \nMainstream Coalition a chance to try to bring together the diverse \ninterests in this Chamber so we could have a chance for health care \nreform to work. I remember spending hundreds of hours with John Chafee \nand that group down in John's hideaway working on health care reform--\nhour after hour after hour. John did not want to give up. Even when it \nseemed as if there was absolutely no hope, John Chafee urged us to \ncontinue to work together, to talk together, and to try to come up with \na plan that would make a difference in the lives of the American \npeople. That was John Chafee.\n  Later, with the Centrist Coalition, we focused on the budget. I \nremember the day we brought a budget resolution to the floor that the \nCentrist Coalition had put together. It was a very close vote. There \nwere 20 of us in the Centrist Coalition: 10 Democrats, 10 Republicans. \nWe met during the Government shutdown. We met throughout the spring. \nEven those of us on the Budget Committee separately debated the budget \nresolution. But when we entered S-201 of the Capitol, Senator Chafee's \nhideaway, we left all partisanship at the door. That was the rule. We \ndebated numbers and entitlements and discretionary spending. We \nconsidered alternatives and options. We voted and we made decisions. We \nput together a budget package that received 46 bipartisan votes in the \nSenate despite the opposition of the leaders on both sides. We had the \nleader of the Democrats and the leader of the Republicans both in \nopposition to our plan, but we got 46 votes.\n  I think it shocked many people--24 Democrats and 22 Republicans. I \nremember John's reaction. He was proud. He was proud we had come \nforward with a plan that commanded that kind of support on the floor of \nthe Senate, even in the face of leadership opposition.\n  Do you know what. I believe that plan helped form the basis for what \ncame later. I believe that plan helped demonstrate to the leaders there \nreally was support for balancing this budget, for getting our fiscal \nhouse in order and for making a difference. John Chafee was a leader in \nthat effort, and he was proud of it. He deserved to be proud of it \nbecause he was making a difference.\n  The vote on the Centrist Coalition budget and the effort that went \ninto putting it together was public policy at its best. It could not \nhave happened and would not have happened had it not been for Senator \nChafee. He demonstrated extraordinary patience, always moving forward, \nalways keeping the debate focused until consensus could be reached.\n  I remember so well, John, your admonition to us: Steady as she goes. \nThat was one of John's favorite sayings: Steady as she goes. His \nstrong, steady leadership allowed the centrist coalition to be \nsuccessful.\n  That is how I will remember Senator Chafee, and that is just one of \nthe reasons we will miss him so terribly in the Senate.\n  I say to our dear friend, John Chafee, this afternoon as he said so \nmany times to us: Steady as she goes, John, steady as she goes. We will \nmiss you very, very much.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to this Chamber concerning the \ntragic news we received yesterday morning that our friend and \ncolleague, John Chafee, passed away on Sunday.\n  John Chafee was a leader who moved the Senate to do great things. He \nembraced the bipartisanship we are so quick to reject in this Chamber, \nand he did so with a dignity and integrity that made us proud to serve \nwith him in this body and to call him a colleague and to call him a \nfriend.\n  John constantly worked to bring his colleagues together and to bring \nhis keen intellect and spirit of fairness to bear in an effort to move \nlegislation forward. Whether he was working on health care, the \nenvironment, constitutional issues, or Government reform, he approached \nevery issue on its merits and found ways to overcome partisanship to \nwork together.\n  In an atmosphere which asks us to take sides and defend our ground, \nJohn Chafee instead sought common ground, and he sought it with an \nuncommon commitment to what was best for our Nation. And always, as he \nworked to foster bipartisanship and civility, he held fast to the \nprinciples that guided him: a deep commitment to fiscal responsibility \nand a dedication to protecting our children, preserving our \nenvironment, and striving for better health care for every American.\n  I had the honor and pleasure of working with Senator Chafee on a \nnumber of issues that affected my State of Wisconsin and the entire \nNation. As a distinguished veteran and one of the Senate's greatest \npatriots, Senator Chafee had the courage and the commitment to \nconstitutional freedom to be a vocal opponent of a constitutional \namendment on flag desecration.\n  When he spoke against the amendment before the Judiciary Committee in \nApril, he criticized the measure as the first amendment to the \nConstitution that would limit, not expand, our freedoms in that great \ndocument. But most of all, this great patriot was deeply troubled by \nstate-mandated patriotism. John Chafee said:\n\n       We cannot mandate respect and pride in the flag. In fact, \n     in my view, taking steps to require citizens to respect the \n     flag sullies its significance and symbolism.\n\n  With this issue and so many others, it was Senator Chafee's \nthoughtful and fair-minded approach that commanded my utmost respect \nand admiration.\n  His work in the area of conservation was legendary. He won huge gains \nin the fight to protect the environment, including perhaps his greatest \nachievement, his vital improvements to the Clean Air Act during its \nreauthorization in 1990.\n  Senator Chafee also was a dedicated advocate for the reauthorization \nof the Superfund Program and the Endangered Species Act, and though his \nattempts at reauthorizing these programs were unsuccessful in recent \nCongresses, in characteristic fashion he managed to carve out \nsignificant common ground between the parties on both issues.\n  John's efforts on these issues were a great service to the Nation, as \nwas his support for another issue recently before this body--campaign \nfinance reform. While John and I did not always see eye to eye about \neach aspect of campaign finance reform, he characteristically found \ncommon ground on which we could agree and lent his invaluable \ncredibility to our efforts.\n  I was also fortunate enough to work with Senator Chafee in the area \nof health care reform where he displayed an unparalleled commitment to \nimproving access and quality of health care for those most in need. His \nability to rise above partisanship enabled him to do the real work of \nthe people, working in bipartisan coalitions to address problems in the \nmanaged care system and doing the vitally important work of examining \nhealth promotion, disease prevention, and improving health care \nquality.\n  Most recently, I had the pleasure of working with Senator Chafee to \ndraft\n\n[[Page S13139]]\n\nlegislation to refine portions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that \nhave adversely affected home health care agencies.\n  In everything he did, John Chafee brought a quiet dignity to his work \nand to the work of this body. We all benefited from the spirit of \ncivility and bipartisanship he fostered during his 23 years in the \nSenate. I hope we can cherish and nurture that spirit in the years to \ncome.\n  I extend my deepest condolences to John's family, his wife Ginny, his \n5 children, and 12 grandchildren. John Chafee was a hero in battle, a \ndistinguished Secretary of the Navy, a great leader as Governor of \nRhode Island, and a towering figure in the Senate for more than two \ndecades. His life was an inspiration to all those who believed public \nservice can, indeed, be an honorable profession. All of us who had the \nopportunity to work with him will cherish his memory and do our best to \nhonor his legacy to the Nation.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues, many who are \nhonoring John Chafee today. He was a proud New Englander and a person, \nin my opinion, who embodied the spirit of service which characterizes \nso many of his contemporaries and those who came before him, not only \nfrom his State but across the Nation, especially from New England.\n  He came out of a culture which always put public service first. To \nhim, public service was the purpose of being an elected official. He \nhad no other cause or commitment other than doing well by the people he \nrepresented and by his Nation.\n  There is a lot of identity I have shared with John Chafee, more in \nthe sense of a father figure than as a comrade or a contemporary, \nduring my years growing up. He went to Yale at about the same time my \nfather went to Yale. Then he went to Harvard Law School about the same \ntime my father went to Harvard Law School. He was elected Governor not \ntoo long after my father was elected Governor. So there was a parallel \ncareer path.\n  In my household in New Hampshire, the name John Chafee, although it \ncame from the distant State of Rhode Island, echoed with great respect. \nIt was a name that had attached to it an understanding that there was a \nleader who was committed to his Nation and who understood that to be a \ngood leader, you had to be concerned for others first. He was a person \nwho set a standard for all of us.\n  When I arrived at the Senate and I met Senator Chafee as a \ncontemporary, so to speak, I had great anticipation because he was \nliterally a very large figure for me as I grew up and a large figure \nwithin the New England community. I would not have been surprised had \nhe been a person who just sort of smiled at a new Senator and said: \nNice to have you here; we'll see you in a couple years when you get \nyour feet on the ground.\n  No, that wasn't John Chafee's style. He reached out to me, as he \nreached out to so many Senators who had served with him, both new and \nthose who served with him for a considerable period of time. He said: \nJoin me; I have some ideas. Sit down with me and listen to them. I \nwould like to hear your ideas.\n  He brought me into this council he had begun, the centrist group, and \ntreated me as someone whose thoughts and concerns were equal to his and \nwere of legitimate importance and significance. I greatly appreciated \nthat, coming from someone with his senior status and great knowledge on \nissues such as health care. It was really an experience in how one \nbuilds consensus to deal with John Chafee at any time but especially \nduring the first few years I served in this body. My respect for him \nonly grew as I had the opportunity to serve with him over the years.\n  There was no issue he undertook that he did not undertake as a person \ncommitted to identifying and obtaining a thoughtful and substantive \nresponse to that issue. I never experienced at any time his addressing \nan issue in a partisan way or in a political way in the negative sense \nbut always in a constructive way and in a manner in which he was \nlooking towards resolution. He would take the most complex issues that \nthis body had to address, issues such as Medicare, the general health \ncare system, environmental laws, issues which created great fervor and \nintensity on both sides of the aisle. He would sit down and, through \nthe force of his personality, which was one of generosity and \nintelligence, of sincerity and of commitment, sift through the issue \nand work with the parties and, more often than not, be able to reach a \nconsensus position--an extraordinarily impressive individual.\n  His greatest strength, I think, was that he was just plain Yankee. He \nhad a way about him that is personified by the Yankee mystique. It can \nbe defined as being honest and committed, patriotic--of course, a lot \nof other people fall in that category, too--but there was also that \nwillingness to be precise, curt, some may say, the willingness to cut \nthrough the large ferocity of this body to the essence of an issue \nquickly, and the understanding always that our purpose is to serve. His \npurpose above all was to serve the people of Rhode Island and the \npeople of this Nation.\n  As with everyone else in this body, my heart goes out to Ginny and \nhis family. We wish them, during this time of difficulty, Godspeed, and \nwe are thankful for the time which we had with John as he showed us how \nto be a good citizen, a good legislator and, most importantly, a good \nAmerican.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, twice I have spoken about John Chafee. He \nwas one of the very special people. We just can't stop thinking about \nhim or talking about him. I will not take a great length of time except \nto say that as I was listening to my colleague from New Hampshire and \nother colleagues, it really struck me that he was the quintessential, \nalmost perfect public servant.\n  I believe service is the most noble human profession--service to \nfamily, service to church, service to community, service to friends, \npublic service. There is no more noble pursuit than service. John \nChafee epitomized public service.\n  I wish Americans could have known John Chafee and could have watched \nhim and been with him during the day. If American schoolchildren were \nto have been with John Chafee, watched John Chafee, I know one thing, \nmost everybody would have wanted to be a Senator. Most everybody would \nhave wanted to emulate John Chafee; he was so good. He taught by \nexample. Somewhat by words, somewhat by telling students what to do, \nbut much more by example.\n  We are all almost in awe of John Chafee because of his example, what \nhe did. He didn't make a big thing about it. He didn't brag about \nhimself. He didn't try to take credit for anything. He just acted \naccording to what he thought was in the country's best interest and in \nRhode Island's best interest. It was just by accident that I learned \nonly a couple years ago that he was a highly decorated Korean war hero. \nThere are Senators on this floor sometimes who like to brag about their \nexploits in the armed services or at least allude to them and hope that \nsomebody asks them more questions about it, pursue it a little more. \nNot John Chafee.\n  If John Chafee's staff would write a statement or a speech on his \nbehalf and allude to his service in Korea or Guadalcanal as a veteran, \nhe would strike it. He didn't want to brag about anything. He didn't \nwant to brag about all the awards he had been given. He was that kind \nof guy. To me, they don't get any better. There aren't many cut from \nthat bolt of cloth these days.\n  I wish more people could have seen and watched John as a person, as \nhe was, and a Senator.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments of my \ntime under the bill to talk about a subject I am very hopeful we will \nbe able to address in the very near future. It is a subject matter that \nhas been outstanding during the course of this year and that we have \nstill failed to act on, and that is to try to see an increase in the \nminimum wage for many of the workers in this country.\n  We have seen in more recent times the Congress move ahead to increase \nits own salary some $4,600 a year. When we increase the minimum wage, \nit will mean approximately $2,000 to those who are working the hardest \nat the lower end of the economic ladder but who perform extraordinarily \nimportant jobs that are really, in many respects, at the heart of the \nengine of the American economy today.\n  I think all of us are mindful that we have had the most extraordinary \neconomic boom in the history of our country. But there are those \nAmericans who have been left out and left behind. There is no group of \nAmericans who have been more disadvantaged than those who are working \nat the minimum wage level. That is why I was very hopeful we would see \nfit to address this issue this year because we find that those minimum \nwage workers are falling further and further behind.\n  I want to remind our colleagues about what has happened on the issue \nof job growth because the most familiar argument we have in opposition \nto the minimum wage is that it will somehow dampen the increase in jobs \nand, secondly, it will add to the rate of inflation.\n  Let's look at what has happened in the most recent times. This chart \ngoes from 1995 up through 1999 and it indicates when the Senate and the \nCongress actually increased the minimum wage. We increased the minimum \nwage to $4.75 in 1996, and still we saw job growth continue through \n1996 and 1997. We increased the minimum wage then in 1997 up to $5.15. \nThis was a two-step increase of 50 cents and 40 cents, up to what is \nnow $5.15.\n  There were those who warned the Senate of the United States that if \nwe saw this kind of increase, we would lose anywhere from 200,000 to \n400,000 or 500,000 jobs in the job market. But what we have seen is a \ncontinuation of the expansion of the job market, where we find it going \nup and up until September of 1999. Past increases in the minimum wage \nhave not meant the loss of jobs.\n  Secondly, if we look at this chart, this is the employment rate. \nAnother way of looking at the issue of jobs is the employment in our \ncountry with the increase in the minimum wage. The unemployment rate is \nat historic lows after a minimum wage increase. On the two steps here, \nif we look, we find that we went from almost 5.5 percent unemployment, \nand then in September of 1997 we were just below 5 percent. Since that \ntime, it has continued to decline. So we have seen an expansion of the \ngrowth rate and a decline in overall unemployment in this country.\n  Well, you could say there must have been some impact in terms of the \nrate of inflation. But what we have seen, and as we know, is if you \nhave an increase in productivity and the rise in productivity exceeds \nthe increase in the payment, you don't get the rates of inflation. That \nis what we have seen.\n  According to labor statistics, we have seen what is represented by \nthis blue line on the chart--an increase in productivity for American \nworkers over the period from 1957 to 1959, up to 1998. This is the \nannual productivity increase. We have seen a significant increase in \nthe productivity.\n  If we look at what has been the impact of the real minimum wage, the \nkind of decline here, now the spread between productivity and the \npurchasing power of the minimum wage is at one of its greatest since \nthe enactment of the increase in the minimum wage. Productivity is up, \nand we should see an increase in terms of the wages for those workers.\n  If we look at what has happened in terms of the real value of the \nminimum wage, we see that in 1968 it would be worth $7.49. If we had \nthe minimum wage today in purchasing power of what it was in 1968, it \nwould be $7.49. This is what has happened in terms of real dollars.\n  We are now at this level of $5.15 an hour. Without this increase, it \nwill drop down to $4.80, almost back to where it was at the time we saw \nthe very modest increase 4 years ago. Even with the increase, it would \nput the real value at $5.73. With two 50-cent increases over the next 2 \nyours, the purchasing power would still be only $5.73. We are always \nplaying catchup with the millions of American workers who receive the \nminimum wage.\n  We are delighted to debate these issues with those who continue to \ngive the old, worn-out, tired arguments in opposition: that raising the \nminimum wage will mean loss of jobs and that it is going to add to \ninflation. We are glad to debate those issues. But we are being denied \nby the Republican leadership the ability to consider an increase in the \nminimum wage.\n  This is a Business Week editorial, May 17, 1999. It is not a Democrat \njournal. It is not a voice for the Democratic Party. Of course, years \nago when we had the increases in the minimum wage, we had \nbipartisanship. It has been only in recent times when it has become a \npartisan issue.\n  As Business Week points out,\n\n       Old myths die hard. Old economic theories die even harder . \n     . . higher minimum wages are supposed to lead to fewer jobs. \n     Not today. In a fast-growth, low-inflation economy, higher \n     minimum wages raise income, not unemployment.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full article with regard to the \nminimum wage be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Business Week, May 17, 1999]\n\n                      The Myth of the Minimum Wage\n\n       Old myths die hard. Old economic theories die even harder. \n     Remember the one about inflation rising as unemployment \n     falls? How about productivity dropping as the business cycle \n     ages? Or the U.S. is a mature economy doomed to slow growth? \n     One old favorite is that higher taxes inevitably lead to \n     recession. These days, none of these theories appears to \n     work. A new economy driven by high technology and \n     globalization seems to be changing old economic \n     relationships. But one economic shibboleth still remains \n     popular: the bane of minimum wages.\n       Congress is debating whether to raise the minimum wage from \n     $5.15 to $6.15. Opponents of the bill cite reams of economic \n     research showing that minimum-wage hikes curtail demand for \n     cheap labor. Like the trade-off between employment and \n     inflation once said to be inherent in the Phillips curve, \n     higher minimum wages are supposed to lead to fewer jobs. Not \n     today. In a fast-growth, low-inflation economy, higher \n     minimum wages raise income, not unemployment.\n       For proof, look no further than the minimum-wage hike of \n     1996-97. The two-stage hike of 90 cents raised the wages of \n     nearly 10 million employees. Nearly three-quarters of these \n     were adults, and half the people worked full-time. In 1996, \n     the unemployment rate was 5.4%. Today, it is 4.2% (page 42).\n       The economy is evolving at a tremendous clip--shedding its \n     old skin before our eyes. In this ever-changing environment, \n     the best policy aims at increasing flexibility and options. \n     Keep markets free, promote growth and entrepreneurship, and \n     open the doors to opportunity for all participants. A higher \n     minimum wage can be an engine for upward mobility. When \n     employees become more valuable, employers tend to boost \n     training and install equipment to make them more productive. \n     Higher wages at the bottom often lead to better education for \n     both workers and their children.\n       In the New Economy, it often makes sense to leave old \n     economic nostrums behind and take prudent risks. Federal \n     Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, for example, has withstood \n     pressure to raise interest rates in the face of strong \n     economic growth. Traditional theory said that inflation \n     follows fast growth. It hasn't. Greenspan bravely took a \n     chance, and America has profited from higher growth. \n     Congress, for its part, has withstood pressure to allow \n     states to impose sales taxes on the Internet. Economic theory \n     says this is harmful because it creates an unfair competitive \n     advantage. But it is the right policy because it nurtures a \n     pervasive technology that is driving the economy.\n       It is time to set aside old assumptions about the minimum \n     wage, as well. We don't\n\n[[Page S13141]]\n\n     know how low unemployment can go before inflation is once \n     again triggered. But Greenspan is testing the limits. We \n     don't know how high the minimum wage can rise before it hurts \n     demand for labor. But with the real minimum wage no higher \n     than it was under President Reagan, we can afford to take \n     prudent risks.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in reading that particular article, you \nwill see that they make the point that the money that is actually used \nor actually received by minimum wage workers is spent and adds to the \neconomy.\n  Take a State such as Oregon, that has the highest minimum wage in the \ncountry. Since Oregon went to a higher minimum wage more people are \nworking, because it brought people who work back into the labor market \nbecause they were able to provide meaningful income to themselves and \nto their families. It provided an additional boost to the economy.\n  That concept has been supported by the Card and Krueger studies that \nhave been referred to in other debates on the minimum wage.\n  Raising the minimum wage is an issue of fundamental and basic \nfairness, fairness and justice for men and women who are working at the \nlower economic rungs of the economic ladder. These are people working \nas assistants to school teachers in many of the schools across the \ncountry. These are people who are working as assistants in nursing \nhomes that are looking after our parents and grandparents. These are \nmen and women working in the great buildings in our major cities \ncleaning up after long days. These buildings effectively would not be \nfunctioning unless people were willing to provide that kind of work.\n  This issue, as I have said many times, is a women's issue because the \nmajority of individuals will benefit from increasing the minimum wage \nare women. This is an issue of civil rights because one-third of \nminimum wage workers are men and women of color. This is a children's \nissue because more than 80 percent of families earing the minimum age \nare headed by women. Providing for the children in these families is \ndirectly related to the incomes that people have, and many have not \njust one job but the two jobs held down by many minimum wage workers \nwho are heads of households.\n  We hear a great deal about family values. How are parents going to be \nable to spend their time with their children when they are out there \nworking on two different jobs trying to put food on the table, a roof \nover their heads, and trying to clothe their children?\n  It is amazing to me when we have this greatest economic boom in the \nhistory of this country, this body is going to be begrudging to men and \nwomen who work hard, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, and who \nvalue work. How many speeches did we hear on the other side of the \naisle that we honor work, and we want them to go out and work? People \nare out there working, and you refuse to give them the kind of income \nthey need so that they can work in dignity and not live in poverty.\n  I know we have a lot of important pieces of legislation. This isn't a \nvery complicated issue. Every Member in this body knows these issues. \nEverybody knows this issue. We are not talking about a complicated \npolicy question. It is just a question of whether we are prepared to \nstand up and speak for those individuals who have fallen further behind \neconomically than any other group--any other group in our society. They \nare the minimum wage workers. They haven't even been able to maintain \nthe purchasing power of their wages, they have fallen further and \nfurther behind and continue to do so.\n  With all respect to all the other items we have in the Senate in \nterms of public policy questions, certainly the issue of fairness to \nour fellow citizens is something the American people understand.\n  The obstinacy of the Republican leadership in refusing to permit a \nlimited period of time for us to vote on this issue, I think, is a real \ntragedy for these families. It certainly is. But they have refused and \nrefused and refused with these tired, old arguments. We cannot get this \nissue on the agenda. They say we are the majority and we will set the \nagenda.\n  Let us have an opportunity to vote on those issues.\n  We saw our colleagues on the other side of the aisle say: Well, all \nright; if we are going to find an increase in the minimum wage for 2 \nyears, we are going to require $35 billion in unpaid tax breaks that \nare going to swell to $100 billion over ten years.\n  If you want to look after the working poor, Senators, they say, you \nare going to have to provide $100 billion in tax breaks--not related to \nsmall businesses, not related to minimum wage individuals, but to the \nhighest paid 10 percent of taxpayers in this country who will get over \n90% of the benefit from those tax breaks.\n  Still we can't even have a chance to debate, they refuse us the time \neven to debate that. They ought to be ashamed of themselves.\n  The last time we provided an increase in the minimum wage was the \nfirst time we added all the tax goodies. Now the Republican leadership \nunderstands they have a train coming along the tracks, and they are \npiling up and piling up.\n  They may consider doing $1 over 3 years.\n  We have already delayed a year--2 years now. They refused to let us \nbring up the issue up last year, and they are refusing to let us bring \nit up this year. They want to spread it out three more years. That \nwon't even keep up in terms of inflation for those working families. \nAnd to be able to do even that, you have to tag on $100 billion over a \n10-year period of tax goodies, unpaid for.\n  If these individuals end up contributing and paying taxes, they will \nbe paying some of their taxes to try to offset the increase that the \nRepublican leadership wants in these tax breaks.\n  We may see another hour that goes by without facing the minimum wage \nissue. We may see another day that goes by without facing the minimum \nwage issue. But I will tell you, it is inevitable that we will one way \nor the other bring these measures to the attention of the Senate and \ntry to get accountability.\n  How many times do we have to hear about accountability on the other \nside of the aisle? We want accountability. We want accountability for \nthis. We want accountability for that. We want accountability for \neverything except being willing to vote up or down on the increase in \nthe minimum wage. Yet they were quite prepared to vote themselves--all \nof the Senate, and the House of Representatives--a $4,600 raise. But \nthey won't even permit a vote on the Senate floor on an increase in the \nminimum wage.\n  Mr. President, maybe that goes over well someplace. But it doesn't \nseem to me that it will go over well with the American people. We \nintend to continue to press this issue.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13141-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13141-S13144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I had a chance to speak this morning \nand I don't really want to repeat what I said, except to mention one \npoint which is both an argument I want to make to my colleagues here \nand an argument I want to also make to the administration.\n  We have a WTO meeting coming up next month in Seattle. There will be \nmany rank-and-file labor people and labor leaders attending, farm \norganizations, nongovernment organizations, environmentalists. We have \nbeen told by the administration that maybe within WTO we can have some \nenforceable labor standards, some enforceable environmental standards, \nso we are raising everything up rather than racing to the bottom.\n  This is important because with NAFTA, in spite of what was said, the \ntruth is, the environmental standards and labor standards were an \nafterthought and not enforceable. What kind of message are we sending \nto people when, on the one hand, we have the administration and others \nsaying with WTO we will try to have enforceable standards, and then we \nhave a bilateral agreement, several trade agreements, without \nenforceable labor standards, without enforceable environmental \nstandards?\n  As a Senator my bottom line is that I am in favor of the right of \npeople to\n\n[[Page S13142]]\n\norganize and bargain collectively in our country and in other \ncountries. I am in favor of the rights of ordinary citizens to be able \nto bargain collectively and have the right to organize so they can make \na decent wage and support their families. That is what is sorely \nlacking in this legislation.\n  I will mention one amendment. I mentioned several this morning. If we \ngo forward with this legislation tomorrow, I certainly want to have the \nright to introduce amendments. I talked about a number of amendments. \nOne dealt with campaign finance reform and for the right to apply for \nclean money, clean elections for Federal offices. I don't think we \nshould abandon this debate or issue.\n  The amendment I want to introduce tomorrow, if that is the direction \nin which we are heading, deals with this economic convulsion that is \ntaking place in agriculture. On October 25, Bird Island Elevator, \nRenville, MN, crop prices: Wheat, $2.89 a bushel; corn, $1.43 a bushel; \nsoybeans, $4.04 a bushel. This has nothing to do with what our \nlivestock producers are getting.\n  Let me say to those who don't know agriculture, this is way below \nwhat it costs farmers to produce a bushel of wheat or corn.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, in my State of Minnesota, farm income \nhas decreased 43 percent since 1996, and more than 25 percent--a \nquarter of our farmers--may not be able to cover expenses for 1999.\n  At the same time, you have these conglomerates that have muscled \ntheir way to the dinner table, exercising their power over family \nfarmers. They will do it over consumers, and they are driving our \nfamily farmers out.\n  According to a recent study at the University of Missouri, five firms \nnow control over 80 percent of beef packing; six firms, 75 percent of \nthe pork packing, and the list, frankly, goes on and on.\n  I want to give a few more figures, then mention the amendment and \nfinish up. The top four pork packers have increased their market share \nfrom 36 percent to 57 percent. That is what has been occurring. \nSmithfield is buying up Murphy, and now they are about to buy part of \nTyson Foods that deals with pork production. Our pork producers are \nfacing extinction and these packers are in hog heaven.\n  The top four beef packers have expanded their market share from 32 \npercent to 80 percent just in recent years. The top four flour millers \nhave increased their market share from 40 percent to 62 percent. The \ntop four turkey processors now control 42 percent. The list goes on and \non.\n  What we have is a food industry where we are looking for the \ncompetition. So here is the amendment I will introduce with Senator \nDorgan. I think we may get a majority of votes. I hope so. This will be \nan amendment to address the market concentration in agriculture. What \nwe would call for is a moratorium that would apply to these mergers and \nacquisitions over the next 18 months, during which time there are a \ncouple of things that will happen. This would deal with companies that \nhad assets of over $100 million and the second party had more than $10 \nmillion. This is the threshold test right now under which these firms \nwould have to apply to the Justice Department and FTC.\n  The moratorium would last for 18 months or until Congress passes \ncomprehensive antitrust legislation to deal with this problem of the \nconcentration in agriculture, whichever comes first. Moreover, our \namendment will establish an antitrust review division to look at this \nconcentration in agriculture and to make recommendations as to what \nkind of regulations are necessary and what kind of action we should \ntake.\n  I finish this way. We will be talking about this legislation today. I \nspoke about it earlier. If we move forward tomorrow, as a Senator from \nMinnesota I want to have the opportunity to introduce this amendment \nwith Senator Dorgan that calls for a moratorium on these acquisitions \nand mergers. I want to do it because these big conglomerates are \npushing our family farmers off the land. I want to do it because there \nis a direct correlation between their concentrated market power and the \nrecord low prices that our producers are receiving. I want to do it \nbecause if we do not have a moratorium over the way in which these huge \nconglomerates are taking over agriculture, then our rural communities \nwill be devastated and more and more family farmers will be driven off \nthe land. Someone will own the land, someone will own the livestock, \nbut it will be the few.\n  I think that kind of concentration of power is frightening. It is \nfrightening for our family farmers. It is driving them off the land. It \nis frightening for our rural communities that depend upon the number of \nfamily farmers who live in the communities and buy there. Do you know \nwhat else? It is frightening for America. Food is a very precious \ncommodity. We ought not have just a few conglomerates that control all \nphases of this food industry from seed all the way to grocery shelf. \nThis is wrong. It is not acceptable.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, I hope my colleagues will excuse me for \nsaying that for 4 weeks I have asked the majority leader for an \nopportunity to introduce the amendment. Tomorrow morning, if we go \nforward with this legislation, I will be here first thing and this is \nthe first amendment I am going to introduce to this legislation. Then \nwe can have an up-or-down vote, and I am hoping we will get a majority \nvote.\n  I see my colleague from North Carolina. I gather he wants to spend \nsome time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, on the Africa-Caribbean trade bill, let \nme say first I believe in free trade. This country and my State of \nNorth Carolina are part of a global economy. To put our heads in the \nsand and pretend that is not true is completely unproductive and \naccomplishes nothing.\n  My concern is that the bills we are addressing this week, the \nAfrican-Caribbean trade bills, put us in a position of playing with \nfire. The Senate version of those bills is marginally acceptable but \nthey are significantly different, from my perspective, than the House \nversion of those bills. The Senate version specifically contains \nprovisions for what is called yarn forward and fabric forward, which I \nwill talk about in a few minutes. But both bills are dramatically \ndeficient in one respect; that is, they make it almost impossible, in \nmy judgment, to enforce provisions against transshipment.\n  Transshipment, as my colleagues know, means a country such as China \ncan ship goods to Africa that they otherwise could not ship directly to \nthe United States because of quotas, have a button sewn onto a garment \nor a piece of apparel, and then have it shipped to the United States \nand otherwise circumvent existing tariffs and quota requirements. The \nproblem is the enforcement mechanisms against transshipment. In the \nHouse bill, in my judgment, they are virtually nonexistent. In the \nSenate bill, while somewhat better, still we rely heavily on African \ncountries to develop and enforce rules against transshipment. That is \nsimply not a bet worth taking. Unfortunately, transshipment has the \npotential of putting an enormous number of folks out of work in North \nCarolina and having a dramatic impact on the textile and apparel \nindustry in my State of North Carolina.\n  The second problem with these bills is the issue of yarn and fabric \nforward. The Senate bill provides for yarn and fabric forward, which \nessentially means African countries operating under the Senate bill, if \nit were passed, would be required to use American yarn, American \nfabric, which theoretically would help protect American manufacturers \nin those two areas. The problem is those provisions are not in the \nAfrican trade bill on the House side. Unfortunately, if this bill \npasses the Senate, once it gets to conference, there would be enormous \npressure to drop out the fabric forward and yarn forward provisions. \nWithout those provisions, the textile and apparel industry in the \nUnited States and in my State of North Carolina would be dramatically \naffected.\n  I said when I began that I believe in free trade, and I do believe in \nfree trade. But I think there are certain fundamental principles with \nwhich every free trade agreement should comply.\n  First, the agreements must be negotiated and must be multilateral. \nThe countries with which we are entering\n\n[[Page S13143]]\n\ninto these agreements have to give something up. As I will discuss in a \nfew minutes, that is not true with respect to this bill.\n  All the trade laws have to be fair and enforceable. As I indicated a \nfew minutes ago, there is at least one major area, transshipment, that \nin my judgment is not enforceable in this bill.\n  Third, the trade bill must have adequate labor and environmental \nprotections overseas.\n  That is common sense. If our businesses and workers in this country \nare going to compete, as they should, with businesses and workers \noverseas, these bills must have adequate labor and environmental \nprotections.\n  Finally, the trade bills must have tangible and provable benefits for \nU.S. companies and U.S. workers.\n  Those four criteria must be present for a free trade bill to make \nsense for our country and for my State of North Carolina.\n  I am going to talk about some of these principles and how they apply \nto this specific bill.\n  First, I just mentioned tangible benefits for U.S. workers. Let me \ntell you a little bit about what is happening with textile and apparel \nindustry jobs in this country and specifically in my State of North \nCarolina.\n  We have 177,000 textile jobs in North Carolina. We have 45,000 \napparel jobs, 222,000 jobs in total. Almost a quarter of a million \nworkers in my State of North Carolina are dependent on the textile and \napparel industry to put food on the table for their families; a quarter \nof a million families who are going to be impacted if this bill passes \nand is signed by the President and becomes law.\n  Let's look at what has happened to folks who have worked in that area \nin North Carolina over the last several years. In the last 5 years, \nfrom 1993 to 1998, North Carolina has lost 62,000 jobs in the area of \ntextile and apparel manufacturing. That is 62,000 families who had a \nbreadwinner working in that industry who lost their jobs. I believe the \nstudies have shown that those folks have had a terrible time finding \nother employment. The reality is that the people who work in these jobs \nneed these jobs. They are critically important to provide them and \ntheir families with a livelihood. Oftentimes, there is nowhere else for \nthem to go.\n  I want my colleagues to recognize that when we do pass the kind of \nlegislation we are talking about in these trade bills, it is not just \nan economic issue. This has real and human consequences on families in \nmy State of North Carolina.\n  We have lost during that same 5-year period in the textile apparel \nindustry almost 300,000 jobs nationally, which means 300,000 families \nin this country have lost their source of income during that same 5-\nyear period.\n  What has happened during the 10-year period from 1989 to 1999? In \nNorth Carolina, we have gone from 220,000 to 177,000 textile jobs, \nalmost 43,000 jobs lost, a 20-percent drop in 10 years. We have gone \nfrom 83,000 to 45,000 in the apparel industry, which means they have \nalmost been cut in half; half the people in North Carolina who were \ndependent on the apparel industry to provide income and livelihood for \ntheir families have been put out of work; a 45-percent drop, almost \nhalf. The reality is, these families have been devastated by the loss \nof these jobs.\n  The bill we are talking about today, the African-Caribbean trade \nbill, could very easily have exactly the same impact because it ensures \nthese jobs we are trying to hold on to in the United States are very \nlikely to be exported to the Caribbean and to African countries.\n  The average apparel wage in the United States is $8 an hour. Let's \nsee how that compares with these other countries. In Mexico, the \naverage wage is 85 cents an hour. In the Dominican Republic, it is 69 \ncents an hour; El Salvador, 59 cents an hour; Guatemala, 65 cents an \nhour; and Honduras, 43 cents an hour--$8 an hour to, in all these \ncountries, well under $1 an hour that companies will have to pay in \nwages. It does not take a mathematical wizard to figure out what is \ngoing to happen to these jobs and to all these folks in my State who \nare completely dependent on the textile and apparel industry to provide \nfor their families, many of whom have been working in this industry for \nmany years.\n  On a personal note, I grew up in the textile business. My dad worked \nin the textile business for 37 years before his retirement from that \nbusiness. I have seen firsthand, having worked in mills in North \nCarolina when I was in high school and in college, how heavily folks \ndepend on these jobs. They have nowhere else to go.\n\n  The bottom line is, it is all they know, and it is all well and good \nto talk abstractly about retraining, but when you are talking about \nretraining somebody who does not have a high school education and who \nhas spent the last 30 or 40 years of their life working in a cotton \nmill, they have no idea what to do and they have no realistic prospect \nof going to some other field of employment. These people need these \njobs. This is a human tragedy that is created oftentimes by these trade \nbills. I want folks to realize this is real, and it has a real and \ndevastating effect on people's lives in my State of North Carolina and \nall over this country.\n  Let me talk briefly about the jobs we know have been lost and the \nplants that have been closed over the last few years in North Carolina. \nIn September of this year, Pluma Inc. closed a plant in Eden, NC, a \nsmall community in North Carolina, 500 jobs lost; 500 families lost \ntheir breadwinner. The company of Jasper closed a plant in Whiteville, \nNC, in September of this year; 191 jobs lost. Whiteville Apparel in \nWhiteville, NC, in eastern North Carolina, closed a plant in August of \nthis year; 396 jobs lost. Stonecutter Mills in Rutherford and Polk in \nwestern North Carolina closed a plant in June of this year; 800 jobs \nlost. Dyersburg, in Hamilton, NC, closed a plant in May of this year; \n422 jobs lost. Unifi in Raeford and Sanford closed a plant in March of \nthis year; 257 jobs lost. Levi Strauss closed a plant in Murphy; 382 \njobs lost. Burlington Industries in January of this year closed plants \nin Cramerton, Forest City, Mooresville, Raeford, Oxford, and \nStatesville; 2,600 jobs lost. Cone Mills at the end of last year, in \nDecember, closed a plant in Salisbury; 625 jobs lost.\n  In a period of less than a year, 6,173 jobs have been lost in my home \nState of North Carolina. Just imagine what impact the passage of this \npiece of legislation will have. It will accelerate those numbers. It \nwill not retard them. It will accelerate them, so more and more workers \nwho have spent their lives working in textiles will have nowhere to go, \nno way to feed their families, and their families are just out of luck.\n  I want to read from a news story that appeared in the Arizona \nRepublic. It appeared on October 23 of this year--just recently. It is \nentitled ``Textile Industry Unravels Workers Idled By Cheap Labor.'' It \ndoes a terrific job of telling the story of what is happening to \nworkers and families all over North Carolina who are being impacted by \nthese trade bills:\n\n       It was the only work she'd ever done, the only work she'd \n     ever wanted to do. And a contented Lorie Coleman spent a \n     decade and a half inspecting stitch lines, examining cloth \n     and making sure everything that came out of the Ithaca \n     Industries textile mill here met her ``high standards''--\n     never mind the company's. A $6-an-hour job it may have been, \n     but it was hers.\n       Then it was gone.\n       ``To think you could work somewhere,'' Coleman . . . said \n     recently, her voice still tinged with disbelief . . .'' and \n     the next thing you know, you're gone, just like that.''\n       Just like that, a livelihood for the Lorie Colemans of \n     North Carolina and thousands of others in the Piedmont area \n     is disappearing.\n       Since 1995, according to state labor statistics, more than \n     160 textile and apparel mills have closed in North Carolina, \n     leaving nearly--\n\n  Listen to this, Mr. President--\n\n     leaving nearly 30,000 people out of work [since 1995].\n       Those losses are reflected throughout the Southeast, which, \n     according to federal figures, lost more than 85,000 such \n     jobs, even as the country was experiencing its fabled \n     economic expansion.\n\n  During a period of booming prosperity for this Nation's economy, when \neveryone else is taking advantage of investment in Wall Street, great \nearnings on Wall Street, companies are doing terrifically well, 85,000 \npeople in the Southeast lost their jobs, 30,000 in my State of North \nCarolina.\n\n       To be sure, North Carolina is still the leading state in \n     the leading region for U.S. production of textiles and \n     apparel. Nevertheless, the State is hemorrhaging.\n       Few places in the State have felt the sting of such losses \n     as much as Lorie Coleman's\n\n[[Page S13144]]\n\n     native Columbus County. Home to nine mills just three years \n     ago, the county now has 3 mills, and two of those are \n     scheduled to close this fall.\n\n  They will have one mill left.\n\n       It's a corner of North Carolina that was spared from the \n     worst of Hurricane Floyd's floods last month, but it is \n     bearing the brunt of an industry's decline. After Jasper \n     Textiles and Whiteville Apparel close their gates, the number \n     of textile jobs in this county [Columbus County in eastern \n     North Carolina] will have fallen to 50 from 2,100.\n\n  In other words, they have gone from 2,100 jobs to 50. There is \nnowhere for these people to go to work. They have no comparable jobs. \nThere is nowhere else for them to go.\n\n       Those figures also bear witness to the decline of a \n     distinctly Southern way of life.\n\n  Lorie Coleman said it best. She spent her life working in this mill \nand all of a sudden it was gone. Everything she spent her life learning \nto do has disappeared.\n  There is another fundamental problem with this bill. These bills are \nunilateral. They are not multilateral. Every Member of the Senate \nshould require, in order to vote for a trade bill, that it be \nmultilateral.\n  What does that mean? First, in the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic \ncharges a 30 to 35 percent tariff on apparel imports. Honduras charges \n25 percent. Nicaragua charges 20 percent. We are lowering our tariffs \nin this bill. Do we have a corresponding lowering of tariffs in those \ncountries? The answer is no. We are unilaterally lowering our tariffs \nand expecting nothing from the countries that are part of this trade \nagreement. Their tariffs remain exactly the same. Where is the fairness \nin this agreement?\n  In Africa, the average tariff on apparel is 27 percent. Exactly the \nsame tariff is charged on home textiles. This simply makes no sense. \nWhy should we as a nation unilaterally lower our tariffs and have our \ncompanies in this country subjected to tariffs in the countries we are \nentering into contracts or agreements with, where they can charge any \ntariff they want? That is exactly what is happening in this agreement. \nThere is no lowering of trade barriers in Africa, no lowering of trade \nbarriers in the Caribbean. Instead, we have decided unilaterally we \nwill lower trade barriers.\n  I have heard a lot of my colleagues talk about the poverty that \nreigns in Africa and in the Caribbean. My heart goes out to those \npeople. They are suffering; they are struggling. The fact that they are \nworking for anywhere from 35 to 85 cents an hour bears witness to the \nterrible lives with which they and their families are confronted. But \nwe, in my State of North Carolina, have an awful lot of people who are \nstruggling to make ends meet, too. We have an awful lot of people and \nfamilies who have spent their lives going into those mills every day, \n5, sometimes 6 days a week, 8 to 10 hours a day, to learn to do a job, \nto build up seniority, to provide for their families.\n  When we enter into these kind of trade agreements, particularly when \nwe can't enforce provisions against transshipment, where there is a \nreal likelihood that yarn and fabric forward will go out when this bill \ngoes to conference and, as a result, there is a devastating economic \nimpact on North Carolina's textile business and on North Carolina's \ntextile workers, those people lose everything. This is not just an \nabstract economic proposition we are debating. We are talking about \nhuman lives. We are talking about an enormous impact on the families I \nrepresent in North Carolina.\n  I want my colleagues, when they come to vote, either on cloture or on \nthe passage of this bill ultimately, if we reach that stage, to \nunderstand every single one of them has a dramatic effect on real human \nbeings' lives across this country and in my home State of North \nCarolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13144-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13144-S13146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF SENATOR JOHN CHAFEE\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I want to say a word about my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Chafee. Having had the honor and privilege of being \nhis friend for the 10 months I have been here, the thing that struck me \nmost about Senator Chafee was his kind and gentle nature. It was the \nsort of thing I am afraid we need more of in government in general and \nparticularly in this body. He was a thoughtful leader who showed \nexactly the kind of leadership we desperately need in our country \ntoday. He was also a thoughtful, nonpartisan voice on issues that were \nnot partisan, issues we ought to be able to work together on, issues \nthat are good for America.\n  It is an extraordinary loss for me personally to lose Senator Chafee. \nHe was someone I looked up to and admired in my brief time here. I \ndon't know anyone here who did not love and adore him. I can certainly \nadd my voice to those who will miss him dearly.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon for just a few \nmoments to add my voice to the chorus of leaders in the Senate, in \nCongress, and throughout the Nation who have expressed in the last 2 \ndays their admiration and respect for our colleague, Senator John \nChafee of Rhode Island.\n  Upon coming to this Chamber almost 3 years ago, one of the first \nthings I did was to try to search out role models who put principle \nahead of politics, who held people more important than political \nparties. John Chafee was such a role model.\n  As has been mentioned many times on this floor, as a young marine who \nbattled at Guadalcanal, to the Rhode Island Statehouse as Governor, to \nthe floor of this Chamber, John Chafee answered the call of his \ncountry. While he was never afraid to fight for his country or for his \nprinciples, as we all know, he knew that common ground provided a \nbetter place to find solutions than the battleground. That is one of \nhis most outstanding legacies to this body, to his State, and to our \nNation.\n  Throughout his public career, John Chafee was a tireless fighter for \nAmerica's children and their families. He correctly perceived that the \nfuture of our country would be dictated by how we treated and nurtured \nour children and set about to create laws, policies, initiatives, and \nprograms which prepared them for the future.\n  We were all privileged to work with him on many issues. I was, \nindeed, privileged to work with him on a particular issue of which he \nwas so proud: The Adoption and Safe Families Act. I spoke on the floor \nabout this act, of which he was a tireless advocate and leader, just a \nfew weeks ago and said in its first year 37,000 children had been moved \nfrom foster care to a place of limbo, to a place where they were not \ncertain anyone wanted them, to families of their own. That was a 32-\npercent increase over the previous year. John Chafee had a great deal \nto do with making that happen.\n  As leaders retire or pass on, as in this case, through our meager \nways we try to construct buildings, highways, and bridges and name them \nin their honor. I am sure Senator Chafee will have the prerequisite \nnumber of bridges or buildings or statues in his honor. I think knowing \nhim the way I did, the way we all did, the legacy of which he will be \nmost proud is that he spent an entire career building up families, \nbuilding up children, building up people. There will be millions of \nfamilies built stronger and nurtured and provided for because of the \ngreat work he did, not only on the floor of this Senate but in the many \nways he has served his State and Nation.\n  I also want to mention his legacy in regard to the environment. I \nfind, unfortunately, few voices of reason on a subject that is so \nimportant to the future of our country. I was so proud, as we all were, \nto work with Senator Chafee on many issues regarding the environment. \nHe was one of our outstanding leaders working to find a permanent \nsource of funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, funding of \nTeaming with Wildlife programs, for wetlands, for estuaries, for \nendangered species. I am confident that as we continue the work in \nthese areas, many of his dreams and aspirations on these initiatives \nwill come to pass.\n  In addition, his passion for history and historic preservation was \nevident until the end. Fittingly, his last public appearance was at the \n50th anniversary of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, just \nthis last Thursday at the National Cathedral. In his final speech, he \nwisely warned of the danger to America's future if it forgets its past. \nIt was a fitting tribute to 50 years of tremendous work, 25 years or \nmore by a leader in this particular area.\n  The poet Abraham Joseph Ryan wrote:\n\n\n[[Page S13145]]\n\n\n       A land without ruins is a man without memories.  . . . A \n     land without memories is a land without history.\n\n  John Chafee understood that. Today we honor his memory. Let us never \nforget his example as an excellent role model, a tireless crusader \nforfamilies and for children, and a tremendous and reasoned voice in \nour debate on how to balance the needs of our Nation and our world with \nthe great need to preserve and protect our environment.\n  Today there is an emptiness in this Chamber that we all sense, a \nterrible emptiness because a grand man, a great man, has left us. We \nhope our work in these areas will be pleasing to him so we can carry on \nmany of the initiatives he started.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak regarding the late \nSenator John Chafee. I have a few comments I want to make.\n  I was privileged to be presiding whenever our colleagues spoke about \nSenator Chafee and what a great man he was. People have gone through \nhis resume. It struck me as I was listening that it is rare for us to \nrecognize giants when they are among us. It is generally only after \nthey leave us that we recognize the giant of the individual.\n  Senator Chafee was such a giant. For all the things he has done and \nfor which he has been recognized--his work for his country, his \nfighting for his country, his service in this body, his service in \nRhode Island--he was truly a giant among us. Only now do we measure his \ntrue greatness because we have this void in that he is no longer with \nus. He was a great giant, he was a humble giant, he was a kind giant, a \ngiant of a man, and a giant of a soul.\n  We can look at his desk and see the flowers--and they are beautiful \nflowers. As I look at Senator Chafee's desk, I see this giant oak tree. \nIt is a soaring oak tree, and it has limbs that branch out everywhere. \nIt has leaves that are providing shade and support and nurturing and \nhousing for so many people. It glistens and reaches all the way across \nAmerica. That is the kind of person he really is. He is a giant of that \nstature and that nature. The other thing about him is, he doesn't even \nwant to be noticed that he is there. He just wants to do that. He just \nwants to provide this great shade and this great tree and this great \nsupport for this country. He really doesn't even want to be noticed.\n\n  When you said, my, isn't that great; he just kind of said, no, I just \nwanted to do this. I just wanted to help the people in this country \nwhom I love so much, these people who are here for whom I feel so \nstrongly. I believe that I have been given much. To whom much is given, \nmuch is expected. I am just providing what I think I ought to.\n  That was the kind of humble man he was.\n  I have my own personal experience and memory, as all of us do, about \nworking with him. I am a newer Member, so I didn't have the length of \nservice others did. But I was working with him on a rails-to-trails \nbill that had a particular problem for Kansas. This was a program he \ndeeply loved. Yet I was having a particular narrow problem. Normally, \none would think--I am a new Member and this is a program he loves; I am \nhaving a problem with it--that he would kind of quickly shuffle me to \nthe side, that that would have been the normal experience. Yet he was \nthe kindest man about it. He said: I know you have a problem with this. \nLet's see if we can work it out. He could have easily said: I really \ndon't have time for this. I have more important things to do. But my \nproblem was his problem. He worked with me, and he worked with me in \nkindness and in gentleness to try to deal with the problem I had with \nwhich, in many respects, he disagreed. Yet that was the kind of man he \nwas. There was a great kindness about him.\n  In my estimation, few have carried greatness so gently as John Chafee \ncarried it. If pride is the first sin, humility is the first grace. And \nJohn was a truly humble man. John was a man of grace. We will all miss \nhim dearly, as we see this giant that is no longer amongst us. We loved \nhim. God loves him. Our prayers will be with him and his family.\n  I only hope his memory can stay with us as long and that we can \nrecognize that giant who was amongst us and in many respects that giant \ntree which is still there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair for an opportunity to join my voice \nwith others who have talked about our dear friend, John Chafee.\n  This place is sadder these last couple days because of the unexpected \npassing of Senator John Chafee. His death has left the Senate and the \nentire country mourning the loss of one of our most admired and \nrespected elected leaders.\n  Senator Chafee belonged to a breed of public servants who have become \na vanishing species in American politics. He was always a gentleman, \neven under attack while defending causes about which he felt deeply. He \nalways stood for moderation and common sense over political extremism.\n  Senator Chafee was a consensus builder. He believed in bipartisan \nsolutions as an alternative to the typically partisan bickering which \nis now often a feature of congressional debate.\n  I served for 15 years with John Chafee on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee--some of those years, obviously, before he became \nchairman, and these recent years when he was chairman of the committee. \nHe and I were allies on many battles for a cleaner environment. Even \nwhen our approaches diverged, his commitment and leadership were always \nto be admired. He worked tirelessly to make our air cleaner, to keep \npollutants from being dumped into our oceans, and to preserve those \nspecies that were endangered.\n  He had a wonderful patience factor in his being. Senator Chafee and I \nspent years trying, in good faith but, unfortunately, unable to reach a \nconsensus on a Superfund reform bill. The reason we failed to reach a \nconsensus was not for lack of effort Senator Chafee put in to try to \nget a Superfund bill out that was satisfactory to both sides and a \nmajority view.\n  Senator Chafee played an important role in most of the major \nenvironmental bills that have come before the Senate since 1977. In \nstanding up for the environment, he often had to stand firmly against \noverwhelming pressure from powerful special interest groups--not to \nmention, by the way, pressures from members of his own party, and \ncertainly from some pressures on our side as well--to try and form the \nconsensus we so much wanted to have. He was a role model for all of us \nin public service and for anyone considering a career in government. He \nvoted his conscience on issues as diverse as child care, welfare \nreform, tobacco, and transportation, even when voting his conscience \nmeant crossing party lines.\n  I was particularly proud to have Senator Chafee agree with me, when \nhe supported my bill to require background checks at gun shows. These \nwere not easy votes to make because most of the Members of his party \nfelt differently about that. But he stood up for what he believed in \nand voted that way and spoke that way and was honored for his \nviews. His own gun safety initiatives made him a hero to me and to all \nAmericans. This was noteworthy, considering his wartime experiences in \nthe face of deadly combat. In World War II, he fought with the Marine \nCorps in the invasion of Guadalcanal. In 1951, he reentered the service \nand commanded a rifle company in Korea. His political career was \nexemplary, including 6 years in the Rhode Island legislature, 3 terms \nas the State's Governor, and 3 years as Secretary of the Navy. And his \nfour highly distinguished terms here in the Senate made him one of the \nmost treasured figures in American politics.\n\n  In his home State, Senator Chafee was known directly as ``the man you \ncan trust.'' No one was more deserving of that trust or worked harder \nto earn it. His constituents in Rhode Island and all of us here always \nknew where Senator Chafee stood on an issue. That was true largely \nbecause he believed in the Government's ability to help people, to make \ntheir lives better. He didn't buy into the notion that Government was \nthe people's enemy.\n  Mr. President, Senator Chafee's death is an incalculable loss to the \nSenate and the American people. He set an example that all of us here \nwould be proud to emulate. I know I speak for everyone in the Senate \nwhen we extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Ginny, whom we have \ngotten\n\n[[Page S13146]]\n\nto know over the years, and his entire family. Senator Chafee's unique \nstyle and his physical and moral courage are irreplaceable. The country \nhas lost a great public servant. We are all poorer with his demise, and \nwe will all miss him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for up to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is the sixth time I have come to the \nfloor in recent days to talk about Medicare coverage for prescription \nmedicine and particularly to talk about bipartisanship. I want to talk \nabout this issue of prescriptions for senior citizens.\n  I am very pleased to see my good friend and colleague from Oregon in \nthe chair. He has been extremely supportive of the effort Senator Snowe \nand I have been making over these last few months to try to show that \nwe can deal in a bipartisan manner with this issue of prescription \ndrugs for the Nation's elderly. I think a lot of people have pretty \nmuch consigned this issue to part of the campaign trail in the fall of \n2000 and that Republicans and Democrats are just going to fight about \nit and nothing is going to get done. But what Senator Snowe and I have \nbeen talking about for the last few weeks is that we ought to act on \nthis now; we ought to deal with it in this session of Congress. I thank \nthe Chair, my friend and colleague from Oregon, because he has been \nvery supportive.\n  I am going to read this afternoon, as I have done on five previous \noccasions, from some of the letters we are getting from seniors across \nthe State of Oregon who are concerned about this issue. In fact, this \nis part of a campaign Senator Snowe and I are making to urge seniors \nacross the Nation, as we say in the poster, to send in their \nprescription drug bills. We hope they do send them to their Senators, \nin the hopes that we can galvanize bipartisan action in this session. \nIt is more than a year until the next election. It would be a shame, \nwith all of the suffering and hardship we are seeing in these letters, \nto have the Senate just take a pass on this issue and say, well, we \nwill deal with it some other time and on some other day.\n\n  So I am going to, as I have on five previous occasions, read from \nsome of these letters in an effort to try to make the case for \nbipartisanship and action in this session.\n  One senior from Lebanon wrote recently that she has about $990 per \nmonth in income. This senior spends about $175 of that for just one \nprescription each month. That leaves this older person a little over \n$700 a month on which to live. Think about what it is actually like for \na senior citizen on a $990-a-month income to spend $175 of that for \njust one prescription each month. It is pretty clear that you just \ncan't pay for necessities if you have to pay out of your monthly income \nthat very large prescription drug bill.\n  It would be one thing if that letter were a rarity, but here is \nanother letter I got recently from a couple in The Dalles, OR--the \nChair and I have been in that community often--who has to spend \nsomething like $1,500 a year for tamoxifen, a drug used to fight \ncancer. It is very clear that with their other health expenses, their \ndental work, eyeglasses, a variety of things that Medicare doesn't \ncover, this couple in The Dalles, OR, is walking on an economic \ntightrope, having to balance food costs against fuel costs, their fuel \ncosts against their medical bills.\n  So I am very hopeful that, as a result of this campaign Senator Snowe \nand I are making to urge seniors to send in their prescription drug \nbills, we are going to have a chance to respond in this session.\n  I see our good friend, Senator Moynihan. He has really led in the \narea of health research and prevention. We talked a little bit about it \non Friday last. What is so important about this issue and dealing with \nit in this session of Congress and not in 2001--by the way, we won't \nhave the good fortune of having Senator Moynihan as a Member of this \nbody then. The reason we ought to deal with it now is that the drugs \nseniors need most are preventive in nature.\n  Back when I was director of the Gray Panthers, which was for about 7 \nyears before I was elected to the Congress--and I think the Chair was \nstill practicing law at that time. It is clear that these new drugs can \nmake a tangible, significant difference in the lives of our elderly \npeople. I talked about a drug last week, an anticoagulant that a senior \ncould get for just over $1,000 a year; and if they take that medicine, \nit can prevent strokes and debilitating illnesses that can cost more \nthan $100,000 a year. Think of it--a modest, preventive investment in \nan anticoagulant drug, helping us to save $100,000 that seniors might \nneed to treat a debilitating stroke.\n  I am going to be brief this afternoon. I am going to wrap up with a \nfew additional cases.\n  In Portland, I was told by a constituent about her mother and father. \nThey are 83 and 79 years old. Right now at their home in Portland, OR, \nthey are being treated for diabetes, hypertension, and a variety of \nillnesses relating to arthritis. They have a monthly income of $1,600 a \nmonth. They are spending more than $400 of it on prescription \nmedicine--25 percent of their monthly income for an older couple 83 and \n79 in our home State of Oregon just for prescription medicine.\n  From Silverton, OR, a senior sent me a copy of all of her \nprescription drugs for 1 year. She spent more than $1,000. Her annual \nincome that year was $868 a month. She is spending more than 10 percent \nof her income on prescription drugs.\n  From Astoria, OR, a couple on a modest income wrote that for the \nfirst 10 months of 1999 they spent over $5,000 on their prescription \ndrug costs.\n  What Senator Snowe and I have said is that we have an opportunity to \ndeal with this on a bipartisan basis. We can steer clear of price \ncontrols and one-size-fits-all Federal policy. We can use a model that \nwe know works. It is based on the Federal Employee Health Plan, one \nthat serves all of us and our families here in the Senate.\n  Our bill is called the SPICE Program, the Senior Prescription \nInsurance Coverage Equity Act.\n  Our legislation now is the only bipartisan prescription drug bill now \nbefore the Senate.\n  Frankly, I am very confident in the bipartisan team I see assembled \nfrom the Finance Committee with Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan.\n  I would like to see as a result of seniors sending in to all the \nSenators--as this poster says, ``Send in your prescription drug \nbills''--I would like to see the Senate Finance Committee have the \nopportunity under Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan to devise a good \nbipartisan proposal in this area.\n  Senator Snowe and I have an approach that we think works. More than \n54 Members in the Senate have voted for the funding mechanism we have \nproposed. We have a majority in the Senate already on record supporting \nthe funding approach that we would take.\n  Frankly, when Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan sit down, they may \nwell have better ideas for dealing with it. It is not as if Senator \nSnowe and I are saying we have the last word in terms of dealing with \nthis issue. What we are saying is given the severity of the problem, \ngiven the stakes and the chance to do some real good with anticoagulant \ndrugs where $1,000 a year worth of help can save $100,000 in terms of \nthe cost of a stroke, let's go forward, and let's not let this issue \nbecome fodder for the 2000 election.\n  I am going to wrap up because the chairman and Senator Moynihan are \nhere. They want to talk about this important trade bill, which I also \nhappen to support.\n  But I hope seniors will keep sending me copies of these bills. Just \nas the poster says, ``Send your prescription drug bills'' to your \nSenator. Senator Snowe and I are collecting these.\n  We are going to talk again and again on the floor of the Senate about \nthe importance of this issue.\n  I think we can do this with market forces. We can use an approach \nthat gives senior citizens the kind of bargaining power that a health \nmaintenance organization has.\n\n  What is so sad about this is these vulnerable older people, such as \nthe\n\n[[Page S13147]]\n\nones I have described in these letters, are getting hit twice.\n  First, Medicare doesn't cover their prescriptions. When the program \nbegan in 1965, it didn't cover the cost of prescriptions. So there is \nno coverage either under Part A or Part B of Medicare for most of the \nNation's seniors.\n  Second, the seniors end up subsidizing the big business. Big buyers \ncan get discounts.\n  So you have big buyers, health plans, and a variety of big purchasers \nusing their marketplace clout in order to get a good price, and the \nsenior citizen in Silverton or Pendleton, the Presiding Officer's \nhometown, who walks in and buys their prescription off the street ends \nup subsidizing those big buyers. That is not right.\n  Senator Snowe and I are going to continue to try as a result of our \nconversation with colleagues to catalyze a bipartisan effort to address \nthis issue.\n  I think the question of adding prescription drugs to Medicare would \nbe a real legacy for this session of the Senate.\n  I think about all of the accomplishments of Senator Moynihan in this \nhealth care field over the years, what he has done in terms of graduate \nmedical education, and what he has done in research is extraordinary. I \nwould like to see as part of the great legacy that he leaves for his \ncareer in the Senate action on this bipartisan issue before he retires \nat the conclusion of this session of Congress.\n  Mr. President, I will be back on the floor--I know Senator Snowe \nintends to as well--talking about this issue. We hope seniors send us a \ncopy of their prescription drug bills. We are going to address this \nissue in a bipartisan way. I will be back on the floor soon to talk \nabout this issue and bring other real, live, concrete cases to the \nSenate in hopes, as the Presiding Officer of the Senate and I have done \nat home in Oregon, we can work on this in a bipartisan kind of way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise once more to thank our dear \ncolleague, the Senator from Oregon, for his remarks and his typically \nself-effacing mode. He said we may not have the last word. Indeed, we \nmay not. But we have the first word. We have to do this together; that \nis, both sides of the aisle. We can. He and the Senator from Maine have \nthe votes. But we need a vehicle.\n  His most important point is that medication is now making that great \nmove from treatment of disease to prevention. That is always the great \nadvance in health for everyone. The single most important health \nmeasures that we have done in the last century have been to clean up \nour water supplies so that we don't get ill. These drugs do the same.\n  He is right. I am with him.\n  I yield the floor, sir.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as have so many of our colleagues today, \nI rise to speak in memory of and in praise of John Chafee. He was my \ndearest friend for nigh onto a quarter century.\n  We came to the Senate together in 1977. As it happens, we were both \nappointed to the same committees. As we all know, the life of a Senator \nvery much depends on the committees he or she is appointed to and the \namount of time that they remain on those committees.\n  We were appointed to the Committee on Finance with its enormous range \nof jurisdiction, and to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. \nOnly recently at that point had the ``environment'' come up and made \nits way onto the title of what had previously been a Public Works \nCommittee. We worked together on both committees from the very \nfirst. These are exceptional committees. Possibly because of the great \ncommon interests that are dealt with, they have been exceptionally \nbipartisan committees.\n\n  I point out at this point we have three measures before the Senate: \nThe trade legislation which we will go to tomorrow morning, the tax \nextender legislation which we must get to, and the Medicare and \nMedicaid amendments to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. All three of \nthese measures come to the floor with practically unanimous agreement. \nTwo cases were unanimous; on another, just a voice vote with two \ndissents.\n  John Chafee, ranking Republican, as Senator Roth, the chairman, would \nagree, was part of this consensus development from the first. He was \ninstinctively a man of this body, and the national interests always \ncame first. I can recall an occasion on the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works when we took a vote and afterwards John said: Hold it, \nhold it, did we just have a vote along party lines? We haven't had one \nof those in 15 years on this committee.\n  It happened we had one, and that moment passed.\n  He was deeply involved in environmental matters--the world \nenvironment as well as our own. I tended to emphasize public works, and \nwe had a remarkably reinforcing and effective time, or so we like to \nthink. Everyone has commented on his work.\n  On the Finance Committee--which not everyone understands is, in fact, \nalso the health committee of the Senate--we deal with Medicare and \nMedicaid. John did a great many things. The one that was so typical and \nwonderful was to transmute gradually --over a quarter century--the \nMedicaid program from a program of health insurance for persons on \nwelfare under title IV(a) of the Social Security Act such that we \nconfined the population who could benefit to those persons who were \ndependent on welfare and added another incentive to dependency. He \nslowly moved this program to a health insurance program for low-income \nAmericans. It was brilliantly done, not least of all because he never \nsaid he was instituting it; it just happened at his insistent and \nconsistent behest.\n  The last great matter we addressed together was the effort to \npostpone, so as not to reject, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. He \nwas deeply involved with that. It is perhaps not easily accessible to \nothers now that he was of a generation--I suppose I was of that \ngeneration--who can very arguably be said to owe their lives to the \natom bomb. He was with marines already in the Solomon Islands. I was in \nthe Navy; I would soon be on a landing craft. We were all headed for \nHonshu. The war would go on but then stopped because of that terrible, \ndifficult, necessary decision President Truman made.\n  It was the most natural thing in the world for someone such as John \nChafee to spend the rest of his life, in effect, trying to ensure that \nsuch a terrible act never was repeated. He was deeply attached to \nmaintaining the essentials of the antiballistic missile program and \nbelieved that a rejection of the test ban treaty would then lead to our \ninsisting on that. He did not prevail, but he was witnessed, as he was \nall of his life, as a man of valor, a man of courage, and such a decent \nman.\n  He was chairman of the Republican Conference. Around 1990, I believe, \nhe was challenged, and openly--legitimately, in politics of our type--\nas too\n\n[[Page S13148]]\n\nliberal. It was a very close contest, decided by a single vote. Another \ncolleague of his from that side of the aisle, of course, thought the \nhonorable thing to do was to tell him in advance that he would be \nvoting against Senator Chafee's role as party conference chairman and \ncame over to John on the floor and told him this. It was, in effect, \ndevastating news. John's reaction was, ``Oh, dear.'' Never a word of \nacrimony. He told me about it smiling the next day. He was hurting a \nbit, but he smiled even then.\n  He was so wide in his concerns and his empathy and his sympathy. I \ncan only say all of us deal with special interests; we all have special \ninterests. But the only one I can identify with him was the Rhode \nIsland Jewelry Manufacturers. Never did a trade bill pass through our \ncommittee without a little essay by him on the subject of the necessity \nto protect this important sector of the American economy; and he did, \nand without difficulty. If he wanted it, we wanted him to have it.\n\n  I close with the lines of W.B. Yeats, a wonderful poem, ``The \nMunicipal Gallery Revisited,'' which concludes:\n\n     Think where man's glory most begins and ends.\n     And say my glory was I had such friends.\n\n  We, all of us, share in that as we contemplate our loss, a loss which \nis more than made up by the great glory of his friendship. Liz and I \nsend our deepest love to Ginny and to his family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, a life lived richly is the phrase that \ncomes to my mind as I think of John Chafee: A life lived richly, not of \nthe material things of this world but in the magnificent service he \nprovided from the time before he was old enough to vote until his dying \nday; a life lived richly in the love and honor and respect of those who \nknew him best, many of whom are Members of this Senate, but love and \nhonor and respect that came from his fellow citizens of Rhode Island \nand from men and women all across the United States of America.\n  I knew John Chafee for only 18 years. The word ``only'' and the \nphrase ``18 years'' do not generally go together, but even that \nrelatively extended period of 18 years was only a modest fraction of \nthe life of service performed by John Chafee. As a U.S. Marine before \nhis 21st birthday, and through many battles and two wars, as Governor \nof the State of Rhode Island, as Secretary of the Navy, and for almost \n23 years as a Member of this body, John Chafee dedicated his life and \nhis entire career to the people whom he represented in the State of \nRhode Island and, beyond that, to the grand concept that is the United \nStates of America.\n  Unlike my eloquent colleague from New York who just spoke, I only \nserved on a committee of this body with John Chafee for a relatively \nshort 2 years. But I do remember vividly the work of several years in \nhis office here in the Capitol in what seemed at the beginning almost a \nforlorn hope to balance the budget of the United States and to put this \nNation and its economy on the sound footing that has been so evident in \nour economic successes over the course of the last few years.\n  As was the case with his work on the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works, that effort was a bipartisan effort, with most of its \ntime being spent with the cochairmanship of the Senator from Louisiana, \nMr. Breaux. It was not at first successful, but it was the immediate \nparent of the success that this body, the entire Congress, and the \nPresident of the United States had in 1997 with a result that was \ngreater than the expectations of any of those who began that lonely \nstruggle or who were in on its completion. It might accurately have \nbeen said that success would not have taken place as dramatically or as \nsoon without the dedicated efforts of John Chafee.\n  On a lesser but still significant level because, of course, each one \nof us does represent a particular constituency, I can remember vividly \nthe way in which John Chafee, a Senator from Rhode Island, would make \nrequests of me in connection with each of the year's Interior \nappropriations bills I have managed, softly and diffidently, but with a \npersuasive manner and reasoning and a persistence that lasted until the \nconclusion itself--a conclusion that, if my memory serves me correctly, \nwas always favorable to Rhode Island and to the specific requests John \nChafee made, partly on the merits of the case and partly because of the \nrespect and love I held for John Chafee, along with all of my \ncolleagues.\n  He did love his small State. He cared deeply about its people and \ncarried the burden and responsibility of representing them both lightly \nand well. John Chafee, not surprisingly for a former member of the U.S. \nMarines with many battles and much conflict under the flag of his \ncountry in his early life, was not afraid to be alone even in this body \nand even in contentious times when he believed, as he often did, that \nhis position was the right one. Equally, he was not afraid to join with \nothers to test his ideas against the ideas of others and to reach a \nconclusion that could command the respect and the votes of a majority \nof this body.\n  He was a highly successful Member of the Senate, and so we will miss \nhim, even though, in a way, some can envy a man who, continuously from \nthe age of 18 or 19 until his dying day, was permitted to serve his \ncountry in so many ways and in so vital a fashion.\n  Now we are constrained to bid him farewell. But he goes with our \nadmiration, our respect, and our prayers.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I will speak briefly with respect to the passing of our \ndear colleague, John Chafee. He was a great friend to all Members, \nthose who had the chance to work with him closely across the board from \none side of the Chamber to the other. I think all felt the highest \ndegree of respect and admiration for him. Today I want to express to \nhis family my deepest condolences and those of my family.\n  A lot of great things have already been said about John Chafee's \nremarkable career both in public service and in service of his country, \nhis academic achievements, as well as his professional achievements. I \nwill have many memories of him. Probably one that will be the most \nvivid in a certain way is something I took note of after reading a book \nabout the Korean war which talked about John Chafee. The book made \nreference to his very distinguishable way of walking, the sort of \ncommanding stride with which he moved among the troops. After I read \nthat, I started noticing the way he walked from one building to another \nof the Senate, and I noticed the same absolutely distinguishable stride \nwith which he carried himself; somebody who was in command, somebody \nwho moved purposefully forward to meetings, to the floor of the Senate, \nto attain the objectives which he had for his State and his country.\n  Certainly, anyone who had the chance to work with him, whether in the \ncontext of the issues that came before the Finance Committee or the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, knows he brought to the \nSenate a great sense of dedication, commitment, integrity, and \nprinciple. We worked together quite a bit last go-round on the highway \ntransportation bill. I remember on numerous occasions appearing in his \noffice to make the plea for my State of Michigan. While he didn't have \nthe ability to provide each and every Member with everything we wanted, \nhe certainly put the time in to make sure he did the best for all of us \nin our States. That was his way of addressing all the things that came \nbefore him.\n  It will be hard to move forward without him because we will all miss \nhim, and I think as a collective chamber we will miss his leadership.\n  As I said to his family and those close to him, I offer both my \ncondolences but, at the same time, I express how much admiration I had \nfor him and how I hope all Members can draw from our experiences with \nSenator Chafee some insights into how to make sure we conduct ourselves \nas Senators, with integrity and with the willingness and ability to \nwork together to achieve great things. He certainly achieved many great \nthings in his career, and I hope other Members can come close in our \ncareers to achieving what he did.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, when I first came to this body in the \nCongress that convened in January of 1981, I was the 100th Senator. \nThere is no question about that. There is a certain degree of humility \nassociated with that prized and coveted position.\n  As a consequence of the reality that we came in with 16 other \nRepublican\n\n[[Page S13149]]\n\nSenators in what was somewhat of a revolution associated with President \nReagan, some suggested we came in on his coattails. Those of us who \nprided ourselves on our accomplishment were not ready to attribute \ntotally that responsibility to President Reagan, but nonetheless we \nwere fortunate to be here.\n  In the determination of how this place works, as a freshman Senator, \none quickly has an opportunity to participate in the selection of \ncommittees. Being the 100th Senator, you take what is left and what you \nget. I found myself having perhaps made the choice, but clearly with \nthe realization that while my first choice was the Finance Committee, \nmy realistic choice was the Environment and Public Works Committee. At \nthat time, Senator Chafee had taken over the chairmanship of that.\n  One of the interesting reflections is not too many of the \nRepublicans, in spite of their seniority, knew what chairmanships were \nall about because it had been a long dry spell in the Senate --several \ndecades.\n  In any event, I had an opportunity to serve with the late Senator \nJohn Chafee. As a junior member of that committee, I was quickly \nimmersed in the technical aspects of such issues as emissions, \nNOX, CO2, clean water, clean air, the role of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and a host of other eventualities that \nsuggested that clearly there was an institutional memory associated \nwith many of these issues. I found, much to my relief, that the late \nSenator Chafee was a patient, caring, and intensely dedicated Member of \nthis body. I know many Members have discussed his military role, his \nindividual and personal sacrifice on behalf of our Nation in serving. \nHaving dedicated his life to public service, I think it is a reflection \nof the type of American and unique Senator he was.\n  During that time on his committee, I was privileged to participate in \nsignificant events that were charged to his responsibility. Looking \nback on those instances, they were really opportunities to get to know \nand understand and appreciate the contribution Senator John Chafee made \nto the Senate.\n  Later, I had an opportunity to serve with him on the Republican \nhealth care task force. Even later, finally, after some 14 years in \nthis body, I did get my first choice of committees, the Senate Finance \nCommittee. John Chafee was on that committee as a senior member. John \ntook over an obligation to coordinate the Republican health task force. \nJohn studied in depth the details of health care. He probably knew them \nbetter than anyone in this body. He cared very deeply about bettering \nthe lives of those he met. I remember the morning meetings when he went \ninto great depth on the health care issue and how we could meet our \nobligations to provide reasonable health care for the Nation. It was a \ndisputed area of concern relative to a certain amount of partisanship, \nwhich occasionally raises its head around here. Nevertheless, John was \nabove that; he was dedicated and committed to trying to accomplish \nsomething meaningful in that area. He never gave up, as he didn't on \nmany of the issues about which he cared so deeply.\n  So as we look at John's desk and the flowers that adorn it, it is \nwith fond memories that we think of a fine American and an outstanding \nSenator with whom we were privileged to serve for a number of years--in \nmy own case, for some 19 years. I treasure that time with John Chafee. \nI shall miss his contribution to this body. We had certain \ndisagreements from time to time on issues, as Senators do in this body, \nbut I always respected where he stood. I always knew where he was \ncoming from. He was a gentleman whose word was his bond.\n  Coincidentally, recently I made a telephone call to a friend who has \nbeen ill for some time. He was known to many in this body. The \ngentlemen's name is Duffy Wall. He was a friend to many Members of this \nbody. Duffy Wall passed away yesterday, as well, at about 4:15 in the \nmorning. I talked to his wife Sharon, who was kind enough to phone me \nand advise me that Duffy had passed on. It was kind of memorable that, \nin her reflection, she said, ``You know, Frank, Duffy was a great \nfriend of John Chafee's.'' She believed that Duffy wanted to go with \nSenator Chafee. So wherever the two are today, obviously, they have \naffection and great friendship. As Senators, we suffer the loss of our \ndear friend John Chafee. I thought it fitting to add that there was \nanother dear friend of ours and John Chafee's who also passed away \nyesterday morning.\n  Mr. President, I extend to Mrs. Chafee and her family my sincere \nsympathy. I also extend to Sharon and the Wall family our sympathy for \nthe loss of Duffy Wall.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I offer my condolences to Ginny and the \nentire Chafee family for the loss of her husband, their father, and our \nfriend, John Chafee.\n  When a great person leaves us, we know we can't replace him and we \nknow have suffered the loss in a very personal way. All of us feel that \nloss with John Chafee. It is not just the loss of a Senator, it is \nsomeone now who is missing in our lives, and we have to deal with that \nin the way human beings have to deal with losses of this kind. Also, \nwhen a great man leaves us, when great people leave us, oftentimes they \nwill put on the television screen the date of birth and the date of \npassing, and they did that in this case with John Chafee: 1922-1999. He \nwas 77 remarkable years, Mr. President.\n  I had a conference in Omaha with young people recently on the \nquestion of how to save money. They were juniors and seniors. I have \ndone this for 2 or 3 years in a row. Warren Buffett, a rather wealthy \nman, was our keynote speaker. He talked for a couple of minutes, and \nthen he took questions. Two years ago, a young person said to him, \n``Mr. Buffett, I mean no disrespect, but aren't most wealthy people \njerks?'' Warren answered, ``No, that is not my experience. Wealth just \nallows you to be a little more of what you already were. If you start \noff a jerk and become wealthy, you can be a real big jerk and hire \nlawyers for $1,000 an hour and sue all your friends. On the contrary, \nif you start off a good person and you acquire wealth, you can be a \nreally good person.''\n  That was John Chafee. John was born into wealth and privilege. At the \nage of 19, after the United States was drawn into World War II after \nbeing attacked by Japan, he volunteered, but not for any special duty; \nhe was an enlisted man in the U.S. Marine Corps. Among other places, he \nhad to fight in one of the bloodiest battles in Guadalcanal. Then he \nwent back to college, and the Korean conflict broke out, and there was \nno question that had he chosen to, he could have figured out a way not \nto go. But he went in this time as an officer commanding a rifle \ncompany.\n  I have had many occasions where I would say, ``I was so impressed, \nJohn, by what you did''; and, of course, all of us who knew him would \nknow he would blush and change the subject. He did not want praise. He \ndidn't want people to think he was anything special. He did this all as \na consequence of the way he was. He didn't think he deserved any \nspecial attention at all.\n  Again, taking my Warren Buffett experience, in talking to the young \npeople, he didn't talk about wealth. He said: You are born with three \nthings--intelligence, endurance, and the opportunity to build \nintegrity. You have to decide how much intelligence and endurance you \nare going to use. You build integrity every single day with the choices \nyou make. Sometimes you make good choices, and sometimes they are bad.\n  I would scratch my head if somebody asked me to give them a choice \nJohn Chafee made that was bad, which produced inferior integrity. And I \ndon't just mean the issues. I am impressed by what he did on the \nenvironment. He believed we needed to leave the world better than we \nfound it. He knew we had to think beyond our lifetimes in order to do \nthat. I was impressed by his courage on public safety. I never have and \nnever would go as far as he did on gun control, but it took guts to do \nthat. All of us who watched him do that had to admire that.\n  On health, there were always other people--the disabled and people \nwho were born with less than he was born with. He didn't just fight \nwith them, and he knew it wasn't for political reasons. He cared about \nthe lives of other people. So I was impressed with what he did on all \nthe issues. But the thing\n\n[[Page S13150]]\n\nthat moved me the most and causes me to say that I will miss this man \nand I will note his absence is that I consider what the world is like \nwithout him, and I think it is less without him. So it was considerably \nmore as a consequence of the choice he made to be kind, the choice he \nmade to be considerate, the choice he made to respect other people. \nThat is a choice we all have to make. Are you going to be kind? You are \nnot born with an attitude of kindness. You have to choose it. You have \nto choose to be considerate and respectful.\n\n  Again, I have been here for 10 years. I can't think of a single \nmoment even when he was provoked that John Chafee ever said an unkind \nword about anybody. He would disagree. He would argue. I never heard \nhim say an unkind word. That was a choice he made. It didn't come as a \nresult of him being a man or a human being. It was a choice and a \ndecision that he made. It was old school values, in my opinion.\n  As a consequence of that, I find myself wondering what life is going \nto be like without John Chafee.\n  I hope his wife and family understand what a big impact he made. John \ncaused not just improvement in our laws, improvement of our country, \nand improvement of our world but improvement of our values.\n  For those of us who fall short of the mark that John Chafee laid down \nwith his behavior, there is an ideal of a goal that he set for \nourselves.\n  I hope as we debate and make decisions about how we are going to \ntreat one another that we remember the way John Chafee treated us. I \nthink if we remember that, it is likely that we will treat not just one \nanother better but as a consequence of that treatment this will be a \nbetter place, and the country will be a better place, and the world \nwill be a better place as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to join so many of my \ncolleagues in making a few remarks about our colleague, Senator John \nChafee.\n  As we all know, many of us have risen over the last 2 days to speak \nof our memories of Senator Chafee and the friendships we have developed \nwith him over the years. Because of my short time in the Senate, my \nexperiences with Senator Chafee are more limited, but I have had ample \ntime to observe Senator Chafee as the good, kind, and honorable man so \nmany of my colleagues have spoken about in the last couple of days.\n  I can recall when I first came to the Senate and we were organizing. \nI wondered what my committee assignments would be. John Chafee, knowing \nof the interest of Idaho in natural resource issues, came to me and \nsaid I ought to try to get on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee which he chaired. I said: I would love to work with you on \nthat committee. When the appropriate opportunity to make a selection \ncame along, I ultimately did, make that choice and had the chance to \nwork with Senator Chafee.\n  John Chafee represented what is good about American politics. Senator \nChafee was a man of the highest principles and utmost integrity. The \nWashington Post referred to him as ``a gentle but stubborn champion.'' \nThat is exactly right.\n  I was remarking to one of our colleagues as we walked back from the \nCapitol Building after a matter of business earlier today that John was \nalways friendly and helpful and was such a kind man, but he was also a \nfirm man in championing the principles he advocated. I believe that \ndescription of him, ``a gentle but stubborn champion,'' is a very apt \nway to describe him.\n  John Chafee was deeply committed to the issues he undertook to fight \nfor, and, at the same time, he was always a gentleman and a statesman. \nSenator Chafee was instantaneously a likable person. Part of his charm \nwas he was entirely unassuming and friendly.\n  Perhaps what made his demeanor more unique was he had enjoyed such an \nimpressive career. Senator Chafee clearly worked hard to make a \ndifference throughout his entire life. His career accomplishments were \nextraordinary, but then he was an extraordinary man. These things have \nalready been said, but I want to repeat them.\n  He served in World War II at Guadalcanal and Korea. He was a graduate \nof Yale University and Harvard Law School and served in the Rhode \nIsland House of Representatives and as Governor of Rhode Island. In \n1969, he was appointed Secretary of the Navy and served in that post \nfor 3\\1/2\\ years during one of the most critical times in our history.\n  Senator Chafee's life's work has been furthering the issues he \nbelieved would make America a better place. His commitment to the \nissues and his good nature are what I will miss the most.\n  I knew if I needed to talk with someone who would have a unique and \nheartfelt perspective on an issue we were debating, all I had to do was \nsit down at his desk, where there are now flowers, and talk to John. He \nwould have thought through the issue carefully and whatever his \nposition on it, he would have a good, balanced, thoughtful reason for \nit.\n  I particularly want to share some of the personal experiences I have \nhad with him.\n  Being from a different part of the country--I come from the West and \nJohn comes from the Northeast--it is no secret those of us from \ndifferent parts of the country often approach environmental issues and \nsome of the natural resource issues in a different way, and that was \ntrue about John and me on some of the issues. We found a lot of common \nground where we worked together, and we found those issues where we \nwere different.\n  What was always remarkable to me is that he was always willing to \nwork with me to try to understand my point of view and to see if the \nissues and concerns of the people I represent in Idaho could be squared \nwith the issues and the concerns of the people he represented in Rhode \nIsland, and if the interests of the Nation could be brought together in \na solution that found common ground, that was one of his strengths.\n  I note he always engaged the people in our hearings in a friendly \nfashion that made them feel at home and at ease. He took a direct \ninterest in legislation and in each committee member's personal \ninterest in legislation which was important to them.\n  He personally worked closely with me on legislation on which we found \nwe could develop common ground. It is because he chose to make his life \none of service that so many people today stand in honor of him. America \ntruly lost one of our great leaders. I believe he stands as a \ntremendous example to all of us of the kind of difference you can make \nif you are willing to put your life into the service of the people of \nthis country.\n  John Chafee truly did that. On behalf of all of us in America, I say \nthank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13150-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13150-S13151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT FOR ALL ACT\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise to express my gratitude and my \nappreciation to the House of Representatives for an action it took last \nweek, under the leadership of Congressman Goodling, chairman of the \nHouse committee dealing with education. The House has now passed the \nAcademic Achievement For All Act, or Straight A's, a concept and a \ncrusade in which Mr. Goodling and I have joined as sponsors in our \nrespective Houses of Congress. It is so dramatic a reform, so dramatic \nan expression of understanding on the part of the majority of the \nMembers of the House of Representatives, that those who provide \neducational services for our children--their teachers and principals \nand superintendents and elected school board members, not to mention \ntheir parents--ought to be empowered to use the money they receive from \nthe Federal Government for that education in a way they deem best, \ngiven the circumstances of each child and of each of the 17,000 school \ndistricts in the United States.\n  That philosophy is very much at variance with the standard philosophy \nof Acts of Congress, which increasingly over the years have told our \nschools in detail what they must teach, how they must teach it, and how \nthey must account for it if they are to receive a modest percentage of \ntheir budgets that Congress itself supplies to them.\n  In order to pass Straight A's through the House of Representatives, \nMr. Goodling and his supporters had to scale it back to a 10-State \nexperiment.\n  Even at that level, I believe it will be a dramatic reform, not \nsimply because it provides this trust in our local educators and \nparents and school board\n\n[[Page S13151]]\n\nmembers, but because it carries with it a requirement for \naccountability that is a real bottom line requirement; that is to say, \nin order to take advantage of Straight A's, a State must have a system \nof determining, through some type of examination or a test, whether or \nnot it is actually improving the educational achievement of the \nchildren under its care. It is only results that count in Straight A's \nand not how you fill out the forms or what the auditors say you have \ndone with the money.\n  I believe we in the Senate will take up Straight A's in that form, or \nin some similar form, sometime during the winter or very early spring \nof the year 2000 when we deal with the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. But I am delighted that we have made such progress \nalready in the House of Representatives.\n  Simply to ratify some of my remarks, I want to share with my \ncolleagues comments that we have received from across the country about \nthis dramatic change in Federal education policy:\n\n       I am pleased to offer my support to the Academic \n     Achievement for All Act. This proposal, if enacted into law, \n     would serve to complement the Commonwealth of Virginia's \n     nationally-acclaimed national education reforms.\n\n  Governor James Gilmore of Virginia.\n\n       A new relationship between the states and Washington, as \n     reflected in Straight A's, can refocus federal policies and \n     funds on increasing student achievement.\n\n  Governor Jeb Bush of Florida.\n\n       Straight A's would allow us to use federal funds to \n     implement our goals while assuring taxpayers that every \n     dollar spent on education is a dollar spent to boost \n     children's learning.\n\n  Governor John Engler of Michigan.\n\n       I'm not a Democrat or a Republican. I'm a superintendent. \n     And what Gorton is trying to do would be the best for our \n     kids.\n\n  Superintendent Joseph Olchefske, Seattle public schools.\n\n       The Straight A's Act will allow those closest to the action \n     to make decisions about education in their own local school \n     district.\n\n  Robert Warnecke, Washington State Retired Teachers Association.\n\n       Senator Gorton's Straight A's proposals is well-conceived \n     with great flexibility for states and districts. It would \n     help to focus federal resources where they are most needed.\n\n  Janet Barry, Issaquah Superintendent and 1996 National Superintendent \nof the Year.\n\n       I look forward to the debate in the Senate on these changes \n     with particular delight because the House of Representatives' \n     majority has already said that this is the direction in which \n     we ought to lead the country.\n\n  (The remarks of Mr. Crapo pertaining to the introduction of S. 1795 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CRAPO.

So I hope we will be able to reach some kind \nof an agreement soon.\n  I have a little bit more I want to say about the legislation before \nwe adjourn, but I thank the Senator from Nevada for his expression of a \ncontinuing interest to work together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13151-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13151-S13156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE MILLENNIUM DIGITAL COMMERCE ACT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, we originally introduced this \nlegislation, which is entitled ``The Millennium Digital Commerce Act'' \non March 25. I introduced it with Senators Wyden, McCain, and Burns.\n  The Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing on the legislation May \n27. Subsequently, the legislation passed unanimously by the Senate \nCommerce Committee on June 23.\n  President Clinton's administration indicated a statement of support. \nThat was issued on August 4.\n  I think that sequence of events suggest that there is a strong degree \nof support for this type of legislation.\n  The same week the President expressed his support, we attempted to \npass the bill in the Senate by unanimous consent. That was just before \nthe August recess.\n  Concerns were raised by two Members of the Senate about the possible \nimpact of this bill on consumer protection.\n  Since that time, we have worked to try to incorporate some of the \nchanges and some of those considerations into the legislation to \naddress consumer protection concerns while still providing the \ntremendous benefit of electronic signatures to the public which was \nintended by the legislation. I believe the substitute which we would \npropose to offer does just that.\n\n  As was the case with the legislation which passed the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, the substitute will promote electronic commerce by providing \na consistent framework for electronic signatures in transactions across \nall 50 States.\n  That framework is simply a guarantee of legal standing in each of \nthose States. Such a guarantee will provide the certainty which today \nis lacking and will encourage the development and the use of electronic \nsignature technology by both businesses and consumers.\n  The legislation addresses the concerns raised by the use of \nelectronic records and electronic transactions. It will allow people to \nsecure loans on line for the purchase of a car, home repair, or even a \nnew mortgage by giving both companies and consumers the legal certainty \nthey need.\n  However, the bill now includes safeguards to guarantee that \nelectronic records will be provided in a form that accurately reflects \nthe original transaction and which can be reproduced later. These \nsafeguards are taken directly from the completed version of the \nElectronic Transactions Act, the ETA.\n  This legislation also recognizes that there are some areas of State \nlaw which should not be preempted. These are specifically spelled out \nand excluded in this bill. They include but are not limited to wills, \ncodicils, matters of family law, and documents of title.\n  As almost anyone in this country knows who has paid the slightest \ndegree of attention to developments in the areas of sales, or economy, \nor the markets, or watches their television and follows the commercials \nto the slightest degree, we are entering an age in which electronic \ncommerce is rapidly serving as a substitute for traditional means of \ncommercial activity.\n\n[[Page S13152]]\n\n  Many individuals and companies, as well as others who wish to engage \nin electronic commerce and other electronic exchanges, are suffering \nbecause there is no uniform supporting legal infrastructure in the \nUnited States which could provide legal certainty for electronic \nagreements.\n  The problem is simple. We have about 42 States that have adopted \ntheir own basic version of how to authenticate documents that are \nentered into through electronic transmission. They are all different. \nBecause of those differences, the potential exists for transactions and \ncontracts entered into online through electronic commerce to be \nchallenged in court because the laws of one State might be different \nfrom the laws in another. We wish to end that problem.\n  The States are moving as fast as they can to address it through a \nuniform act which has been developed by the States. And slowly but \nsurely we believe that act will be adopted by State legislatures and \nsigned into law by Governors. But until the States get to that point, \nwe need an interim solution so that electronic commerce can continue to \nexpand and people can continue to engage in electronic commercial \nactivity.\n  The current and prospective patchwork of law and regulation cannot \nsupport, and in some cases is incompatible with, the e-commerce \nmarket's demanding requirements that are flowing from the interstate \nand international nature of Internet commerce.\n  The uncertainty and certainly the existence of all these different \nState laws provides a lot of uncertainty, and the resulting risks that \nstem from that harm America's businesses and consumers because it puts \na limit on the amount of commercial activity that is capable of being \nhandled in this fashion.\n  I think it further hinders the broad deployment of many innovative \nproducts and services by American companies, and, of course, in turn \nlimits the choices for those who are prospective consumers, whether it \nis in business-to-business transactions, or business-to-consumer \ntransactions.\n  The point is this legislation cannot continue to wait. We have tried \non several occasions already to bring it to the floor. We tried to pass \nit through unanimous consent agreements. We have tried to negotiate. So \nfar we have been unsuccessful.\n  The concepts and the goals behind this move toward electronic \ncommerce and authentication are not a subject of controversy. Obsolete \nstatutes that exist in State law should not be permitted to bar \ninnovation and economic growth.\n  This is no longer a States rights issue because we are dealing with \notherwise enforceable contracts involving interstate commerce. Thus, \npassing legislation that contains crucial provisions providing \ninterstate commerce certainty for electronic agreements, in my \njudgment, and I believe in the judgment of a lot of others, should be a \ntop priority for the Congress before leaving this year.\n  The legislation which we are talking about has been endorsed by \nnumerous organizations and companies who are trying to expand e-\ncommerce in our country.\n  They are: America Online, American Bankers Association, American \nCouncil of Life Insurance, American Electronics Association, American \nFinancial Services Association, American Insurance Association, \nBusiness Software Alliance, Charles Schwab, Chase Manhattan Bank, \nCiticorp, Coalition of Service Industries, Consumer Bankers \nAssociation, Consumer Mortgage Coalition, Digital Signature Trust Co., \nDLJ Direct, Electronic Check Clearing House, Electronic Industries \nAlliance, Equifax, Fidelity, and Ford Motor.\n\n  Also, the Financial Services Roundtable, Gateway2000, General \nElectric Company, GTE, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Information Technology \nAssociation of America, Information Technology Industry Council, Intel, \nInternational Biometric Industry Association, Internet Consumers \nOrganization, Intuit, Investment Company Institute (ICI), Jackson \nNational Life, Keybank, Microsoft, National Association of \nManufacturers, National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, \nNational Retail Federation, NCR Corporation, New York Clearing House \nAssociation L.L.C., PenOp Inc., Securities Industry Association, \nTelecommunications Industry Association, U.S. Bancorp, U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, Wachovia Corporation, Zions First National Bank, and Zurich \nFinancial Services Group.\n  The fact that the legislation passed the Commerce Committee \nunanimously, the fact the President has endorsed it, should be a signal \nto everybody that this is legislation that does have the kind of \nbipartisan backing that should allow it to move fairly quickly through \nthe Senate. Yet it is not. It has been since June that we have tried to \ndo this. We have yet to have a successful completion of our efforts.\n  There are many issues involved in electronic authentication that can \nwait for the market to mature for resolution. Contractual certainty \ncannot. The absence of certainty with respect to electronic \nauthentication contracts creates a huge impediment to the development \nof e-commerce both here and internationally.\n  Before I finish on this issue, I am still very much interested in \nworking with people who have objections. I hope we can work something \nout in the next day or two, but I do think we need action this year. If \nwe can't work something out in the next day or two, it will certainly \nbe my intention to ask the majority leader to see if we can't file a \ncloture motion on a motion to proceed to this legislation so we can \nwork it out. It seems to me if people have substantive differences we \nought to be able to enter into a consent agreement to afford the \nopportunity for a limited number of amendments on this legislation so \nthose differences can be worked out on the floor. To hold the bill up \nand prevent proceeding to the bill jeopardizes our ability to get \nanything done this year. I appeal to those who raised objections to \nwork with Members in the next day or two to find an amicable as well as \nhopefully a fairly quick process by which we can bring the legislation \nthrough the Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, along with many of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, I have long been an advocate of legislation to \nenable and encourage the expansion of electronic commerce, and to \npromote public confidence in its integrity and reliability. In that \nbipartisan spirit, many of us worked together in the last Congress to \npass the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, which established a \nframework for the federal government's use of electronic forms and \nsignatures. I believe that the same spirit, and the same process of \nlistening to the people involved and the experts on the issue, and of \nreasoned deliberation, could yield an electronic signatures and \nelectronic contracting bill that would benefit our entire national \neconomy.\n  Sadly, however, the bill before us today is not the product of such a \nprocess, and it is not such a bill. Where the Government Paperwork \nElimination Act was an object lesson in bipartisanship, the bill before \nus today is an object lesson in special interest politics.\n  This bill has a history. If we listen to that history, we may hear \nsome of the voices that have been silenced in the rush to bring it to \nthe floor. So let me recount it briefly.\n  On May 27, the Commerce Committee held hearings on Senator Abraham's \noriginal S. 761. Remarkably, for a bill that proscribed rules for \nbusiness-to-consumer transactions as well as business-to-business \ntransactions, neither the Federal Trade Commission, nor state consumer \nprotection authorities, nor any consumer advocates, were invited to \ntestify at those hearings. Sometimes it seems that we forget that the \npurpose of commerce is to provide goods and services for consumers.\n  In June, neglecting the concerns of silent consumers, the Commerce \nCommittee reported a bill of quite unprecedentedly sweeping preemptive \neffect. The Commerce-passed bill would have overridden untold numbers \nof federal, state and local laws that require contracts, signatures and \nother documents to be in traditional written form.\n  I was concerned that the Commerce-passed bill was federal preemption \nbeyond need, to the detriment of American consumers. For example, the \nbill would have enabled businesses to use their superior bargaining \npower to compel or confuse consumers into waiving their rights to \ninsist on paper disclosures and communications, even\n\n[[Page S13153]]\n\nwhen they do not have the technological capacity to receive, retain, \nand print electronic records.\n  On August 10, I asked the FTC whether S. 761 as reported by the \nCommerce Committee could undermine consumer protections in state and \nfederal law, and how the bill might be improved. The FTC responded by \nletter dated September 3 that, while it shared the broad goals of S. \n761, the bill's potential application to consumer transactions raised \nquestions that needed to be addressed:\n\n       For instance, would the bill preempt numerous state \n     consumer protection laws? Would borrowers be bound by a \n     contract requiring that they receive delinquency or \n     foreclosure notices by electronic mail, even if they did not \n     own a computer? Would consumers who had agreed to receive \n     electronic communications be entitled to revert to paper \n     communications if their computer breaks or becomes obsolete? \n     Would consumers disputing an electronic signature have to \n     hire an encryption expert to rebut a claim that they had \n     `signed' an agreement when, in fact, they had not? What \n     evidentiary value would an electronic agreement have if it \n     could easily be altered electronically?\n\n  The FTC concluded that further clarification was needed to provide \nprotection for consumers while allowing business-to-business commerce \nto proceed unimpeded.\n  Consumer and privacy advocates, consumer lawyers and law professors \nechoed the FTC's views. Among the many national organizations opposed \nto the bill: Consumer Union, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, National Consumer Law Center, National Association of Consumer \nAgency Administrators, National Consumers League, National Center on \nPoverty Law, National Legal Aid and Defenders Association, National \nSenior Citizens Law Center, Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, United Auto \nWorkers, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and Utility Consumers \nAction Network. They wrote to the Senate on September 9, that, while \nconsumers can potentially benefit from receiving information \nelectronically, ``the broad-brush approach of S. 761 . . . would \neviscerate important consumer protections in state and federal law, as \nwell as interfere with a state's rights to protect its own consumers \nwithout imposing any protections against misuse, mistake, or fraud.''\n  The Commerce Department also came to oppose S. 761 as reported by the \nCommerce Committee, because of its spillover effect on existing \nconsumer protection and regulatory standards. In a letter this month to \nthe Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, the Commerce Department \nnoted its concern that enactment of S. 761 was desired by some \nprecisely because of this spillover effect.\n  Faced with a bill that proclaimed an objective that I agreed with, \nbut also presented serious dangers for consumers, I committed to \nworking with Senator Abraham and others to rewrite S. 761 in a manner \nthat would benefit businesses and consumers alike. For many weeks, we \nstrove to do the work that the Commerce Committee had failed to do, \nmeeting with business and consumer representatives in order to make \nsure that we understood and fully addressed their concerns.\n  I was and still am proud of what this consultative process produced. \nThe Leahy-Abraham compromise bill satisfied the primary and valid goal \nof the business community, which was to ensure that contracts could not \nbe invalidated solely because they were in electronic form or because \nthey were signed electronically. The bill also promoted competition and \ninnovation by proscribing that regulations would not discriminate \nbetween reasonable authentication technologies. At the same time, the \nbill left in place essential safeguards protecting the nation's \nconsumers.\n  As of September 28, then, the prospects looked good for a bipartisan \ncompromise that furthered the interests of industry and consumers \nalike. The prospects looked even better two weeks later, when a \nbipartisan majority of the House Judiciary Committee adopted the Leahy-\nAbraham compromise bill as a substitute to the radically preemptive \nH.R. 1714.\n  That was the history of S. 761, until today. Senator Abraham is now \nseeking unanimous consent to pass a totally different bill, a bill that \nis more preemptive and potentially more harmful to consumers than the \nbill reported by the Commerce Committee in June. How did this reversal \nhappen? I as one of the architects of the compromise was not consulted. \nBut that is not what troubles me.\n  What troubles me is that, so far as I know, the FTC was not \nconsulted; the Commerce Department was not consulted, and consumer \ngroups were certainly not consulted. I do not know who was consulted, \nbut I do know that, whatever process created this new bill, it was not \na bipartisan process, it was not an open process, and it completely \nbypassed the Committee system.\n  What is in this mystery bill, which was unveiled less than 24 hours \nago, and which we are now asked to pass by unanimous consent? A very \nsmall part of this bill focuses, as did the Leahy-Abraham compromise, \non validating electronic contracts. A much larger part of the bill is \ndevoted to electronic records, which is broadly and vaguely defined in \nsuch a way as to encompass any text on any computer anywhere.\n  The bill provides that if any law, federal or state, requires a \nrecord to be in writing, an electronic record satisfies the law. I \nfrankly do not know what that means. My fear is it means that if a \npatient purchases medication from ``drugstore.com,'' the listing of \ndosage instructions and counter-indications on the ``drugstore.com'' \nweb site could be deemed to satisfy the FDA's safety labeling \nrequirements. To take another example, what happens if the homeowner \ncannot access an email from the bank threatening foreclosure because \nher computer is broken?\n  The bill also sweeps unduly broadly in its provisions on electronic \nsignatures. Under this bill, if any law, federal or state, requires a \nsignature, an electronic signature is deemed to satisfy that law. The \nterm ``electronic signature'' is defined to include any electronic \nsound, symbol or process used with intent to sign and associated with \nan electronic record. This captures everything from the most secure, \nencrypted, state-of-the-art authentication technology to my typing my \ninitials at the end of an email.\n  This one-size-fits-all legislative approach substitutes for the \nuniqueness and reliability of a human signature a wide range of \nunreliable and unauthenticable technologies, without providing any of \nthe protections that, say, credit card owners have. To take an old-\nfashioned example, where parents used to sign their children's \nhomework, this approach would suggest that the teacher should be \nsatisfied by the sight of the parent's initials attached to an email. \nThe ramifications are much more serious when we consider the prospect \nof children using insecure technologies to bind their parents to \nelectronic transactions that they cannot afford.\n  There are other problems with this bill as well. It has a new and \ncomplex provision regarding what it calls ``transferable records,'' in \neffect, electronic negotiable instruments. This provision has never \nbeen considered by any Committee of the House or Senate, or to my \nknowledge by any banking regulators. Maybe the sponsors of the bill are \nprepared to take us through it in detail on the floor today. If not, we \nwould be derelict in our duty if we brought into force a whole new \nlegal regime that we have neither scrutinized nor understood.\n  Then there is the issue of preemption. State laws include a large \nnumber--usually thousands--of references to signatures and writings. A \nrecent review of the Massachusetts General Laws uncovered over 4,500 \nsections dealing with or requiring a signature or writing, and I \nunderstand that this is typical among the states.\n  In some cases, it may be appropriate to reform such requirements to \nallow electronic means rather than paper and pen. In other cases, it \nmay be appropriate to maintain paper requirements or, if the law is to \nbe changed to allow electronic means, to tailor the law to maintain the \nlegislative intent, as for example in the case of consumer protection \nprovisions requiring conspicuous terms. But aside from a handful of \nspecific exclusions, the new S. 761 does not attempt to differentiate \namong state laws, nor does it concern itself with the reasons why state \nlegislatures required a signature or writing in the first place; \nrather, S. 761 simply wipes these thousands of state laws off the \nbooks.\n\n[[Page S13154]]\n\n  We have heard a lot of late about the integrity of state law. We have \nheard that providing federal protections for battered women would \nunduly intrude on the states' authority. We have heard that allowing \nfederal authorities to prosecute hate crimes would violate state \nsovereignty. It is interesting to note that the principal sponsor of \nthis bill is also a cosponsor of S. 1214, the Federalism Accountability \nAct, which aims to protect the reserved powers of the states by \nimposing accountability for federal preemption of state and local laws.\n  I myself have always taken a more pragmatic line about the pros and \ncons of federal versus state law. But it is ironic to hear Members who \nspeak the rhetoric of states' rights on a regular basis to turn around \nand advocate a bill that would preempt thousands of state laws ranging \nfrom the common-law statute of frauds to California's recent enactment \nof a modified version of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.\n  Finally, one important provision that we included in the Leahy-\nAbraham compromise is missing from this bill--a provision that asked \nthe FTC to study the effectiveness of federal and state consumer \nprotection laws with respect to electronic transactions involving \nconsumers. That kind of scrutiny would be all the more valuable in the \ncontext of this new bill, which would radically change the legal \nlandscape by stripping consumers of a host of current legal \nprotections.\n  It is a disturbing testament to the power of special interests that \nthe reporting provision at the end of this bill one-sidedly demands a \nreport on what it calls ``barriers to electronic commerce,'' while \ncreating no provision for any investigation of the effects of its new \nregime on the nation's consumers.\n  I do not consent to passage of S. 761 in its current form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to address in \nthe Senate some matters that I believe are important as we approach the \nend of the fiscal year 2000 appropriations cycle.\n  Foremost among my concerns is the increasing role the Federal \nGovernment plays in our everyday lives in the area of education, and \nthe budgetary impact on our nation that results from assuming this and \nother roles more properly and constitutionally the responsibilities of \nState and local government.\n  I have witnessed during my first year in the Senate a number of \npositively amazing and enlightening experiences that have made me feel \nproud to be able to serve in this body and at this level of government. \nYet my pride is increasingly tempered by subjects which have caused me \ngreat concern.\n  You needn't be an experienced member of the Senate, a Governor, or \npublic official to appreciate the dire situation our nation faces with \nregard to the solvency of Social Security and Medicare. However, as \npublic officials and stewards of our Nation's finances, I believe that \nwe must be all the more vigilant of this reality since every decision \nwe make at this level in some way will impact whether we as a nation \nwill be able to honor the commitments we have made.\n  I wish to highlight some recent examples as to how we in the Senate \nhave, I believe, erroneously prioritized with respect to our federal \nresponsibilities.\n  For example: Mr. President without a doubt, improvement in the \nquality of education is a top concern for parents, teachers, and \nemployers across the country--in fact, improvement in the quality of \neducation ought to be our number one priority as a nation.\n  As with all issues, when discussing education we must ask two key \nquestions: 1. What level of government is responsible? 2. How are we \ngoing to pay for it?\n  Since the introduction of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 by President Johnson, the Federal Government has gradually been \nincreasing it's involvement in education.\n  Rather than the role of a very junior partner in education reform, \nthe President has offered a number of initiatives throughout his term \nthat would substitute the U.S. Department of Education for most local \nschool boards.\n  Mr. President, we recently spent hours and hours of debate on the \nsubject of education in the context of the fiscal year 2000 Labor, HHS, \nand Education Appropriations Bill.\n  We allocated $2.3 billion more on education in this year's Senate \nbill compared to fiscal year 99, a more than 6% increase at a time when \nwe have a problem balancing the budget.\n  Yet, the primary responsibility for our nation's education doesn't \nand shouldn't reside in Washington.\n  The text of the Constitution and the Federalist Papers indicate that \nresponsibility for our Nation's education resides with State and local \ngovernment--not the Federal government.\n  And indeed, States have upheld their constitutional responsibilities \nand have responded to our education needs by moving forward with \nappropriate reforms and spending.\n  State spending in education has increased dramatically in the past \ndecade.\n  According to a recent report by the National Governors' Association \nand the National Association of State Budget Officers entitled The \nFiscal Survey of States, elementary and secondary educational now \naccounts for slightly more than one-third of State general funds \nspending and about one-quarter of State spending from all funding \nsources.\n  The report goes on to say that:\n\n       . . . elementary and secondary educational has been the \n     largest state expenditure category, with almost $182 billion \n     in total expenditures in 1998. Its growth has outpaced the \n     growth in total state expenditures, with overall state \n     expenditures increasing by 6 percent between 1997 and 1998 \n     and elementary and secondary education spending increasingly \n     by 7.2 percent.\n\n  Governors' recommended budget for fiscal year 2000 include an average \nproposed increase for elementary and secondary education of 4.8 \npercent, and an average proposed 4.3 percent increase for post-\nsecondary education.\n  During my two terms as Governor of Ohio, we increased education \nspending from our General Revenue Fund by $2 billion, or 50.7 percent. \nThe amount of Basic Aid per pupil rose during my term from $2,636 to \n$3,851, or 46 percent--and a 56 percent increase in per-pupil \nexpenditures was measured for the poorest one-fourth of Ohio's schools.\n  In addition, under my administration, State funding support for \ncapital improvements for Ohio's primary and secondary school buildings \ntotaled more than $1.56 billion. We have wired every classroom for \nvoice, video, and data to the tune of $525 million.\n  We have increased accountability and established higher classroom \nstandards in Ohio and are implementing a more stringent set of academic \nrequirements that students must meet to earn a high school diploma.\n  In particular, State funding for Ohio's youngest children has grown \ntremendously. Child care spending alone increased by 681 percent under \nmy administration!\n  I am especially proud of what we have done in Ohio with the Head \nStart program. Ohio is now the national leader in State support for \nHead Start. When I began as Governor, State support for Head Start in \nfiscal year 1990 was $18.4 million. In fiscal year 1998, State spending \nfor Head Start had increased to $181.3 million, making Ohio the first \nState in the nation to provide a slot for every eligible 3- or 4-year-\nold child whose family desires quality early care and education \nservices.\n  The first question we should ask is: whose responsibility is \neducation--and mostly it is a State and local responsibility. The \nsecond question is: how are we going to pay for it?\n  A few weeks ago I spoke on the Senate floor in response to the \nPresident's announcement of a $115 billion surplus in fiscal year 1999, \nindicating that it would be wonderful if it were only true.\n  The President, however, neglected to mention during his remarks in \nthe Rose Garden that OMB also projected an on-budget deficit.\n  The only way the President could claim an on-budget surplus was by \nusing the employee payroll taxes coming into the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  During the recent debate over the Labor, HHS, Education \nappropriations bill, I heard a lot of talk in the Senate with respect \nto funding for schools, funding for 100,000 new teachers, funding for \nteacher training.\n  We spent a great deal of time discussing Federal class size \ninitiatives.\n\n[[Page S13155]]\n\nAdditional debate on the role of the Federal Government in providing \nfunding for school construction is likely to follow in future debates.\n  The reality is, however, that many States already have class size \ninitiatives in place--I know of at least 20 States that are doing this \nnow. Additionally, it is also reported that at least 28 States have \nalready proposed major initiatives in the area of school construction \nin their fiscal year 2000 budgets.\n  Governors of at least 13 states have already recommended using a \nportion of their tobacco settlement funds for education. Ohio itself \nwould commit $2.5 billion of their tobacco settlement funds for school \nfacilities under Governor Taft's plan.\n  You will recall that the States fought hard to keep the President \nfrom using any of the tobacco settlement funds recovered from State-\ninitiated lawsuits for his own priorities in his budget.\n  Instead, many States are exercising responsible leadership by \nrecommending these funds be used to honor a number of key state \npriorities and commitments such as education.\n  My point is this: The Federal Government is not the school board of \nAmerica. The Members of the U.S. Senate are not members of the school \nboard of the United States. The responsibility for education is at the \nstate and local level, where they are in much better financial shape \nthan the Federal Government, as I've illustrated.\n  We have a staggering $5.6 trillion national debt--a debt that has \ngrown some 1,300 percent in the last 30 years. I remind my colleagues, \nwith each passing day, we are spending $600 million a day just on \ninterest on the national debt--$600 million a day!\n  Most Americans do not realize that 14 percent of their tax dollar \ngoes to pay off the interest on the debt, 15 percent goes to national \ndefense, 17 percent goes for non-defense discretionary spending, and 54 \npercent goes for entitlement spending.\n  We are spending more on interest payments today than we spend on \nMedicare and Congress needs to spend more money on Medicare as we all \nknow--now!\n  When my wife and I got married in 1962, interest payments on the dept \nwere at 6 cents on the dollar. If we would have only had to pay 6 cents \non the dollar last year, Americans would have saved $131 billion \ndollars. We would have saved $229 billion if we didn't have to make any \ninterest payments on the debt last year!\n  Meanwhile, States have been both cutting taxes and running true \nsurpluses--a reality that does not exist here in Washington.\n  For fiscal year 1999, my last budget as Governor, Ohio had a budget \nsurplus of $976 million, and operates a rainy day fund containing $953 \nmillion--up from 14 cents in 1992. And because of good management and a \nstrong economy, we provided an almost 10 percent across-the-board \nreduction this year for those filing their 1998 returns.\n  As I said earlier, the States are in a much better position to spend \nmoney on education than we are, yet we continue to advocate more \nFederal spending--more than last year, more than the year before--\ndipping into our nation's pension fund.\n  As it is, the Federal Government does have responsibilities to the \nAmerican people to uphold the promises we have given to them in \nMedicare, Social Security and national security--promises that we are \ndesperately struggling to maintain.\n  We need to begin establishing just what our priorities are as a \nlegislative body, and where our responsibility lies.\n  One instance in the context of the Labor, HHS, Education legislation \nwe just completed where I believe the Federal Government has been \nparticularly irresponsible is in the almost $1 billion decrease in \nfunding for the Social Services Block Grant originally written into the \nbill.\n  As you know, States rely on the Social Services Block Grant to \nprovide crucial services to low-income individuals, including children, \nfamilies, the elderly and the disabled.\n  However, funding for this block grant has been cut repeatedly the \nlast few years, despite the Federal commitment made in the 1996 welfare \nreform agreement with the States. Congress and the administration \nguaranteed that funding would be maintained at $2.38 billion each year \nfrom fiscal year 1997--fiscal year 2002.\n  Instead, funding for the Social Services Block Grant for fiscal year \n2000 has only reached the level of $1.05 billion.\n  Yet, in the appropriations bill we have somehow managed to increase \nfunding in a number of other areas, including a $2 billion increase \nabove the fiscal year 1999 funding level of $15.6 billion for the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  In the process of providing for the 13 percent increase in funding \nfor the National Institutes of Health, we have cut the Social Services \nBlock Grant, which provides for the most vulnerable and underserved in \nour population, by 45 percent. How do we reconcile these kinds of \ndecisions based on our responsibilities here in Washington and with \nprevious commitments to the States?\n  I should add I believe many of the services provided to young \nchildren under the Social Services Block Grant serve as preventive \nmedicine for a number of ailments they may encounter later in life--\nailments the Federal Government funds the National Institutes of Health \nto research.\n  In other words, if we do not take care of those kids during that \nprenatal period, they will develop many of the things that the National \nInstitutes of Health are trying to take care of, like high blood \npressure and diabetes. Why not take care of it earlier? That does not \nmake sense to me--$2 billion more, and cutting the Social Service Title \n20 block grant. It does not make sense.\n  Before we go off spending more money on new education initiatives, \nsuch as 100,000 new teachers and financing for new school construction, \nwe should at the very least make it a top priority to honor the Federal \nGovernment's funding commitment to the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act--currently the largest unfunded mandate by the Federal \nGovernment on the states. IDEA currently contains a provision \nauthorizing the Federal Government to fund up to 40 percent of the \nservices provided under Part B of the act. Since its enactment, \nhowever, the Federal Government has only appropriated funds for 10 \npercent of these services--only 10 percent.\n  In the meantime, we must begin taking a serious look at the billions \nof dollars we spend on education programs to determine whether these \nprograms are effective, and whether the Federal Government should have \na role in these programs in the first place.\n  According to GAO, there are 560 different education programs \nadministered by 31 Federal Government agencies. I have asked GAO to \nformulate methodology that determines the overall effectiveness of \nFederal education programs. Currently, there is no methodology to do \nthis.\n  Wouldn't it be nice to sit down and look at what we are doing as a \ncountry in education, identify the programs definitively, look at those \nthat are really making a difference, get rid of those that are not, and \nput the money in the programs that are successful?\n  It all gets back to the fact that at each level--Federal, State and \nlocal--we all want value, which is getting the best product for the \nleast amount of money, and we all want positive results.\n  To this end, we must work with State governments as partners to come \nup with a system where we can maximize our dollars to make a difference \nin the lives of our children.\n  Rather than enact more Federal mandates and raid Social Security to \nincrease Federal spending on State and local responsibilities--we \nshould be giving states greater flexibility to innovate and tailor \ntheir education programs to the unique needs of their children.\n  Congress has been talking about drawing a line in the sand, \ncommitting not to raid any more from the Social Security trust fund to \npay for increased spending for Federal programs. Yet we recently \nlearned from CBO Director Dan Crippen that the FY2000 spending bills \nthat we've been laboring over are already eating up billions of the \nSocial Security surplus--even while our promises to maintain the \nintegrity of the trust fund still hang in the air! I have not forgotten \nthe lockbox I had on my desk, and many other Members of the Senate, \nputting a firewall between spending and the Social Security trust fund.\n\n[[Page S13156]]\n\n  When faced with honest choices, the American people will not accept \nthe Federal Government paying for programs that are primarily the \nresponsibility of the States at the expense of sacrificing our \ncommitment to Social Security and Medicare, as well as to numerous \nother commitments the Federal Government has made under law and under \nthe Constitution of the United States of America. That is absolutely \nunacceptable, and the American people have a right to be upset. We need \nto be doing better.\n  As the appropriations legislation is finalized in negotiations, I \nhope that we in the Senate can inject some common sense into the \ndialog, taking into account our priorities as a Federal legislative \nbody, and weighing the extent to which we should or should not maintain \nour involvement in various programs that are more properly the \nresponsibility of State and local government. Even now, however, I fear \nwe are primarily driven to compete with the President for political \noneupsmanship in the area of education which, while ranked first as a \nnational priority according to polling data, is not the primary \nresponsibility of State and local government.\n  Medicare, Social Security, and national security--these are the \nprimary challenges before us. As fiscal stewards of our Nation's \neconomy, we cannot afford to continue maintaining our involvement in so \nmany other areas, spending at such a pace as we have and it has been \nenormous. We must define our responsibilities. We must prioritize. We \nmut exercise fiscal discipline and restraint and insist that we work \nharder and smarter and do more with less.\n  The current budgetary path that we are on is both dangerous and \nirresponsible and downright misleading.\n  I am sad to say that many of the fiscal year 2000 appropriations \nbills with which we have invested so much of our time, despite our best \nintentions, are flawed by the use of budgetary gimmicks that I cannot \nhelp but say overshadow the labors of so many of my colleagues who are \nshouldered with the difficult task of constructing a budget that both \nmeets all of the perceived demands placed on this body and keeps us out \nof the red. That is why we must prioritize.\n  In the meantime, I cannot condone the sleight of hand that allows us \nto postpone making the kind of tough choices that are required to \nbalance our books, and because of that I have voted against a number of \nthese spending bills--bills that, to be sure, would benefit Ohio in a \nnumber of ways.\n  We have committed over $17 billion in emergency spending in these \nbills, and that does not even count the billions of dollars of other \nspending that's being hidden. We are plastering--and I mean \nplastering--this spending over with something called directed scoring. \nInstead of using CBO numbers--that is, the Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers--we have been selectively using numbers from the Office of \nManagement and Budget, the agency for which the President is \nresponsible, whenever they allow us to spend more.\n  Incidentally, does anyone remember the last time we did not have an \nemergency for which we had to account? Let's end the charade and admit \nwe use emergency spending to avoid the balanced budget spending caps \nand, while we are at it, admit we are spending every dime of the \nprojected on-budget surplus in fiscal year 2000.\n  When I go back to Ohio, people say to me: What about the tax \nreduction? You guys are having a tough time just balancing the budget.\n  I want to say this: If we do not have substantially more revenues in \nfiscal year 2000 than what is currently projected, CBO will announce in \nJanuary that we are using Social Security to balance the 2000 budget. \nWe have to pray the dollars come in a lot more, but if the dollars do \nnot come in more, then CBO is going to announce in January this budget \nuses Social Security.\n  It is time to bite the bullet and make the hard choices. Nobody else \nbut us can exercise the fiscal responsibility that is needed. If we \ncannot do it now, with the lowest unemployment we have had and a \nbooming economy, the question I have is, When will we ever be able to \ndo it? If we fail to make the tough choices now, we will soon be facing \na train wreck that will make it impossible for us to respond to the \nneeds specifically delegated in the Constitution to the Federal \nGovernment and fail to keep the sacred Social Security and Medicare \ncovenant we have with the American people. Let's get back on track so \nwhen we return to Washington at the start of the new millennium, which \nis just around the corner, we can say with confidence we have, indeed, \nbeen the stewards of a government the American people deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13156-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICE OF OBJECTION\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, according to recent results from the 1998 \nNational Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), only about a \nquarter of fourth, eighth, and twelfth graders write well enough to \nmeet the ``proficient'' achievement grading level, and a measly one \npercent of students attained the ``advanced'' grading level. \nApproximately six out of ten pupils reached just the ``basic'' level--\ndefined as ``partial mastery'' of writing skills by the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress exam.\n  What startling results, Mr. President! How do we expect our nation to \nforge ahead in a global economy with a ``partial mastery'' of writing \nskills? From the typical thank-you note to a cover letter for a job \nopening to a simple exchange with friends over the Internet, writing is \na skill essential to everyday existence, no matter what path in life \none may choose to pursue. The power of words and the blending of \nthoughts in a succinct, clear, and grammatically correct manner is \noften a daunting endeavor, and one that is too easily dismissed with a \npoor letter grade or a critical evaluation by a mentor or coworker.\n  The path to becoming a solid writer is a long and arduous road. I \ncontinue to improve my writing skills each day through reading and \nthrough practice. As the old saying goes, ``practice makes perfect.'' \nWell, Mr. President, this dictum does not just apply to perfecting your \nbaseball swing or your tennis serve. It is an edict we all ought to \nfollow with a little greater will and fortitude in all of life's \nquests.\n  What makes someone a better writer? Lots of things, I say, but \nperhaps a strong foundation is the most critical, and often the most \nneglected, step along the way. Today's children are ripe with great \nideas and creativity, but without proper instruction and strong reading \nskills, bright promise fades into fractured thoughts and misspelled \nwords on paper. Based upon the results of the 1998 NAEP test, students \nwho did well tended to be those who planned out their compositions and \nhad teachers who required practice drafts. Moreover, youngsters from \nhomes filled with books, newspapers, magazines, and encyclopedias had \nhigher average scores.\n  So often, we hear students gripe about burdensome summer reading \nlists, and even more shockingly, we witness parents encouraging their \nchildren to buy the ``Cliff Notes'' of the book to provide them with \nthe basic character and plot summaries while avoiding the hefty task of \nreading the novel from cover to cover. What nonsense! Perhaps, the \ngreatest benefit of a child's summer agenda is reading. Skimming and \nreading shortened versions or the so-called ``Cliff Notes'' rob \nchildren of wonderful learning experiences.\n\n  Reading is an essential ingredient to enhancing one's writing skills. \nFrom enjoying the morning newspaper over a cup of coffee to reading an \neducational magazine or a novel, one can benefit greatly from this \nendeavor. Given the expansive English vocabulary, there is much to \nlearn from different styles of writing. How often does a person come \nacross an unfamiliar word or phrase in reading? Quite often, I suspect. \nBut how often does the person actually interrupt their reading to \nconsult the dictionary for the word's definition or origin? Not very \noften, I venture to guess. An appreciation of the soaring majesty of \nthe English language is the\n\n[[Page S13157]]\n\nkey to unlocking one's own writing skills and letting one's own words \ntake wing.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor this year of S. 514, legislation to \nreauthorize the National Writing Project. The National Writing Project \n(NWP) is the only federally funded program that specifically works to \nimprove a student's writing abilities and provide professional \ndevelopment programs in the area of writing instruction for classroom \nteachers. This program operates on a ``teachers teaching teachers'' \nmodel, meaning that successful writing teachers conduct workshops for \nother teachers in the schools during the school year to improve overall \nwriting skills. It is critically important that our nation have skilled \nteachers in the area of writing, and this program goes straight to the \nheart of that. West Virginia is home to three federally funded National \nWriting Projects, including programs at West Virginia University and \nMarshall University.\n  The act of writing is itself an art, one which not only requires \ncreativity, but one that can also glisten with beauty. Calligraphy, for \nexample, is a beautiful form of writing, very popular in formal \ninvitations and for special events. And while most of us are not gifted \ncalligraphers by nature, we all ought to take a little more pride in \nthe presentation of our writing. A beautifully worded poem or essay can \nbe easily tarnished by poor penmanship. Conversely, good penmanship can \nenhance the overall beauty of one's writing by simple finishing \ntouches, beginning with the dotting of our i's and the crossing of our \nt's. It is very easy to become sloppy in one's writing, but we must not \nforget that appearance does matter, and a good essay that is illegible \nwill have little impact.\n  Sadly, today's young generation seems to be more happily occupied \nwith a telephone in one hand and a television remote control in the \nother than with a book or a newspaper. I fear that the entertainment \nluxuries of the twentieth century have misplaced the old-fashioned art \nof reading and writing. Computer electronic mail too often has become a \nreplacement for a hand-written thank-you letter to a deserving \ncolleague or peer. Reading from Plutarch's ``Lives,'' Homer's ``The \nIliad'' and ``The Odyssey,'' or a Shakespearean play has taken a \nbackseat to video games and Hollywood movies.\n  I challenge all of us to set higher standards in our reading and \nwriting skills, and to help our young people do the same. Put down the \nremote control and pick up a good book. Write a poem for a friend on \nher birthday. Poetry is a wonderful gift--such heartfelt thoughts on \npaper tend to last much longer than a piece of clothing exhibiting the \nlatest fashion trend. Embrace the English language and take pride in \neach word that you place on paper--after all, your writing is a \nreflection of you.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13157-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CBO COST ESTIMATE FOR S. 1377\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Griffith Water Project (Griffith Project) to the \n     Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA). The transfer would \n     occur after the SNWA pays about $121 million to the Bureau to \n     meet its outstanding obligations under an existing repayment \n     contract with the federal government. A substantial portion \n     of the Griffith Project is located on federal land \n     administered by the National Park Service (NPS) and the \n     Bureau of Land Management. Under S. 986, the SNWA would \n     retain rights-of-way across this federal land at no cost.\n       CBO estimates that enacting S. 986 would yield a net \n     increase in asset sale receipts of $112 million in 2000, but \n     that this near-term cash savings would be offset on a present \n     value basis by the loss of other offsetting receipts over the \n     2001-2033 period. Because the bill would affect direct \n     spending, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply. CBO also \n     estimates that implementing S. 986 could cost up to $50,000 a \n     year in appropriated funds over the 2001-2004 period. S. 986 \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). The \n     project conveyance, and any costs associated with it, would \n     be voluntary on the part of the SNWA. The bill would impose \n     no costs on any other state, local, or tribal governments.\n\n\n                estimated cost to the federal government\n\n       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 986 is shown in the \n     following table. The costs of this legislation fall within \n     budget function 300 (natural resources and environment).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        By fiscal year, in millions of dollars\n                                                                    --------------------------------------------\n                                                                       2000     2001     2002     2003     2004\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING \\1\\\n \nEstimated Budget Authority.........................................     -112        9        9        9        9\nEstimated Outlays..................................................     -112        9        9        9        9\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ S. 986 also would authorize additional spending, subject to appropriation, of up to $50,000 a year over the\n  2001-2004 period.\n\n                           basis of estimate\n\n       For this estimate, we assume that S. 986 will be enacted \n     early in fiscal year 2000. Based on information from the SNWA \n     and\n\n[[Page S13158]]\n\n     the Bureau, CBO expects that the authority will make the \n     prepayment during fiscal year 2000, and that the formal \n     project conveyance will be completed during fiscal year 2001.\n       Direct Spending. S. 986 would direct the Secretary of the \n     Interior to sell the Griffith Project to the SNWA, in \n     exchange for a one-time payment of about $121 million. The \n     sales price would be adjusted to reflect any additional \n     payments made by SNWA before the project transfer is \n     completed. CBO expects the prepayment to occur during fiscal \n     year 2000 and estimates that those receipts would be offset \n     by the loss of currently scheduled repayments of about $9 \n     million a year between 2000 and 2022 and $6 million a year \n     between 2023 and 2033.\n       Spending Subject to Appropriation. Presently, the SNWA \n     bears the full cost of operating and maintaining the Griffith \n     Project. In addition, pursuant to an agreement with the \n     Bureau, the SNWA will absorb all administrative costs \n     associated with the conveyance. Thus, implementing this \n     provision would not affect discretionary spending. The NPS \n     currently collects about $50,000 a year from the SNWA to \n     offset the costs of administering and monitoring rights-of-\n     way within the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. Under S. \n     986, the SNWA would maintain rights-of-way across these \n     federal lands at no cost after the conveyance is completed. \n     CBO estimates that implementing this provision would require \n     a net increase in amounts appropriated to the NPS of about \n     $50,000 annually to continue administrative activities \n     related to monitoring these rights-of-way.\n\n\n                      pay-as-you-go considerations\n\n       The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act sets \n     up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct \n     spending or receipts. The net changes in outlays that are \n     subject to pay-as-you-go procedures are shown in the \n     following table.

Based on \n     information provided by the bureau, CBO estimates that the \n     sale of the Griffith Project as specified in S. 986 would \n     result in a net savings to the government, and therefore, the \n     proceeds would count for pay-as-you-go purposes.\n\n\n        estimated impact on state, local, and tribal governments\n\n       S. 986 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in \n     UMRA.

The conveyance would be voluntary on \n     the part of the authority, however, and these costs would be \n     accepted by it on that basis. Further, the authority is \n     already responsible for all costs of operating and \n     maintaining the facility.

Under current law the Congress \n     has authorized the appropriation of $75 million for this \n     activity. The bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior \n     to prepare a report by June 30, 2000, on the status of the \n     comprehensive program for minimizing salt contributions to \n     the Colorado River.\n       Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO \n     estimates that implementing S. 1211 would result in \n     additional discretionary spending of about $6 million over \n     the 2000-2004 period. Enacting this legislation would not \n     affect direct spending or receipts, so pay-as-you-go \n     procedures would not apply. S. 1211 contains no \n     intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). State and local \n     governments might incur some costs to match the federal funds \n     authorized by this bill, but these costs would be voluntary.\n\n\n                estimated cost to the federal government\n\n       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 1211 is shown in the \n     following table. Of the $75 million authorized under current \n     law about $36 million has been appropriated through fiscal \n     year 2000. Assuming that annual appropriations for this \n     program continue near the 2000 level of $12 million as \n     anticipated by the Department of the Interior, the balance of \n     the $75 million authorization would not be exceeded until \n     fiscal year 2004. Thus, CBO estimates that the additional \n     $100 million authorized by S. 1211 would be appropriated in \n     2004 and in the following years. We estimate that the report \n     required by the bill would cost less than $500,000 in fiscal \n     year 2000. The costs of this legislation fall within budget \n     function 300 (natural resources and environment).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         By fiscal year, in millions of\n                                                    dollars\n                                      ----------------------------------\n                                        2000   2001   2002   2003   2004\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    Spending subject to appropriation\nSpending Under Current Law:\nBudget Authority/Estimated\n  Authorization Level \\1\\............     12     12     12     12      2\n  Estimated Outlays..................     12     12     12     12      6\nProposed Changes:\n  Estimated Authorization Level......    \\2\\      0      0      0     10\n  Estimated Outlays..................    \\2\\      0      0      0      6\nSpending Under S. 1211:\n  Estimated Authorization Level \\1\\..     12     12     12     12     12\n  Estimated Outlays..................     12     12     12     12    12\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 2000 level is the amount appropriated for the Colorado River\n  salinity control program for that year.

Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to a provision \nin the Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary conference report, \nwhich Congress passed a few days ago, and which the President vetoed \nyesterday. As the ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on \nProliferation, International Security, and Federal Services, with \njurisdiction over the census,\n\n[[Page S13159]]\n\nI am disappointed the conference report requires that decennial census \nactivities be appropriated by specific program components, known as \nframeworks.\n  Appropriating by framework for the decennial census has never been \ndone before and would cause serious management problems for Census \n2000. According to Census Director Kenneth Prewitt, such a change in \nfunding practices would come at the same time that Census 2000 \nactivities are at their highest. Past congressional direction on the \nallocation of funds by framework has been in report language, which \nafforded Congress the ability to guide spending without hamstringing \noperational management of the census.\n  Director Prewitt noted in a letter to the Chairman of the House \nSubcommittee on the Census, ``Congressional approval in the form of a \nreprogramming would be required for any movement of funds between \ndecennial program components.'' This would necessitate obtaining \nclearance by the Department of Commerce and the Office of Management \nand Budget, as well seeking congressional approval. The Senate version \nof H.R. 2670 did not include this onerous provision, which will \nseriously impede the Census Bureau from shifting needed funds in a \ntimely manner. ``A decennial census is, by its nature, an unpredictable \nexercise. Decisions must be made quickly and frequently adjusted to \nadapt to ever-changing conditions in the field,'' Director Prewitt \nsaid.\n  In its budget presentation, the Census Bureau designed eight \nframeworks for major decennial activities, such as management, field \ndata collection, address listing, automation, Puerto Rico and Island \nareas. The frameworks have been used as strong guidelines rather than \nstrict appropriation limits because funds may need to be shifted \nquickly between frameworks to cover unexpected contingencies. \nHistorically, the Census Bureau has been able to move funds among its \nframeworks--it is inappropriate and damaging for Congress to mandate \nreprogramming at this time.\n  Any delay in census operations in order to accommodate having to wait \nfor affirmation of a reprogramming request will seriously degrade the \nquality and completeness of the resulting population count that must be \ndelivered by December 31, 2000. The President vetoed the conference \nreport yesterday, and it is my hope this provision, retained from the \nHouse version of the bill, will be deleted. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent to print Director Prewitt's letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      U.S. Department of Commerce,\n\n\n                                         Bureau of the Census,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 15, 1999.\n     Hon.

There is language \n     in the version of the bill passed by the House that is of \n     significant concern to the Census Bureau.\n       In the House version of the FY 2000 appropriations bill, \n     funding is provided by specific program components (known as \n     frameworks). Consequently, Congressional approval in the form \n     of a reprogramming would be required for any movement of \n     funds between decennial program components. This is a \n     dramatic departure from past practices and takes place at \n     precisely the time when Census 2000 activities peak, when the \n     need for program flexibility is most crucial. If the need to \n     obtain Congressional approval significantly delays the \n     transfer of funds, Census 2000 operations could be \n     compromised. The companion legislation passed by the Senate \n     does not contain this restrictive provision and would permit \n     the timely transfer of funds, if necessary, to attain the \n     results we are all working so hard to achieve.\n       In the past, formal reprogramming has only been required to \n     shift funds between different programs, accounts, and bureaus \n     within the Department of Commerce. This has allowed Congress \n     to exercise its oversight responsibility without constricting \n     the operational management of Bureau activities. The proposed \n     House provision would trigger a time-consuming reprogramming \n     process, in addition to the bill's provision that mandates a \n     delay of at least 15 days for Congressional review.\n       As you know, the Census Bureau has spent literally \n     thousands of hours developing a carefully analyzed \n     Operational Plan, which we believe can achieve the most \n     accurate and complete census possible within the parameters \n     required by the recent Supreme Court decision requiring a \n     complete enumeration of all census non-respondents.\n       A decennial census is, by its nature, an unpredictable \n     exercise. Decisions must be made quickly and frequently \n     adjusted to adapt to ever-changing conditions in the field. \n     One obvious example of the need for this type of flexibility \n     is in dealing with our new construction program. The Census \n     2000 New Construction procedures perform a vital role in \n     address list development after all other addressing processes \n     have concluded. If the volume of new construction listing \n     work is significantly higher than anticipated, funds must be \n     rapidly shifted from other frameworks to cover the costs of \n     investigating areas, listing households, and preparing maps \n     and other materials for enumeration. Reprogramming could \n     inhibit the timely completion of listing operations and \n     jeopardize the quality and completeness of the population \n     count in states with high rates of new construction.\n       The census has the potential to be a civic ceremony that \n     celebrates participation and responsibility. It is up to all \n     of us to ensure that it is. Congress has consistently \n     expressed and demonstrated a commitment to ensure the most \n     complete and accurate census possible.\n       I appreciate your support and commitment in making Census \n     2000 a success.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Kenneth Prewitt,\n     Director.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13159-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13159-S13160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE AFRICA TRADE BILL\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my objections to the \nAfrica trade bill. I have listened to how this bill will help those \ncountries on the African Subcontinent, and I support that goal. \nHowever, Mr. President, what I don't support is watching mills close in \nmy State, and around the country, and having to tell these people that \nthey no longer have jobs because cheap labor overseas has either caused \ntheir company to go out of business or move overseas.\n  At the same time, I don't believe that this legislation will serve \nthe intended purpose of helping to raise the living standards of \nAfricans through increased trade and economic cooperation between the \nUnited States and African countries. In order for this to occur, \nworkers need to be paid well, treated well and have a suitable \nworkplace. Workers in many countries in both Africa and the Caribbean \nBasin are subjected to abusive conditions at work while their \ngovernments remain uninvolved, or, with government complicity. This \nlegislation does not have the provisions necessary to guarantee that \nthe workers in these countries receive the benefits of U.S.-Africa \ntrade.\n  In addition, being from Maine, I understand the importance of \nbalancing the needs of loggers with the desires of environmentalists. \nThis legislation would result in increased rates of logging, which has \nbeen cited as the greatest threat to Africa's remaining native forests. \nAs only eight percent of Africa's forests still exist in large \nundisturbed tracts, forcing African nations to give even more access to \nforeign logging companies could be fatal to these vital tropical \nforests.\n  In the last 57 months, from December 1994 to September 1999, the U.S. \napparel industry has lost 309,000 jobs. The textile industry has lost \n128,000 jobs, for a total of 437,000 American jobs lost.\n  My home state of Maine has seen its fair share of lost jobs as well. \nSince 1994, 26,500 Mainers have been told that they no longer have a \njob to provide for them and their families. I have heard some of my \ncolleagues state that this legislation is about jobs. Well, I am \nunwilling to trade well-paying jobs with benefits for lower paying \nones--but that's precisely what's happened under our ill-conceived \ntrade agreements. As the trade deficit and globalization of U.S. \nindustries have grown, more quality jobs have been lost to imports than \nhave been gained in the lower-paying sectors that are experiencing \nrapid export growth. Increased import shares have displaced almost \ntwice as many high-paying, high-skill jobs than increased exports have \ncreated.\n  It was my concern about the impact of foreign labor on the American \njob market, Mr. President, that led me to oppose passage of the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993. Unfortunately, NAFTA has \nbecome a trade agreement whose provisions are not adequately enforced--\nto\n\n[[Page S13160]]\n\nthe detriment of the United States, our industries, and our workers.\n  I am in agreement with my distinguished colleague from South \nCarolina,\n  Senator Hollings, in his assessment of NAFTA last week. We were told \nthat NAFTA would create jobs in America. I have seen in my state that \nthey were wrong.\n  The U.S. textile and apparel industry has been decimated by imports \nfrom the Far East as a result of the Asian ``flu'' and also illegal \ntransshipments that our government does not catch and which find their \nway into this country in what is estimated to be an annual volume of \nsomewhere between $4 and $10 billion.\n  For 23 years, U.S. imports have exceeded U.S. exports. Consequently, \nin the last quarter of the 20th century, the United States has amassed \na total trade deficit of more than $2 trillion. As a result, the United \nStates, which entered the decade of the 1980s as the world's largest \ncreditor nation, leaves the 1990s as the world's largest debtor \ncountry.\n  This is no time to further liberalize trade policy that is hurting \nnot only the textile and apparel industry but also steel, computers, \nand auto parts where net imports have climbed enormously. Last year, \nall of manufacturing lost over 340,000 jobs.\n  Mr. President, when I became a United States Senator, one of my \npledges to the people of Maine was that, and continues to be, that I \nwill work to the best of my ability to ensure that their jobs are not \nlost because of actions taken by their government.\n  The administration and proponents of NAFTA told us over and over \nagain how good the Agreement would be for creating American jobs. I now \nhear the same argument with this legislation and I want to say that if \nwhat has happened is considered good, then I could not imagine what \npoor trade legislation would do to the textile and apparel industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13160-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE CLIMATE CHANGE ENERGY POLICY RESPONSE ACT AND THE CLIMATE CHANGE \n                         TAX AMENDMENTS OF 1999\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the Climate Change Energy Policy Response \nAct would bring the debate on global warming and climate change out of \nthe arena of mass speculation and back to the refuge of sound, \npractical science. This legislation I am cosponsoring with my colleague \nfrom Idaho, Senator Larry Craig, would not only move our Nation toward \na healthier environment by requiring Federal agencies to establish \nclear goals for addressing climate change concerns, but it also seeks \nto protect rural economies that are currently threatened by policies \nbased on scare tactics developed by professional global warming special \ninterest activists and the politicians that cater to their agenda.\n  One thing that should be pointed out is that for many of the people \nwho attend global warming conferences and who circulate global warming \npropaganda, global warming is an occupation. This is how they make \ntheir living. I make my living by ensuring the people of Wyoming and \nthe United States get a fair deal. Committing our Nation's valuable \nresources and our children's futures to policies that unduly burden our \ncommunities is, to me, not only unfair, it's unconscionable.\n  This bill would direct the Secretary of Energy to coordinate and \nestablish Federal policy for activities involving climate change. It \nwould require increased peer review of the science used to create that \npolicy and it establishes important objectives for the science such as \nunderstanding the Earth's capacity to assimilate natural and manmade \ngreenhouse gas emissions and to evaluate natural phenomena such as El \nNino.\n  I also am cosponsoring companion legislation that would put the power \nof addressing global warming issues into the hands of those most \naffected by climate change initiatives. It does this by amending the \nInternal Revenue Service Code to provide incentives for voluntary \nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions and for the development of global \nclimate science and technology. This would permanently extend a tax \ncredit for research and development involving climate change. It also \nwould apply tax credits for greenhouse gas emission reduction \nfacilities. This rewards industry for investing in cleaner technology \nwithout punishing it for thinking beyond short-term profits.\n  Our entrepreneurs, small businesses and the employers and employees \nof large companies have the ability to protect and preserve the \nenvironment without sacrificing the global economy. The goals of \nenvironmental health and economic stability are not mutually exclusive. \nFor example, voluntary, incentive-based programs, in combination with \nprivate efforts, have been largely responsible for the success of \nwetlands restoration. We made developing and preserving wetlands an \nasset instead of a burden and as a result we have more wetlands now \nthan before we enacted the incentive-based programs. Resorting to \nFederal regulations, on the other hand, has produced hostility and \nconfusion on the part of private citizens. Why? Federal regulations are \ntypically cost prohibitive and are promulgated with a single-minded \npurpose that sacrifices America's ability to respond to future \nchallenges via proactive incentives.\n  It is my hope that proponents of government-knows-best policy and \nspecial interest mandates will set aside their rhetoric and walk with \nus on the practical path of real, reasonable environmental progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13160-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the National Security Archives recently \nreleased an additional selection of declassified documents from the \nState Department, Defense Department, and the CIA on U.S. relations \nwith Chile between 1970 and 1973, when the democratically-elected \ngovernment of President Allende was overthrown by General Pinochet. The \nrelease of these documents is part of the Administration's ongoing \n``Chile Declassification Project,'' an effort begun following the \narrest of General Pinochet last year. According to the President's \ndirective, U.S. national security agencies are directed to ``review for \nrelease * * * all documents that shed light on human rights abuses, \nterrorism, and other acts of political violence during and prior to the \nPinochet era in Chile.''\n  On October 24, the Washington Post carried two articles which \nemphasized the need for full disclosure by the CIA of its documents \nrelated to its covert operations in Chile during this period. The \nrelease of these documents will facilitate a full understanding of this \nperiod in U.S.-Chile relations. I believe that these articles will be \nof interest to all of us in Congress concerned about this issue, and I \nask unanimous consent that they may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 24, 1999]\n\n       Still Hidden: A Full Record Of What the U.S. Did in Chile\n\n                          (By Peter Kornbluh)\n\n       As Augusto Pinochet continues to fight extradition from \n     England to face charges of\n\n[[Page S13161]]\n\n     crimes against humanity, the historical record of U.S. \n     support for the former Chilean dictator remains \n     desaparecido--disappeared--like so many victims of his \n     violent regime. Unless President Clinton ensures that the \n     record is brought to light, a singular opportunity to find \n     answers to unresolved cases of atrocities against Chileans \n     and Americans, and to fully understand the role U.S. \n     Government played in this Cold War tragedy, will be lost.\n       In the wake of Gen. Pinochet's stunning arrest in London \n     one year ago, the Clinton administration has been conducting \n     a special ``Chile Declassification Project.'' On Feb. 1, U.S. \n     national security agencies were directed ``on behalf of the \n     president'' to begin searching their archives ``and review \n     for release . . . all documents that shed light on human \n     rights abuses, terrorism, and other acts of political \n     violence during and prior to the Pinochet era in Chile.''\n       What began as a precedent-setting exercise in official \n     openness, however, has devolved into an example of government \n     censors holding history hostage. The ``securocrats'' of the \n     national security bureaucracy are blocking the release of \n     virtually all documents that chronicle the full extent of the \n     U.S. role in Chile. The result, so far, is a public record \n     skewed by omission, open to charges of fraud and a coverup.\n       Chile holds a special place in the annals of American \n     foreign policy. During the mid-1970s, the country that poet \n     Pablo Neruda described as ``a long petal of sea, wine, and \n     snow'' became the subject of international scandal. News \n     reports revealed that the CIA had conducted massive \n     clandestine operations to undermine the democratically \n     elected socialist government of Salvador Allende and help \n     bring the military to power in 1973. Secretary of State Henry \n     Kissinger's embrace of the Pinochet regime, despite its \n     ongoing atrocities, prompted Congress to pass the very first \n     laws establishing human rights as a criterion for U.S. policy \n     abroad.\n       The CIA's covert operations and the debate over U.S. policy \n     toward Pinochet generated a slew of secret documents. So, \n     too, did the 1973 murder in Chile of two U.S. citizens, \n     freelance writers Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi, as well \n     as the brazen 1976 car bombing in Washington that killed \n     former Chilean ambassador Orlando Letelier and his American \n     associate, Ronni Karpen Moffitt. The Clinton administration's \n     special review carried the promise of finally declassifying \n     these records and answering the outstanding questions that \n     haunt this shameful era.\n       Such questions include:\n       What role did the United States play in the violent coup \n     that brought Pinochet to power?\n       Why was Horman, whose case was made famous in the Hollywood \n     movie ``Missing,'' detained and executed? Did U.S. \n     intelligence somehow finger him, as recently declassified \n     documents suggest, for the Chilean military?\n       What support did the CIA provide to Pinochet's notorious \n     secret police, the DINA?\n       Could the United States have prevented the assassination of \n     Letelier and Moffitt on American soil?\n       Since the White House ordered declassification, the \n     agencies' review has yielded almost 7,000 documents--a major \n     feat given the usual snail's pace of the national security \n     bureaucracy. On June 30, the administration released same \n     5,800 records, covering the most repressive years of \n     Pinochet's bloody rule, 1973 to 1978. Significantly, \n     however, 5,000 of those were from the State Department; \n     the CIA released only 500 documents--a fraction of its \n     secret holdings on that period.\n       On Oct. 8, approximately 1,100 documents were declassified \n     in a second phase that was supposed to cover the years of \n     Allende's presidency, 1970 to 1973. Based on the accumulated \n     evidence of U.S. involvement in Chile during that period, \n     that figure is a meager percentage of the true record.\n       To be sure, some of the documents that were declassified \n     contain extremely detailed information on the Pinochet \n     regime, and they undoubtedly will prove useful to future \n     efforts within Chile to hold Pinochet's military officers \n     accountable for human rights violations.\n       But while Chileans are learning about their dark history \n     from the U.S. documents, American citizens are learning \n     almost nothing about their own government's actions. Among \n     more than 25,000 pages released to date, there is not a \n     single page of the thousands of CIA, National Security \n     Council (NSC) or National Security Agency (NSA) records on \n     U.S. policy and operations to bring down Allende and help \n     Pinochet consolidate his rule. This documentation includes \n     the files of the CIA's covert ``Task Force on Chile,'' \n     planning papers from the Nixon White House, records of U.S. \n     material support for the DINA, and intelligence documents on \n     the Horman and Letelier-Moffitt cases.\n       That such records exists is beyond dispute. As the subject \n     of repeated controversy over the years, the U.S. role in \n     Chile has generated congressional inquiries, murder \n     investigations, criminal prosecutions and civil lawsuits--not \n     to mention hundreds of requests under the Freedom of \n     Information Act. These have yielded extensive information \n     (which I have spent almost 20 years compiling and analyzing) \n     about what still is hidden.\n       A close reading of two detailed Senate reports published in \n     1975, for example, shows that the CIA station in Santiago \n     sent a number of cables about its ``liaison relations'' with \n     the Chilean DINA after the coup. Justice Department files on \n     the prosecution of former CIA head Richard Helms for lying to \n     Congress about covert operations in Chile reveal that the \n     agency filed daily progress reports on ``Track II''--the code \n     name for U.S. efforts to foment a coup against Allende. An \n     aborted lawsuit filed by the Horman family against Kissinger \n     produced references to classified records containing \n     information about Charles Horman's death. But while President \n     Clinton clearly intended these cables, files and records to \n     be released, none of them have been.\n       The Horman case is a classic example of the cult of \n     secrecy. As the movie ``Missing'' suggests, his family has \n     long suspected that the U.S. intelligence community knew far \n     more than it admitted about how and why he was singled out by \n     the Chilean military after the coup. But it took 26 years for \n     the U.S. government to acknowledge that State Department \n     officials shared the family's suspicion. ``U.S. intelligence \n     may have played a part in Horman's death. At best, it was \n     limited to providing or confirming information that helped \n     motivate his murder. . .'' according to a passage in an Aug. \n     25, 1976, State Department memorandum released this month--a \n     document that Horman's widow, Joyce calls ``close to a \n     smoking pistol.'' (When the same document was released to the \n     family in 1980, this critical paragraph was blacked out.) And \n     although Clinton's order explicitly directed agencies to \n     declassify documents on Horman, neither the CIA nor the NSA \n     has released a single record relating to his case.\n       Hundreds of documents have also been withheld on the \n     Letelier and Moffitt assassinations--albeit with the \n     explanation, wholly unsatisfactory to their families, that \n     these records are material to an ``ongoing'' investigation \n     into Pinochet's possible role.\n       As coordinator of the Chile Declassification Project, the \n     NSC bears responsibility for failure to comply with the \n     president's directive. Under its watch, countless documents \n     have been blocked from release.\n       The CIA, which has the most to offer history but also the \n     most to hide, has refused to conduct a full file search of \n     its covert action branch, the Directorate of Operations. \n     After I sent a comprehensive list of documents missing from \n     the first release to the CIA's declassification center--the \n     address of which is classified--an official informed me that \n     the agency was ``not legally obliged'' to search such file \n     because it had never ``officially acknowledged'' covert \n     operations in Chile. (President Gerald Ford's public \n     admission in 1974 that the CIA had covertly intervened in \n     Chile apparently doesn't count.)\n       Moreover, with the acquiescence of the NSC, the \n     intelligence community has taken the position that policy and \n     planning documents are ``not responsive'' to the president's \n     directive. Under this narrow interpretation, the \n     deliberations of Nixon, Kissinger, Helms and others in \n     plotting and financing political violence in Chile will not \n     be considered for declassification--severely distorting the \n     historical record.\n       Consider one example: The CIA has released one heavily \n     blacked-out cable reporting on the October 1970 kidnapping \n     and murder of Chilean Gen. Gene Schneider, who opposed a \n     military move against Allende. But the agency did not even \n     submit for review the dozens of secret ``memcons'' \n     (memorandums of conversations), meeting minutes and briefing \n     papers showing that the White House and the CIA covertly \n     orchestrated this operation in an aborted attempt to \n     instigate a coup in Chile.\n       To the surprise of the intelligence community, the National \n     Archives Records Administration (NARA) found such documents \n     among Nixon's papers. In compliance with Clinton's order, \n     these records were submitted to the Chile Declassification \n     Project, but CIA and NSA officials objected to their release. \n     Since the documents deal with the Allende era, they should \n     have been made public on Oct. 8. They weren't.\n       It is unclear how many, if any, will be included in the \n     third and final declassification, now scheduled for April. \n     Under the media spotlight, the CIA recently said it will \n     review some records related to covert action. But it is \n     unlikely that the credibility of this important project can \n     be salvaged unless the president explicitly orders full \n     cooperation and maximum disclosure.\n       There are compelling reasons to do so:\n       Abroad, Washington's reputation as a standard-bearer on \n     human rights is at stake. It will prove far more difficult to \n     encourage Chileans to undergo a process of truth and \n     reconciliation if Washington is unwilling to admit its own \n     involvement in their history. Indeed, the credibility of U.S. \n     diplomatic efforts to press other nations, from Germany to \n     Guatemala, to acknowledge and redress their mistakes of the \n     past will be undermined by this flagrant attempt to hide our \n     own.\n       At home, the American public has the right to know the full \n     story of U.S. policy toward Chile and Pinochet's brutal \n     regime. And his victims' families deserve to be able to lay \n     this painful history to rest. Clinton's directive said the \n     declassification project responded, in part, ``to the \n     expressed wishes of the families of American victims.'' But \n     an incomplete review, as Joyce Horman wrote recently, would \n     be ``little more than an exercise in hypocrisy.''\n       At least rhetorically, Clinton appears to agree: ``I think \n     you're entitled to know what happened back then and how it \n     happened,'' he recently told reporters. We are indeed.\n\n[[Page S13162]]\n\n     But only if he takes concrete action to support his words \n     will Americans finally learn what was done in Chile--in our \n     name, but without our knowledge.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 24, 1999]\n\n                   The `Jewels' That Spooked the CIA\n\n                            (By Vernon Loeb)\n\n       President Clinton's order to declassify all U.S. government \n     documents on human rights abuses and political violence in \n     Chile has forcefully recalled the most painful period in \n     agency history.\n       It is a cautionary tale of secrets and lies, burned deep \n     into the CIA psyche. It begins on Feb. 7, 1973, with the \n     question that Sen. Stuart Symington put to former CIA \n     director Richard Helms before the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee:\n       ``Did you try in the Central Intelligence Agency to \n     overthrow the government of Chile?''\n       ``No, sir,'' Helms replied.\n       The facts told a different story, and three months later, \n     after an order came down asking all CIA employees to report \n     any evidence they had of any unlawful acts, someone at \n     Langley questioned the truthfulness of Helm's response.\n       His prevarication found its way into a 693-page compendium \n     of CIA misdeeds that was being compiled by the new director \n     of central intelligence, William Colby--a document that came \n     to be known as ``the Family Jewels.''\n       The Family Jewels told all: of plots to assassinate foreign \n     leaders, overthrow government, bug journalists, test \n     psychedelic drugs on unwary subjects. And, of course, of the \n     agency's efforts to destabilize the socialist regime of \n     Chilean President Salvador Allende.\n       Colby shared the Family Jewels with Congress, the White \n     House and, to a lesser extent, the news media. He hand-\n     delivered a chapter to the Justice Department that directly \n     led to Helms facing criminal charges over his Chile \n     testimony. And Colby's revelations prompted the creation of \n     the Senate Select Committee to Study Government Operations \n     with Respect to Intelligence Activities, known as the Church \n     Committee after its chairman, Sen. Frank Church.\n       Once the committee issued its final report, the CIA's \n     ability to do pretty much as it pleased without telling \n     anyone was over: Both houses of Congress created standing \n     select committees to oversee the CIA as a full-time pursuit.\n       To this day, Helms--who pleaded no contest in 1977 for \n     failing to testify fully to Congress, was ordered to pay a \n     $2,000 fine and was given a two-year suspended sentence--\n     remains one of the most revered figures in the secrecy-based \n     CIA culture. (At 86, he is currently working on his memoirs.) \n     But Colby, who died in 1996, is deeply resented by many for \n     what is seen as betrayal.\n       ``The first principle of a secret intelligence service is \n     secrecy.'' Thomas Powers wrote in his 1979 biography of \n     Helms, ``The Man Who Kept the Secrets.''\n       ``It was bad enough this ancient history was being raked up \n     at all, but to have it raked up in public, with all the \n     attendant hypocrisy of a political investigation conducted by \n     political men . . . This, truly, in Richard Helms' view, \n     threatened to destroy the agency he and a lot of men had \n     spent their lives trying to build.''\n       Whether a new spirit of openness prevails at the CIA \n     remains to be seen, at least when it comes to Clinton's \n     declassification order on Chile. No covert action documents \n     relating to CIA operations in Chile have yet been made \n     public. But CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said their release \n     is only a matter of time.\n       ``We're still very much in the middle of this, and we are \n     going to be as forthcoming as possible,'' Mansfield said, \n     ``consistent with protecting legitimate sources and \n     methods.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13162-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13162-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    A DRAFT OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION RELATIVE TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY \n               SYSTEM--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 68\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following messages \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith for your immediate consideration a legislative \nproposal entitled the ``Strengthen Social Security and Medicare Act of \n1999.''\n  The Social Security system is one of the cornerstones of American \nnational policy and together with the additional protections afforded \nby the Medicare system, has helped provide retirement security for \nmillions of Americans over the last 60 years. However, the long-term \nsolvency of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds is not \nguaranteed. The Social Security trust fund is currently expected to \nbecome insolvent starting in 2034 as the number of retired workers \ndoubles. The Medicare system also faces significant financial \nshortfalls, with the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund projected to become \nexhausted in 2015. We need to take additional steps to strengthen \nSocial Security and Medicare for future generations of Americans.\n  In addition to preserving Social Security and Medicare, the Congress \nand the President have a responsibility to future generations to reduce \nthe debt held by the public. Paying down the debt will produce \nsubstantial interest savings, and this legislation proposes to devote \nthese entirely to Social Security after 2010. At the same time, by \ncontributing to the growth of the overall economy debt reduction will \nimprove the Government's ability to fulfill its responsibilities and to \nface future challenges, including preserving and strengthening Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  The enclosed bill would help achieve these goals by devoting the \nentire Social Security surpluses to debt reduction, extending the \nsolvency of Social Security to 2050, protecting Social Security and \nMedicare funds in the budget process, reserving one-third of the non-\nSocial Security surplus to strengthen and modernize Medicare, and \npaying down the debt by 2015. It is clear and straightforward \nlegislation that would strengthen and preserve Social Security and \nMedicare for our children and grandchildren. The bill would:\n  --Extend the life of Social Security from 2034 to 2050 by reinvesting \n    the interest savings from the debt reduction resulting from Social \n    Security surpluses.\n  --Establish a Medicare surplus reserve equal to one-third of any on-\n    budget surplus for the total of the period of fiscal years 2000 \n    through 2009 to strengthen and modernize Medicare.\n  --Add a further protection for Social Security and Medicare by \n    extending the budget enforcement rules that have provided the \n    foundation of our fiscal discipline, including the discretionary \n    caps and pay-as-you-go budget rules.\n  I urge the prompt and favorable consideration of this proposal.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to provide for local family information centers, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n               LOCAL FAMILY EDUCATION INFORMATION CENTERS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I speak on behalf of myself and Senator \nKerry from Massachusetts, today for myself and Senator Kerry of \nMassachusetts today to introduce legislation that will go a long way to \nhelp parents become more involved in their children's education. We all \nknow that families are crucial to the improvement of our nation's \nschools. To ensure that schools and students meet challenging \neducational goals, families must be involved. Parents must insist that \ntheir children get the best education. They must understand, shape and \nsupport the reforms in their schools; and, they must work with schools \nto help all children meet their goals.\n  We know that when families are fully engaged in the educational \nprocess, students have: higher grades and test scores; better \nattendance and more homework done; fewer placements in special \neducation; more positive attitudes and behavior; higher graduation \nrates; and, greater enrollment in postsecondary education.\n  For school reforms to help all children, we must move to ensure that \nall parents are involved in their children's education. For many \nparents, this is not an easy task. Parents, particularly those who have \nlimited English proficiency, or those who have a troubled history with \nthe school system, often need outside help to get the information, \nsupport, and training they need to help their children navigate the \nschool system.\n  Current provisions in Title I of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act provide for excellent and important ways for parents to \nget involved in their children's education. However, in some cases, \nparent involvement of the type envisioned by Title I remains a distant \ngoal. Many Title I schools (though not all) have failed to fully bring \nparents into the development of parent involvement policies, school-\nparent compacts, and into planning and improvement for the school as \nprovided for in Title I. It is thus essential for families to have an \nindependent source of information and support that they understand and \ntrust so that they can participate in an informed and effective manner \nand help move the schools toward the goal of full parental \nparticipation.\n  To achieve this critical end, this legislation would provide \ncompetitive grants to community based organizations to establish Local \nFamily Information Centers. These centers, made up of community members \nas well as professionals from the Title I schools in the area, should \nhave a track record of effective outreach and work with low income \ncommunities. They, in consultation with the school district, would \ndevelop a plan to provide parents with the full support that they need \nto be partners in their children's education. For example, they would \nhelp parents understand standards, assessments, and accountability \nsystems; support activities that are likely to improve student \nachievement in Title I schools; understand and analyze data that \nschools, districts, and states must provide under reporting \nrequirements of ESEA and other laws; understand and participate in the \nimplementation of parent involvement requirements of ESEA, including; \nand, communicate effectively with school personnel.\n  This legislation is essential because it would reach and assist \nparents most isolated from participation by poverty, race, limited \nEnglish proficiency and other factors. It is essential because of what \nwe know about how children learn--that children that are the farthest \nbehind make the greatest gains when their parents are part of their \nschool life.\n  Many schools do a very good job of involving parents in education \nreform. This bill does nothing but ensure that parents have the option \nof an independent voice in districts where schools do not do such a \ngood job. If we are to educate our children, we must also educate their \nparents. This legislation provides one necessary means to do so.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 1786. A bill to amend the Robert T.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nimprove water quality on abandoned or inactive mined land; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n    good samaritan abandoned or inactive mine waste remediation act\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill, for myself, \nSenator Campbell, and Senator Daschle. This bill will address one of \nour nation's most overlooked environmental problems: the thousands of \nabandoned mines that pour pollution into rivers and streams throughout \nthe west.\n  Since 1972, when we enacted the Clean Water Act, our nation has made \na lot of progress improving water quality. Generally speaking, our \nwater is cleaner. The Potomac doesn't stink. The Cuyuhoga doesn't burst \ninto flame. EPA estimates that about 1/3 more of our rivers are \nfishable and swimmable than 20 years ago.\n  But we still face serious water pollution problems.\n  One of the most serious, in the west, is pollution from abandoned \nmines.\n  Let me provide some background.\n  The settlement of the mountain west was driven, in large part, by \nmining. Take my home state of Montana. At the center of Helena is Last \nChance Gulch, where gold was discovered in 1864. Butte was called the \n``Richest Hill on Earth, ``because of it's huge veins of copper. Our \nstate's motto is ``Oro y Plata''--gold and silver. The ASARCO smelter \nin East Helena is one of the largest and most efficient in the world.\n  Mining has long been critical to our development. It's created jobs. \nIt's part of our culture. Of our community.\n  But mining, like many other economic activities, can have severe \nenvironmental consequences. Especially the way it was conducted years \nago, before the development of sophisticated environmental laws and \nregulations.\n  I am reminded of the words of the Montana writer, A.B. Guthrie.\n\n       Much of the exploitation, much of unthinking damage, was \n     done in . . . a spirit characteristic of pioneer America. \n     Growth was the way of life. It was the nature of things. . . \n     . The end was not yet. The end never would be. That's what we \n     thought. We know better now.\n\n  One reason that we know better now is that we've seen the effect of \nthe abandoned hardrock mines that dot the landscape of the mountain \nwest. They once were active mines, in many cases, long ago. Now they're \nan abandoned collection of tailings, shafts, and adits.\n  Even in generally arid areas, these mines release acid wastes. They \nleach mercury, arsenic, copper, and other heavy metals. They load \nsediments into nearby waters. They poison drinking water. They \ncontaminate fish, making them unfit to eat. They threaten public health \nand destroy rivers and streams.\n  According to the Western Governors Association:\n\n       Abandoned and inactive mines are responsible for many of \n     the greatest threats and impairments to water quality \n     throughout the United States. Thousands of stream miles are \n     severely impacted by drainage and runoff from these mines, \n     often for which a responsible party is unidentifiable or not \n     economically viable. At least 400,000 abandoned or inactive \n     mine sites occur in the west.\n\n  This map shows the scope of the problem.\n  The small dots indicate individual sites. Light shading indicates \nthat there are more than 100 sites. Orange, between 200 and 300. Red, \nmore than 300 sites.\n  As you can see, There are hundreds of sites in many western states--\nMontana, Idaho, California, Utah. New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and \nSouth Dakota.\n  And that's not all. Michigan. The Ohio Valley. The Appalachains. All \nacross the country.\n  In Montana, there are approximately 6,000 abandoned hardrock mines. \nState officials already have identified 245 that are within 100 feet of \na stream. In many cases, these mines are known to be polluting \ndownstream waters.\n  Most of the sites are concentrated around Helena. But there are sites \nthroughout western Montana, in 24 of our 56 counties. All the way from \nLincoln County, in Northwest Montana, to Park County, in South Central \nMontana.\n  Let me show you an example.\n  This is an abandoned hardrock mine site near Rimini, about 15 miles \nwest of Helena. It's in the Ten Mile Creek watershed, which serves as \nthe Helena drinking supply. As you can see, the water is actually \norange.\n  Clearly, abandoned hardrock mines pose a big problem.\n  So why isn't somebody doing something about it?\n  As is often the case, this simple question requires a pretty \ncomplicated answer.\n  In the first place, it may be impossible to track down the person who \ncreated the problem. The original mine operator may long gone.\n  In other cases, the ownership patterns are a complex mix of federal, \nstate, and private land; and of surface, mineral, and water rights. It \nis not uncommon for dozens of parties to have had some connection to a \nmining site over the years. So it's difficult to establish legal \nresponsibility for a private party to clean up the site.\n\n[[Page S13167]]\n\n  There's another alternative. A state, tribe, or local government \nagency may want to step in and clean the site up themselves. As the \nWestern Governors Association has put it:\n\n       The western states have found that there would be a high \n     degree of interest and willingness on the part of federal, \n     state and local agencies . . . to work together toward \n     solutions to the multi-faceted problems commonly found on \n     inactive mined lands.\n\n  But there's a hitch. A few years ago, a federal court of appeals held \nthat, under the Clean Water Act, one of these ``good samaritans'' is \ntreated exactly the same as the operator of an working mine. That is, \nsomeone who has no responsibility for a site, but nevertheless wants to \nstep in and make progress in cleaning up the site, must get a permit \nthat complies with all of the effluent guidelines and other \nrequirements of the Clean Water Act.\n  Many states, tribes, and local government good samaritans simply \ncan't afford to clean up a site to full Clean Water Act standards.\n  So, facing the legal consequences if they fall short, potential good \nsamaritans refrain from attempting to address water pollution problems \nat all.\n  Let me tell you about the Alta mine, outside Corbin, Montana. That's \nabout 15 miles South of Helena.\n  The mine is an important part of Montana's heritage. Ore was \ndiscovered in there 1869.\n  During the late 1800s, 450 miners were extracting more than 150 tons \nof ore each day, generating a total of $32 million worth of gold, \nsilver, lead, and zinc. That's the equivalent of about $1 billion in \ntoday's dollars.\n  The main portion of the mine closed in 1896. This century, mining and \nremining continued sporadically, under a variety of different \noperators. The mine was completely abandoned in the late 1950s.\n  I visited the site a few weeks ago, with my friend Vick Anderson, who \nruns the Montana mine cleanup program.\n  This is a photograph of the mine shaft. It cuts down to the old \nunderground workings, 650 feet below. The shaft serves as a collection \npoint for groundwater.\n  In the picture, you can see the toxic, acid water that seeps from the \nshaft and eventually drains into Corbin Creek.\n  Up until this point, Corbin Creek runs clear and clean. It's a high-\nquality trout stream. But, after the runoff from the Alta mine, the \nwater is contaminated with arsenic, antimony, cadmium, copper, iron, \nlead, mercury, and zinc.\n  There's a distinct sulphuric odor. In some places, the water looks \norange, like the picture I showed of the mine near Rimini.\n  This contamination affects not only Corbin Creek, but also Spring \nCreek and Prickly Pear Creek. That's about 7 miles of contamination. In \nthe town of Corbin itself, the pollution is so bad that the State of \nMontana was forced to close groundwater wells and contstruct a $300,000 \nwater supply project to serve 11 homes.\n  Now let me tell you what you can't see in the picture of the Alta \nmine.\n  All around the mine shaft, the State of Montana is conducting \nreclamation work. Removing structures. Closing adits. Removing or \ncovering contaminated soil.\n  The state would also like to do something about the water pollution.\n  For example, they could divert runoff through a channel, and then \nconstruct wetlands to filter the arsenic, iron, lead, mercury, and \nother pollutants. This would clean the water up, significantly.\n  The engineers say that it will work.\n  But the lawyers say it won't.\n  They say that, by diverting the water, the state would become liable \nunder the Clean Water Act. It would have to get a permit. And the \npermit would require permanent treatment that is prohibitively \nexpensive.\n  Faced with that possibility, there is only one practical thing for \nthe state to do. Nothing. Leave the water pollution alone.\n  And that's exactly what is happening. As we speak, the toxic water \ncontinues to flow directly into Corbin Creek.\n  This is not an isolated example. According to the Western Governors \nAssociation and others, the same thing is happening all across the \nwest.\n  As you can see, the current system creates a disincentive. It \nprevents well-intentioned state and local governments from stepping in \nand conducting voluntary cleanups.\n  As a result, the cleanups don't occur and the pollution keeps \nflowing.\n  That's the problem that our bill will fix.\n  The title of this bill, the ``Good Samaritan Mine Remediation Waste \nbill'' says it all.\n  The state, tribal, and local government agencies that we refer to as \n``good samaritans'' are not trying to make money. They're not trying to \nskirt the law. They're trying to do good--in this case, to improve \nwater quality.\n  The basic objective of this bill is to allow that. To allow states, \ntribes and local governments to be good samaritans.\n  In a nutshell, the bill will allow state, local, and tribal \ngovernments to clean up an abandoned mines under a special permit, \ntailored to the conditions of the site.\n  They apply for a good samaritan permit from EPA. The application must \ninclude a detailed plan describing the cleanup actions that will be \ntaken to improve water quality.\n  EPA reviews the plan and takes comments from the local community. EPA \ncan approve the application if it determines that the plan will result \nin an improvement in water quality to the greatest extent practical, \ngiven the resources and cleanup technologies available to the Good \nSamaritan.\n  Once a permit is approved, the good samaritan can proceed with the \ncleanup. EPA will monitor progress and conduct periodic reviews. When \nthe cleanup is finished, the permit is terminated and the Good \nSamaritan is not held responsible for any future discharges from the \nsite.\n  That's the basic framework.\n  Let me also mention several additional safeguards, that are described \nin detail in a summary that I ask be included in the Record after this \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 1.]\n  First, before applying for a permit, the good samaritan must conduct \na search, to try to find parties who are responsible for the pollution \nproblem at the mine site and have the resources to clean it up \nthemselves. If so, those parties should be held to the ordinary \nstandards of the Clean Water Act. And they will be.\n  Second, a good samaritan permit can only be used for cleanup. It \ncan't be used for remining. In fact, if the cleanup generates materials \nthat can be sold commercially, the proceeds have to be used to help \nfurther clean up the river or stream. As a result, good samaritan \npermits cannot become a loophole for someone to get around the \napplication of the Clean Water Act to active mining operations.\n  This bill is not a remining bill, and will not become one.\n  Third, a good samaritan permit is fully enforceable, by either EPA or \na citizen suit. As I've explained, there are very good arguments for \napplying different standards to good samaritan cleanups.\n  But, once those standards are written into a permit, they must be \ncomplied with to the same extent as the standards of an ordinary \npermit. The law is the law.\n  Mr. President, this bill reflects years of hard work, by the Western \nGovernors Association, environmentalists, industry representatives, and \nothers.\n  It's not perfect. It does not reflect a complete consensus. There are \nfurther issues to work through.\n  But my hope is that we can proceed quickly, through a hearing and \nmarkup, so that, before long, this important bill can be enacted into \nlaw.\n  If so, we soon will see success stories, all across the west. At \nplaces like the Alta Mine, we'll be taking sensible steps to make our \nrivers a lot cleaner and our lives a little bit better.\n  Let me return to the words of A.B. Guthrie. He described the \nexploitation of natural resources in the past. Then he said that ``we \nknow better now.''\n  We do. We know better. And that knowledge gives us a responsibility. \nWe must put our knowledge to constructive use. In this case, by \ncleaning up abandoned mine sites and other sources of pollution.\n\n[[Page S13168]]\n\n  If we solve the problem, our grandchildren won't have to.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                Summary\n\n       The legislation is designed to eliminate the disincentives \n     that currently exist in the Clean Water Act to the \n     restoration of water quality through Good Samaritan cleanups \n     of abandoned or inactive hardrock mines. To accomplish this, \n     the legislation allows the federal government, states, \n     tribes, and local governments that want to clean up an \n     abandoned or inactive mining site to apply for a ``mine waste \n     remediation'' permit instead of the typical Clean Water Act \n     permit. The key to the mine waste remediation permit is that \n     it allows Good Samaritans to improve water quality to the \n     best of their ability rather than necessarily to achieve full \n     compliance with water quality standards.\n       An application for a permit must be submitted to the \n     Environmental Protection Agency and include a detailed plan \n     describing the cleanup actions that the Good Samaritan will \n     take to improve water quality. Applicants for a permit must \n     make a reasonable search for parties who are responsible for \n     the mine waste and therefore, are subject to full compliance \n     with the Clean Water Act. Based on a review of the plan and \n     obtaining public input, EPA can approve an application if no \n     companies responsible for the mine waste are found and if the \n     application ``demonstrates with reasonable certainty that the \n     implementation of the plan will result in an improvement in \n     water quality to the degree practicable, taking into \n     consideration the resources available to the remediating \n     party for the proposed remediation activity.'' EPA will \n     develop and issue regulations that detail the specific \n     contents of applications for mine waste remediation permits \n     and may, on a case-by-case basis, issue regulations that \n     impose ``more specific requirements that the Administrator \n     determines'' are appropriate for individual mine sites.\n       Upon approval of a permit, the Good Samaritan proceeds with \n     the planned cleanup. EPA plays a continuing role in \n     monitoring the cleanup's progress, conducting periodic \n     reviews to assure permit compliance. As with an ordinary \n     Clean Water Act permit, both EPA and citizens can take legal \n     action if a Good Samaritan fails to comply with the terms of \n     a mine waste remediation permit. When the cleanup is \n     completed, the permit is terminated and the Good Samaritan is \n     not held responsible for any future discharges from the site.\n       The legislation is based on a proposal by the Western \n     Governors Association (WGA), which worked extensively with \n     the environmental community, mining industry, and the \n     Administration in developing it. The staff of Senator Max \n     Baucus has also worked with these groups and WGA in crafting \n     the legislation. The Western Governors support this \n     legislation and urge that it be enacted in this Congress.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of \nsupport from the Western Governors Association be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Western Governors' Association,\n\n                                     Denver, CO, October 19, 1999.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Senator of Montana, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Baucus: The Western Governors commend you for \n     introducing the ``Good Samaritan Abandoned or Inactive Mine \n     Waste Remediation Act.'' As stated in WGA Resolution 98-004 \n     (attached), the Western Governors believe that there is a \n     need to eliminate current disincentives in the Clean Water \n     Act for voluntary, cooperative efforts aimed at improving and \n     protecting water quality impacted by abandoned or inactive \n     mines. We believe your bill could effectively and fairly \n     eliminate such disincentives, and we therefore urge its \n     passage this Congress.\n       Inactive or abandoned mines are responsible for threats and \n     impairments to water quality throughout the western United \n     States. Many also pose safety hazards from open adits and \n     shafts. These historic mines pre-date modern federal and \n     state environmental regulations which were enacted in the \n     1970s. Often a responsible party for these mines is not \n     identifiable or not economically viable enough to be \n     compelled to clean up the site. Many stream miles are \n     impacted by drainage and runoff from such mines, creating \n     significant adverse water quality impacts in several western \n     states.\n       Recognizing the potential for economic, environmental and \n     social benefits to downstream users of impaired streams, \n     western states, municipalities, federal agencies, volunteer \n     citizen groups and private parties have come together across \n     the West to try to clean up some of these sites. However, due \n     to questions of liability; many of these Good Samaritan \n     efforts have been stymied.\n       To date, EPA policy and some case law have viewed inactive \n     or abandoned mine drainage and runoff as problems that must \n     be addressed under Section 402 of the CWA--the National \n     Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit \n     program. This, however, has become an overwhelming \n     disincentive for any voluntary cleanup efforts because of the \n     liability that can be inherited for any discharges from an \n     abandoned mine site remaining after cleanup, even though the \n     volunteering remediating party had no previous responsibility \n     or liability for the site, and has reduced the water quality \n     impacts from the site by completing a cleanup project.\n       The ``Good Samaritan Abandoned or Inactive Mine Waste \n     Remediation Act'' would amend the Clean Water Act to protect \n     a remediating agency from becoming legally responsible for \n     any continuing discharges from the abandoned mine site after \n     completion of a cleanup project, provided that the \n     remediating agency--or ``Good Samaritan''--does not otherwise \n     have liability for that abandoned or inactive mine site and \n     implements a cleanup project approved by EPA. The Western \n     Governors support this bill, and urge that it be enacted this \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Marc Racicot,\n                           Governor of Montana, WGA Lead Governor.\n                                                       Bill Owens,\n                          Governor of Colorado, WGA Lead Governor.\n                                               Michael O. Leavitt,\n     Governor of Utah.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         Policy Resolution 98-004, Cleaning Up Abandoned Mines\n\n               [Adopted June 29, 1998, Girdwood, Alaska]\n\n\n                             A. Background\n\n       1. Inactive or abandoned mines are responsible for threats \n     and impairments to water quality throughout the western \n     United States. Many also pose safety hazards from open adits \n     and shafts. These historic mines pre-date modern federal and \n     state environmental regulations which were enacted in the \n     1970s. Often a responsible party for these mines is not \n     identifiable or not economically viable enough to be \n     compelled to clean up the site. Thousands of stream miles are \n     impacted by drainage and runoff from such mines, one of the \n     largest sources of adverse water quality impacts in several \n     western states.\n       2. Mine drainage and runoff problems are extremely complex \n     and solutions are often highly site-specific. Although cost-\n     effective management practices likely to reduce water quality \n     impacts from such sites can be formulated, the specific \n     improvement attainable through implementation of these \n     practices cannot be predicted in advance. Moreover, such \n     practices generally cannot eliminate all impacts and may not \n     result in the attainment of water quality standards.\n       3. Cleanup of these abandoned mines and securing of open \n     adits and shafts has not been a high funding priority for \n     most state and federal agencies. Most of these sites are \n     located in remote and rugged terrain and the risks they pose \n     to human health and safety have been relatively small. That \n     is changing, however, as the West has gained in population \n     and increased tourism. Both of these factors are bringing \n     people into closer contact with abandoned mines and their \n     impacts.\n       4. Cleanup of abandoned mines is hampered by two issues--\n     lack of funding and concerns about liability. Both of these \n     issues are compounded by the land and mineral ownership \n     patterns in mining districts. It is not uncommon to have \n     private, federal, and state owned land side by side or \n     intermingled. Sometimes the minerals under the ground are not \n     owned by the same person or agency who owns the property. As \n     a result, it is not uncommon for there to be dozens of \n     parties with partial ownership or operational histories \n     associated with a given site.\n       5. Recognizing the potential for economic, environmental \n     and social benefits to downstream users of impaired streams, \n     western states, municipalities, federal agencies, volunteer \n     citizen groups and private parties have come together across \n     the West to try to clean up some of these sites. However, due \n     to questions of liability, many of these Good Samaritan \n     efforts have been stymied.\n       a. To date, EPA policy and some case law have viewed \n     inactive or abandoned mine drainage and runoff as problems \n     that must be addressed under the Clean Water Act's (CWA) \n     Section 402 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System \n     (NPDES) permit program. This, however, has become an \n     overwhelming disincentive for any voluntary cleanup efforts \n     because of the liability that can be inherited for any \n     discharges from an abandoned mine site remaining after \n     cleanup, even though the volunteering remediating party had \n     no previous responsibility or liability for the site, and has \n     reduced the water quality impacts from the site by completing \n     a cleanup project.\n       b. The western states have developed a package of \n     legislative language in the form of a proposed amendment to \n     the Clean Water Act. The effect of the proposed amendment \n     would be to eliminate the current disincentives in the Act \n     for Good Samaritan cleanups of abandoned mines. Over the \n     three years that the proposal was drafted, the states \n     received extensive input from EPA, environmental groups, and \n     the mining industry.\n       6. Liability concerns also prevent mining companies from \n     going back into historic mining districts and remining old \n     abandoned mine sites or doing volunteer cleanup work. While \n     this could result in an improved environment, companies which \n     are interested are justifiably hesitant to incur liability \n     for cleaning up the entire abandoned mine site.\n\n\n                     b. governors' policy statement\n\n                             Good Samaritan\n\n       1. The Western Governors believe that there is a need to \n     eliminate disincentives to voluntary, cooperative efforts \n     aimed at improving and protecting water quality impacted by \n     abandoned or inactive mines.\n\n[[Page S13169]]\n\n       2. The Western Governors believe the Clean Water Act should \n     be anended to protect a remediating agency from becoming \n     legally responsible under section 301(a) and section 402 of \n     the CWA for any continuing discharges from the abandoned mine \n     site after completion of a cleanup project, provided that \n     their mediating agency--or ``Good Samaritan''--does not \n     otherwise have liability for that abandoned or inactive mine \n     site and attempts to improve the conditions at the site.\n       3. The Western Governors believe that Congress, as a \n     priority, should amend the Clean Water Act in a manner that \n     accomplishes the goals embodied in the WGA legislative \n     package on Good Samaritan cleanups.\n\n                          Cleanup and Funding\n\n       4. The governors support efforts to accelerate responsible \n     and effective abandoned mine waste cleanup including the \n     siting of joint waste repositories for cleanup wastes from \n     abandoned mines on private, federal, and state lands. \n     Liability concerns have hampered the siting of joint waste \n     repositories leading to the more expensive and less \n     environmentally responsible siting of multiple repositories. \n     The governors urge the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. \n     Forest Service to develop policy encouraging the siting of \n     joint waste repositories whenever they make economic and \n     environmental sense.\n       5. The governors encourage federal land management agencies \n     such as the Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, and \n     Park Service, as well as support agencies like the U.S. \n     Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Geological \n     Survey to coordinate their abandoned mine efforts with state \n     efforts to avoid redundancy and unnecessary duplication. \n     Federal and State tax dollars should be focused on working \n     cooperatively to secure and clean up abandoned mine sites, \n     not working separately to conduct expensive and time \n     consuming inventories, research, and mapping efforts.\n       6. Other responsible approaches to accelerate abandoned \n     mine cleanup should be investigated, including remining.\n       7. Reliable sources of funds should be made available for \n     the cleanup of abandoned mines in the West.\n\n\n                   c. governors' management directive\n\n       1. WGA staff shall transmit a copy of this resolution and \n     the proposed WGA legislative package on Good Samaritan \n     cleanups to the President, the Secretary of the Interior, \n     Secretary of Agriculture, Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, and Chairmen of the appropriate House and \n     Senate Committees.\n       2. WGA staff shall work with the mining industry, \n     environmental interests, and federal agency representatives \n     to explore options to accelerate abandoned mine cleanup \n     through remining and report back to the Governors at the 1999 \n     WGA Annual Meeting.\n       3. WGA shall continue to work cooperatively with the \n     National Mining Association, federal agencies, and other \n     interested stakeholders to examine other mechanisms to \n     accelerate responsible cleanup and securing of abandoned \n     mines.\n       Approval of a WGA resolution requires an affirmative vote \n     of two-thirds of the Board of the Directors present at the \n     meeting. Dissenting votes, if any, are indicated in the \n     resolution. The Board of Directors is comprised of the \n     governors of Alaska, American Samoa, Arizona, California, \n     Colorado, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, \n     Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Northern Mariana Islands, \n     Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1789. A bill to provide a rotating schedule for regional selection \nof delegates to a national Presidential nominating convention, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n            the regional presidential selection act of 1999\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the 2000 presidential election has already \ncaptured the interest of the national media, and once again the media \nstruggles to make sense of one of this nation's most complex and \nconfusing practices--the presidential nomination system. It is a tenet \nin this country, the greatest democracy in the world, that all citizens \nhave an equal voice in choosing who will be the nominees for the final \nrace for President of the United States. If there is one thing that has \nremained constant in the American system, it is democratic \nparticipation in our electoral process--a basic creed that has guided \nus toward wider participation and more direct election of our leaders. \nIronically, however, every four years we are witnesses to the fact that \nthe current system by which this country chooses its presidential \nnominees is not only arbitrary, but in many ways incompatible with the \nnotion of equal participation in the nominating process.\n  One of the most memorable political cartoons I have had the pleasure \nof reading was drawn during the 1996 election by the cartoonist for a \nlocal paper in my home state of Washington. This cartoon illustrates \njust how bizarre the current presidential primary process really is. \nThe cartoon features Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander \nHamilton brainstorming at the Constitutional Convention. Ben Franklin \nturns to his colleagues in jest and rattles off an idea for the \npresidential election system. He reads from his sheet of paper,\n\n       The President shall be chosen from among those persons who \n     can hone complex ideas into simplistic sound bites, defame \n     the character of their opponents, hide their own blemishes \n     from an intrusive swarming press corps and--get this--win the \n     most votes from a tiny number of citizens in a remote corner \n     of New England!\n\nTo which Alexander Hamilton replies,\n\n       Very droll Franklin, you're quite the comedian.\n\n  Mr. President, I agree with the cartoonist that what our Founding \nFathers would have regarded as a ridiculous way to choose a president \nis now reality. It is no joke--this IS how our Presidential nominating \nsystem works.\n  For some time Members of Congress, party activists, the states, and \nacademics have all advocated reform of the Presidential nominating \nsystem in this country. The flaws in our current system are obvious. \nThe system is unstructured, confusing, and it gives small states that \nhold early primaries or caucuses a disproportionate amount of influence \non the final outcome. The lack of uniformity and clear guidelines in \nthe system creates a system whereby states compete for an early \nposition in the nominating process in order to attract candidates and \nto have some kind of influence in the nominating process. Small to \nmiddle-sized states that select delegates later in the game risk being \nshut out of the process all together and face having a limited role in \nchoosing the Presidential nominee. While the 2000 primary schedule has \nnot yet been solidified, the first primary will be held at the earliest \ndate in history, and an alarming number of states have moved or are \nconsidering moving their primary earlier in the year with the hope of \ninfluencing the nomination process.\n  Clearly, the system does not allow for equal participation by all the \nstates. It undermines the ideal of equal participation in the electoral \nprocess by giving certain states, year after year, far more leverage \nthan others. This unequal balance of power, if you will, compromises \nthe integrity of the nominating process.\n  At this time, while this country's Presidential nominating system \nagain begins to receive national attention, I believe it is fundamental \nthat the American people and this Congress begin discussing methods to \nimprove the current system and introduce reforms to encourage wider \nparticipation and more direct nomination of Presidential candidates.\n  I am introducing, today, a bill to provide for a rotating regional \nselection system for the nomination of candidates for Presidential \nelections. This bill will establish four regions comprised of 12-13 \nstates from the same geographic area in the country. All states in a \nregion will hold primaries or caucuses on the same date either the \nfirst Tuesday in March, April, May, or June and no region will vote in \nthe same month. The order in which each region votes will rotate with \neach presidential election cycle, allowing each region to have the \nopportunity to be the first, second, third, and last region in the \ncountry to vote.\n  This bill introduces much needed uniformity and structure to a system \nthat lacks real composition. It will eliminate the drive by the States \nto gain ``first-in-the-nation'' status and the ability for one or two \nsmall states to influence the entire nomination process. Under this \nplan each state will have equal opportunity to participate and \ninfluence the nomination process. This bill will also establish greater \nuniformity and structure by instituting much needed guidelines for \nstates, delegate selection, and the role of Federal Election \nCommission.\n  Obviously, since we are well into the presidential nomination process \nfor the 2000 Presidential race this bill, if enacted, will apply to \n2004 and election years thereafter.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I look forward to discussing this proposal \nwith my colleagues in the coming weeks and months. I believe it is \nimperative that we do everything we can\n\n[[Page S13170]]\n\nto improve the practice by which we nominate our country's leader.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President. I am happy to join Senator Gorton in \nintroducing a bill that we hope will restore some common sense to the \nway the country chooses party nominees for president. As Senator Gorton \nalready has explained well, anyone taking a objective look at the \ncurrent primary and caucus system could reach only one conclusion: it \nmakes very little sense.\n  Our primary system was meant to serve a very important purpose: to \ndetermine the two--or perhaps three--individuals who will have the \nopportunity to compete for the most powerful office in our nation, and \nperhaps in the world. Given the importance of the process, it is \ncritical that it be a fair one, one that tests the mettle and the ideas \nof all of the candidates, one that allows the voters to hear and weigh \nthe views of those seeking their parties' nominations, and one that \ngives the primary electorate--the whole, national primary electorate--a \nchance to choose the person they think will best represent them and \ntheir views in the ultimate contest to determine who will become \nPresident of the United States.\n  But that just isn't happening now. Instead of a system that tests a \ncandidate's character and his ability to offer reasoned opinions over \nthe long haul, we have an increasingly compressed schedule, one in \nwhich States whose primaries once were spread out over months now \ncompete to see who can hold their contests the earliest, and candidates \ncompete to see who can raise more money than everyone else before the \nfirst primary voters ever step foot into the election booth. That \n``money primary'' has already eliminated four of the Republican \ncandidates for President.\n  This is no way for the world's greatest democracy to choose its \nleader. As Senator Gorton already has explained, the bill we are \nproposing today offers an alternative system, one that can restore the \nprimary season to what it should be: a contest of candidates discussing \ntheir ideas for America's future. By creating a series of regional \nprimaries, we will make it more likely that all areas of the country \nhave input into the nominee selection process, and that the candidates \nand their treasuries will not be stretched so thin by primaries all \nover the country on the same day. By spreading out the primaries over a \nfour-month period, we have a chance to return to the days when the \nelectorate had an opportunity to evaluate the candidates over time, and \nwhere voters--not just financial contributors--had decided who the \nparties' nominees will be.\n  Anyone looking at the current system knows it has to change. I hope \nthat we can make that happen before the 2004 campaign begins.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1790. A bill to provide for the issuance of a promotion, research, \nand information order applicable to certain handlers of Hass avocados; \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n    The Hass Avocado Promotion, Research and Information Act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will create a national promotion, research and information program \nfor Hass avocados. This industry-financed promotion program will help \nfarmers without costing taxpayers any money.\n  This legislation provides California's 6,000 Hass avocado growers \nwith the ability to achieve together that which would not be possible \nalone--the establishment of a national program to enhance avocado \nmarketing and consumption. Pooled industry resources create the \npotential for an impact much greater than what would be possible \nthrough a solely state-funded program.\n  Like producers who have successful national promotion programs, \nincluding those for beef, cotton, dairy, eggs, pork and soybeans, \nproducers of Hass avocados are seeking a new vehicle for expanding the \nconsumer market for avocados. A nationwide promotion program would \nprovide the avocado industry with the means to market avocados to a \nmuch wider consumer audience, and build demand at a time when the \naggregate supply of avocados is rapidly increasing.\n  California has a long history of state marketing programs for its \nmany diverse agricultural commodities. In fact, the avocado industry \nhas long benefitted from an innovative state grower-funded program \nadministered by the California Avocado Commission.\n  In recent years, however, increasing imports are supplying a larger \nshare of the U.S. consumer market. In 1998, for example, import levels \nreached 100 million pounds, or nearly one-third the size of U.S. \navocado production. If not offset by increased demand, this rapid \nescalation of supply will lead to market instability. Given this \ndynamic, it is only fair that the cost of a national promotion program \nbe shared fairly among importers and domestic producers.\n  The ``Hass Avocado Promotion, Research and Information Act of 1999'' \nis a self-help national checkoff program that will allow avocado \ngrowers to fund and operate a coordinated marketing effort to expand \ndomestic and foreign markets. The avocado promotion program will be \noperated at no cost to the federal government and will be funded by \nU.S. Hass avocado growers and Hass avocado importers.\n  The key elements of this avocado promotion legislation include: (1) \nan 11-member Hass Avocado Board comprised of both domestic producers \nand importers; (2) new programs for the advertising and promotion of \navocados to develop new markets; (3) research on the sale, \ndistribution, use, quality or nutritional value of avocados; (4) an up-\nfront referendum of qualified producers and importers during a 60-day \nperiod preceding the effective date of the Secretary of Agriculture's \nimplementing order; and (5) an initial assessment rate on Hass avocados \non 2.5 cent per pound.\n  Hass avocados are an integral food source in the United States and \nare a valuable and healthy part of the human diet. Avocados are enjoyed \nby millions of persons every year for a multitude of every day and \nspecial occasions. The maintenance and expansion of existing markets \nand the development of new markets and uses for Hass avocados is needed \nto preserve and strengthen the economic viability of the domestic Hass \navocado industry for the benefit of producers and the benefit of other \npersons marketing, processing and consuming Hass avocados.\n  Agricultural commodity promotion programs are a proven means of \nincreasing market share for commodities. The Hass avocado growers in my \nstate want to have a program that will help increase their market share \nof the consumer food dollar. California's Hass avocado growers have \nmade extensive efforts over the last two years to unify the industry, \nwhich has resulted in the development of this highly supported national \npromotion program. The 1996-1997 value of domestic Hass avocado \nproduction was $259 million--a substantial market that could be even \ngreater if properly promoted.\n  This national avocado promotion program is an opportunity for \nCongress to help an agricultural industry create increased economic \nactivity and job opportunities, with no expenditure of tax collars. I \nurge you to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1791. A bill to authorize the Librarian of Congress to purchase \npapers of Dr. Martin Luther King, Junior, from Dr. King's estate; to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n         the martin luther king, junior papers preservation act\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould authorize the Librarian of Congress to acquire Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Junior's personal papers from his estate. I am pleased to be \njoined in this important initiative by my friend and colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Joe Lieberman. This bill is a companion to H.R. \n2963, which was introduced by our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives, Congressman James Clyburn and Congressman J.C. Watts.\n  Dr. King, as a minister, civil rights leader, prolific writer and \nNobel Prize winner, was deeply committed to nonviolence in the struggle \nfor civil rights. He is quite possibly the most important and \ninfluential black leader in American history.\n  When Dr. King was tragically assassinated on April 4, 1968, he was in \nhis prime, after having emerged as a true\n\n[[Page S13171]]\n\nnational hero and a chief advocate of peacefully uniting a racially \ndivided nation. He strove to build communities of hope and opportunity \nfor all. He recognized that all Americans must be free if we are to \nlive in a truly great nation.\n  The acquisition of Dr. King's papers would permanently place them in \nthe public domain. People from all over the United States, and the \nentire world, would have direct access to these important historic \ndocuments. Those people studying his life's work would have access to \nhis messages of justice and peace, and also to reflect on the civil \nrights struggle. The Library of Congress would be the perfect place for \nthese papers which already houses other great works of original \nAmerican freedom fighters such as Frederick Douglass and Thurgood \nMarshall. It is altogether fitting that these documents be together \nunder one roof.\n  Dr. King was a person who wanted all people to get along regardless \nof their race, color or creed. His call to all of us, that we should \njudge by the content of one's character rather than by the color of \none's skin, sums up the very core of how we can all peacefully live \ntogether as well as any other words ever spoken.\n  The establishment of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a national \nholiday was the result of the work of many determined people who wanted \nto ensure that we and future generations duly honor and remember his \nlegacy. In fact, our tradition of honoring Dr. King took another step \nforward when just yesterday the President signed into law S. 322, a \nbill I introduced earlier this year that authorizes the flying of the \nAmerican flag on Martin Luther King Day, in addition to all of our \nnation's national holidays. The bill I introduce today builds on this \nwork and will ensure that Dr. King's legacy is preserved for \ngenerations to come.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill. I \nask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1791\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to ensure that there will be adequate funding for the \ndecommissioning of nuclear power facilities; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                 NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING ASSURANCE ACT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in an era of deregulation, it is \nimperative that we focus on the public health and safety concerns that \nmay surface in the rush to eliminate excess costs in energy production.\n  One such concern involves the decommissioning and decontamination \n(D) of retired nuclear power plants. The nuclear industry confronts \nnot only the difficulty of providing a competitive energy source in a \nchanging regulatory environment, the funds accumulated to date to cover \nD costs are not sufficient to ensure proper cleanup unless measures \nare put into place that continue fee collection for the duration of \neach plant's service life.\n  This bill establishes a framework to ensure adequate fee collection \nto cover nuclear decommissioning and decontamination costs in a \nchanging regulatory environment.\n  Today, nuclear generating units provide almost a quarter of the \ncountry's annual electricity generation. Over the next twenty years, a \nsubstantial number of these nuclear power plants reach the end of their \n40-year licenses. Some will apply for a license renewal, which should \nbe a straightforward and expeditious process.\n  All plants, at some point, however, will face retirement. Whenever \nretirement occurs, decommissioning follows--this requires safe \ndismantling and disposal of all irradiated components.\n  Upon acquiring a license to operate a nuclear power plant, licensees \nalso commit to decommission the plant upon closure. Utilities are \nrequired to set aside funds for decommissioning.\n  In the past, State regulators generally allowed fee collection for \ndecommissioning obligations through rates over the entire service lives \nof the nuclear power plants. This method spread the costs of \ndecommissioning the plant to all the customers served by the plant over \nthe entire course of the plant's service life.\n  As the electricity market moves toward deregulation, the nuclear \nindustry confronts a profound problem. First, fee collection was \nstructured such that accrual of sufficient funds required the full life \nof the plant, and regulators often undercut the amount of fees \ncollected in order to keep energy prices down.\n  Second, under funding also results from escalating decommmissioning \ncosts due to expanded regulatory requirements, lower than expected \ngrowth due to loss of load and customer exodus, rate settlements, and \nthe lag in collecting funds due to ratemaking delays.\n  Lastly, decommissioning cost recovery for most utilities, including \nnuclear, is ``back-end loaded.'' Meaning, cost recovery is designed to \ngenerate much larger contributions to the fund in latter years.\n  In short, the funding of decommissioning has not kept pace with the \naging of the units.\n\n[[Page S13183]]\n\n  For example, today, a nuclear plant licensee of a 15-year-old plant \nwould have collected only approximately 5 percent of the funds \nnecessary to meet decommissioning obligations. In addition, these \nnuclear plant licensees currently have no means of ensuring that they \ncan continue to collect fees from consumers to ensure decommissioning \nobligations are met.\n  The magnitude of the potential shortfall in cost recovery for \ndecommissioning obligations is staggering. On an aggregate basis, \nutilities' decommissioning trust funds currently are funded at \napproximately 25 percent of the estimated costs--about $9 billion. \nNuclear plants, however, are approximately 43 percent through their \nexpected service lives. Total projected D costs will exceed $35 \nbillion, leaving a current shortfall of about $26 billion.\n  The monumental size of this problem is underscored by the following \ncomparison: FERC allowed recovery of $10 billion of total stranded \ncosts during the restructuring of the natural gas industry. the nuclear \nindustry's current dilemma is two and a half times greater.\n  Two recent publications underscore the critical need to provide \nassurance that decommissioning funds can be collected and are adequate \nto cover costs. A study which I chaired by the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies (CSIS) entitled The Regulatory Process for \nNuclear Power Reactors addressed this issue.\n  The CSIS report stated, ``Restructuring of the electric utility \nindustry could exacerbate the problem of adequate decommissioning \nfunding and could threaten the ability of nuclear power plant owners to \nrecover funds for decommissioning and for nuclear waste disposal in \nelectric rates.'' The June 1999 report Nuclear Power Plant \nDecommissioning Under Utility Restructuring by the National Conference \nof State Legislatures strongly urged a ``review of current \ndecommissioning legislation, especially if considering or passing \nderegulation.\n  The legislation I am introducing today creates a backstop to ensure \nthat decommissioning fees can continue to be collected regardless of \nforthcoming changes in the regulatory environment. Because full, safe \ndecommissioning is vital to public health and safety, this legislation \nis required to ensure that adequate funds for decommissioning are \navailable to power plant licensees upon closure of their nuclear \nplants.\n  Let me briefly describe the mechanism established in this bill to \nensure that adequate funds are collected.\n  First, nuclear power plant licensees are allowed to petition the NRC \nfor determination of adequacy of their nuclear decommissioning trust \nfunds. This petition process allows a full review of licensees' \ndecommissioning costs and available funding. The petition process \nallows full public notice and comment.\n  In other words, the NRC will determine each licensee's current and \nongoing revenue requirement necessary to ensure adequate funds are \naccumulated in the trust fund at the appropriate time.\n  Second, the Act amends the Federal Power Act to enable licensees to \napply to the FERC, in the case of wholesale rates, or state \ncommissions, for retail rates, for an order establishing rates or \ncharges for collection of revenues necessary to meet NRC determined \nrequirements.\n  Depending on the consumer base served by the nuclear licensee, either \nthe FERC or the state PUCs will be required to incorporate the NRC \ndetermined decommissioning cost and revenue requirements in their rate \nstructure.\n  This translates into a negligible fee added to consumers' monthly \nbills that will guarantee adequate cleanup upon closure of the nuclear \nplants that met their energy needs. This measure is simple, pragmatic, \nand safeguards our safety and health needs.\n  We must act now to ensure adequate funding for the safe \ndecommissioning of nuclear units. The awkward jurisdictional position \nof this issue--caught in a gap between federal agencies and state \nregulatory authorities--creates a situation in which inconsistent \nregimes interfere with federally mandated safety measures.\n  This situation presents an unacceptable uncertainty and risk for the \nhealth and safety of the citizens and for the economy. As a matter of \npublic policy, to protect public health and safety, as well as to \npreserve sound energy and economic policy, adequate funding of \ndecommissioning obligations must be assured.\n  This act addresses this concerns and creates a practical mechanism to \nensure the decommissioning funds will be adequate to safe closure of \nnuclear plants in the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1793\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear Decommissioning \n     Assurance Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) full, safe decommissioning of nuclear power plants is a \n     compelling Federal interest, in that--\n       (A) the public health and safety and the protection of the \n     environment can be guaranteed only if nuclear power plants \n     are adequately decommissioned at the end of their useful \n     lives; and\n       (B) decommissioning obligations cannot be avoided, \n     abandoned, or mitigated, as a matter of public health and \n     safety;\n       (2) electric utilities that own nuclear power plants must \n     be able to collect adequate revenues to ensure that the \n     utilities can satisfy the obligation to fully decommission \n     nuclear power plants in accordance with standards established \n     by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission;\n       (3) the authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to \n     ensure that utilities are able to collect adequate funds so \n     that they can satisfy the decommissioning obligation is \n     limited by the fact that the Commission does not directly \n     establish rates for electric services;\n       (4) many nuclear decommissioning trust funds are not \n     adequate to meet decommissioning obligations, and the current \n     electric rates of collection are not adequate to ensure that \n     there will be adequate funds at the time of decommissioning.\n       (5) potential restructuring of the electric utility \n     industry will exacerbate the problem, because competitive \n     pressure is expected to be placed on current rates, thereby \n     threatening the ability of utility entities to recover funds \n     for decommissioning in electric rates; and\n       (6) there is a Federal interest in establishing a national \n     policy to ensure that electric utilities that own nuclear \n     power plants can recover funds sufficient to satisfy the \n     decommissioning obligation.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that electric utilities that own commercial \n     nuclear electric generating plants will be able to satisfy \n     the obligation to decommission the plants, as established by \n     the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and\n       (2) to provide rate making bodies, including the Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission, with sufficient authority to \n     provide for recovery of funds for decommissioning.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to designate the Federal courthouse at 145 East \nSimpson Avenue in Jackson, Wyoming, as the ``Clifford P. Hansen Federal \nCourthouse''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                 Clifford P. Hansen Federal Courthouse\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of \nWyoming's native sons, former Wyoming Governor and United States \nSenator Cliff Hansen. I am pleased that my colleague, Senator Enzi is \njoining me in sponsoring legislation to name the federal courthouse in \nJackson, Wyoming, as the ``Clifford P. Hansen Federal Courthouse.''\n  Wyoming has enjoyed a long history of outstanding leaders and strong \nindividuals. These men and women have sought the best for our small \ntowns with big expectations and in turn have exemplified what it really \nmeans to be a leader in their communities.\n  Senator Cliff Hansen stands with the other Wyoming statesmen that \nhave helped make our state so special and her citizens proud. Today I \njoin my colleagues and Wyoming people to honor him by designating the \nJackson, Wyoming, federal courthouse in his name.\n  Cliff Hansen's career is well known and he has been a fixture of \npublic service in Wyoming and the United States for more than 40 years. \nBeginning with the local school board, to Teton County Commissioner, \nthe statehouse in Cheyenne as Wyoming's 26th Governor, and finally here \nas a distinguished member of the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Cliff Hansen was so well regarded, his leadership so clear, \nthat President Reagan asked him to be Secretary of the Interior not \nonce, but twice. With his experience and expertise gained from working \non issues involving public lands and the environment there is no doubt \nhe would have done an excellent job had he chosen to accept.\n  His has been a remarkable career with a distinguished record.\n  Cliff Hansen and his wife Martha recently celebrated their 65th \nwedding anniversary. What an incredible accomplishment--one of many for \nthis singular Wyoming family that continues to play a significant role \nin the Jackson Hole community in which they live.\n  With their children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren--the \nHansen family is a colorful part of the fabric that makes Jackson and \nthe surrounding areas unique. Cliff Hansen resides and enjoys life in \nJackson, Wyoming under the immense shadow of the famed Grand Tetons. \nLike the Grand, he stands tall in that close community--dignified, \nmultifaceted and solid in his grounding. Our goal as fellow public \nservants should be to aspire to climb to the same personal heights.\n  Senator Hansen is a man who embodies a mix of justice and compassion. \nThat's a combination we need always to strive for. He is a leader, \nquick to care, astutely understanding and finding the best solutions to \nfit the need. Gracing the Federal Courthouse in his hometown with his \nname--considering that great legacy--is an appropriate symbol for what \nhe has always worked for and achieved.\n  I join other Wyoming people who consider Governor, Senator, Cliff \nHansen a worthy citizen. An honorable gentleman who continues to live \nup to the special significance I hope this act will bestow.\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nWyoming's greatest public servants of this century and to support \nlegislation introduced today by my colleague, Senator Craig Thomas, to \ndesignate the federal courthouse in Jackson, Wyoming as the Clifford P. \nHansen Federal Courthouse.\n  When he was elected to the United States Senate in 1966, Clifford \nPeter Hansen had already distinguished himself as a dedicated advocate \nfor the State of Wyoming. Born in Zenith, Teton (then Lincoln) County, \nWyoming, on October 16, 1912, Cliff Hansen attended public schools in \nJackson, Wyoming and graduated from the University of Wyoming in 1934. \nIn that same year, Cliff married his sweetheart, Martha Elizabeth \nClose. For the\n\n[[Page S13185]]\n\npast 65 years the couple has worked side by side to Wyoming's great \nbenefit.\n  As a successful cattle rancher and industry representative, Cliff has \nserved as an officer of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, the \nAmerican National Cattlemen's Association, and the Livestock Research \nand Marketing Advisory Committee. He also served as both the Columbia \nInterstate Compact commissioner and the Snake River Compact \ncommissioner.\n  In 1943 Cliff began his first term as a public official where he \nserved for eight years in the capacity of county commissioner for the \npeople of Teton County. During those same years Cliff became a member \nof the Board of Trustees for the University of Wyoming where from 1955 \nto 1962 he served as board president. Then, from 1963 to 1967 Cliff and \nMartha served as Governor and First Lady of the State of Wyoming.\n  In 1966 Cliff was elected to the United States Senate where he served \nfrom January 3, 1967 until December 31, 1978 when he resigned and was \nreplaced by my immediate predecessor, Former Senator Alan K. Simpson. \nHe passed legislation that still provides for and protects Wyoming. One \nof those, federal mineral royalty sharing, is a major source of revenue \nfor the state.\n  In April 1979 Cliff was awarded the William A. Steiger Award for \npublic service in commemoration of his service to the people of Wyoming \nand the nation.\n  This, however, was not the end of Cliff's dedication to public \nservice. In 1996, the University of Wyoming celebrated the dedication \nof the Cliff and Martha Hansen agricultural teaching center that was \nmade possible by the couple's generous donations to the school.\n  One of the best testimonials about Cliff, however, can be found in \nthe statement by one of his former employees. For the past three \ndecades, the State of Wyoming has benefited by the fine service of \nCorrespondence Coordinator Carroll Wood. Carroll was first hired by \nCliff and has since worked for a total of three Wyoming senators \nincluding myself. On the subject of Cliff Hansen, Carroll writes: \n``Thank God for Cliff Hansen. He gave me the opportunity to work for \nhim and I have survived three different senators from Wyoming. I am \nindeed in his debt for his confidence in me and I will never forget the \nlove he has shown me and my family.''\n  Mr. President, I too thank God for Cliff Hansen. He has dedicated his \nlife to the people of Wyoming and is truly one of the giants of the \nState. Cliff and Martha Hansen are role models for my wife, Diana and \nI. Their continuing concern and consideration for other is unmatched. \nNaming this courthouse after Cliff would provide a small tribute to one \nwho has done so much.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO:\n  S. 1795. A bill to require that before issuing an order, the \nPresident shall cite the authority for the order, conduct a cost \nbenefit analysis, provide for public comment, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                    executive orders limitation act\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Executive Orders \nLimitation Act of 1999.\n  A growing number of Americans have expressed concern that President \nClinton has sought to bypass the constitutional role of Congress by \nissuing Executive orders or proclamations that have the force of law \nand the practical impact of law. Indeed, the use of Executive orders \nhas increased dramatically. For example, the first 24 Presidents issued \n1,262 Executive orders, whereas the last 17 Presidents have issued \n11,798 orders.\n  The bill I introduce today seeks to strengthen article I of the \nConstitution which grants all legislative powers to the Congress. The \nbill seeks to strengthen our system of checks and balances by ensuring \nthat all Executive orders are based on the President's expressed \nconstitutional or statutory authority. The bill would require the \nPresident to cite the exact constitutional or statutory authority he is \nexercising when he issues an Executive order. It would require the \npublication of a cost-benefit analysis and a public comment period \nbefore an Executive order can take effect.\n  The act would also provide for expedited judicial review of \nquestionable Executive orders. The Congress has previously set limits \non the President's ability to issue Executive orders when it required \nthat all orders be printed in the Federal Register. My bill would not \nin any way limit the President's ability to issue an Executive order \nwhich he has the constitutional right to issue. The Executive Orders \nLimitation Act of 1999 seeks to preserve the constitutional separation \nof powers by safeguarding Congress' legislative power, while at the \nsame time protecting the President's constitutional and statutory \nauthorities.\n  The question of how a law is enacted in America was one of the most \nimportant and significant debates in our constitutional convention. \nThat is why we have a system of government established under our \nConstitution by which it is the Congress that makes the law that \ngoverns this Nation. The President then decides, as he has the right to \ndo, whether to sign that law or not. We do not have a system where one \nman or even one branch of our Government has the ability to \nunilaterally create law. Yet that is what the practical effect of the \nuse of Executive orders has become in today's timeframe in the way that \nPresident Clinton has begun using these Executive order powers.\n  This legislation will bring appropriate controls to the issue. If the \nPresident has constitutional or statutorily delegated authority to \nissue Executive orders in a given area, those authorities and those \nrights are preserved. But in those areas where Congress or the \nConstitution have not given the President the authority to enact and \nact as though he were imposing new legal requirements, then that is \nprohibited.\n  This legislation is critical. It should not be deemed a threat to \nanyone from any particular perspective on any issue. It should be \ndeemed what it is, an effort to restore the balance of power and the \nsystem of government, in particular the system of making laws our \nconstitutional founders intended when they created the Constitution of \nthis country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Mack, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n Robb, Mr. Lott, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Helms, Mr. \n Torricelli, Mr. Specter, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Coverdell, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Cleland, and Mr. Santorum):\n\n  S. 1796.

A bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, to \nprovide for a land conveyance to the City of Craig, Alaska, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       alaska native claims settlement act amendments legislation\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to solve a \nproblem unique to Alaska. The city of Craig is located in the far \nsoutheastern part of Alaska on Price of Wales Island, the third largest \nisland in the country. Craig is unlike any other small town or village \nin Alaska. It has no land base upon which to maintain its local \nservices, and no ability to utilize many federal programs which are \ndependent upon a large Alaska Native population for eligibility.\n  Nevertheless, the community has grown from a mostly Native population \nof 250 in 1971 to over 2,500 residents, most of whom are not Alaska \nNatives. Despite this, the town is surrounded by land selections from \ntwo different Alaska village corporations. In fact, 93 percent of the \nland within the Craig city limits is owned by these village \ncorporations. Under federal law passed in 1987, none of the village \nland is subject to taxation so long as the land is not developed. The \ncity of Craig has only 300 acres of land owned privately by individuals \nwithin its city limits to serve as it municipal tax base. It can annex \nno other land because the entire land base outside its municipal \nboundaries is owned by the federal government as part of the Tongass \nNational Forest or other Alaska Native corporation.\n  Craig's demands for municipal services increase every year as costs \ngo up and population increases. According to the State of Alaska, Craig \nis the fastest growing first class city in the state. Since its large \nnon-Native majority population make the town and its residents largely \nineligible for federal programs which service virtually all other ANSCA \nvillages, it has requested a small conveyance of 4,532 acres of federal \nland located not far from the town. That land entitlement would permit \nthe city to develop a land base upon which it could support its \nincreasing demand for municipal services.\n  The land base which is included in this bill has been carefully \nchosen. It is less than 20 miles from the city and abuts the existing \nroad system. It is the first available land from the city limits not \nowned by an Alaska native corporation. The land will complete a sound \nmanagement system by providing municipal ownership of land adjacent to \nboth existing private and state owned land. It will be a good use of \nthis land which is nowhere near any environmentally sensitive lands \nsuch as wilderness areas. This part of Prince of Wales Island has \nroads, communities and other developed sites near it. There will be no \nland use conflicts created by this conveyance.\n  Mr. President, my bill provides a direct grant of 4,532 acres to the \ncity. While I looked at a land exchange, the city has no land to trade. \nThe city received no municipal entitlement because the Forest Service \nnever agreed to any land selection by the State of Alaska in this part \nof Prince of Wales Island. The only substantial land near Craig besides \nthe actual 300 acres on which Craig sits is owned by the federal \ngovernment in the national forest or by Alaska Native corporations.\n  I intend to hold a hearing on this bill early in the next session, \nand begin the process to move the bill through the Senate to final \npassage in the Congress.\n\n

JOHN FRYMOYER\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding Vermonter, Dr. John Frymoyer. John's unwavering commitment \ntoward improving the health of all Vermonters serves as a testament to \nus all. His long and distinguished career began at the University of \nVermont in 1964. Now, as he prepares for his retirement, he is a \nstunning example of how much one person can accomplish in a lifetime--\nhow one person can positively affect so many.\n  John began his career specializing in orthopaedics and quickly became \none of the world's leading authorities on lower back pain--something \nmany of us can relate to. He served as Chairman of the Department of \nOrthopaedic Surgery from 1979-1987, and Chief Executive Officer of the \nUniversity Health Center from 1987-1991. His leadership posts include \nthe Director of the McClure Musculoskeletal Research Center and one of \nthe founders of the Vermont Back Research Center. He also helped launch \nthe acclaimed International Society for the Study of the Lumbar Spine.\n  John was one of the key architects of Fletcher Allen Health Care, \nwhich in 1995 combined the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, Fanny \nAllen Hospital and the University Health Center. In doing so, Fletcher \nAllen emerged as one of northern New England's preeminent health care \nproviders. It was a very bold move, but a necessary one considering the \ndynamics of our health care system. John rose to the challenge, and it \nwas no surprise that he served as Fletcher Allen's first chief \nexecutive officer, simultaneously while he was at the helm of the \nCollege of Medicine.\n  Since 1991, John has served as Dean of the University of Vermont \nCollege of Medicine. Simply put, his accomplishments as Dean are far \ntoo many to list, but certainly, strengthening UVM's research programs, \nbuilding a curriculum for the 21st century, and addressing the unique \nhealth care needs of our rural communities are among them. On a more \npersonal note, whether as Dean, doctor or professor, John was always \napproachable, something I know his students, faculty and staff admired \nand appreciated.\n  I should also acknowledge John's willingness to personally advise me \nover the years on critical health care and education matters. As a \nlongtime member, and now Chairman, of the committee which oversees \nhealth care and education policy, it was comforting to know that I \ncould always rely on John's competence and expertise in such areas as \nmedical research, telemedicine, home health care, graduate medical \neducation and Medicare reform. In this, as in every other capacity, his \nmark has been left far beyond that of the UVM campus. It is this deep \ncommitment to his patients, students and the greater community that has \nendeared him to us.\n  One might imagine that amidst all his responsibilities, John would \nfind little time for extracurricular activities--not so. John is also \nan accomplished organist, a published author and a skilled woodworker. \nIn fact, he designed much of the furniture adorning the Dean's office. \nHe also helped design an extensive playground for Burlington's King \nStreet Area Youth Program, and he served as a captain in the Vermont \nNational Guard for eight years.\n  Vermont has much to be grateful for when it comes to John's steadfast \ncommitment to improving the quality of life in our small state. \nAlthough he is retiring on the last day of this century, it is \nreassuring to know that his legacy will lead the College of Medicine, \nFletcher Allen and the greater community we call Vermont, into the next \nmillennium. For that, Vermont owes a great deal of gratitude to John \nFrymoyer. We wish him well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13188-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13188-S13189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE PASSING OF MR. HARRY VANDEMORE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the memory \nof a departed friend and trusted advisor, Harry VandeMore of Canton, \nSouth Dakota; a lifelong advocate for veterans and the citizens of \nLincoln County, South Dakota.\n  Harry's dedication to community began with his own service in the \nSeventh Infantry Division of the United States Army. He served \nmeritoriously on the frontlines of the Korean War, earning the Combat \nInfantryman Badge for Excellent Performance. Unfortunately, on October \n14, 1952, he received serious combat injuries to the face, left arm, \nand left leg. For two years, he underwent thirty surgeries at Denver's \nFitzsimmons Army Hospital to mend his injuries. As a result of his \ninjuries, he was awarded the Purple Heart.\n  After being discharged, he returned to Hudson, South Dakota, where he \nmarried Rose Ann McNamara, his wife of forty-four years, and farmed the \nlands of Hudson with his parents and brothers. Community was second \nonly to his family. Harry always brought his family to events he \nattended. Many people who worked with Harry knew his children just as \nwell.\n  Harry dedicated his life to veterans ``because he went through it,'' \naccording to Rose, his wife. His first service was to help the \nreturning Vietnam War veterans who were facing mass rejection. Harry \nwas honored by his peers when he was elected to the Disabled American \nVeterans National Executive Committee for the Fourteenth District, \ngaining wide respect serving a four-state region. His dedication was \nalso present with his eighteen years on the state D.A.V. Executive \nCommittee where he served as state commander; with his years as \nAmerican Legion Post Commander in Hudson; and as president of the South \nDakota Veteran's Council.\n  Many have dedicated their life only to this very important cause, but \nHarry also served the whole community with seven years as chairman of \nthe Hudson School Board and his years on the Lincoln County Planning \nand Zoning Commission. It was on the commission where he helped make \nroads safer for fellow farmers because they were farm-to-market roads.\n  Harry was always a valuable citizen-counsel to me. He always helped \nto keep me abreast of veterans' hardships during my days as a state \nlegislator, then as a member of the House, and\n\n[[Page S13189]]\n\nnow, during my service in the U.S. Senate. I will forever miss his \nperspective on the uniquely tragic situation many of America's \nservicemen and women are in today. His life is a model to all South \nDakotans and all Americans.\n  Harry VandeMore will be missed. He served by dedicating his life to \nhis community and comrades, leading by example. As a soldier, a farmer, \na husband and father, and as a public servant, he served not only the \nveterans, who are too often passed over, but the entire community, so \nothers would not have to go through hardship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13189-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GRIZ ACES PROGRAM\n\n Mr. BURNS.

In September 1940, he \nwas called to active duty with the 121st Infantry, Fort Jackson, South \nCarolina. Lt. Col.

Kaufman joined the \nstaff of the First National Bank of Brunswick and retired as Vice \nPresident for Loans in 1977.\n  Lt. Col. Kaufman and his wife Frances had two children who chose to \nfollow in their father's footsteps and join the armed services. Carl \nKaufman retired from the U.S. Air Force with twenty-two years of \nservice, and Col. Daniel Kaufman has served the United States Army for \nthirty-one years and is currently professor and Head of the Department \nof Social Sciences at the United States Military Academy.\n  I am proud to salute Lt.

I am \nproud that the CCMPO has received such a prestigious award for bringing \nthese qualities to their work.\n  The Chittenden County Metropolitan Organization is an effective \nadministrator of federal and state transportation funds, but has gone \nwell beyond this basic role to also develop alternative transportation \nplans and support public transportation systems. The CCMPO has also \ntaken an active role in exploring the relationship between \ntransportation planning and smart growth strategies, helping to make \nVermont a nationally recognized leader in this subject area.\n  Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join the Association \nof Metropolitan Planning Organizations in honoring the members and \nstaff of the Chittenden County Metropolitan Planning Organization for \ntheir significant achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13189-4", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF JUDGE JOHN L.

After serving \nin the District Bankruptcy Court for 35 years, Jack is retiring. As a \nnative of Butte, MT, Jack has become a fixture in the Montana court \nsystem.\n  His tenure on the bench has earned him the distinction as ``Dean'' of \nbankruptcy judges in this century. Jack is a no-nonsense type of judge, \njust ask any lawyer that has ever come before Judge Peterson, they had \nto learn that quickly. He has saved bankruptcy clients and lawyers \nthousands of dollars by pioneering video trials. He has proved over and \nover that he is innovative and effective. As the longest serving \nbankruptcy judge in the United States his experience and wisdom will be \nsorely missed..\n  Although his absence will leave a void in the courts, the handball \ncourts and golf courses in Butte will get to see a lot more of him. \nJack's retirement will also allow him to spend some welcome time with \nhis wife, Jean, his three children and four grandchildren.\n  On behalf of myself and the people of Montana who have benefited from \nJudge Peterson's wisdom and service over the last 35 years, I extend my \nthanks and warmest wishes for a long and happy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13189-5", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13189-S13190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING RAMON DE LA CRUZ\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nefforts of my constituent, Mr. Ramon de la Cruz, who serves as \nPresident of the Hispanic Bar Association, HBA, of New Jersey. Mr. de \nla Cruz is being honored on November 6, 1999 at the Annual Scholarship \nGala of the Hispanic Bar Association of New Jersey, and I am proud to \ncongratulate him on a job well done.\n  Recently, we celebrated National Hispanic Heritage Month. I am proud \ntoday to recognize the efforts of a man and organization who illustrate \nso well the strong work ethic, deep affinity to service and commitment \nto our nation of the Hispanic American community. For countless years, \nHispanic Americans have played an integral role in our legal system, \nand I am proud to represent a state with a large concentration of \nHispanic Americans. Their commitment to this country has not gone \nunnoticed.\n  Ramon de la Cruz has been active with the HBA for the past ten years \nand has served with distinction. He has lent his support to countless \ncauses, including the promotion of qualified Hispanic lawyers for state \nand federal judgeships, creating scholarship opportunities for law \nstudents, and initiating professional exchange opportunities in \nconjunction with other bar associations. Additionally, Ramon has served \nas editor of ABOGADO, the official publication of the HBA, for four \nyears. Furthermore, when it came time to consider candidates for the \nfederal bench, Ramon was one of the people I turned to for assistance. \nI was proud to submit to the White House the nomination of Judge Julio \nFuentes to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and Ramon \nworked extensively with my staff to bring this to fruition. Ramon has \nbeen vital to the success of the Hispanic Bar Association of New \nJersey. Through his efforts, membership has grown to approximately \nthree times that of previous years.\n\n[[Page S13190]]\n\n  Mr. de la Cruz is a resident of Guttenberg in the diverse County of \nHudson, which is home to countless Hispanic Americans that I have the \nprivilege of representing. Since its inception and through Ramon's \nleadership, the HBA has been dedicated to making a real difference in \nour state, and indeed the nation. Ramon has brought vision and new \nenergy to this organization.\n  The judicial branch plays such a critical role in the life of our \ndemocratic institutions, and the industry is well served by true \nprofessionals like Ramon de la Cruz. His credentials and background are \nindeed impressive.\n  The HBA's positive impact on the Hispanic community has spread to \nother communities in a manner that transcends racial and ethnic \ndifferences. Mr. President, activism is important to creating a sense \nof personal responsibility for one's community. The HBA embodies this \nconcept, and should be celebrated for successfully instilling it in \nothers. I take pride in recognizing distinguished individuals in the \ngreat State of New Jersey like Ramon de la Cruz.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13190-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO CITY YEAR'S OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to \ncommend City Year, a community service program which began eleven years \nago in Boston. This landmark program became the prototype for \nAmeriCorps, which celebrates its own 5th anniversary this week.\n  City Year has an impressive history of working closely with Boston's \nMayor Menino to support his work in developing youth leadership, \nprotecting public health, and building stronger local communities. City \nYear also works closely with the Boston Superintendent of Schools, Tom \nPayzant, and other educational leaders to develop innovative \ncurriculum-based service learning projects. City Year has also engaged \narea business in supporting its efforts, so that each year they have \nbeen able to increase its membership and its effectiveness.\n  Today, City Year organizations are found in eleven cities across the \ncountry. Each local corps is dedicated to offering 17-24 year olds a \nchallenging year of full-time service, leadership development and \ncommunity involvement. The founders of City Year--Michael Brown and \nAlan Khazei--has a vision that individuals working together could solve \nalmost any problem. My brothers, President Kennedy and Senator Robert \nKennedy, shared that vision. Today, that spirit of idealism is \ntransforming communities across the country and inspiring thousands of \nyoung men and women to become involved in helping others.\n  A recent article in the Philadelphia Inquirer Magazine eloquently \ndescribes the extraordinary achievements of City Year, and I ask that \nit be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n                              Corps Values\n\n                          (By Melissa Dribben)\n\n       ``Have you heard Robert F. Kennedy's theory about \n     ripples?'' asks Kelly Dura.\n       She tries to summon up the quote. ``It's something like `If \n     you strike out against oppression with ripples of hope . . .' \n     ''\n       She frowns. ``Wait,'' she says, ``it's much better than \n     that. I don't want to guess. I'll get it for you in a \n     minute.''\n       Dura, with a shag of red hair, looks at you straight on, \n     through eyes big and clear as cat's-eye marbles. She wants to \n     get this right. She wants to get everything right.\n       She's 24. A fervent idealist and veteran volunteer with \n     City Year, an urban community service program, which is a \n     division of the national Americorps.\n       If she can't rattle off the quotation verbatim, Dura \n     clearly gets the gist.\n       The words were spoken by Kennedy in a speech about the \n     effect a single person can have on the monumental problems of \n     society. For Dura, as well as the 130 other young men and \n     women who will serve this year in Philadelphia, inspirational \n     quotations are sustenance. They help feed the corps' \n     enthusiasm through what is a frequently difficult, but \n     rewarding, time.\n       The work is hard, and the relationships intense.\n       ``A lot of optimists come in, wanting to change everything \n     right away,'' says Dura. ``You just can't. Change takes \n     time.''\n       City Year volunteers, who receive a small stipend for their \n     work, spend the year in teams of 10, mentoring elementary \n     school students, distributing books to literacy centers and \n     teaching children how to resolve conflicts without the use of \n     knuckles or steel-toe boots. They spend time listening, \n     really listening, to senior citizens in nursing homes, \n     ladling out chicken and noodles in soup kitchens, rebuilding \n     homes with Habitat for Humanity, painting murals on tenement \n     walls and cleaning up weeds and old tires along SEPTA's train \n     tracks.\n       While they are in the program, volunteers must promise not \n     to spew any profanity in public, jaywalk, pierce any part of \n     their face or wear Walkmen while out on the street (in case \n     someone wants to ask them a question about the program).\n       ``It's a sacrifice for a good cause,'' says Nikki Owens, \n     20, a senior corps member, who has had to postpone putting a \n     stud below her lower lip.\n       The volunteers wear uniforms--white polo shirts, khaki \n     pants, work boots and scarlet jackets--provided by \n     Timberland, the program's national sponsor. Locally, their \n     work is supported by corporations, who donate $70,000 or more \n     each year for the City Year projects, a sum matched by \n     federal grants.\n       The program, which is in its 10th year, was started in \n     Boston by two Harvard Law School grads. There are now City \n     Year teams in nine cities, plus Rhode Island. Three years \n     ago, it landed in Philadelphia, where it has been one of the \n     most successful--with the fastest growing membership in the \n     country.\n       Some of the volunteers, like Dura, come from comfortable \n     homes in the suburbs. Some are college graduates trying to \n     find themselves before moving on with their lives and \n     careers. Some are the daughters of drug addicts who grew up \n     in the city's worst neighborhoods, or teenage fathers, or \n     high school dropouts who were floundering until they bumped \n     into a City Year recruitment officer.\n       Dion Jones, 22, had been ``sitting around for a couple of \n     years'' after finishing high school in North Philadelphia. \n     Last year, he was in the Gallery with his 2-year-old son, \n     Saadiq, when the boy saw some balloons at a table and asked \n     his father to get him one. At the table was a representative \n     from City Year, doling out information and application forms. \n     Jones filled one out. ``I didn't know what kind of job it \n     was,'' he says. ``But I needed a paycheck.''\n       A few weeks later, he got a call to come in for an \n     interview. He missed the appointment. And the next. But after \n     the City Year staff called a third time, he showed up.\n       ``I did service in my own neighborhood,'' he says, rubbing \n     the heavy ankh ring on his pinkie. ``The one thing that gives \n     me hope is the kids. They're happy to see you.\n       ``Seeing them smile--it changed me. I've had to be more \n     empathetic. I can't holler or curse. I'm being a role model \n     for my son, 24 hours a day.''\n       At the annual convention, held in Washington, D.C., at the \n     end of May, each city competes for an award--the Cup of \n     Idealism. This year, Philadelphia won. The huge silver cup \n     sits gleaming on a table covered by a red plastic tablecloth \n     in the City Year offices at 23d and Chestnut.\n       A tour takes less than five minutes. There are a few \n     offices and a lot of snapshots of volunteers. I step into the \n     elevator. ``Hold it!'' It is Dura, sprinting down the hall. \n     ``I found the quote.''\n       ``Let no one be discouraged by the belief there is nothing \n     one man or one woman can do against the enormous array of the \n     world's ills. * * * Each time a man stands up for an ideal, \n     or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against \n     injustice, he sends a tiny ripple of hope, and, crossing each \n     other from a million different centers of energy and daring, \n     those ripples build a current which can sweep down the \n     mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/26/senate-section/article/S13190-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 336, S. 1235.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1235) to amend part G of title I of the Omnibus \n     Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to allow railroad \n     police officers to attend the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     National Academy for law enforcement training.\n\n  There being on objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will approve \nS. 1235, legislation which I introduced to provide railroad police \nofficers the opportunity to attend the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation's National Academy for law enforcement training in\n\n[[Page S13192]]\n\nQuantico, Virginia. I thank Senators Hatch, Biden, DeWine, Schumer, \nHelms, and Grams for their co-sponsorship of our bipartisan bill.\n  The FBI is currently authorized to offer the superior training \navailable at the FBI's National Academy only to law enforcement \npersonnel employed by state or local units of government. Police \nofficers employed by railroads are not allowed to attend this Academy \ndespite the fact that they work closely in numerous cases with Federal \nlaw enforcement agencies as well as State and local law enforcement. \nProviding railroad police with the opportunity to obtain the training \noffered at Quantico would improve inter-agency cooperation and prepare \nthem to deal with the ever increasing sophistication of criminals who \nconduct their illegal acts either using the railroad or directed at the \nrailroad or its passengers.\n  Railroad police officers, unlike any other private police department, \nare commissioned under State law to enforce the laws of that State and \nany other State in which the railroad owns property. As a result of \nthis broad law enforcement authority, railroad police officers are \nactively involved in numerous investigations and cases with the FBI and \nother law enforcement agencies.\n  For example, Amtrak has a police officer assigned to the New York \nCity Joint Task Force on Terrorism, which is made up of 140 members \nfrom such disparate agencies as the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service, the \nU.S. Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. \nThis task force investigates domestic and foreign terrorist groups and \nresponds to actual terrorist incidents in the Metropolitan New York \narea.\n  Whenever a railroad derailment or accident occurs, often railroad \npolice are among the first on the scene. For example, when a 12-car \nAmtrak train derailed in Arizona in October 1995, railroad police \njoined the FBI at the site of the incident to determine whether the \nincident was the result of an intentional criminal act of sabotage.\n  Amtrak police officers have also assisted FBI agents in the \ninvestigation and interdiction of illegal drugs and weapons trafficking \non transportation systems in the District of Columbia and elsewhere. In \naddition, using the railways is a popular means for illegal immigrants \nto gain entry to the United States. According to recent congressional \ntestimony, in 1998 alone, 33,715 illegal aliens were found hiding on \nboard Union Pacific railroad trains and subject to arrest by railroad \npolice.\n  With thousands of passengers traveling on our railways each year, \nmaking sure that railroad police officers have available to them the \nhighest level of training is in the national interest. The officers \nthat protect railroad passengers deserve the same opportunity to \nreceive training at Quantico that their counterparts employed by State \nand local governments enjoy. Railroad police officers who attend the \nFBI National Academy in Quantico for training would be required to pay \ntheir own room, board and transportation.\n\n  This legislation is supported by the FBI, the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the Union Pacific Railroad Company, \nand the National Railroad Passenger Corporation.\n  I urge prompt consideration by the House of Representatives of this \nlegislation to provide railroad police officers with the opportunity to \nreceive training from the FBI that would increase the safety of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1235) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1235\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
