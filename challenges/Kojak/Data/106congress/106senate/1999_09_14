Mr. President, I just read a text that was submitted to \nme. I am going to offer what I hope is a slight correction to that for \nthe benefit of all Senators. I believe, as manager of the bill, it is \nhighly possible there are only two other unresolved matters in \nconnection with the Interior appropriations bill. One is, of course, \nthis Bryan-Wyden amendment that will be voted on in about 1 hour. The \nother is cloture on the Hutchison amendment. There was a vote on that \ncloture last night. It failed, but it seemed to have failed primarily \nby reason of absent Senators. The majority leader moved to reconsider \nand, of course, can bring up that motion at any time.\n  As manager of the bill, I do not know of any other amendments that \nwill require rollcall votes. It does not mean there might not be one or \ntwo, but I do not know of any others. We now have two managers' \namendments ready: one dealing with legislative matters and one dealing \nwith money matters, but I hope we will have settled all other \noutstanding issues in connection with the bill. In any event, if there \nare Senators who wish to bring up amendments that they reserved way \nback in August with respect to the bill that are not settled in these \ntwo managers' amendments, I certainly urge them to come to the floor \nand to be prepared to present them immediately after the 10:30 vote on \nthe Bryan-Wyden second-degree amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I see Senator Wyden present, I see Senator \nCraig present, and so we are ready for debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/14/senate-section/article/S10793-7", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10793-S10801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  2000\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the question is now \non amendment 1623 on which there shall be 1 hour of debate which will \nbe equally divided.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair. I would like to take just a few minutes \nnow to speak on behalf of the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment and try \nto offer up to colleagues on both sides of the aisle why Senator Bryan, \nSenator Fitzgerald, and I are trying to incorporate some of the \nimportant thinking that has been done by the chairman of the Interior \nSubcommittee, Senator Gorton, as well as the work with respect to \nforestry done on the floor of the Senate over the last few days by \nSenator Robb of Virginia. It seems to me that Senator Gorton, as well \nas Senator Robb, are making extremely important points. What Senator \nBryan, Senator Fitzgerald, and I are trying to do is build on the work \ndone by both of our colleagues.\n  For example, I think Senator Gorton and Senator Craig are absolutely \nright in terms of saying that the Forest Service has lacked direction, \nparticularly as it relates to the Pacific Northwest. They have known at \nthe Forest Service for many months that they had to comply with each of \nthese survey and management requirements. The Forest Service dawdled \nand dragged its feet. It has been literally flailing around in the \nwoods.\n  I think Senator Gorton and Senator Craig have been absolutely right \nthat there has been a lack of accountability and a lack of oversight \nwith respect to the Forest Service.\n  At the same time, I think Senator Robb has also been correct in terms \nof saying we can't just throw the environmental laws in the trash can \nbecause a Federal agency messes up. You can't just set aside the \nenvironmental laws of the United States because a Federal agency, in \nthis case the Forest Service, has not done its job. You have to figure \nout a way to put this agency and this program back on track.\n  What the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment seeks to do is to get the \nForest Service on track by building on some of the important work done \nby Senator Gorton and Senator Craig, as well as focusing on the \nenvironmental principles pursued by Senator Robb.\n  One of the reasons I so strongly support the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden \namendment is we have seen in past years that throwing money at the \ntimber sale program does not make things better. Each year, since 1996, \nthis Congress has authorized more money for the timber sale program \nthan the administration has asked for. So we have, in effect, shoveled \nmore money out the door for the timber sale program.\n  The fact of the matter is, in spite of the fact the Congress keeps \nspending more money on the timber sale program, the problems in these \nrural communities, particularly the rural West --and these are economic \nand environmental problems--keep getting worse. So the notion that \nthrowing money at the timber sale program is going to solve these \nproblems is simply not correct. The Congress has continued to spend \nmoney. The problems are getting worse, both from an economic and an \nenvironmental standpoint. And that is the bottom line.\n  So what Senator Bryan and Senator Fitzgerald and I are seeking to do \nis to link the money that the Forest Service needs for these important \nprograms--not just in Oregon but across the country--to a new focus on \naccountability.\n  What our legislation does is earmark resources for the important \nenvironmental work that needs to be done and at the same time places a \nstringent timetable on the completion of the important environmental \nwork. So, in effect, we have a chance to do some good by getting the \nenvironmental work done while at the same time helping timber workers \nand environmental concerns addressed in a responsible fashion.\n  We do direct additional funds for the survey and management program \nso we can have the protocols for the species that currently lack this \ndata, but we do it in a way that brings new accountability. This is the \nfirst time on the floor of the Senate that we have tried to take this \nprogram, which has been so mismanaged by the Forest Service, and put in \nplace some real accountability.\n  This is not the old days of just throwing money at problems. This is \na new approach, a fresh and creative approach, that Senators Bryan, \nFitzgerald, and I are trying to offer which will ensure that not just \nin the Northwest but across the country there will be the funds that \nare needed for the timber sale program, but at the same time we are \ngoing to have a real process to watchdog the Forest Service to make \nsure they actually get the work done.\n  With respect to the problems that have shut down the forests in the \nPacific Northwest, our amendment requires that the survey and \nmanagement draft, the environmental impact statement would be completed \nby November 15 of this year. The final version of that impact statement \nwould be published by February 14 of 2000.\n\n  So this gives us a chance, I say to my colleagues, to make sure the \nwork that was promised actually gets done. We fund the timber sale \nprogram at the levels called for by the administration. We have a \nchance to learn from years past that just throwing money at the timber \nsale program does not solve things.\n  I hope our colleagues will realize that this bipartisan approach is a \nchance to solve problems, which is vitally important to rural \ncommunities not just in the West but across the country, while at the \nsame time honoring the important environmental obligations this \nCongress has set out for the Forest Service and other agencies.\n  I do hope that however colleagues voted on the Robb amendment, \nwhatever they think with respect to the original language proposed by \nSenator Gorton, they will look anew at the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden \namendment because what we are seeking to do is build on the important \nprinciples embodied behind both of those positions.\n  My two colleagues are here from the Northwest, the distinguished \nchairman of the subcommittee, Senator Gorton, and the chairman of the \ncommittee on which I serve, Senator Craig. They are absolutely right; \nthe Forest Service has lacked direction. Under the Bryan-Fitzgerald-\nWyden amendment, we put in place that direction and real \naccountability.\n  For those who voted for the Robb amendment earlier, and want to make \nsure environmental laws are respected and honored, we keep in place the \nnotion that you do not throw those laws into the garbage can on \nappropriations bills.\n  So I am hopeful my colleagues will support this on a bipartisan \nbasis. I particularly thank the original sponsor of the legislation, \nSenator Bryan. He has done yeoman work to try to put in place a \nbipartisan coalition. I hope this proposal will be attractive to my \ncolleagues of both political parties.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, good morning.\n  I am not quite sure I know, for all of the Senators who are listening \nthis morning or who will be asked to vote in about 45 minutes, how to \ncapture the essence of this amendment--the first-degree and second-\ndegree amendments--brought to us by the Senator from Nevada and the \nSenator from Oregon.\n  I guess the best way to do that is to kind of take a snapshot back to \n1989 and 1990 when this country had a vibrant forest products industry \nand a green sale program on the forested lands, the forested public \nlands of our Nation.\n  I would be the first to tell you, as I have said over the years, that \nat that\n\n[[Page S10795]]\n\ntime we were probably managing a level of cut on our public lands that \nwas not sustainable. But it was at that time that the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Air \nAct, and the Clean Water Act began to take effect on those lands. We \nsaw some very dramatic reductions in logging.\n  Here is an example of the kind of reductions we have seen since 1989. \nThe Senator from Oregon just spoke. In his State alone, 111 mills and \n11,600 jobs. The Forest Service, by its action, in response to public \npolicy shaped by the Senate, and interpreted by the courts of this \ncountry, caused this to happen by disallowing the availability of \npublic saw logs to 111 mills.\n  My State of Idaho: 17 mills, 770 jobs. That is a comparable impact \nbecause of the number of mills.\n  I spoke yesterday about my community of Midvale--45 jobs in a 300-\nperson community, a big impact. But that mill is gone, torn down, sent \nto Brazil to cut down the rain forest.\n  Literally this mill right here, Grangeville, ID, closed for lack of \ntimber, lack of public timber, lack of public timber by public policy, \nnot for the lack of growth of trees on the Nezperce Forest, torn down \nand sent to Brazil to cut rain forest trees.\n  We have struggled for a decade to try to transform public policy to \nmeet the environmental sensitivity that all of us want the Forest \nService to meet. The chairman of the appropriations subcommittee, \nSenator Gorton, has constantly worked where he could through the \nappropriations process to shape that new policy.\n  We have now reduced the allowable cut on the public forests of our \ncountry, from 1990 to today, by 70 percent, a precipitous drop. In \nother words, if that were the auto industry, GM and Chrysler would no \nlonger exist. They would be gone. Their plants would be torn down and \ntheir people would be strewn across the landscape looking for a new \njob. But it wasn't the auto industry, it was the forest products \nindustry. We have recognized that and tried to reshape it to meet the \nenvironmental standards all of us want our Forest Service to adhere to, \nbut also to wring the politics out of it.\n\n  So there has been a 70-percent decline in logging for timber harvest \nsince 1990; 140,000 people were employed in that industry in 1990; \nthere are 55,000 today. Think of that tremendous flip-flop. Many of \nthose folks don't have jobs yet. When you come to the public lands-\ndependent communities and counties of the West and some places in the \nSouth and Southeast, the unemployment today is not nearly at full \nemployment as are most of our urban communities. It is at 16 and 17-\npercent unemployment. These are former loggers, men and women who made \ntheir jobs in the logging industry--not cutting trees, but working in \nsawmills and selling the product.\n  So that is a snapshot of time. That has all happened since about 1989 \nto 1999. In less than a decade, we have seen the collapse of the forest \nproduct industry of this country, all in the name of the environment, \nwhile we are still growing more trees now than ever in the history of \nour country. We are growing more trees now than when European man came \nto this continent. Our forests, in some instances, are more healthy \ntoday, and in other areas they are devastatingly old, with 30 to 40 \npercent dead and dying. They create phenomenal fire potential \nsituations when the climate goes dry, as they do in the Great Basin \nWest about every 6 years. Yet we have Senators who come to the floor \nand want to reduce the 70-percent reduction again and again and again. \nThat is exactly the intent of the amendment by the Senator from Nevada.\n  So I scratch my head most sincerely, and ask why. It can't be because \nwe haven't reduced the program. It can't be because we are trying to \nbuild environmental sensitivity and shape timber sales so they are much \ndifferent than they were a decade ago. It must be because the national \nenvironmental movement--and the Sierra Club is the best example--in a \nnational policy shaped 3 years ago, said: zero cut of trees on public \nlands. We don't want to see another tree cut.\n  Somehow, other Senators seem to want to echo that and bring it to the \nfloor. I have to believe that is the driving impetus behind this \namendment. I know of no other reason--at least I can't come up with a \ngood one--when you look at the history and recognize what the Forest \nService has done. The Senator from Oregon and I are working together to \nshape policy. The Forest Service has lost its direction. It tried to \ndeal with the National Endangered Species Act and National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, and as it tried to amalgamate these into the \nNational Forest Planning Act and the national forest plans under which \nthe forest operates. The courts have stepped in time and time again and \nsaid, no, you can't do it that way. The reason is that environmental \ngroups have filed lawsuits. We have allowed the courts to become the \nmanagers of our public forested lands, not the U.S. Senate.\n  You and I were elected to shape public policy. The chairman of the \nAppropriations Interior Subcommittee is working to do that. The \nlegislation we have here, which dramatically reduces the overall \nprograms in spending, is to do that. Some instructive words are in \nthere. Even the amendment here, while it is argued to do something \ndifferent, actually goes out on the land to improve existing roads and \nmake them more environmentally sound.\n  Now, it would be argued by some that these are going to be brand new \nroads out through a pristine forest. That is really not true in about \n99 percent of the cases because the Forest Service is not opening up \nnew land. They are going back now in the States of Oregon, Washington, \nand Idaho and recutting old land. So they are taking old roads and \nimproving them and putting in culverts and graveling them and making \nthem more environmentally sound so you don't get sediment creating \nrunoff into the streams and damaging the fisheries. Ninety percent of \nthe very money the Senator from Nevada wants to take out of this bill \nwill go to that kind of reconstruction of the roads.\n\n  Those are the facts. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Forests and \nPublic Land Management, in the last 3 years, we have held 45 hearings \non the U.S. Forest Service. We turned it upside down and we shook to \ntry to figure out why it was the most dysfunctional agency of the \nFederal Government. Here is part of the reason why: Because the \nCongress of the United States, over the last two decades of shaping \npublic policy, didn't blend the policy together and it collided, which \ncaused the Forest Service, in large part, to crash because of lawsuits \nand very dedicated environmental groups who really do want to shut \npublic timber cutting down.\n  For the first time, yesterday, the Senator from Pennsylvania spoke on \nthis. You would not expect Pennsylvania to be involved in this debate. \nYet they have National Forest lands, hard wood lands. They have the \nsame problem. Now lawsuits are being filed there to disallow the cut of \nred cherry and other woods that are critical to the furniture industry \nand to about four counties in Pennsylvania. This amendment affects \nevery State in the United States that has a National Forest so \ndesignated within its boundaries. In some form, it will impact every \none of those States.\n  The second-degree amendment is simply to shift over a little over \none-third of the $34 million that is taken out of the program by the \namendment of the Senator from Nevada to do research. The Senator from \nOregon will argue that it expedites an agenda. I am confident it \ndoesn't because the Forest Service simply can't move that quickly. If \nthey did, they would probably be sued and shut down again.\n  So we can argue on the floor, and we will vote; and it will be a vote \non politics a lot more than on policy or substance, tragically enough. \nI hope the Senate will stand up and say, no, we have reduced the timber \nsales in the United States by 70 percent, and that is enough. We have \nto cut some for health reasons, to clean our forest floors, for our \nstewardship programs, for salvage purposes, get rid of the dead and \ndying in the bug-infested forests that oftentimes breed the kind of \ndeath that when the drought cycle comes and creates the catastrophic \nfires we have seen through the Great Basin, in New Mexico and Arizona, \nwhich we will see once again. This is what is at issue today.\n  I hope the Senate will agree with the chairman of the subcommittee, \nwho spent a great deal of time with those of\n\n[[Page S10796]]\n\nus who are committed to shaping public policy on these most critical \npublic land issues. I believe that is the substance of the amendments \nat hand. I know of no other way to tell about it or to understand it. \nSo if you want to keep ratcheting down the cut to a zero amount on our \npublic lands, then you want to vote for Bryan-Wyden because that is \ntheir answer. If you do that, we will still build homes, but we will \nimport that lumber from Canada and Brazil's rain forests and from \nArgentina and Venezuela and all the other areas and even Norway, \nstrangely enough, but it will not be cut here. Hundreds of communities \nacross this country will die because they are dying now. It is just \nthat we haven't gone to their funerals yet. The rest of these mills \nwill close, and this country will not have something it ought to have, \nwhich is a balanced, multiple-use, environmentally sound stewardship \nprogram for its public lands, which includes some tree cutting where \nnecessary and appropriate.\n  I retain the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I am proud to rise in support of the \nBryan amendment. In fact, I would like to tell the body that I am a \ncosponsor of this amendment, the Bryan-Fitzgerald amendment. It is \ngoing to be second degreed with Senator Wyden's amendment. I continue \nto support the bill. I think it is a reasonable, moderate approach. I \nhave great respect for my colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, and I am \nvery impressed by his concern for his State and the Forest Service, for \nhis knowledge of the area, and for the jobs that are in the timber \nindustry in this country. But I think it is important to notice that \nthis is a very moderate amendment.\n  It does not end timber sales in this country. In fact, it simply cuts \nback an increase that the Appropriations Committee added to the Forest \nService's Timber Sales Management Program--an increase that went $32 \nmillion beyond what the Forest Service chief requested, what the \nadministration requested.\n  This bill simply funds the Timber Sales Management Program at the \nvery same amount that the Forest Service has requested.\n  With all due respect, I have to say that many of the horror stories \nwe heard on the floor last night and this morning about what effect \nthis would have on timber sales and logging in this country are not \ntrue. It is also a very fiscally conservative approach. Of the $32 \nmillion that the Appropriations Committee gave to the Forest Service \nbudget beyond what the Forest Service requested, we are going to apply \n$10 million to reduce our national debt--to pay down that important \ndebt we are trying to eliminate over time. The rest of it we are \napplying for other important priorities such as restoring cuts in the \nfish and wildlife program that were used to, in fact, fund this \nincrease.\n  People might ask why do we need this amendment? In my judgment, \nincreasing the timber sales management budget can't be justified either \non economic grounds or on environmental grounds.\n  First, if I could speak for a moment on the economic grounds, there \nhave been a variety of studies over the recent years that have been \nvery critical of the country's Timber Sales Management Program. All of \nthe different reports have suggested that the program loses money. \nThere have been different studies. Some have suggested--in fact, the \nForest Service itself, I believe, estimated its loss in fiscal year \n1997 at $889 million. But other estimates by other people using \ndifferent accounting methods have suggested that the true net cash loss \nto the taxpayers could be as much as $1.3 billion in fiscal year 1997. \nYou get different amounts depending on which type of accounting you \nwould use to estimate the loss from the timber sales in this country. \nBut whatever the true number is, there is widespread agreement that the \nprogram loses money and that it is a drain on the taxpayers.\n\n  I have to ask why would we want to put more money into a program that \nby everybody's measure loses money for the taxpayers? It doesn't seem \nto make sense economically. Also, environmentally there are many \narguments that appropriate management of our national forests and \nappropriate targeted cuts may actually have a beneficial effect over \ntime.\n  I have talked on several occasions to Senator Craig. I know he \nbelieves strongly that the management of our forests is environmentally \nsound. I would simply point out we are not curtailing all timber sales. \nWe are preserving the status quo in timber sales in this country. This \namendment does not go so far as to end timber sales. It funds them at \nroughly the same level they were funded last year. But we are not going \nto increase it.\n  Obviously, from an environmental standpoint, the timber sales in this \ncountry are very controversial, particularly where you have an old-\ngrowth forest. Forests once cut come back. They grow back. But they \nnever quite grow back in the same way in the same original pristine \nstate that they once were.\n  Over the August recess, I had the occasion to vacation in northern \nWisconsin, in an area that was in the middle of a State forest in \nWisconsin. That whole area, as I understood it from reading the history \nof the region, was completely clearcut in the late 1890s. In the \nintervening 100 years, the forest has grown back. But I read a study of \nthe forest which showed that it didn't come back in the same way. There \nwere different trees that came back. In fact, some of the more valuable \ntrees were not favored in that regrowth process.\n  Once a pure pristine forest is cut, it can never be regained in the \nbeautiful form that it once was. Since those pristine areas in this \ncountry are fewer and fewer now as we enter the third millennium, don't \nwe want to think about how much we want to expand the cutting of our \nnational forests?\n  Finally, one of the points I make is that timber sales from timber \nharvested in our national forests represent only a small portion of our \nNation's timber supply. In fact, I am told--I have seen estimates--that \nas low as 3.3 percent of our timber comes from national forests. We are \nin no way dependent on those national forests in order to meet our \ntimber needs in this country. In any case, this amendment does not cut \nthat amount, whatever it is; it says we are not going to expand it.\n  In sum, I think this is a very well balanced, moderate, measured \namendment. I compliment Senator Bryan, my colleague, and also Senator \nWyden for their work on this.\n  I am proud to support this amendment. I support it with wholehearted \nenthusiasm. While I cannot claim to have the extent of beautiful \nnational forests in my great State of Illinois that some of my \ncolleagues from the West may have, we have the Shawnee National Forest \nin southern Illinois. It is one of the most beautiful parts of our \nState. It is something that is of concern to people right in my State--\nand that we have jobs in that area down in southern Illinois.\n  I very much enjoyed spending 5 days with my family in the Shawnee \nNational Forest about a year or so ago.\n  I am hoping we can go forward into the 21st century finding a way to \nmake sure we have an ample supply of timber in this country but at the \nsame time preserving some of the pristine natural areas in this \ncountry--that we don't go too far in either direction.\n  This is a very well-balanced amendment. I am pleased to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in fiscal year 1990, the Forest Service \nsold 11 billion board feet of timber for harvest and for productive \nuse. For the last 2 years, we have authorized through our \nappropriations 3.6 billion board feet of harvest. The administration \nproposed in its budget for this year 3.2 billion, a further reduction, \nand a reduction from 1990 of 71 percent, as my colleague from Idaho \npointed out.\n  Peculiarly, or interestingly enough, the Forest Service in its actual \nNational Forest Land Management Plan allows for a harvest of about \ntwice this amount. It is only the appropriations level recommended by \nthe administration, and for that matter by this Congress, that has the \nlevel almost 50 percent below what the Forest Service plans say is both \neconomically and environmentally sustainable.\n  That is the first peculiar argument.\n\n[[Page S10797]]\n\n  Second, the committee bill does not increase the allowable harvest. \nIt simply allows the same harvest for next year that appropriations \nbills passed overwhelmingly by this body and signed by the President \nhave permitted for the course of the last 2 years.\n  The question is whether or not we should continue to move toward no \nharvest at all, as many of the national environmental organizations \nrecommend, or whether we should consider continuing the relatively \nmodest harvests that were promised by this President and this \nadministration at the beginning of his Presidency, most particularly in \nthe Pacific Northwest.\n  The Senator from Idaho pointed out that this is not exclusively a \nNorthwest issue; that it applies to forests in other parts of the \ncountry, including the hardwood forests in the Northeast.\n  The original Bryan amendment distributes this money relatively \nwidely--a fairly small percentage of the overall Interior \nappropriations bill--including a modest amount which simply is not to \nbe spent at all and will go to the national debt. Most of that modest \namount, however, is taken up and spent by the Wyden second-degree \namendment that is to be directed at surveys of various species in the \nforests of the Pacific Northwest.\n  About those surveys, the Oregonian wrote an editorial 3 days ago. \nThree paragraphs of that editorial read as follows:\n\n       Maybe now it is finally clear to the Clinton administration \n     that it is fiscally and practically impossible to count every \n     slug, every lichen, every salamander that lives on every \n     timber sale on public forest land in the Northwest.\n       The surveys of rare species of animals and plants required \n     in the Northwest Forest Plan are ``technically impossible'' \n     and ``preposterous,'' in the words of the Society of American \n     Foresters, a professional group holding its national \n     convention in Portland this week. . .\n       Intentional or not, the survey requirement inserted into \n     the Northwest Forest Plan has proven to be a poison pill--a \n     way to block all logging and prevent the plan from working as \n     it was designed.\n\n  That is the end of my quote from that editorial.\n  The Wyden second-degree amendment wastes $10 million. It literally \nwastes $10 million on surveys that are ``impossible'' according to the \nnewspaper, ``preposterous'' according to the Society of American \nFarmers, and ``a poison pill'' for any timber sales whatever.\n  Estimates made during the course of a debate last week on carrying \nout all of these surveys were somewhere between $5 billion and $9 \nbillion--not the $10 million that is included in this amendment. In \nother words, we are being asked by this amendment simply to throw away \n$10 million on useless surveys and at the same time to reduce further a \ntimber sale program, a harvest, that is approximately half of what the \nClinton Forest Service and its forest plans has said is environmentally \nand economically appropriate in the forests of the United States.\n  There is no rational ground for either the first-degree amendment or \nthe second-degree amendment, except for the proposition that we wish to \ndrive as quickly as we possibly can to a situation in which there is no \nlonger any harvest of timber products on the national forests or, for \nthat matter, all of the public lands of the United States. That is a \nconclusion and a goal that is economically unsound, environmentally \nunsound in the United States, bad for our balanced payments, and bad \nfor the management of forests and the rest of the world whose products \nwould be substituted for our own if that goal were reached.\n  I trust that sound judgment and wisdom will prevail and that both of \nthese amendments will be rejected.\n  I want to point out once again that the committee report, the \nAppropriations Committee bill that is before the Senate, does not \nincrease timber harvests on public lands of the United States. It \nretains exactly the level they were authorized for in the current year \nby the current appropriations bill, a level that the Senator from \nIdaho, I, and the junior Senator from Oregon believe already to be \nunwisely low.\n  We did not come here with a controversial point of view; we came here \nwith essentially a freeze. We ask our colleagues to support the \ncommittee in that connection.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nintroduced by the Senior Senator from Nevada that would drastically cut \nfunding for our schools and rural communities. Over the past ten years \nthe federal timber sale program has already declined by more than 70 \npercent to an all-time, post World War II low. This rapid decline has \nbrought with it severe economic instability to resource dependent \ncommunities in rural America.\n  The most visible victims have been rural schools who were dependent \non their share of the 25% payments they received from the proceeds of \ntimber sales to fund such programs as, school lunches, nurses, \ncomputers for the classrooms, and just about any extra-curricular \nactivity that you now see vanishing from America's education system. \nSome school districts have been forced to cut back to 4-day weeks, \nothers have been forced to lay off teachers, and others have dropped \ncourses, all in attempts to survive within diminishing budgets.\n  This instability has also impacted the rest of the community. \nIncreased unemployment has resulted in an increase in domestic \nviolence, family dislocation, substance abuse, and increased welfare \nrolls in rural counties in all regions of the country. More and more \nfamilies and communities have been driven to live near or below the \npoverty level.\n  Many local communities, however, have begun working with their local \nForest Service offices to restore economic equilibrium. They have \njoined with local environmentalists, local governments and industries \nto form coalitions that they hope can help save their schools while \nmaintaining or improving the forest ecosystems in which they live. And \nyet, as quickly as they rebuild, new attacks come to reduce or \neliminate funding for the federal timber sale program. These attacks \nare based on the concept that federal timber sales are below-cost and \neconomic boondoggles for the federal treasury.\n  As a former accountant, I would like us to take a moment to look at \nthis program and to evaluate exactly what is going on with our Federal \nTimber Sale program.\n  The first question we have to ask is: Does the federal timber sale \nprogram constitute a subsidy for the forest products industry, or in \nother words, is the price paid for federal timber below its actual \nmarket value?\n  If federal timber contractors were to receive a special benefit and \npay less money for the timber they harvest on federal lands, then we \ncould say that there is a subsidy. However, Federal timber is sold by \nmeans of a competitive bid system. As a result, these auction sales are \nthe most likely of any type of commercial transaction to generate the \nreturns that meet or exceed market value. Because timber sales are \ndesigned to generate market value prices, we therefore must conclude \nthat there is no subsidy.\n  Furthermore, the forest products industry has been able to \ndemonstrate time and time again that the benefits gained by the public \nthrough the Federal timber sale program far outweigh the costs to the \nFederal treasury.\n  Only twice in the history of the Federal Timber sale program has the \nForest Service reported that the costs of operating the program has \nexceeded revenues, in the years 1996 and 1997. This sudden loss of \nrevenues, however, has not occurred because timber sales are not \nprofitable.\n  A quick breakdown of the timber sale program shows that commercial \nsales still generate a profit for the federal government. The Forest \nProducts industry is still paying its share.\n  What has changed is the focus within the Forest Service to implement \nan increased number of what is called stewardship sales, or timber \nsales designed to improve forest health without necessarily harvesting \nmerchantable timber. These sales are not, and never have been intended \nto make a profit.\n  Because of this increased emphasis on stewardship, there is now \nvirtually no such thing as a purely commercial timber sale on our \nNational Forests. Almost every timber sale released by the United \nStates Forest Service now includes some form of stewardship element \nthat is intended solely for the purpose of improving the health and \nfire resilience of our National Forests. In a sense we now have timber \ncompanies paying for the privilege of improving forest health. As a \nresult, our national timber sale program continues to be the single \nmost effective tool of\n\n[[Page S10798]]\n\nthe United States Forest Service for restoring health to our national \nforests. And our national forests desperately need help.\n  According the Forest Service's own records, more than 40 million \nacres of our national forest system currently exist under an extreme \nthreat of destruction by catastrophic wildfire. An additional 26 \nmillion acres suffer from threat of destruction as a result of disease \nand insect infestation. Without the National Timber Sale program to \nthin out these forests and drastically reduce the amount of combustible \nfuels accumulating in our national forests I can guarantee you that \nwhen these forests burn, not if they burn, but when they burn, habitat \nwill be destroyed, animals will be killed, water tables will be \ndecimated, jobs will be lost, and more communities have to suffer the \npains of rebuilding after another economic loss.\n  Mr. President, it does not make sense to take money from our nation's \nmost effective forest restoration program just to give it to another \nforest restoration program. The Timber Sale Program is currently funded \nat a level very close to last year--an appropriate figure as we work to \nrestore equilibrium in rural economies.\n  This bill, however, does not ignore the other restoration programs. \nWherever possible we have increased funding for watershed restoration, \nroad maintenance, and fish and wildlife management and I hope that we \ncan continue to increase funding for these important programs, but \nwhere we have limited resources, we need to spend our tax dollars in \nthe most effective manner, which means continuing to support the timber \nsale program.\n  In closing Mr. President, I would like to say that the goals of \nenvironmental protection and economic stability are not mutually \nexclusive. We can save our environment without sacrificing rural \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, how much time remains for the proponents of \nthe amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 12 minutes 43 seconds, and \nthe opponents have 10 minutes 4 seconds.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I reserve 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, let me compliment the Senator from Oregon \nfor his leadership in helping craft this very carefully balanced and I \nbelieve very modest amendment. Although the Senator from Illinois has \nleft the floor, I want to compliment him for the clarity of his \ncomments. I think he has put this debate in the proper context.\n  The Senator from Idaho has framed the issue as being for or against \nharvesting timber for commercial sales on the national forests. That is \nnot the issue before the Senate today. This amendment does not deal \nwith that issue. This amendment reduces the amount of money allocated \nfor the commercial timber sales program back to the amount the \nPresident recommended in his budget and the Forest Service, the \nprofessional managers, recommended, which was $196 million.\n  That commercial timber program has been subject to much criticism \nover the years. It is, in my judgment, one of the vestiges of corporate \nwelfare that still exists in the Congress of the United States. \nCourageously, on a bipartisan basis, both parties worked to reform the \nwelfare system. We have already seen enormous benefits as a result of \nthat bipartisan action. For reasons that are not altogether clear to \nme, we have had much less success in removing the vestiges of corporate \nwelfare. It is for that reason that such responsible organizations as \nthe Concord Coalition as well as the National Taxpayers Union are \nstrongly in support of the Bryan-Wyden-Fitzgerald amendment.\n  The commercial timber sales program has been widely criticized \nbecause it is a subsidy. The Forest Service itself has acknowledged \nthat fact. In the most recent fiscal year in which data is available, \nthey have acknowledged that it is an $88.6 million loss to the \ntaxpayer. The General Accounting Office, reviewing the data from 1992 \nto 1997, concluded the American taxpayers have lost some $1.5 billion \nas a result of this program. The Bryan-Wyden-Fitzgerald amendment is an \nattempt to bring some balance to the program.\n\n  My friend from Idaho has suggested that somehow this commercial sales \nprogram deals with forest management. We should be candid: It deals \nwith commercial sales. We are subsidizing some of the largest logging \ncompanies in America. To do so, the appropriators, in changing the \nPresident's recommendation, have stripped money from some of the most \nimportant accounts in the Forest Service.\n  Regarding the road maintenance account, we have in the neighborhood \nof 380,000 miles of roads in the national forests. That is more miles \nthan we have on the National Interstate Highway System. Each one of \nthose miles of new roads that are cut in requires a substantial amount \nof ongoing maintenance to prevent environmental damage. The Forest \nService estimated it would require $431 million annually to begin to \naddress the environmental consequences of some of these roads that have \nbeen cut through the national forest. The backlog is some $3.85 \nbillion. Yet in the bill that the appropriators present to the floor, \nthey have stripped about $11.3 million out of this road maintenance \nprogram.\n  From firsthand experience, based upon our experience in Nevada and \nthe Tahoe Basin, that is a major contributing factor to erosion and \ndegradation of the ecosystem. Yet in terms of priorities, the \nappropriators would set as a priority increasing the timber sales \nprogram and reducing the amount of money available for the road \nmaintenance program.\n  In addition, they have cut substantial amounts of money out of the \nfish and wildlife accounts.\n  Putting the National Forest System in some perspective, only 4 \npercent of the timber harvested in America comes from the National \nForest System. However, it is not the only use that the national forest \nhas. The national forest, as my colleague from Illinois noted in citing \nhis own personal experience, provides an enormous recreational \nopportunity for millions of people. Yet the programs which they depend \nupon--the fish and wildlife accounts to make sure the habitat is there, \nthat the fishery is not devastated as a consequence of some of these \npractices--those accounts have been substantially reduced. The funding \nthat goes to those accounts is an investment in the Nation's 63 million \nwildlife watchers, 14 million hunters, and 35 million anglers who spend \napproximately 127.6 million activity days hunting, fishing, and \nobserving fish and wildlife annually on the national forests.\n  Those who oppose the amendment have cited some of the economic \ncircumstances that have affected the logging industry. Let me suggest \nwith great respect, those are consequences of changing technology. \nThose jobs, I regret to say, will never come back because we harvest \ndifferently. The technology is more efficient. It is less manpower \nintensive.\n  On the other hand, the moneys that we invest in these programs that \ndeal with fish and wildlife directly result in local community \nexpenditures of billions of dollars, in over 230,000 full-time \nequivalent jobs.\n  One out of every three anglers fishes the national forest waters \nnationally, and two out of three anglers in the West fish the national \nforest waters.\n  So what my colleagues from Oregon and Illinois have put together is a \ncarefully crafted balance: Maintain the timber harvest program at a \n$196 million level but do not increase it, because of the massive \nsubsidy involved and the damage that has been done to the national \nforest system; put money back into the road maintenance account to help \naddress that backlog, which is a major contributor to the environmental \ndegradation that the ecosystem, according to the National Forest \nService, is experiencing; restore money to the fish and wildlife \naccounts so we can help those who use the national forests for \nrecreational purposes and address their needs.\n  I think as evidence of how balanced this effort is, the editorial \nsupport is not confined to any particular region. The Chattanooga Times \nexpresses its support for it, as does my own hometown newspaper, the \nLas Vegas Sun, the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, and the San Francisco \nChronicle. All who looked at this recognize this subsidy needs to be \nlimited. What we have done is provide a carefully balanced response to \nthat. I urge my colleagues to\n\n[[Page S10799]]\n\nsupport the Bryan-Wyden-Fitzgerald amendment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 13 seconds.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, let me wrap up by saying that colleagues \ncan see, year after year, this Congress has increased funding for the \ntimber sale program. You can see that pattern since the late 1990s, \ngoing into this year. So all Senator Bryan, Senator Fitzgerald, and I \nare trying to say is that there is more to this question, practicing \nsustainable forestry that will be good for rural communities as relates \nto their economic needs and to their environmental needs--there is more \nto this than just throwing money at the timber sale program.\n  If throwing money at the timber sale program was going to make things \nbetter, all of us in this body would have seen improvements over the \nlast few years. In fact, we have seen the problems get worse. The \nproblems have worsened in so many of these rural communities in both \neconomics and the environment.\n  Much has been made of comments in our newspaper, the Oregonian, \nbecause of the importance of the forest in the Pacific Northwest. The \nOregonian, in their editorial pages, said:\n\n       What is needed is a carefully negotiated agreement on \n     appropriate surveys for rare species and adequate funding to \n     do them.\n\n  That is exactly what the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden package does. For the \nfirst time we link adequate funding for the timber sale program to \nspecific requirements for accountability and oversight. Never before on \nthe floor of the Senate have we made the judgment that is in the Bryan-\nFitzgerald-Wyden package that in fact the Forest Service really has \nlost direction in complying with a lot of these environmental concerns.\n\n  But we do not throw the environmental laws in the garbage can. \nInstead, we have the important effort that was launched by Senator Robb \nand our good friend, Senator Cleland, who is here this morning. At the \nsame time, we agree with Senators Craig and Gorton that we do need to \nput this program on track.\n  So I am very hopeful my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nsee this as a practical approach, an approach that is sensitive to the \neconomic needs of rural communities, an approach that complies with the \nNation's environmental laws and at the same time allows us to be a more \neffective steward of resources for taxpayers in this country.\n  This is not the end of the debate. Certainly what the Oregonian \ncalled for recently--a negotiated agreement on surveys to comply with \nthe environmental rules and adequate funding--is going to have to be \nfleshed out when the House and Senate go to a conference committee. But \nthis is the first step to a fresh approach that links adequate funding \nfor the necessary environmental work with accountability that is long \noverdue at the Forest Service and a chance to meet the economic needs \nof the rural communities.\n  If all that was needed was what some of my colleagues on the other \nside have called for, which is spending more money on the timber sale \nprogram--we would not have many of the problems we are seeing today \nbecause year after year this Congress has put more money in the timber \nsale program. What we need is what Senators Bryan and Fitzgerald and I \nhave talked about on this floor, an effort to link the new focus on \naccountability at the Forest Service with compliance with environmental \nrules and sensitivity to economic concerns.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, every year at this time it seems we are \nhere on the Senate floor debating another attack on the Forest \nService's Timber Management Program. Every year those who wish to \neliminate logging in our national forests come up with another angle \nwhich they claim helps protect the environment by eliminating \n``wasteful'' spending on logging practices. Every year people \nthroughout northern Minnesota and forested regions across the country \nsee their jobs and their livelihoods threatened in the name of \npreservation or conservation. And every year, those of us who represent \nthe good people of the timber and paper industry in our states have to \nfight, scratch, and claw our way to a narrow victory that saves those \njobs and those families from economic ruin.\n  I come from a state in which the forest and paper industry is vital \nto our economy. The reduction in the timber program on national forests \nhas had a dramatic impact over the past ten years on the number of jobs \nand the economic vitality of northern Minnesota. According to Minnesota \nForest Industries (MFI), jobs provided by the timber program in \nMinnesota dropped from over 1,900 in 1987 to less than 1,100 last year, \nand they continue to decline.\n  The reduction in timber harvests on federal lands has had an equally \ndramatic effect on unrealized economic impacts. MFI estimates that \nunrealized economic benefits include over $10 million from timber \nsales, $25 million in federal taxes, $2.5 million in payments to \nstates, and $116 million in community economic impact in Minnesota \nalone.\n  It is important to point out that the timber program in national \nforests has a very positive impact on the amount of federal money that \ngoes to rural counties and schools. Nationally, the program contributes \n$225 million to counties and schools each year through receipts from \ntimber sales in national forests. In Minnesota, the timber program \nprovided roughly $1.7 million to counties and schools in 1998 alone. If \nthe timber program would have met its allowable sale quantity in 1998, \nthat number would have risen to nearly $2.5 million.\n  I am fascinated by the claims of some of my colleagues that the \ntimber program is a subsidy to wealthy timber and paper companies and \nthe claims that the timber program loses money because we are giving \ntimber away to these companies. If you truly believe that, I challenge \nyou to visit northern Minnesota and speak with the families who have \nlost their mills and the loggers who have lost their jobs. Talk to the \ncounties and the private landowners who cannot access to their own \nproperty because the Forest Service doesn't have enough money to do the \nenvironmental reviews. Or talk directly to the Forest Service personnel \nand let them tell you how lengthy and costly environmental reviews and \nthe overwhelming number of court challenges to those reviews is making \nthe timber program so costly.\n  Then go speak with state or county land managers and ask them why \ntheir timber programs are so successful. Ask them why their lands are \nso much more healthy than the federal lands and why they're able to \nmake money with their timber programs. In Minnesota, St. Louis County \nonly has to spend 26 cents in order to generate one dollar of revenue \nin their timber program and the State of Minnesota spends 75 cents to \ngenerate one dollar of revenue. The Superior National Forest, on the \nother hand, spends one dollar and three cents to get the same result.\n  I cannot see how my colleagues can stand here on the Senate floor and \ntell me that the forest and paper industry in our country, and its \nemployees, are the bad guys. The forest and paper industry in America \nemploys over 1.5 million people and ranks among the top ten \nmanufacturing employers in 46 states. These are good, traditional jobs \nthat help a family make a living, allow children to pursue higher \neducation, help keep rural families in rural areas, and provide a \nlegitimate tax base from which rural counties can fund basic services. \nThese are jobs that we in Congress should be working diligently not \nonly to protect, but to grow.\n  Unfortunately, many Members of Congress who advocate these ideas have \nnever taken the time to understand the positive economic and \nenvironmental benefits of science-based timber harvests. They have \nnever sat down with a county commissioner who does not know where he is \ngoing to get the money for some of the most basic services the county \nprovides to its citizens. They have never considered that for every 1 \nmillion board feet in timber harvest reductions in Minnesota, 10 people \nlose their jobs and over $570,000 in economic activity is lost. And \nthey have never taken the time to go into a\n\n[[Page S10800]]\n\nhealthy forest where prudent logging practices have been essential to \nensuring the vitality and diversity of species.\n  If Members of this body want to make the timber program profitable \nacross the country, then we should have an honest debate about what \nworks and does not work in the program. We should discuss frankly the \nridiculous number of hoops public land managers have to jump through in \norder to process a timber sale. I think we need to discuss the fact \nthat under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act the \nfederal government must provide access across federal lands for state, \ncounty, and private landowners to access their land. Yet in Minnesota, \nthose landowners either have to wait a number of years or pay for the \nenvironmental reviews themselves because the Forest Service claims it \ndoes not have enough money. We should also discuss openly the dramatic \nimpact court challenges are having on the ability of the Forest Service \nto do its job and to carry out the timber program in a cost-effective \nmanner. On top of that, it's clear that under this administration the \nForest Service does not want a timber program that shows a profit and \nthey have done an effective job of using the powers of the executive \nbranch to vilify both the timber program and the men and women of my \nstate who rely upon that program in order to meet their most basic \nneeds.\n  Virtually everyone in this body, including this Senator, is committed \nto the protection of our environment and to the conservation of our \nwildlife species and wildlife habitat. I believe we can expand upon our \ncommitment to wildlife and provide additional resources for habitat \nprotection. But I do not believe we must do so on the backs of timber \nand paper workers throughout the nation. I am willing to work with \nanybody in this chamber towards those conservation efforts, but let's \nnot do it by pitting timber and paper workers against conservationists.\n  We cannot simply stand here and claim that the Bryan amendment is an \neasy way to throw some money towards the preservation of public land. \nRather, this amendment is going to take jobs from my constituents and \nhurt the economy of the northern part of my state. The Bryan amendment \nis just one more step down the road toward eliminating logging on \nfederal land. This amendment is going to reduce the ability of a number \nof rural counties in my state to make ends meet and to provide \nnecessary services to residents. Those are just a few of the realities \nof the Bryan amendment and just a few of the reasons why I cannot and \nwill not support its passage.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I want to at least try to shape for the \nRecord some of the facts and statistics that have just been brought \nout. Last year, commercial sales of logs by the Forest Service produced \na profit of $14.7 million. Last year's stewardship sales, the kind that \nthe Senator from Nevada is talking about, for the purposes of forest \nhealth, the kind that is going on in the Tahoe Basin, lost the Forest \nService $57.4 million. Those are the facts from the Forest Service.\n  It is understandable because when you go in to clean up the dead and \ndying and to improve the general health of the forested lands, you are \ndealing with a less valuable stick of timber. But the reality is that \nwhat the Senator from Nevada advocates is, in fact, a losing \nproposition. But I support stewardship, as does the Senator from \nNevada, because it improves the forest health, it improves wildlife \nhabitat, and water quality when it is properly done. It is not a money-\nmaker. It is something that will have to be subsidized.\n  Is the Senator from Nevada willing to say that the company that does \nthe stewardship contract for the Forest Service is a subsidized \nbusiness? He just finished talking about corporate welfare. Is that \nwelfare or is that forest health? Is that an environmentally sound \nthing to do? I think we are getting our facts a bit mixed up.\n  The road maintenance program was not slashed this year; $10 million \nwas added to it. The Senator from Nevada knows the President's budget, \nwhen it came to the Hill, was dead on arrival, and we did not really \nconsider any aspect of it. They wanted more money. They wanted $20 \nmillion. We gave them $10 million. So the program was not slashed; it \nwas added to by $10 million over last year's level. It was reduced from \nthe President's recommendation. I believe that shapes the reality of \nthe facts a bit differently.\n  Let me talk a little more about facts. The Forest Service timber \nprogram generated directly for personal and business incomes this last \nyear over $2 billion. Personal and business income from the timber \nprogram has dropped by almost $5 billion since 1991, for the very \nreasons we have given, because the Forest Service has reduced its \nprogram by 70 percent. We are dealing with less than the 30 percent \nthat remains, and even that produces an income for working men and \nwomen and businesses of around $2 billion.\n  The amendment will continue to reduce this. There is no question \nbecause you are not going to have the money to do the studies, to do \nthe EISs, to produce the sales, and to recondition the roads necessary \nto gain access to that timber. There are over 50 timber-dependent \ncommunities that each receive over $10 million of personal and business \nincome from the forest timber program. There are almost 150 counties \nthat each receive over $1 million. This income is at risk with the \nBryan amendment--no question about it--because he continues to reduce \nthe program.\n  The timber sales program generated $577 million in revenue to the \nGovernment and returned $220 million directly to school districts and \ncounties for their roads and bridges. That is the reality of the money \nfrom the timber program.\n  It is important to understand that when we talk of allocating tax \ndollars to the Forest Service, it is done for the purpose of \nmaintenance and of stewardship. All of these create a healthier, more \nvibrant forest.\n  That is largely the timber sale program today. It is not the large \ngreen-cuts program of a decade ago. Still the Senator from Nevada says \nthat is too much and even used phrases like ``corporate welfare'' this \nmorning. I do not think he would say the companies that are in the \nTahoe Basin today, thinning and taking out the dead and dying and \nimproving the forest health and ultimately improving the water quality \nof that basin, are corporate welfare babies. They are industries hired \nby the Forest Service to improve the health of the forest.\n  The Forest Service timber program generated $309 million in Federal \ntaxes in 1997. This kind of significant economic activity is only when \nwe have a viable timber program. We have reduced it dramatically, the \ntimber program contributed over $700 million in income taxes in 1992. \nAgain, the Bryan amendment will continue to reduce that.\n  We have already talked of the loss of jobs. One-half of the timber \nprogram is stewardship or personal use. Sales are used, again, for the \npurpose of maintaining or improving forest health--thinning, cleaning, \nreducing the fire hazards and the fuel loads. These types of sales are \nalways, as I have just said, marginally profitable, some of them not, \nbut they are done as part of the responsibility of the Forest Service \nto progressively improve the general health of our forested lands.\n  We know that Mother Nature, left to her own decisions in forest \nmanagement, takes a lightning strike where she takes it and oftentimes \nburns down hundreds of thousands of acres, destroying habitat and \ndramatically impairing water quality in that immediate area for several \nyears to come. We know that the hand of man, properly directed, can \nassist in improving the forest health, and that is exactly what many of \nour programs are about today.\n  The amendment will penalize the Forest Service timber program by \nreducing activities that are improving the health that I have talked \nabout and the ecosystems about which all of us are concerned. At the \nsame time, the amendment will throw a monkey wrench into a program that \nis already in trouble and will not contribute increased dollars to the \ncoffers of the Public Treasury.\n  Those are the general issues at hand.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I was just informed, and I think it is reasonable, Mr. \nPresident,\n\n[[Page S10801]]\n\nto suggest if Hurricane Floyd sweeps up the coast and destroys some of \nour timberlands in the next few days, we are going to have the \nPresident come to us asking for emergency moneys in these areas to \nclean up the dead and dying trees in some of those areas, and yet here \nwe are trying to cut it at this moment. I guess we will have to wait \nand see about Hurricane Floyd and forest health.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents of the amendment have 58 \nseconds. The opponents of the amendment have 2 minutes 1 second.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder \nof the time remaining on my side if my colleague from Idaho is prepared \nto do the same.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am, Mr. President. I yield back the remainder of my \ntime. I move to table amendment No. 1588 and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the tumultuous \nevents that have unfolded in East Timor since the August 30 ballot to \ndetermine the territory's political future, and to state clearly what \nthe United States is and should be doing in response to this crisis.\n  How can anyone not be horrified at the blind eye that the Indonesian \ngovernment has turned to the unchecked violence and mass murder being \nperpetrated in East Timor by anti-independence militias--violence that \neven today is blatantly supported by elements of the Indonesian army.\n  In just one week, since the ballot's results were announced on \nSeptember 4, the militias have driven out or slaughtered nearly the \nentire population of the capital city of Dili. East Timor is dotted \nwith villages and cities that have become virtual ghost towns in a \nmatter of days. Many of the people that have been driven out have been\n\n[[Page S10802]]\n\nforced into militia-run refugee camps in West Timor. Mr. President, \nthese innocent civilians are unprotected targets for a group of thugs \nwho are willing to obliterate East Timor completely rather than allow \nit to start down the road to the independence more than 78 percent of \nits people voted for on August 30.\n  The message of the militias is clear: if Indonesia can't have East \nTimor, there will be no East Timor worth having for the East Timorese.\n  Cities are in flames and militia members are stealing anything of \nvalue that they have not destroyed. Churches, usually recognized as \nplaces of sanctuary--even by combatants during war--have been burned \nwith refugees still inside. Mr. President, this is literally a scorched \nearth policy. It is like few of even the worst episodes we have seen in \nthe often bloody 20th century.\n  No segment of the pro-independence population in East Timor has \nescaped the wrath of the militias. Religious leaders, foreigners, and \nthe families of activists have been especially targeted for summary \nexecution. At least 20 priests and nuns across East Timor have been \nmurdered. Three of the priests were among approximately 100 Timorese \nvictims killed in a brutal grenade attack on the town of Suai. Women, \nchildren, and the elderly have been massacred. Members of the United \nNations Assistance Mission to East Timor (UNAMET) have been targeted, \nas have foreign journalists who are trying to cover the atrocities.\n  The leaders of the Timorese independence movement and their families \nare especially vulnerable to attack. Early last week, the Indonesian \ngovernment released independence leader and political prisoner Xanana \nGusmao from jail in Jakarta. On Friday, he learned that his 82-year-old \nfather had likely been murdered by pro-Jakarta thugs, and that his \nelderly mother is missing.\n  Last week, the United Nations evacuated most of its personnel to \nAustralia. About 80 brave UNAMET personnel elected to stay in East \nTimor to try to protect the approximately 1300 East Timorese who \nremained huddled behind the compound's barbed wire fences. They \nremained barricaded in what was left of the UNAMET headquarters for \nabout a week with little, if any, power, water, or working \ntelecommunications lines. Militia members have repeatedly fired into \nthe compound.\n  On Friday, some of the Timorese, including women and children, \ndesperate to escape the violence, climbed the razor-sharp fence \nseparating them from the armed thugs and attempted to find refuge in \nthe hills behind the UNAMET mission. They were fired on by the militias \nas they tried to escape. The unarmed UNAMET personnel were powerless to \nhelp and could only watch in horror as those they had come to help were \nshot down by ruthless opponents of justice, self-determination, and the \nrule of law. Yesterday, the U.N. evacuated most of its personnel and \nthe refugees remained in the compound to Australia.\n  The boldness of the militias, and the complicity of the Indonesian \narmy, and apparently members of the Habibie government, is astounding. \nI am truly shocked by the total impotence or inaction of the Indonesian \ngovernment over the last two weeks. President Habibie promised the \nUnited Nations, the international community, and--most importantly--the \npeople of East Timor, that he would ensure a secure environment in the \nterritory and that the wishes of the Indonesian people would be \nrespected. Neither has happened.\n  Some argue that Habibie may be unable to stop the violence. Others \nsay he is unwilling. His level of control over the army, which he did \nnot consult prior to agreeing to the U.N.-supervised ballot on the \nfuture of East Timor, is, of course, a subject of a lot of debate. \nWhatever the case, Habibie has not made any compelling strong \nstatements condemning this violence, and has made no attempt to reign \nin the army personnel who are participating in this rampage.\n  I am also disturbed by the inaction of the head of the Indonesian \nmilitary, General Wiranto. This past weekend, Wiranto implied that he \nmay not have control of all of his forces. On Saturday, he accompanied \na delegation from the United Nations Security Council to Dili, and he \nsaw for what he said was the first time the devastation in that city. \nSoon after this visit, he said he would recommend that President \nHabibie accept an international peacekeeping force.\n  Finally, under considerable pressure from the international \ncommunity, and with the support of General Wiranto and the head of the \nIndonesian police, Habibie announced early Sunday that his government \nwould allow international peacekeepers, led by Australia, to come to \nEast Timor to restore order and stop the violent rampage of the \nmilitias. But, as is often the case in clashes such as this, his \nannouncement, while welcome, came too late for those Timorese murdered \nby the militias and those hiding in the hills who have been forever \nscarred by the violence and impoverished by the destruction that has \nbeen leveled against the democratic aspirations of the people of East \nTimor.\n  Now that the international community has reached this critical point \nin the transition of the political future of East Timor, Mr. President, \nhere, I think, are the steps that must be taken next.\n  First and foremost, the international peacekeeping force must be \ndeployed at the earliest possible date. I am very concerned at the \nwords of delay coming out of Jakarta this morning.\n  I deeply regret that it took President Habibie so long to recognize \nthe need for international assistance. Now, the Indonesian government, \nmilitary, and President Habibie must cooperate fully with the \ndeployment and must not interfere in the operations of this \npeacekeeping force. They must allow the force to deploy quickly, \nrestore order, and help the East Timorese people to regain a semblance \nof security in their own homes and some hope of actually realizing the \naspirations manifest in the results of the August 30 ballot.\n  I understand that Indonesian Foreign Minister Alatas continues \nmeeting in New York today along with officials from Australia, to \ndiscuss the details of the Security Council mandate for the \npeacekeeping mission. One of those details clearly is to determine the \ncomposition of this international force and the role of the Indonesians \nthemselves in such a deployment. Another should be to lay the \ngroundwork for investigations into the crimes that have taken place in \nEast Timor, including procedures to begin to collect evidence for \nfuture prosecutions.\n  Nobel laureates Jose Ramos Horta and Bishop Carlos Belo have called \nfor the immediate formation of a war crimes tribunal to investigate and \nprosecute those responsible for these vicious crimes. That tribunal \nshould be formed at the earliest possible date. To achieve that goal, \nthe immediate priority of the international community should be to get \nthe peacekeeping forces deployed to gain control of the situation and \nprevent any further bloodshed, and to allow the Timorese that have fled \nto return home.\n  The mandate for the peacekeeping mission should also be clear about \nthe rules of engagement for disarming and detaining members of the \nmilitias. Some militia leaders have said that they will not disarm. \nThis volatile situation poses a grave risk to the peacekeepers, and \nmust be dealt with carefully and expeditiously.\n  Second, we must quickly and concisely define the scope of the U.S. \nrole in this peacekeeping mission. I am pleased that Australia has come \nforward to take the lead on this peacekeeping mission in East Timor, \nand that other countries in the region have offered to contribute \ntroops to this effort. It is my general belief that peacekeeping \noperations should be led by countries in the region where the conflict \nis occurring. I am also troubled by some word this morning that the \nIndonesian government is perhaps balking at the idea of Australia \nleading this mission--which I think is very appropriate, that Australia \ndo so.\n  The militia-led violence, and the blatant collusion of the Indonesian \nmilitary in the commission of that violence, is a direct slap at rule \nof law and the protection for the right to self-determination in \ninternational law and supported by the United Nations. I hope that any \nparticipation by the Indonesian military in this peacekeeping force \nwill be scrutinized. Those who helped perpetrate the violence must not \nbe placed in positions of trust within this operation.\n\n[[Page S10803]]\n\n  I will say more about my views with respect to U.S. involvement in \nthis peacekeeping operation in a few minute.\n  Third, the international community must keep the pressure on the \nIndonesian government. I am pleased that the President of our country \nmade a decision I have advocated for some time to suspend military-to-\nmilitary activities with Indonesia. I am also encouraged that this \ndecision includes halting all new military sales to that country. I \nhope that the President will expand this decision to immediately halt \nany sales currently in the pipeline. If we are to be taken seriously by \nthe Indonesian government, those sales must also be included. And these \nbenefits should not be reinstated until specific steps have been taken \nto implement the results of the August 30 ballot.\n  I have heard many observers argue that Indonesia is too important \nfinancially to the United States and other countries to risk angering \nJakarta. I would argue that no amount of trade is worth East Timorese \nlives. If we truly are to support Indonesia in its transition to true \ndemocracy, we must insist that the violence stop, and we must use every \ncent of our economic leverage to do so.\n  Last week I introduced a bill, S. 1568, that would suspend all \nmilitary and most economic assistance to Indonesia until steps have \nbeen taken to implement the August 30 ballot. I am pleased that the \nAdministration has suspended some military aid. It is now imperative \nthat we keep the pressure on by refusing to reinstate that aid--and by \nthreatening to suspend all other aid--until the results of the August \n30 ballot are implemented. My bill would suspend new assistance and \nsales as well as those loans and purchases currently in the pipeline. \nIn order to be effective, we must stop all aid in its tracks, not just \nnew aid. We should also call on our allies to do the same. The recent \nfinancial troubles in Asia have made Indonesia dependent on bilateral \nand multilateral assistance. We should use that dependence as leverage \nto ensure that the Indonesian government lives up to its commitments in \nEast Timor, including its newly announced willingness to admit a \npeacekeeping force into East Timor.\n\n  In that regard, I am pleased that the European Union yesterday \nannounced that it has suspended all arms sales and military cooperation \nwith Indonesia.\n  That welcome development makes it all the more important that we \ncontinue to push for passage of our legislation to suspend assistance. \nWe must continue to apply the financial pressure provided for in this \nbill so that the Indonesians will understand the continuing U.S. \nresolve to see justice done in East Timor.\n  Finally, the United Nations mandate for this peacekeeping mission \nshould include full access to East Timor for peacekeeping troops, \nhumanitarian workers, and war crimes investigators. The anti-\nindependence movement cannot be allowed to block access to any part of \nEast Timor. In addition, humanitarian workers should also be allowed \nfull access to the refugee camps in West Timor. The nations of the \ninternational peacekeeping force must make clear that no such \ninterference will be tolerated.\n  People are dying. Women and children are being slaughtered while the \npoliticians try to leverage the situation to their advantage. President \nHabibie has a chance to do what is right for his people, and the East \nTimorese people, before he leaves office. The way to salvage what is \nleft of Indonesia's shredded international reputation is to allow \ninternational peacekeepers to deploy rapidly into East Timor to stop \nthis senseless bloodshed.\n  Let me say another word about the U.S. role in this peacekeeping \nmission. As many of my colleagues know, I have been a vocal opponent of \nU.S. deployments to such places as Bosnia and Kosovo. While I support \nthe concept of an international peacekeeping force led by countries \nfrom the region, it is my strong preference as it was in those cases \nthat U.S. troops on the ground in East Timor not be a significant part \nof this peacekeeping mission. Our troops are currently overextended in \nopen-ended commitments in such places as Bosnia, Kosovo, and Saudi \nArabia. We should do whatever we can to limit our involvement in these \nplaces and be very hesitant to get deeply involved in any new missions \nof this sort.\n  That said, however, I am open to supporting a request to the Congress \nfrom the Administration for U.S. financial, diplomatic, communications, \nand logistical support for an international peacekeeping mission to \nEast Timor that is led by countries in the region. The Administration \nmust continue to consult closely with the Congress prior to making any \ncommitment to assist with such a peacekeeping mission.\n  I believe strongly that the United States must develop criteria for \ndeciding whether and where and how deeply to get involved in \npeacekeeping missions abroad. Our men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies deserve to understand the dangers of proposed missions and to \nbe given a good-faith estimate of their length.\n  As my colleagues know, I oppose our continuing involvement in the \nBalkans. The Administration argued that our action against the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia was necessary for humanitarian reasons. The \ntrouble I have with our operations in Kosovo is that we have not shown \nthe same willingness to intervene outside of our hemisphere to places \nlike Rwanda and East Timor. What constitutes a humanitarian tragedy \nthat warrants involvement by the United States military? The answer to \nthat questions seems to change frequently under the current policy. I \nam affraid we really have no policy framework to address this crucial \nquestion. But the question will continue to arise and will do so with \nincreasing frequency.\n  In my view, the legal case for international intervention in East \nTimor is more compelling than the situation in Kosovo because of the \nlong-standing legal disputes over the political status of the \nterritory, as well as the clear expression for self-determination by \nthe people of East Timor on August 30. The people of East Timor cast \ntheir votes in a ballot sanctioned by the Indonesian government and \nsupervised by the United Nations.\n  The East Timorese were promised a secure environment in which to \nexpress their honest views about the political future of their \nhomeland. Instead, they had to endure intimidation by armed thugs \nsupported by the army and by elements of the government that had sworn \nto protect them and to respect their wishes. Yet miraculously almost 99 \npercent of registered voters went to the polls, bringing along their \ncourage and a commitment to freedom. And then when the militias began a \nmurderous rampage, the government did nothing. They would not grant the \ninternational community the power to act.\n  So again, Mr. President, let me reiterate my view of the next crucial \nsteps that must be taken in East Timor.\n  An international peacekeeping force must be deployed as rapidly as \npossible.\n  We must quickly and concisely define the scope of a limited U.S. role \nin the peacekeeping mission.\n  The international community must keep the pressure on the Indonesian \ngovernment, and the peacekeepers, humanitarian workers, and war crimes \ninvestigators must be allowed full access to East Timor. And it all \nmust happen as soon as possible. Thousands of lives and the legitimate \nhopes of a people hang in the balance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from today's New York Times \nentitled ``Effective Force for East Timor'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   An Effective Force for East Timor\n\n       ``We cannot wait any longer,'' Indonesia's President, B.J. \n     Habibie, said on Sunday. ``We have to stop the suffering and \n     mourning immediately.'' With those words, Mr. Habibie bowed \n     to world opinion and agreed to allow international \n     peacekeepers into East Timor. But important, questions remain \n     about when--and with what powers--the force will go in. The \n     international community needs to maintain political and \n     financial pressure on Indonesia to accept a force large and \n     powerful enough to protect East Timor's people--and to do so \n     immediately, before thousands more are killed.\n       Militias created and backed by Indonesia's military have \n     been rampaging in East Timor for months, but the violence \n     dramatically worsened after an Aug. 30 vote that \n     overwhelmingly supported independence for the disputed \n     province, which Indonesia invaded and swallowed in 1975. The \n     militias have set\n\n[[Page S10804]]\n\n     fire to much of the territory and killed perhaps thousands of \n     people, many of them the pro-independence intelligentsia. \n     Others have been rounded up and taken to West Timor, and tens \n     of thousands have fled to the mountains, where they are in \n     danger of starving.\n       Mr. Habibie's announcement that he would accept an \n     international force took considerable political courage, as \n     the idea is hugely unpopular with Indonesians and especially \n     with its powerful military establishment. He agreed after \n     several countries began to cut off joint training exercises, \n     as well as military aid and sales, and important donors and \n     the International Monetary Fund and World Bank suggested that \n     they would condition further assistance on Indonesia's \n     performance in East Timor.\n       The peacekeeping force, which requires the blessing of the \n     United Nations Security Council, would be organized and led \n     by Australia. Australian officials say they will provide \n     about 4,500 of the anticipated 7,000 troops needed if \n     Indonesia's military in East Timor is cooperative. They say \n     they can get 2,000 troops to East Timor within 72 hours of \n     United Nations approval.\n       President Clinton says that Washington does not anticipate \n     providing ground troops for the mission, but that American \n     support forces would assist with logistics, intelligence, \n     airlift and coordination. Australia has maintained that \n     American expertise is needed for these tasks, and this is an \n     appropriate role for the United States.\n       Yesterday the Security Council met to hear a chilling \n     report from a delegation of U.N. ambassadors that had just \n     returned from East Timor, and to begin to negotiate the \n     details of the force. Happily, Indonesia has retreated from \n     earlier statements that the unit should contain only Asians. \n     The world needs to keep up the economic and diplomatic \n     pressure to convince Mr. Habibie that the force must be able \n     to detain militia members or Indonesian soldiers who \n     terrorize the population or menace peacekeepers.\n       President Habibie has already agreed to a commission to \n     look into human rights violations. Those investigators must \n     be able to work freely. Most crucial, Mr. Habibie cannot be \n     permitted to stall. There will soon be nothing left of East \n     Timor to save.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I, again, thank the majority leader for the opportunity \nto address this matter at this time, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/14/senate-section/article/S10804-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10804-S10807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPLORING THE ACTIONS OF PRESIDENT CLINTON REGARDING GRANTING CLEMENCY \n                           TO FALN TERRORISTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. It is my \nunderstanding that we are now on S.J. Res. 33.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. By unanimous consent, there are 2 hours \nof debate on S.J. Res. 33 equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to read the resolution to open \nthis discussion. It is a joint resolution deploring the actions of \nPresident Clinton regarding granting clemency to FALN terrorists:\n\n       Whereas the Armed Forces of National Liberation (the FALN) \n     is a militant terrorist organization that claims \n     responsibility for the bombings of approximately 130 \n     civilian, political, and military sites throughout the United \n     States;\n       Whereas its reign of terror resulted in 6 deaths and the \n     permanent maiming of dozens of others, including law \n     enforcement officials;\n       Whereas 16 members of the FALN were tried for numerous \n     felonies against the United States, including seditious \n     conspiracy;\n       Whereas at their trials, none of the 16 defendants \n     contested any of the evidence presented by the United States;\n       Whereas at their trials none expressed remorse for their \n     actions;\n\n  I am going to repeat that clause, Mr. President:\n\n       Whereas at their trials none expressed remorse for their \n     actions;\n\n       Whereas all were subsequently convicted and sentenced to \n     prison for terms up to 90 years;\n       Whereas not a single act of terrorism has been attributed \n     to the FALN since the imprisonment of the 16 terrorists;\n       Whereas no petitions for clemency were made by these \n     terrorists, but other persons sought such clemency for them;\n       Whereas on August 11, 1999, President William Jefferson \n     Clinton offered conditional clemency to these 16 terrorists, \n     all of whom have served less than 20 years in prison;\n       Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal \n     Bureau of Prisons, and 2 United States Attorneys all \n     reportedly advised the President not to grant leniency to the \n     16 terrorists;\n       Whereas the State Department in 1998 reiterated two long-\n     standing tenets of counter terrorism policy that the United \n     States will: ``(1) make no concessions to terrorists and \n     strike no deals''; and ``(2) bring terrorists to justice for \n     their crimes'';\n       Whereas the President's offer of clemency to the FALN \n     terrorists violates longstanding tenets of United States \n     counterterrorism policy; and\n       Whereas the release of terrorists is an affront to the rule \n     of law, the victims and their families, and every American \n     who believes that violent acts must be punished to the \n     fullest extent of the law: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,  That making \n     concessions to terrorists is deplorable and that President \n     Clinton should not have granted clemency to the FALN \n     terrorists.\n\n  I commend the House of Representatives. It has already passed House \nCongressional Resolution 180: 311 voting aye, 41 voting no, and, in an \nunprecedented act, 72 voting ``present.''\n  I conducted a hearing this morning, the witnesses of which were \nformer New York Detective Senft, former New York Detective Pastorella, \nthe president of the Fraternal Order of Police, Mr. Gallegos, and a son \nof one of the victims of the New York bombing at a restaurant, Fraunces \nTavern, in New York, Mr. Connor.\n  It was a very moving hearing. The two detectives, one of whom, in the \nbombing in New York by this organization, has lost permanent sight in \none eye, some 60 percent of his hearing, and has gone through, I guess, \nsome 16 reconstructive operations. The other detective is permanently \nblind and has lost the majority of his right hand. They made rather \npoignant statements. They said that there would be no pardon for what \nthey had suffered; there would be no clemency; that theirs were life \nsentences. Both nearly lost their lives. One still has metal particles \nin his stomach and shoulders from the bombing.\n  Mr. Connor, very movingly, talked about the notice that he and his \nmother received on his 9th birthday that their father, an innocent 33-\nyear-old, who had taken a client to lunch, had died in the bombing.\n  It was sort of interesting; Detective Senft, 2 years ago, began \nwriting the President about this matter, to which there has been no \nresponse. Several of the witnesses talked about having written the \nAttorney General and the White House, with no response. To me, it is \nhard to imagine that such a letter would come to the White House or to \nthe Attorney General and not be responded to.\n  Lieutenant Senft over 2 years ago wrote and has yet to receive a \nresponse. Mr. Connor cited current law which requires that victims are \nto be notified of the release of prisoners in cases in which they were \ninvolved.\n  None--neither of the detectives nor the Connor family--have been \nnotified at all.\n  One of the concerns that came out of the hearing was to embrace these \nquestions so our committee, and the Judiciary Committee, can make \nappropriate inquiries as to what was done to advise these individuals. \nIn the hearing they pointed out that the clemency advocates have had \nnumerous meetings with the Attorney General's Office and others in the \nGovernment, but those who would oppose it have had none, and requests \nto have these meetings have gone without response.\n  The representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who was to \nhave testified on behalf of the Government to try to explain how this \npolicy would not be incongruous with Federal policy with regard to the \nhandling of terrorists, at 9:30 last night, notified the committee they \nwould not testify, that they had been instructed not to testify by the \nWhite House.\n  So the inquiries over the last 2 weeks to give the administration an \nopportunity to air their view of this circumstance and how it \ninteracted with U.S. policy with regard to terrorism\n\n[[Page S10805]]\n\nwent unheeded, and neither the State Department nor the Justice \nDepartment nor the Federal Bureau of Investigation would even make a \nwitness available on behalf of the committee to air the Government's \nview with regard to this act on the part of the President.\n  No one is challenging the President's right and power to grant the \nclemency. To the extent they say, well, it is a constitutional power, \net cetera, that is a smokescreen. What we are trying to understand is \nwhat its effect is on U.S. policy with regard to terrorism.\n  Interestingly--to comment just a moment or two more on the hearing--I \nposed the question to the witnesses that the President has endeavored, \nin his clemency finding, to draw a distinction for these 16 terrorists, \nindicating they themselves did not actually throw or place the bomb.\n  These were conspirators. These were planners. Senator Sessions so \neloquently stated the other day that one of the reasons they did not \nget to do that is they were caught with all these weapons in their van. \nIn other words, if you are an unsuccessful terrorist, you have a higher \nstanding under U.S. law than if you are a successful terrorist.\n  But when the question was posed to the panel, Mr. Gallegos, who is \npresident of the Fraternal Order of Police, said: Wait a minute. What \nkind of question are we introducing to the adjudication of criminal \nactivity? He said: For example, if you are the get-away driver in a \nbank robbery--you did not actually rob the bank--under U.S. law you are \nas guilty and subject to as much of a punishment as the man who walked \ninto the bank.\n  I mentioned the other day on the floor, under this theory of \nseparation of degree, why is Bin Laden a No. 1 fugitive for the United \nStates? He didn't drop the bombs in Kenya and Tanzania. He was a \nconspirator, as these people were. I asked the question--and I will \nturn to my colleague--what this did to the morale, and New York \nDetective Senft said it undermines every active-duty law enforcement \nofficer. He said, as damaged as he is permanently in life, he took \nsolace that the perpetrators who attacked him were in prison. It has \nbeen a devastating fact for him to know that clemency can be granted \nfor that kind of activity. All of the law enforcement officials said \nthese decisions were particularly devastating to men and women on \nAmerica's front line protecting citizens day in and day out from these \nkinds of hostilities and violence.\n  With that, I yield up to 15 minutes of our time to the Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Gramm.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I inquire of the Senator from Georgia?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May we have some understanding of how the time will be \nallocated? It is my understanding that, generally speaking, we have an \nequal amount of time on a side, and 1 hour is allocated to this debate. \nSenator Conrad is here on the Democratic side; he would like to speak \nfor 10 minutes. I see the Senator from Georgia has at least two \ncolleagues interested in speaking. Could we reach some kind of \nagreement as to how we will proceed?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from \nIllinois, that is a perfectly legitimate question. My idea is to go to \nthe Senator from Texas, back to your side, and then back to our side. \nAfter the Senator from Texas has 15 minutes, of course, which will be \ncounted against our side, it will be about 10 minutes and 10 minutes \nback and forth.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time of the Republican side has \nbeen used to this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Another 15 minutes from your side will mean you have \nconsumed 30 minutes of your 1 hour of debate before we have spoken. So \ncan we agree that after 15 minutes we would have the remaining time \nuntil 12:30?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. With one exception. Senator Kyl has come to the floor \nand asks that we give him some opportunity in that timeframe. I ask the \nSenator from Texas if he might limit his remarks to 10 minutes so we \ncan accommodate Senator Kyl.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have the obligation of chairing a \nnominations hearing in the Judiciary Committee at 2 o'clock, which I am \nsure my colleagues on the other side would like to move forward on, \nsince all of the nominees appear quite qualified and presumably could \nmove forward.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may take 30 seconds to express my \nsupport for what the chairman is doing and then put a statement in the \nRecord. That would be satisfactory from my standpoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have had the pleasure of attending the \nsubcommittee meeting this morning, and I heard witnesses who are \nvictims of the terrorists who were given clemency. It was a \nheartbreaking experience, frankly, because at the conclusion of it one \nunderstands that we haven't closed a chapter by doing this. In fact, \nthe President has probably opened a new chapter. I believe there will \nbe additional terrorism as a result of the clemency that he ordered. I \nhope that will be addressed by this Senate, working together with the \nadministration, so we can continue a policy which has been effective \nheretofore, and that is making certain that terrorists are hunted down, \nprosecuted, and incarcerated so they can't commit terrorist acts again.\n  To the extent the President's actions in this case were different \nfrom that past policy, they should be condemned, and we as a Senate \nshould make sure it doesn't continue in the future. So I commend the \nchairman of the subcommittee for holding his hearing. I indicate again \nthat the Judiciary Committee will have its hearing tomorrow and will \nhave more to say about this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, Senator Gramm is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wasn't aware that there was an \nagreement. Can we restate it so there is a clear understanding? The \nSenator from Texas will speak up to 15 minutes; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I have been recognized for 15 minutes, as I understand it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Then the Senator's side will have the \nremaining time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We will try to maintain the floor until 12:30, which I \nunderstand we have agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me remind everyone how we came to this \npoint under the leadership of Senator Coverdell. A resolution was \nintroduced condemning the President's decision to grant clemency to 16 \nterrorists who were part of a wave of violence and death across the \ncountry that started in the mid-1970s and ended when these terrorists \nwere incarcerated. We sought to bring that resolution to a vote on the \nfloor of the Senate. Our Democrat colleagues, using their rights under \nthe rules of the Senate, objected. We were forced to file cloture to \nforce the consideration of this resolution, and that cloture motion \ncarried. Now we are in the process of debating a resolution where \nCongress, in this instance, takes the strongest action it can under the \nConstitution, and that is condemn the President's actions.\n  The President is given, under the Constitution, the power of pardon. \nThere is nothing we can do that would override that constitutional \nprerogative. But while the President has the right to pardon, I believe \nthe President is profoundly wrong in pardoning these terrorists.\n  Now, I wish I had the ability of our President to articulate so \nclearly and to put a human face on so many of the public policy issues \nhe discusses because there is a very real human issue involved here. It \nstarted with a bombing of historic Fraunces Tavern in Manhattan.\n  This is the front page of the New York Times from Saturday, January \n25, 1975. In this article, in excruciatingly painful and bloody detail, \nit outlines how a bomb was set the day before, how it decimated this \nrestaurant, injured 44 people, killed 4 people, decapitated 1 person. \nThese were innocent people who just had the bad luck to go to lunch at \nthis place, at that time on Friday, January 24, 1975.\n  Some of my colleagues may have read a recent article in the Wall \nStreet Journal, written by two sons of a man who had the bad luck of \ngoing to lunch that day in that tavern. Basically, they put a human \nface on that one brutal\n\n[[Page S10806]]\n\nmurder. The picture they drew was that of a young man who grew up in a \nvery poor family. Actually, he grew up in a Puerto Rican neighborhood \nin New York and worked his way up to be successful. Today, both of his \nsons are investment bankers. So in that sense, he was successful. But \nhe died--and he was 33 years old--because a group of brutal murderers, \ncalling themselves a ``liberation army,'' planted a bomb that day in \nNew York that took this man's life, took him away from his family. The \nFALN--this terrorist group--claimed responsibility and, in fact, left a \nnote near the bomb scene outlining their grievances.\n  They said they had grievances. So they injured 44 people and brutally \nmurdered four people.\n  That started a reign of terror--the greatest terrorist assault in the \nhistory of the United States of America in our homeland among our \npeople, innocent people. This reign of terror continued until these \nterrorists, now pardoned by the President, were arrested and \nincarcerated.\n  Our President says, and I quote, talking about these terrorists:\n\n       They had served very long sentences for offenses that did \n     not involve bodily harm to other people.\n\n  It is true that while they are the core, or were the core, of this \nterrorist organization, while they were its leadership, and while they \nwere arrested and convicted for engaging in terrorist activities--they \nwere convicted of things such as unlawful storage of explosive \nmaterials--it is also true that the terrorist attacks ended when they \nwent to jail.\n  So you can say they weren't convicted of these specific, brutal \ntavern murders in New York. They weren't convicted of the bombing on \nNew Year's Eve in 1982 when a New York City police headquarters and \nother sites were bombed, and in the process you had victims who were \nblinded in both eyes, who lost five fingers on their right hand, who \nlost hearing, who required 13 major surgical operations on their face \nalone, and had 20 titanium screws put in place to hold their face \ntogether. They weren't convicted of those particular crimes, but they \nwere leadership, the core, of the organization that claimed credit. \nThose crimes ended when they went to prison.\n  They were part of the leadership of that organization. They were \naccessories whether they were there and planted the bomb or not; we do \nnot know, we may never know, but they were accessories before and after \nthe fact as part of FALN. Yet the President says they were nonviolent.\n  If you are going to put a human face on it, you would have to go back \nand talk to these police officers who have been blinded, and who have \nhad their faces destroyed. You would have to talk to the children and \ngrandchildren of these people who were murdered in the tavern in New \nYork.\n  I call that violence. I call that a fundamental assault on the \nAmerican people. This is not a violence where someone is selected for \nretribution, wrong as it may be, for an act they committed. This is \nviolence against people who had nothing to do with this desire to see \nPuerto Rico an independent nation. These were people living their \nlives, routinely going about their business, who certainly didn't know \nabout this group, or if they knew, they weren't in any way involved.\n  So to say that these people were nonviolent, who were the core of \nthis terrorist organization that planted 130 bombs that killed and \nmaimed across America, is an outrage.\n  While I know our President has no shame, he ought to be ashamed of \nthat statement.\n  What are we doing? We are here because the President of the United \nStates decided, based on pleas made by various individuals and groups \naround the country to grant a pardon--clemency--to these people who \nwere leadership of a group that planted 130 bombs in America over a 7-\nyear period and that brutally killed and maimed our fellow citizens.\n  I don't understand the President's action. The FBI was reported to be \nopposed to it. The Justice Department and the prosecutors who were \ninvolved were opposed to it. Maybe I should take the Justice Department \nout. I don't know. They probably have not heard about it yet. But the \nprosecutors who were involved were opposed to it. Law enforcement \nofficials across the country were opposed to it. It was supported by \nsome political leaders of the Puerto Rican community in New York.\n  Quite frankly, I don't understand that. Many of these terrorists \nweren't even from Puerto Rico. They were born in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Yet somehow, despite the fact that Americans were killed and maimed, \nthese terrorists are given special status, seemingly because they could \nidentify a cause, a cause, interestingly enough supported by only 2.5 \npercent of the people who voted in the December 1998 plebiscite in \nPuerto Rico.\n  We will never know why the President did this. If he did it to court \npolitical support for Mrs. Clinton running for the Senate in New York, \nit turned out to be a bad deal. It turned out to be something that \nprobably was harmful and not helpful.\n  But let me tell you why I am concerned, which goes beyond politics.\n  What the President did was lower the cost for committing acts of \nterrorism in America. He lowered the cost for committing acts of \nterrorism in America by pardoning people who participated in a reign of \nterror that, as far as I am aware, is unparalleled in America's \nhistory.\n  If we are going to pardon people who brutally murdered innocent \ncitizens, who maimed and mutilated police officers, then what is the \npenalty for terrorism?\n  The President says President Carter urged him to pardon them.\n  It is very interesting to note when these acts of terrorism \naccelerated. In fact, the police headquarters in New York City was \nbombed 3 years after then-President Carter pardoned the Puerto Rican \nterrorists who came into this sacred temple of American democracy--the \nCapitol Building--when there was a quorum call on in the House of \nRepresentatives and stood in the House balcony and shot and wounded \nMembers of the House of Representatives. In fact, there is still a \nbullet hole in the ceiling of the House of Representatives. There is \nstill a bullet hole in the drawer of the Republican leader's desk from \nthat day in 1954.\n  President Carter decided in 1979, 4 years after the Fraunces Tavern \nbombing, to pardon the Puerto Rican terrorists--which is an inaccurate \nmedia description because many of these people were born on the \nmainland of America--who in this great temple of democracy assaulted \ncivilization itself. He pardoned them and let them out of prison.\n  Three years later, this terrorist group bombed New York City police \nheadquarters, the Manhattan office of the FBI, and the Metropolitan \nCorrections Center in New York.\n  Here is the point. Jimmy Carter, as President, lowered the cost of \ncommitting terrorist acts. Those terrorist acts accelerated after that \npardon in 1979.\n  Now the President has pardoned the members of the very group that \nclaimed credit for those acts, and who were convicted, among other \noffenses, of storage of explosives and conspiracy to make bombs. So, \nobviously, they were planning more attacks and more bombing. They \nclaimed credit for the bombings in New York--the bombing of the police \nheadquarters, the killing of innocent citizens, the mutilation of \npolice officers.\n  Now the President has pardoned them. I would like to conclude with \nthese points.\n  The President and his spokesman on many occasions have said that \nfighting terrorism is the No. 1 objective of his administration, that \nthe greatest threat we face in the world today is the threat of \nterrorists. Obviously, there is some other objective somewhere that is \nof a higher order because for some reason the President pardoned these \nterrorists.\n  I think it was a terrible mistake. I believe the American people will \nhold President Clinton accountable for it. I want to know how the \nprocess occurred and whether the process outlined in law was followed. \nWhatever the process was, the decision was wrong. I believe we should \ncondemn it in the strongest possible language.\n  I hope we get strong bipartisan support. I hope we don't have in the \nSenate what we saw in the House when some Democrat Members of the House \ndidn't vote yes and didn't vote no. The best they could do is to say \nthey were there that day, and they voted ``present.'' I don't think \nthis is an issue\n\n[[Page S10807]]\n\nwhere Members want to vote ``present.''\n  I want people to know I think it was an absolute outrage that the \nPresident did this. He ought to be ashamed of it. The American people \nought to hold him accountable. The Congress, in the strongest action we \ncan take in this matter, is deploring the President's action.\n  I thank our colleague from Georgia for his leadership on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on the subject that has been discussed by \nthe Senator from Texas and the Senator from Georgia, I think the \nPresident did make a mistake. I don't think it was appropriate to \nextend clemency to these people. I hope this is an issue that we can \naddress by resolution and make clear where the Senate stands. We are \ngoing to have an opportunity to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/14/senate-section/article/S10807-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10807-S10809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FISCAL YEAR\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this morning I got up and, as is typically \nmy habit, I opened up the Washington Post to see what was there. I \nturned first to the sports page to see how my Baltimore Orioles \nperformed. I got good news there. That was a welcome addition to my \nmorning.\n  On the front page of the Washington Post I was very surprised to see \nthis headline: ``GOP Seeks to Ease Crunch with 13-month Fiscal Year.''\n  I have heard of some gimmicks in my time. Now we see our friends on \nthe other side, who are not able to meet the legal requirement that \nthey pass the appropriations bills on time by October 1, have resorted \nto a new concept. Instead of having a 12-month year, we will have a 13-\nmonth year.\n  I think our friends are going off on a tangent that should not be \npursued. I think this would be a profound mistake. The last thing we \nneed to do is solve our fiscal problems by creating a fiction of a 13-\nmonth year. That isn't what we need to be doing. We need to address \ndirectly and forthrightly the problem we face in trying to avoid \nraiding the Social Security trust fund. Let's do it honestly. Let's do \nit directly. Let's not engage in the fiction of creating a 13-month \nyear in order to resolve the fiscal challenges facing this country and \nthis Senate.\n  That is what the Republicans have come up with. They point out in the \nstory:\n\n       By creating this fictitious 13th month, lawmakers would be \n     able to spend $12 billion to $16 billion more for labor, \n     health, education and social programs than they otherwise \n     would be permitted under budget rules.\n\n  What are we doing? We are going to create a 13th month to deal with \nthe fiscal problems of the country? I don't think so.\n  Senator Specter is apparently one of the backers of this idea.\n\n       ``We all know we engage in a lot of smoke and mirrors,'' \n     said Senator Arlen Specter, chairman of the Senate \n     Appropriations subcommittee, ``But we have to fund education, \n     NIH, worker safety and other programs. It's a question of how \n     we do it.''\n\n  I agree with it being a question of how we do it. The last thing we \nought to do is create a 13-month year. If we want to cause a lack of \nrespect of people in the country for the Congress, this is the way: \nAdopt the Republican proposal that the way to solve our fiscal problem \nis to create a 13th month.\n  I began looking at the calendar to try to figure out where we would \nadd this 13th month, what we would call it. One thought that we had is \nthat maybe we could have January, February, and then ``Fictionary''--\nkind of a fictional 13th month. Maybe that could be the month: January, \nFebruary, and Fictionary.\n  Or maybe we ought to have ``Spend-tember,'' after September, or maybe \nbefore September. We could have ``Spend-tember'' for the 13th month.\n  There is something wrong with what our colleagues on the Republican \nside have come up with. Thirteen months? I don't think the American \npeople are going to buy this. Everybody knows there are 24 hours in a \nday, 7 days a week, and there are just 12 months in a year. Search as \nwe might, here is the calendar; there are only 12 months; there is no \n13th month. That is not the solution to our problem.\n  If we started thinking of where we would add this month, some would \nadvocate two Decembers. That would have a certain attractiveness. We \nwould have two Christmases, all the retail sales twice. That is not a \nbad idea.\n  On this idea the Republicans have come up with for 13 months to solve \nour fiscal problems, my choice is to see 2 Octobers. I am a baseball \nfan. I could have the World Series twice. Others might have a different \nidea of where we could add a month.\n  I must say to our Republican friends, why stop at 13 months? If this \nis the way we are going to solve the fiscal problems of our country, \nlet's go to 14 months, maybe add 15. Somebody in my office suggested we \ngo to 24 months. That way, we would be able to double everybody's \nincome in a single year. We would be able to have twice as much \nspending in a single year if we went to 24 months. I think we have real \nopportunities. If we keep adding enough months, we can completely avoid \nthe Y2K problem altogether. Now this is a real opportunity, and I don't \nthink we want to miss it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, if he yields for a question, if we \ncan extend the year to avoid the tough decisions on the budget and not \nonly avoid Y2K, but we can repeat the month of December and have \nChristmas sales and inject in the economy a lot more life--and of \ncourse kids enjoy Christmas--perhaps the Republican leadership is onto \nsomething by extending the year an additional month for budgetary \npurposes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. There are lots of good ideas coming out on this idea to \nextend the concept that our Republican friends have come up with to go \nto 13 months in a year in order to solve our budget problems. The last \ntime we made a major change in the calendar, it was made by the Pope. I \nam not sure what that says about those putting forward this proposal, \nother than I can't wait to see what they come up with next.\n  I don't think this is the solution to the fiscal problems of America; \n13 months is not the answer.\n  Going back to the headline, it really is kind of stunning: ``GOP \nSeeks to Ease Crunch with 13-month Fiscal Year.''\n  One person who has commented on this in this morning's paper is \nRobert Bixby, head of the Concord Coalition, a budget watchdog group. \nHe says they are degrading themselves and we degrade the budget process \nby resorting to these budget gimmicks.\n  The only disagreement I have with that is, this goes way beyond \ngimmick when all of a sudden we are going to take a 12-month year and \nmake it 13 months to address the budget problems of the country. I \nthink our Republican friends have gone off in the weeds. I hope they \nreconsider. This is a mistake.\n  If we start going in the direction of adding months, where is this \ngoing to stop? We have 12 months. Thirteen months? Fourteen months? Are \nwe going to be able to solve all the problems of the country if we \nstart to engage in fiction? That is not the direction we ought to take. \nDoes my colleague from North Dakota agree?\n  Mr. DORGAN. If my colleague will yield, this is remarkable. I was \neating Grape Nuts, actually, when I read that this morning. That is not \nalways a pleasant experience unless you have plenty of sugar. And then \nyou get the newspaper and you read a headline that says, ``GOP Seeks to \nEase Crunch With 13-Month Fiscal Year.''\n  I am thinking to myself, I have been around this place for some time \nand have grappled with a lot of fiscal policy problems. If we had \nthought of this a long while ago, we would not have all of these \nproblems. If you have a problem, just change the calendar.\n  That would raise of course the question of what to name this new \nmonth. I suppose if they were really serious they could do what all the \nsports stadiums do, and just sell the name. How much money could you \nraise with a Microsoft month or a US Airways month? I suppose there are \nall kinds of possibilities along this line. But I think most people \nwould look at this and say that it is not very serious governance--when \nyou have a problem you cannot fix you create another month and then \npretend you fixed it.\n  Some State legislative bodies have a rule that they must adjourn by a \nparticular time. So what they do occasionally, is to take a black cloth \nand cover\n\n[[Page S10808]]\n\nthe clock. Now we have budgeteers who think the way to solve a fiscal \nproblem is to add another month to the calendar.\n  I don't know. We hear a lot of Byzantine and bizarre suggestions in \nthis Chamber from time to time. But this one has to rank right up \nthere. As a young schoolboy in the southwestern ranching country of \nNorth Dakota, I learned the days of the months through a little ditty. \nWe all know it. Perhaps now it should be changed:\n\n       Thirty days hath September,\n       April, June, and November,\n       All the rest have 31,\n       Except the Republicans,\n       They have an extra month.\n\n  This is going to be confusing to a whole generation of schoolchildren \nif the GOP decides they are going to mess with the calendar.\n  We have had the lunar calendar, the solar calendar, the Gregorian \ncalendar--I assume my colleague explained much of the history of the \ncalendar. Perhaps the creative minds here in the Senate will make \nhistory when they try to find their way out of the corner into which \nthey have painted themselves.\n  Let me yield the floor at this point to my colleague from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Wall Street Journal, back in July, had this headline: \n``The GOP Uses Two Sets Of Books.'' Now we are going to have a new \nheadline: ``The GOP Uses Two Calendars.'' We have the one with 12 \nmonths, which I guess will run all the rest of our lives, but for \nbudget purposes we will have 13 months.\n  The second part of the story in the Washington Post today said: \nSenate Republican leaders embrace a longer fiscal year to ease spending \nwoes. They want to spend the money, but they want to make it appear as \nthough there is less spending in this year, so they add a 13th month. I \ndon't think that is going to fool anybody. It certainly should be \noutside the rules of this body, if we are going to be serious about \nmaintaining the fiscal discipline that has done so much to restore the \nfiscal integrity of this country.\n  For the first time in 30 years, we have been able to balance the \nbudget, largely as a result of the 1993 budget plan we passed. We \nreceived no help from our friends on the Republican side--not a single \nRepublican vote, not one. That was a plan which put us on a path to \nreduce the deficit each and every year of the 5 years of that plan. In \n1997, we added a little bit. That was done on a bipartisan basis. That \nwas good. We did something together.\n  But now our Republican friends are retreating to the notion that the \nway to solve the fiscal problems of the United States is to add a 13th \nmonth. That cannot be a serious proposal. I cannot believe our \ncolleagues are going to engage in that kind of charade and that kind of \ngame and that kind of gimmick in order to address the serious fiscal \nproblems facing the country. After all, this progress has been made--\ngetting our fiscal house in order--having the lowest inflation rate in \n30 years, the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, the longest \neconomic expansion in our history. We are now going to resort to budget \ngimmickry to address the additional challenges that we face? That is \nnot the way a great country does its work.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have had an opportunity to discuss this \na bit, the gimmickry of doing all of these things. I was talking to my \ncolleague, Senator Byrd, who has spent a great deal of time on the \nfloor telling us about Roman history. We were just discussing the front \npage of this morning's newspaper with the headline about the easing of \nthe fiscal crunch by creating a 13th month. Senator Byrd indicated that \nJulius Caesar in trying to reconstruct the calendar, somewhere around \n46 B.C., decided he was going to have a 15-month year. Senator Byrd \nknows about all of these things. He has given wonderful lectures on the \nfloor of the Senate about the rich history of the Roman Empire.\n  I just now learned this from our distinguished colleague. So \napparently, I would say to Senator Conrad, what we are discussing today \nhas been done before. Julius Caesar did it, and he added 3 months to \nthe calendar, apparently.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Certainly.\n  Mr. BYRD. He was assassinated 2 years later, though.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield, it seems to me that lends \ncredibility to the question of whether or not this ought to be done. \nThose of us who wonder whether this is a good idea might take lessons \nfrom the history that is offered by Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Can you imagine? I wonder what is going to happen in the \nschools of America now that the Republicans have said there are 13 \nmonths. Can you imagine the confusion of the elementary schools as they \nare teaching children their months? Where is this month going to fit? \nWhat is it going to be called?\n  I know the Senator from North Dakota has children in school. Have \nthey been advised of this change?\n  Mr. DORGAN. They have already weighed in. They would prefer it fall \nin the summer. My children are in seventh and fifth grades, and if \nthere is to be an extra month, they would prefer it fall somewhere in \nthe summer.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Did they have any idea for a name of the month?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No. In fact, I was thinking this morning when I read this \nthat we probably should have some kind of a contest, to create a name. \nThen too, as I indicated earlier, almost everyone today is selling \nnames. If this is institutionalized as a month without a name, clearly \none could offer it for sale.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Something like Federal Express month?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That's right, or Microsoft month or U.S. Steel----\n  Mr. CONRAD. Microsoft month. That might be a lucrative thing, to \nauction this off. That might be a way to solve the budget problem, \ninstead of going to the 13-month plan the Republicans have, is to \nactually auction off a month. I think kind of the leading alternative, \nat least in my office, is ``Spendtember.'' That has gone over pretty \nwell.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield, there is nothing to stop the \nSenate at 13 months. This relates to the whole aging process, which I \nthink would be of great interest to a number of Senators. If this \nSenate enacted a longer year, and perhaps went to 15, 18, or even 19 \nmonths, we would have folks running for election who are 75 years old \nbut who could claim they are only 68.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator for bringing up this headline. I, \ntoo, was struck by this new concept of adding a month to our calendar \nin order to solve the problems of the country. I agree, it has to be \nhumorous; otherwise, we would all be crying. Because, truly, when I go \nhome what my constituents tell me is what I think everyone is hearing: \nWe have priorities in this country, particularly education. They are \nworried about preschool. They are worried about Head Start. They are \nworried about whether or not their child is in a class that is small \nenough that they get the individual attention they need. They are \nworried about whether or not their teachers have the kind of training \nthey need to teach their children. They certainly are worried about \nschool construction and the ability to send their child to a safe \nschool.\n\n  We had a whole hearing this morning about school violence. But \nteachers have not come to me and said: How do we add this to our \ncurriculum, explaining a whole new month that has been added by the \nSenate?\n  I know my colleague has worked with me on the Budget Committee for \nthe last 7 years. We have worked very hard to reduce the deficit. There \nwas a $300 billion deficit when we arrived here in 1993.\n  We worked hard to be real. Despite the humor we have in this debate \ntoday, we need to get real about the budget; we need to get real about \nour priorities; we need to recognize we cannot put a priority on \neducation verbally and put it at the end of the pile when it comes to \nthe budget and then come up with gimmicks to pay for it.\n  I ask the Senator to comment because we worked on this together for \nmany years.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington. She \nis exactly right. We do face a problem\n\n[[Page S10809]]\n\nthis year, and the problem is we have these budget caps that were \nagreed to in 1997, and now things have gone better than anybody \nanticipated. We have been able to get our fiscal house in order. The \nquestion is how we maintain that discipline and at the same time fund \nthe urgent priorities of the American people, especially education.\n  As was said by budget expert, Robert Reischauer, the former Director \nof the Congressional Budget Office, this notion the Republicans have \ncome up with to just add a 13th month does not solve the problem; it \navoids the problem. We will have spending caps in 2001 and 2002 as \nwell, so all we have done is postpone and magnify the problem. We will \nhave actually made the problem worse.\n  There is humor in this. I think we all see almost a theater of the \nabsurd in the notion that our Republican colleagues have come up with \nas a way to solve the problem, which is to add a 13th month.\n  I say on a serious note, let's not do that. We have had success in \ngetting our fiscal house in order by being straight with the American \npeople, by passing legislation that fits our spending to our income. \nLet's not create a fix such as this in order to support a massive, \nrisky, radical, reckless tax cut scheme which our friends on the other \nside have come up with that threatens the fiscal discipline that has \nbeen put in place, that has put us in such a strong position.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/14/senate-section/article/S10809-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair and my colleague from Georgia.\n  On January 24, 1975, during a busy lunch hour, an explosion ripped \nthrough the historic Fraunces Tavern in New York City, killing four \npeople and injuring 55 others. On August 3, 1977, during the morning \nrush hour, a powerful bomb was detonated in a busy New York office \nbuilding, killing one man and injuring several others. Credit for both \nthese bombings was proudly taken by a terrorist organization calling \nthemselves the FALN, an acronym from a Spanish title meaning the Armed \nForces for Puerto Rican National Liberation.\n  In March of 1980, armed members of the FALN entered the Carter-\nMondale campaign headquarters, bound and gagged women and men inside, \nand held them at gunpoint as they ransacked the offices. The FALN took \ncredit for bombings and incendiary attacks in New York City, Chicago, \nand Washington, D.C., attacks which took place in department stores, \noffice buildings, restaurants, even a women's restroom. In all, the \nFALN has been linked to over 150 bombings, attempted bombings, \nincendiary attacks, kidnappings, and bomb threats, which have resulted \nin the death of at least six people and the injury of at least 70 \nothers.\n  On August 11, 1999, President Clinton, who up to this point had \ncommuted only three sentences since becoming President, offered \nclemency to 16 members of the FALN. This to me, was shocking. And quite \nfrankly, I think I am joined by a vast majority of Americans in my \nfailure to understand why the President, who has spoke out so boldly in \nopposition to domestic terrorism in recent years, has taken this \naction.\n  In subsequent spinning, the White House has pointed out that the 16 \noffered clemency were not convicted of the actual attacks that killed \nor maimed people. But many of these 16 were involved in building bombs, \nand in storing and transporting explosives, incendiary materials, and \nweapons. In one raid alone involving the terrorists President Clinton \nhas released, law enforcement recovered 24 pounds of dynamite, 24 \nblasting caps, weapons, and thousands of rounds of ammunition, as well \nas disguises and false identifications.\n  The administration argues that none of these people were ``directly'' \ninvolved with activities that hurt people. But these people, to the \ncontrary, were convicted of conspiring to commit acts of terrorism. \nAccording to former Assistant U.S. Attorney Deborah Devaney, several of \nthe FALN terrorists were captured in a van full of weapons and others \nwere videotaped making bombs that they planned to use at military \ninstitutions.\n  It is only because of the good work of law enforcement that these \nterrorists were caught and convicted before these deadly devices were \nused to take additional innocent human lives. Osama bin Laden is on the \nFBI's Most Wanted List for conspiring to commit acts of terrorism. \nAccording to the administration's logic, he too should be let go, if \ncaptured, because he was not directly involved in acts of terrorism, \nalthough we all know he has been funding the terrorist acts.\n  The administration also argues that these prisoners received longer \nsentences than they would have under the sentencing guidelines. Well, \nthere are thousands of people in jail who were sentenced before the \nguidelines. Does each of them deserve to have their sentences reduced? \nThe President will have to pick up the pace of clemency offers if he is \nto right all these so-called wrongs in the 15 months left in his term.\n  This whole episode raises a number of questions about this \nadministration's approach to law enforcement and the rule of law in \ngeneral. Were the normal procedures followed in the processing of \nclemency opinions? What set these 16 prisoners apart from the more than \n4,000 who have petitioned this President for clemency, or the other \ntens of thousands serving time across the country? What prompted the \nPresident to make this offer of clemency? Who recommended it? On what \nbasis was it granted?\n  Whatever the administration's arguments, the bottom line is that the \nPresident's ill-considered offer of clemency has now been accepted by \n12 of the 16 FALN members, many of whom are now back on the streets.\n  These are people who have been convicted of very serious offenses \ninvolving sedition, firearms, explosives, and threats of violence. The \nFALN has claimed responsibility for past bombings that have killed and \nmaimed American citizens. I personally pray that no one else will get \nhurt.\n  This is yet another example of this administration sending the wrong \nmessage to criminals, be they foreign spies, gun offenders, or, in this \ncase, terrorists.\n  In this case, it appears President Clinton put the interests of these \nconvicted criminals ahead of the interests of victims, the law \nenforcement community, and the public. I think we need to know: Did the \nJustice Department do its job?\n  There are substantial questions as to whether the normal process was \nfollowed in this case. Reportedly, the President made his clemency \noffer over the strong objections of prosecutors, the FBI, the Bureau of \nPrisons, and the victims of crime. In the Wall Street Journal today, \nMr. Howard Safir, the New York City police commissioner, asserts that:\n\n       In my 26 years as a Justice Department official, I have \n     never heard of a clemency report being delivered to the \n     President over the strenuous objections of these agencies. \n     The Department of Justice and the Attorney\n\n[[Page S10810]]\n\n     General apparently did not even take a formal position on the \n     matter, even though the Department's own rules require doing \n     so.\n\n  Here we have another example of what people suspect: The Attorney \nGeneral is asleep at the switch while the White House runs the Justice \nDepartment.\n  As chairman of the Senate committee with oversight of the Department \nof Justice, I have requested copies of all relevant documents, \nincluding the Department's memo to the White House. Even our colleague, \nSenator Schumer from New York, believes we should have these documents. \nBut so far the Department has refused to turn over anything.\n  The White House and the Justice Department are hiding behind their \ntired, old ploy of ``studying'' whether to assert executive privilege. \nIf the President has confidence that his decision was a just one, then \nhe ought to be willing to hold it up to public scrutiny. There may be a \nlegitimate argument that executive privilege applies to some materials. \nThere is no legitimate reason, however, not to allow the Justice \nDepartment witnesses to appear before Senator Coverdell's hearing this \nmorning about the current status and activities of the FALN. Nor is \nthere any legitimate reason to refuse to allow the Pardon Attorney to \ntestify at my hearing tomorrow about how the clemency process works. \nAre the White House and the Justice Department studying or are they \nstonewalling?\n\n  At the Judiciary Committee hearing tomorrow, we will hear from the \nlaw enforcement community and the victims who have been affected by \nthis grant of clemency. I have invited representatives of the FBI and \nthe Justice Department's Pardon Attorney's Office. I hope the White \nHouse and the Department of Justice will allow them to testify. The \nAmerican people deserve to hear this testimony, and I think the White \nHouse and the Justice Department should not be stonewalling this type \nof investigation by the appropriate branch of Government called the \nCongress of the United States.\n  I believe our entire Nation is being victimized by terrorism. A bomb \nat the World Trade Center, the Oklahoma City Federal Building, or a \nU.S. Embassy abroad has an effect on all of us.\n  This clemency deal is an insult to every American citizen. This \nclemency deal is not humanitarian. It is not just.\n  Exactly what is this? A weak moment? Political favoritism? Another \nforeign policy miscalculation by this administration? I will tell you \nwhat it is. It is plain and simple. It is wrong. That is what it is.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Coverdell resolution so that the \nSenate will be on record as opposing the President's decision to grant \nclemency.\n  We cannot send mixed messages with regard to terrorism. One of the \nmajor problems this country is going to face in the future --as will \nevery free country--will be acts of terrorism by people just like these \nFALN terrorists who put their own beliefs above doing justice and what \nright in society. If the United States continues to show that type of \nsoft-headedness with regard to terrorist activities and terrorists \nthemselves, then we are going to reap a whirlwind in this country, and \nwe will see more acts of terrorism in this country than we ever thought \npossible.\n  I can say with impunity that there are better than 1,500 known \nterrorists and terrorist organizations in the United States of America \ntoday. Frankly, there are a lot more than that. Thus far, the \nadministration, prior to this act, has done a pretty good job of \noffsetting terrorist activities in this country, mainly because of the \nFBI and its good work. I am suggesting that we get on top of this. The \nPresident should be ashamed for doing what he has done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to express may great \nconcern and dismay at President Clinton's decision to offer clemency to \nsixteen convicted terrorists. These individuals were members of the \nFALN, the Armed Forced for National Liberation, which uses violence and \nterror to further its cause of making Puerto Rico an independent \nnation. As a result of their involvement in a series of terrorist bomb \nattacks on United States soil, these individuals have been convicted of \nvery serious offenses.\n  Terrorism is a deplorable act. In recent years we have seen tragic \nattacks on our embassies overseas, and hideous murders in Oklahoma City \nand the World Trade Center. This harvest of death and suffering is what \nterrorism is about. By releasing these terrorists President Clinton has \nmade a terrible mistake. For years our message to terrorist has been \nsimple: ``If you attack, maim, and kill Americans, the United States \nwill hunt you down and punish you. We do not forget, and we will bring \nyou to justice.'' Now the President is saying that we will forget, and \nthat justice can give way to other considerations. That is the wrong \nthing to do.\n  Mr. Gilbert Gallegos, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police, \nwhich represents the Americans on the front lines of the war on \nterrorism, has eloquently condemned President Clinton's actions. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that this letter from Mr. Gallegos \nto President Clinton be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      Grand Lodge,\n\n\n                                    Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n                                 Albuquerque, NM, August 18, 1999.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing this letter on behalf of \n     the more than 283,000 members of the Fraternal Order of \n     Police to express our vehement opposition to your offer of \n     clemency to sixteen convicted felons involved with a wave of \n     terrorist bomb attacks on U.S. soil from 1974-83. I would \n     also like to express my own personal confusion and anger at \n     your decision.\n       Your offer of clemency would immediately release eleven \n     convicted felons who conspired as members of the FALN to \n     plant and explode bombs at U.S. political and military \n     targets. The remaining five would have their criminal fines \n     waived and only two would serve any additional time. These \n     attacks killed six people, wounded dozens and maimed three \n     New York City police officers: Detective Anthony S. Senft \n     lost an eye and a finger, Detective Richard Pastorella was \n     blinded and Officer Rocco Pascarella lost his leg.\n       Your claim that none of these people were involved in any \n     deaths is patently false. As members of the terrorist \n     organization that was planting these bombs, all of them are \n     accessories to the killings as a result of the bomb attacks. \n     Two of the persons to whom you have offered clemency were \n     convicted of a $7.5 million armored truck robbery, which \n     undoubtedly financed the FALN's 130 bomb attacks.\n       These are not Puerto Rican patriots, these are convicted \n     felons who are guilty of waging a war of terror against \n     Americans on American soil to accomplish their political \n     objectives. Why are you rewarding their efforts?\n       I can only assume you are again pandering for some \n     political purpose. This time, Mr. President, it must stop \n     before it begins.\n       The ``human rights advocates'' who are so concerned about \n     the plight of these killers have never shed a tear for the \n     victims. These ``human rights advocates'' are the same people \n     and organizations who maintain that the United States \n     routinely abuses the rights of its citizens and who issue \n     reports stating that our state and local police officers are \n     nothing more than racist thugs who enjoy brutalizing \n     minorities. These ``human rights advocates'' are the same \n     people and organizations who clamor for the release for Mumia \n     Abu-Jamal, a convicted cop-killer, and raise money for his \n     defense.\n       I do not Know, Mr. President, how they decide which rights \n     to advocate and which to ignore, but it seems that murderers \n     and terrorists are more entitled to them than victims. Do not \n     offer clemency to sixteen convicted felons to placate ``human \n     rights advocates.''\n       I would also strongly urge you to reject any inclination or \n     polling data that indicates this will generate sympathy for \n     you or for a Democratic presidential candidate among \n     Hispanic-Americans. As an Hispanic-American myself, I can \n     assure you that releasing violent convicted felons before \n     they have served their full sentences and to waive tens of \n     thousands of dollars in criminal fines, is no way to appeal \n     to racial pride.\n       I sincerely hope, Mr. President, that this ill-conceived \n     notion is consigned to the pile reserved for horrendously bad \n     ideas. Many of the best accomplishments of your presidency \n     stemmed from your commitment to law enforcement and to police \n     officers.\n       This aberration would surely eclipse all we have done to \n     date to keep America safe. Police officers around the \n     country, including me, have stood side by side with you in \n     fighting violent crime and supporting your community policing \n     initiatives. Caving into these advocates is a slap in the \n     face.\n       I look forward to hearing from you about this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Gilbert G. Gallegos,\n                                               National President.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of S.J. Res. 33, a \nresolution which disapproves of the President's decision to grant \nconditional\n\n[[Page S10811]]\n\nclemency for certain individuals who were convicted of crimes related \nto the activities of the Armed Forces for National Liberation and a \nsplinter group called the Macheteros.\n  However, I am disappointed that this issue was turned into a \npartisan, political attack on the President. The original language was \ninflammatory and too broad, accusing the President of sweeping charges \nthat were misleading and inappropriate. Some of the worst rhetoric has \nbeen removed in this version, but in my view it is still too political.\n  In the future, I hope that Congress will prove to more responsible \nand bipartisan when discussing U.S. counterterrorism policy.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to join and associate \nmyself with the remarks of Senator Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. We will be having hearings tomorrow on the pardon of FALN \nterrorist groups.\n  I would like to share a few thoughts at this time. I feel very \nstrongly about this matter. I spent not the 26 years that Howard Safir, \nwho is now the Commissioner of Public Safety in New York, spent with \nthe Department of Justice. But I spent 15 years at the Department of \nJustice.\n  It really troubles me. It very much saddens me to see what is \nhappening to that Department. Senator Hatch said the Attorney General \nis asleep at the switch while the White House runs the Department of \nJustice. Too often that has been true. I hate to say that. I love that \nDepartment of Justice. I respect it.\n  On the facade of the Supreme Court, right across this street, are the \nwords ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' I would like for people to think \nabout a couple of things. Three-thousand people in prison in this \ncountry during the Clinton administration--more than 3,000--asked for \nclemency. This administration followed the procedures established by \nExecutive order in 1893. They referred it to the Department of Justice \nfor a background review and a recommendation. After that was done, only \nthree--only three--had clemency granted to them.\n  A clemency is a very unusual thing. It is to allow somebody to get \nout of jail before they serve their full sentence imposed by a court of \nlaw and affirmed by the appellate courts of this country. So this is \nunusual.\n  Apparently, it was done against the objections of the people who were \ninvolved in the case who knew about it. The prosecuting attorney--the \nU.S. Attorney's Office--apparently recommended no. The FBI, which \ninvestigated the case, said no. The Federal Bureau of Prisons said no.\n  We don't know yet. I hope that we will find out--and I hope this \nadministration does not stonewall--what the Pardon Attorney's \nrecommendation was. It went on up to the Deputy Attorney General of the \nUnited States. So we need to find out what happened. It cannot be, in \nmy view, justice.\n  Some said: Well, what if one of these 16 may not have been personally \ninvolved in the violent act?\n  I want to tell you what a conspiracy means.\n  These individuals knowingly and deliberately joined with a group, \nFALN, which had been involved--and well known in Puerto Rico throughout \nthis country--in public bombings and assassinations and maiming of \nAmerican people. They joined with that group. They were caught with C-4 \nexplosives and truckloads of guns in participation of that effort.\n  I want to note what the law is on that. Under one case in the Fifth \nCircuit, the court held that ``A conspiracy is like a train. When a \nparty knowingly steps aboard, he is part of the crew and accepts \nresponsibility for the existing freight (that was already carried).''\n  That is what we have here. There is no doubt that this group joined \nthis criminal enterprise and participated in it and were apprehended by \ncourageous FBI agents working undercover. There is no doubt that it was \ntried in a high profile case in Chicago, New York, and other places.\n  You can be sure that the Marshals Service and the FBI were guarding \nthe judge, the jury, and the families because this was a big-time \nprosecution of people who were determined to destroy this country and \ndefeat the U.S. Government.\n  That is what it was about. This was a high profile, very intense \neffort. It was done by prosecutors and FBI agents who willingly put \ntheir lives at risk to bring them to bear. And once they were \nconvicted, we have not had any more bombings. It was a successful, \ncourageous effort that saved lives in this country.\n  It is not acceptable for this President to go around the Department \nof Justice professionals, violating President Grover Cleveland's \nExecutive order which he could have changed if he wished to but never \ndid. It is the established procedure--and for reasons that I can only \nconclude have to be political because they certainly cannot be based on \nlaw and fact.\n  I would just say this: Justice is a fragile thing. But I would like \nto ask the American people and the Members of this body to think about \nthis: What about the other 3,000 people who did not get their pardons?\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I did not agree with the President's recent clemency \ndecision, but I recognize that it is his decision to make. When I was \nState's Attorney for Chittenden County, I did not always agree when the \nGovernor of Vermont exercised his clemency power, but I understood that \nit was his to exercise as he saw fit. There were many more numerous \nexercises of this constitutional power by the Republican and Democratic \nPresidents with whom I have served over the last 25 years--President \nCarter used this power over 560 times, President Reagan over 400 times \nand President Bush over 75 times-- and they have not always been \nmatters with which I necessarily agreed.\n  Yesterday I cautioned against the extreme rhetoric of the version of \nthe Lott-Coverdell resolution that was initially introduced. Through \nthe course of the last week some of the misstatements of fact that were \ncontained in that version of the resolution have been corrected and its \nmost extreme and dangerous political rhetoric has been eliminated.\n  The resolution that the Senate will adopt today deletes much of the \noverreaching language of the President's congressional critics. I noted \nyesterday that to contend that the clemency grants showed a weakness of \nresolve against international terrorism was both wrong and might itself \ncontribute to creating a dangerous atmosphere.\n  We ought to be careful when anyone, let alone the Senate and Congress \nof the United States, starts bandying about declarations that accuse \nthe United States Government of making ``deplorable concessions to \nterrorists,'' ``undermining national security'' or ``emboldening \ndomestic and international terrorists.'' Playing politics with this \nmatter and accusing the President of ``undermining our national \nsecurity'' or ``emboldening terrorists'' carries significant risks and \nwas not right. I am glad that language has been eliminated from the \ntext of the resolution.\n  Likewise, some of the factual inaccuracies in the initial draft were \neliminated, including the assertion that the procedure used in these \npetitions was ``irregular'', and the inaccurate assertion that the \nBureau of Prisons had audio recordings indicating that some of the 16 \npersons offered conditional clemency by the President had ``vowed to \nresume their violent activities upon release.'' There was no basis for \nthat assertion, which was inaccurate and unfounded but nonetheless \nincluded in the original resolution. It has now been deleted.\n  Similarly, the substitute resolution eliminates the contention that \nthe President's decision was ``making terrorism more likely and \nendangering'' Americans.\n  Most importantly for the resolution-- and this is after all only a \ncongressional resolution that cannot change the clemency decisions by \nthe President-- the original resolution proposed declaring that the \nPresident had ``made deplorable concessions to terrorists, undermined \nnational security and emboldened domestic and international \nterrorists.'' All of that language has been deleted from the \nresolution. It was extreme and risky political rhetoric and should \nnever have been included.\n  The American people can judge whether the time and energy being \ndevoted by the Congress to this declaration is the best use of the \nthese resources. Yesterday I challenged the\n\n[[Page S10812]]\n\nSenate to make time for votes on the many qualified nominees whom the \nRepublican majority has stalled for the last several years. If the \nSenate has time to debate and vote on this resolution, it should have \ntime to vote on the nomination of Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, which has been pending for over 3\\1/2\\ years. \nIf the Senate has time to debate and vote on this resolution, it should \nhave time to vote on the nominations of Justice Ronnie White to be a \nfederal judge in Missouri, Marsha Berzon to be a judge on the Ninth \nCircuit, Bill Lann Lee to head the Civil Rights Division and to act on \nthe scores of other nominees pending before it.\n  The Senate has not completed work on 11 of the 13 appropriations \nbills that must be passed before October 1. The Republican Congress \ncannot find time for campaign finance reform or a real patients' bill \nof rights or raising the minimum wage or reforming Medicare or \ncompleting the juvenile crime bill conference. The American people will \njudge whether the Senate should be doing its job and attending to its \nconstitutional duties of confirmations and legislation or whether its \ntime should continue to be devoted to partisan politics and attacks on \nthe Executive Branch.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I oppose the President's decision to \ngrant clemency for the FALN terrorists.\n  I oppose clemency for two reasons. First of all, this clemency \ndecision violates the tenets of our counter terrorism policy. Terrorism \nis one of the greatest threats facing our nation. We say that we will \nfight terrorism with every tool that we have. We say that we will make \nno concessions to terrorists. We say that we'll track the terrorists \ndown--no matter where they are, no matter how long it takes. We say \nthat we'll hold them accountable--and punish them to the fullest extent \nof the law. By granting clemency to terrorists, we are saying that \nthese tenets don't always apply. What kind of message does it send to \noffer clemency to those who are guilty of the most heinous and cowardly \ncrimes?\n  Terrorism is a real threat to America--and to individual Americans. \nToo many families are suffering the inconsolable loss of their loved \nones--because some murdering thug wants to make a political point. Too \nmany times, I have called grieving families to express my sorrow. After \nPan Am 103 was destroyed over Scotland, I called the families of seven \nyoung people from Maryland who were brutally and callously murdered. We \nrecently marked the tenth anniversary of this terrible crime--and we \nare still seeking justice. I also think about a young Navy diver from \nMaryland--Robert Stethem--who was murdered in a terrorist attack in \n1985. The victims of terrorism deserve justice that is not watered \ndown.\n  The second reason I oppose clemency is that I am not convinced that \nthe terrorist have expressed sufficient remorse. Each of these \nindividuals had many years to express remorse and renounce violence. I \nhaven't heard that the FALN terrorists have changed their lives to \nreflect a change of heart. I haven't heard about any apologies or \nexpressions of regret. Their renunciation of terrorism was tepid. It \ncame only in exchange for their freedom. I don't consider this true \nremorse. I don't consider this worthy of clemency.\n  So I will support this resolution to disapprove of clemency for \nterrorists. I am sorry that the President chose to shorten the \nsentences of terrorists who feel justified in using violence to achieve \ntheir political goals.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I rise today to condemn the President's use of the \nConstitutional power to grant clemency to FALN terrorists. The members \nof the Armed Forces of National Liberation, known by their Spanish \nacronym FALN, were responsible for 130 bombings in the late 1970's and \nearly 1980's. As a result of these FALN actions, six people died, \nscores of citizens were maimed and injured, and the public at large was \npetrified by an indiscriminate threat.\n  The FALN's stated purpose in conducting this reign of terror was to \nfurther the cause of Puerto Rican independence. But it virtually goes \nwithout saying that there is no justification for this vicious \nlawlessness that terrorized, killed and maimed human beings. After a \nHerculean effort on the part of law enforcement and prosecutors, the \nFALN members were brought to justice and convicted of a variety of \nserious charges including seditious conspiracy.\n  Those who suffered at the hands of the FALN, those whose only crime \nwas to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, had names and lives \nbefore they had the misfortune to encounter an FALN-placed bomb. But \ntheir lives were ended or irrevocably altered by senseless actions. The \nlaw enforcement officers and prosecutors who brought the FALN to \njustice placed themselves at personal risk in their effort to protect \nthe public from the terror of the FALN bombings.\n  On August 11th, the President unexpectedly offered clemency to 16 \nFALN members. Their release was conditioned on each prisoner renouncing \nviolence, obeying a ban on the use of weapons, and refusing \nfraternization with independence leaders. Unbelievably, it was \nindicated that these vague promises would release these individuals \nfrom their sentences--a privilege that he has granted only three times \npreviously. And even more unbelievably, these promises were not \nforthcoming.\n  The President made this clemency offer despite the fact that he was \nadvised against it by the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons, and two United \nStates Attorneys.\n  The President made this offer despite the fact that the jailed FALN \nmembers had illustrated no remorse for their actions. This became \npainfully clear on this past weekend's ``Meet the Press'' where Ricardo \nJimenez, one of the freed conspirators, appeared. Mr. Jimenez \nidentified himself as a freedom fighter and justified his criminal \nactions as a remedy for Puerto Rican ``colonization.''\n  Mr. Jimenez is not unique among the FALN conspirators in his utter \nlack of remorse for the terrorist bombings. Unbelievably, in fact, \nBureau of Prison audiotapes have captured several of the former FALN \nmembers recently released from prison saying they would return to \nviolence upon release.\n  By releasing prisoners convicted of serious crimes, for which they \nshowed no remorse, based on only the promise that they will not commit \nsuch crimes again, the President has undermined the standard for \neligibility for the extraordinary remedy of clemency.\n  There is no recourse from the President's action, which was based on \nhis unquestioned Constitutional authority. The Senate can only express \nour sentiment that his actions were appalling and dangerous. Therefore, \nin the strongest possible terms, I support the resolution offered today \ncondemning the President's action.\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to make clear that, while I \nwas not able to vote on S.J. Res. 33, I am very much in favor of this \nresolution and I am pleased that it passed today. Had I been present, I \nwould have voted in favor of it. It is important for the Senate to \nvoice its concerns about the President's actions when they infringe on \nour Nation's best interests. Given the long and disturbing history of \nthe FALN terrorists who were recently released, I believe that this \nPresident's actions with regard to those terrorists did, in fact, \nundermine our Nation's policies against terrorism.\n  On January 24, 1975, a New York city tavern was ripped apart by a \nbomb that killed 4 people and injured more than 50 others. A radical \nPuerto Rican nationalist group known as the Armed Forces for National \nLiberation (FALN) claimed responsibility for the act and was later \nimplicated in more than 100 bombings across the United States. Several \ndetectives were maimed as a result of these bombings and suffer to this \nday from the terrorism perpetrated by FALN.\n  Sixteen FALN terrorists were eventually convicted in the 1980's for \nviolent offenses related to the bombings, including armed robbery, \nweapons violations, and seditious conspiracy, a rarely invoked but \npowerful criminal charge reserved for people whose intent is to \nundermine the Government of the United States.\n  Their history makes it clear that FALN was a dangerous terrorist \nfaction whose members deserved the punishment they received. It is for \nthese reasons that I was appalled when President Clinton offered to \ngive these terrorists an early release from prison, ignoring unanimous \nopposition from federal law enforcement professionals and\n\n[[Page S10813]]\n\nsiding with liberal human rights activists and Puerto Rican nationals. \nEleven FALN terrorists were released from federal prison last Friday.\n  As you know, Mr. President, I chair the Senate Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary, which funds the \nFBI and other law enforcement agencies that are responsible for our \nNation's counterrorism strategy. Over the last few years we have \nsignificantly increased the resources available to law enforcement and \nnow have in place for the first time a coordinated, government wide \nstrategy to deter and respond to terrorism. Releasing convicted \nterrorists before they serve their full sentence sends the wrong \nmessage about how our Nation will deal with people who use violence to \nachieve their political objectives.\n  There is no question that the President has the authority under the \nConstitution to grant pardons and reprieves for offenses against the \nUnited States. Once a pardon or clemency offer is official, no one can \nreverse or overturn the decision, not even the Congress or the Supreme \nCourt. Given the magnitude of this power, the question that should be \nasked is why the President would use it to give convicted terrorists an \nearly release from prison, especially the fact that President Clinton \nhas reduced sentences in only 3 out of 3,042 prior cases.\n  Hearings will be held in this body and in the House of \nRepresentatives in the next few weeks, and they should aggressively \nquestion the administration's reasons for this act. These hearing \nshould explore how the clemency offer supports the State Department's \nantiterrorism policy which states that the United States shall ``make \nno concessions and strike no deals and will bring terrorists to justice \nfor their crimes.''\n  The primary argument for clemency appears to be that none of the 16 \nFALN members were directly involved in any of the bombings. However, \nalmost all of them were convicted for seditious conspiracy--the purpose \nof which was to wage a campaign of terror against the United States \nGovernment. Osama bin Laden may not have lit the fuse that detonated \nthe bomb, but his participation in a conspiracy to commit these acts \nwould be enough to incarcerate him for life. In addition, the Clinton \nadministration contradicts its tough stance on gun violence by \nreleasing these terrorists, almost all of whom were convicted of \nvarious gun violations, including armed robbery.\n\n  Another explanation floated by the administration is that the \nsentences are too stiff. The President's early release certainly \nchanges that. Eleven of the convicted FALN members are now free. Two \nothers will serve additional time, and three others will be released \nfrom paying the remainder of their criminal fines. However, the \nsentencing judge's decision to order maximum prison terms was based on \nthe evidence in the case and the fact that none of the FALN members \nshowed any remorse for their acts at the time of sentencing. One \nsentencing judge indicated that he would have ordered the death penalty \nfor one of the terrorists who showed no regret for his acts, but it was \nunavailable as an option. It is presumptuous for the President to grant \nclemency on the grounds that the federal judge who heard the testimony \nand saw the evidence firsthand imposed a sentence that was too severe.\n  In fact, Oscar Lopez-Rivera, one of the FALN terrorists that \nPresident Clinton offered to release early, had this to say in an \ninterview with the Associated Press last year,\n\n       I have no regrets for what I've done in the Puerto Rico \n     independence movement . . . This onus is not on us. The crime \n     is colonialism. . . . If Puerto Rico was not a colony of the \n     United States, I would have had a totally different life.\n\n  Mr. Lopez-Rivera was convicted of numerous charges, including weapons \nviolations and conspiracy to transport explosives with intent to \ndestroy government property.\n  Our judicial system also provides an absolute right of appeal for \ncriminal convictions. Superseding the judicial system should be \nreserved for cases in which the facts are clear and the benefits of \nrelease outweigh the dangers. That balancing test is not met in this \ncase.\n  Many people have speculated that the President's decision was an \neffort to woo the large Puerto Rican constituency in New York where \nMrs. Clinton is likely to run for the U.S. Senate. It is not too much \nto imagine that the Clinton administration would jeopardize our \nnational security to court potential voters based on their record of \npoliticizing federal agencies, so I believe it should be examined \nduring congressional hearings as a possible motivating factor.\n  One of our government's primary responsibilities is to safeguard the \nfreedom and liberty of its people. Given the growing terrorist threat \naround the world, now is not the time to go easy on convicted \nterrorists. Over 700 people died last year and more than 6,000 were \nwounded from the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania last year. The \nWorld Trade Center bombing and the Oklahoma City bombing are fresh \nreminders of the violence that can be wrought by terrorists. Releasing \nterrorists before they serve their full sentence sends the wrong \nmessage and undermines our nation's tough stance against \nterrorism.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time remains on this debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 39 minutes remaining, with 16\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining on the Senator's side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/14/senate-section/article/S10813-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10813-S10815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE REMAINING SENATE BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one of the items previously discussed \ndeserves further exploration; that is, the whole question of what we \nare going to do in the closing weeks to meet the Senate's obligation to \nthe people of this country, to deal with the most basic \nresponsibilities of this Chamber.\n  The most basic responsibility, of course, is to meet and pass the \nspending bills necessary for the orderly operation of the Federal \nGovernment. For those who are not students of the process, the fiscal \nyear that we work under starts on October 1, and we are supposed to \npass 13 different spending bills so that come October 1, the actions of \nGovernment can continue their business. This is our ordinary \nresponsibility.\n  So we meet on September 14 to discuss a lot of issues of importance. \nBut the American people have the right to ask us what we have done \nabout our basic responsibility to pass the spending bills for the next \nyear. The honest answer is, of 13 bills, we have only passed and had \nsigned into law one bill, and that is the military construction bill. \nAll of the other activities of the Federal Government, frankly, are \nstill in play. They are being debated on Capitol Hill. It is a sad \ncommentary on those who manage the House and the Senate that we have \nnot made more progress. In fact, closer inspection suggests to us that \nthere are some serious problems ahead.\n  Anyone who followed the proceedings last year knows that a similar \nsituation led to a mountainous piece of legislation called a continuing \nresolution. If I am not mistaken, it was some 10,000 pages long and it \nwas literally dropped in our laps with 48 hours to go and we had to \nread it, vote yes or no to continue the operations of Federal \nGovernment, and go home or stay here. It was chaotic.\n  At a time when we have a Federal Government and a Congress with a \nresponsibility, a staff and resources, it is hard to imagine we are \nabout to repeat that scenario of last year. But it looks as if we are \nheaded in that direction.\n  The sad fact is that one of the more sinister games being played is \nthat one of the most important spending bills for American families--\nthe bill that contains, for example, education spending for the United \nStates of America--is being held hostage as the last spending bill \nwhich we are going to consider. As each appropriations bill that needs \nmoney comes along, it is taken from this education and health bill and \nput into another bill.\n  The day of reckoning is upon us in the not-too-distant future where \nwe will face the possibility of another continuing resolution.\n  I am disappointed the Senate has not responded to the challenge by \nthe President in his State of the Union Address and, frankly, challenge \nby the people of this country to address some\n\n[[Page S10814]]\n\nof the serious problems which we face. Instead, we find ourselves \ntangled in a weave of budgetary deception where the suggestion has been \nmade this morning that there is going to be an extension of the fiscal \nyear to make it 13 months long as opposed to 12 months.\n  I believe it was Pope Gregory who came up with this calendar which we \nnow use across the world. Now we have a suggestion that is part of \ntheir effort to extricate themselves from this budgetary maelstrom. The \nRepublicans are going to somehow construct a 13-month calendar. I will \nnot go into all the possibilities that were mentioned in the earlier \ndebate, but I will say that it is, frankly, evidence of their failure \nto lead in the Senate and the House of Representatives because we are \nin the closing weeks of the fiscal year not having met our obligation \nto manage the Government and do it in an efficient manner.\n  The President came to us many months ago in his State of the Union \nAddress suggesting some changes which we should consider in education \nin America. I am sorry to report that, to my knowledge, there has been \nno hearings on the President's proposals, nor is there any likelihood \nthat the budgetary bills coming before us in the closing hours of the \nsession will even address these changes in education. Most of these \nchanges are widely accepted and embraced by the American people. Yet we \nfind the Republican majority in both the House and the Senate refusing \nto even consider them.\n  The idea of increasing the number of teachers across America so \nclassroom size is reduced is one that every parent understands. You \nwalk into a classroom of 30 kindergartners and one of them is your \nchild. You pray to God there will be a few minutes each day where the \nteacher might be able to pay special attention to your son's or \ndaughter's particular problems. The same is true in the first, second, \nand third grades when children are learning the basics in terms of math \nand reading and such things that will build their education for the \nfuture.\n  The plebiscite President said 100,000 new teachers and reduce \nclassroom size across America and we will have better students, better \ngraduates, a better workforce, and a better country. The American \npeople said: We agree. Do something about it. As we stand here in \nSeptember of 1999, 8 or 9 months later, nothing has been done--nothing.\n  The President has already said--and I think he is right--address the \nneeds to modernize classrooms across America.\n  We had a press conference in Illinois last week in Farmington, a \nsmall town near Peoria.\n  The school there was built in 1908. It is one of those battleship \nschools. I attended similar schools that reflect the turn of the \ncentury commitment to education in America. However, the school needs \nhelp. It needs a new fire escape. It needs new electrical service. It \nneeds to be equipped for computers. It needs the basics.\n  It is not alone. There are schools across America in need of \nmodernization. New schools need to be built. There will be more \nstudents than there will be classrooms. Will we help school districts \nacross America? Will this Congress rally, as the President has asked, \nto help the school districts? The honest answer is no. We have not had \nany show of will by the Republican majority to even address this. When \nwe bring it up, they say: There you go again, another new program.\n  Does this strike anyone listening to the debate as a radical \nsuggestion, that our Federal Government lend a helping hand to school \ndistricts across America so schools are safer, that they are more \nmodern, that in the 21st century kids have a better chance to learn? \nThe honest answer is, that is not radical; that is as basic as it gets \nin the United States of America.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I hate to break into the flow of thought, but in \nlistening to my friend from Illinois I am wondering if he is aware that \nthe first President to call attention to the needs of education in \nmodern American history happened to be a Republican named Dwight \nEisenhower. Is my friend familiar with his National Defense of \nEducation Act?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think it is an important point.\n  We have a Republican Party today in this Senate that is blocking the \nSenate from taking action, as my friend has stated, on the 100,000 \nteachers, on school construction, on afterschool, which they say they \nsupport in one vote, and when it comes to putting money down, they are \nnot there.\n  My friend says they call it ``radical.'' President Eisenhower, when I \nwas a youngster in the 1950s, said we could have all the missiles in \nthe world on our side, we could have all the bombs and all the military \npeople, but if we didn't have an educated workforce that understood how \nto use the equipment, if we didn't have an educated workforce to be \nproductive, America wouldn't be what she must be, the leader of the \nfree world.\n  I merely interrupted my friend to ask him if he recalled that \ninteresting fact, when Dwight Eisenhower said we had to do something as \na Federal Government. Some people said, wait a minute, education is a \nState matter. He made a couple of points: A, you can't be a strong \nleader if you don't have educated kids; B, the States can't do \neverything; they need Congress to come in when there is a national \nproblem. We can't come in for every little thing, but if we don't have \nenough teachers, that is a national problem. Afterschool is a national \nproblem; early education, a national problem.\n  The States are saying they need our help.\n  I yield back to my friend. I would love to hear his comments on the \nirony of this modern-day Republican Party and this Senate essentially \nturning against what a wonderful Republican President of the United \nStates, Dwight Eisenhower, said about education.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California.\n  The fact of the matter is, I managed to complete college because of \nthe National Defense of Education Act, a bill passed by Congress, \nsigned by President Eisenhower, that allowed me as a student from a \nworking family to borrow money from the Federal Government to pay my \ncollege education and pay it back over 10 years at 3 percent interest. \nWhat a deal. I would sign up for it again.\n  I hope those who were supporting it and reflecting on it believe that \ninvestment in this kid from East St. Louis and a lot of other children \nlike me paid off for the country in the long haul.\n  I think President Eisenhower and Congress were correct in calling \nthis the national defense. When you talk about the national defense of \nAmerica, I think it has a lot more to do with the people who live here \nthan the hardware we purchase. The investment in education is such an \ninvestment. Think back to the turn of the century. If you had to go \nback 100 years and ask, Will America be a dominant country in the 21st \ncentury, most would guess no because in the 19th century we were a \nminor power.\n  The European powers captured the attention of the world. We made some \nthreshold decisions at the turn of the century that made a difference. \nI love this statistic: Between 1890 and 1920, on average, we built one \nnew high school every day in America. For 30 years, a new high school \nwas built every day in towns across the country--no Federal mandate, \njust the understanding that if you had a town that was worth its salt, \nit would have a high school. High school wasn't just for rich kids; \nhigh school was for all kids. The kids of immigrants, the kids of \nfarmers, and the kids of small business people all went to school \ntogether in a public school system.\n  What happened? We went from 6 percent of 17-year-olds graduating high \nschool in 1900 to 1930, 30 percent, and today, over 75 percent. Make no \nmistake, that commitment by America to education, which created high \nschools, which were then called ``people's colleges'' because this was \na chance for education beyond the eighth grade for just average kids, \nled to college education and a dramatic increase in the number of \nscientists, engineers, and doctors. It took America from Kitty Hawk to \nthe space program.\n  The obvious question is, Do we have the same commitment to education \nin the future that the leaders in the 19th century, looking to the 20th \ncentury, had? I don't hear it as I listen to the debate in the \nCongress. I don't hear men and women of vision standing up\n\n[[Page S10815]]\n\nand saying in the 21st century our kids will have the same \nopportunities.\n  There are some things we have to commit ourselves to as a nation. \nThat isn't being done here. Instead, we languish in this debate, lost \nin the minutiae about local control and forgetting the big picture. The \nAmerican people expect Congress to understand the challenges our Nation \nfaces for the next century. It is not reflected in the debate on the \nbudget or in the appropriations bills.\n  We have talked about school modernization, we talked about smaller \nclassroom sizes in K through 4. Let me discuss another critically \nimportant topic: Quality teachers, men and women who will become \nprofessional teachers who are good at it--not to take what is left over \nfrom college or high school, but to take the very best and brightest \nand put them in a classroom to spark in each kid that feeling of \ncreativity and learning which those who are blessed to have such \nteachers have experienced. Yet we don't have that commitment.\n\n  The President has said: Invest in teachers. Make sure they have a \nchance to have their skills improved. Hold them accountable for what \nthey do in a classroom. But make sure to bring these young men and \nwomen into the teaching profession.\n  We can turn on the television almost any night and see the exposes \nabout education in America where, unfortunately, some people are in \nclassrooms and they shouldn't be there. The vast majority of teachers \nare good, hard-working men and women. We can help them improve their \nskills and keep those who are not good out of the classroom with a \ncommitment in Washington that we just haven't seen during the course of \nthis year.\n  The last point I will make is on afterschool programs. I have been \nmystified by the fact we are still caught up in a mindset that is, \nfrankly, old fashioned, a mindset that says children start school at \nthe age of 6 and school lets out at 2:30 or 3:00 in the afternoon and \nwe take 3 months off in the summer. This might have made sense at some \npoint in time. It doesn't make sense in today's America. Six years of \nage is a good age to put a child in a classroom, but 5 is better; 4 may \neven be better. There might even be learning experiences for those \nyounger who are now in a day-care setting.\n  Ask any teacher, if they could add a year in education, where would \nthey add it. It isn't at the end of 12th grade but at the beginning, \nkindergarten or before. The teachers say: Give me a chance to mold that \nchild before they come into the classroom, and I will show you a better \nperson and a better student.\n  Yet our commitment to preschool programs, our commitment to programs \nfor the earliest ages, just isn't there. We ignore it. We act as if it \nisn't a reality. We know it is. A younger child in a learning situation \nis a child more likely to be a good student.\n  Classrooms adjourning each day at 2:30 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon \nmade sense when Ozzie and Harriet were at home with milk and cookies \nwaiting for the kids, but not in today's America. More parents are \nworking; kids are going home to empty houses and getting in trouble \nafter school.\n  One might ask, Why doesn't the schoolday reflect the family day where \nparents might get home at 5:30, 6 o'clock, or after? Some schools \nadjust to that. Some schools provide that. Some schools need help. We \nhave yet to come up with any suggestion here on Capitol Hill about \nafterschool programs responsive to the needs of today's working \nfamilies. I suppose taking summer vacations off was an idea that made \nsense in my home State of Illinois. After all, the kids did have to go \nwork on the farm. But out of a State of 12 million people, we only have \n75,000 farm families. Those children should be in another learning \nexperience, another supervised experience so they are better students. \nIf they are falling behind in reading and math, let them have remedial \nwork during the summer. If they are good students, give them enrichment \ncourses, teach them a musical instrument, or something new about \nscience. Introduce them to computers. All the options and possibilities \nare there. Yet when you bring that up on Capitol Hill, you would think \nyou were speaking a foreign language. People just cannot quite \nunderstand what we have to do with it.\n\n  I think we have a lot to do with it. That this Congress has been so \nderelict when it comes to the issue of education is a suggestion to me \nthat we just don't get it. We are not listening to American families \nwho identify education as their highest priority. We certainly are not \nreading history, which tells us education made the 20th century the \nAmerican century because of our commitment to education.\n  Make no mistake about it; other countries around the world, in \nEurope, in parts of Asia, are starting to move forward. These are \ntomorrow's competitors. These are the people with whom our children \nwill have to be ready to do business and with whom they will have to \ncompete. If we are not prepared, they will pass us by. I don't want to \nsee that happen to my children. I don't want to see that happen to this \ncountry.\n  The honest question we have to ask ourselves is, Does Congress get \nthat message? If you look at the budget debate, it is pretty clear to \nme we have missed the point completely. We are now entangled in this \nterrible budget debate with the President. Thank goodness the \nRepublican Party has abandoned this $750 billion or $800 billion tax \ncut for wealthy people. They took that out in August. They were going \nto go home with it and explain to the American people why this was the \nreal important thing to do for America's future. It fell on its face. \nIt had about as much popularity as the new Coca-Cola. They came back \nand said: We have given up on that idea. Maybe we will do it next year.\n  I hope they have walked away from it. But in abandoning that bad \nidea, why don't they pick up on a good idea like education? Why don't \nthey join us in making certain the education funding bill is one that \nreally is a source of pride rather than a source of embarrassment. At \nthis point, unfortunately, we have seen that bill delayed. There have \nbeen absolutely no hearings on it and absolutely no effort being made, \nno initiative being shown, when it comes to improving education for the \nnext generation.\n  I think the American people rightly give us that responsibility and \nask us to meet it. It is a responsibility that should be shared on a \nbipartisan basis. The things I have suggested are not radical \nDemocratic ideas. The things I have suggested I think would appeal to \nfamilies of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--all families who \ncare about the future of their children.\n  I yield the floor hoping the debate soon will turn to these issues \nsuch as education, issues which most American families consider to be \none of our highest priorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/14/senate-section/article/S10815-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10815-S10817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPLORING THE ACTIONS OF PRESIDENT CLINTON REGARDING GRANTING CLEMENCY \n                     TO FALN TERRORISTS--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Chair advise the Senator the order of \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is S.J. Res. 33.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. This is the resolution by Mr. Lott, myself, and Mr. \nBrownback, deploring the actions of the President of the United States \nregarding the granting of clemency to terrorists called FALN?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is supposed to be the order, yes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thought it was interesting to make note of the \nbusiness before the Senate at this moment. With that in mind, I yield \nup to 5 minutes of our time to the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to talk about the business \nthat is before the Senate because I think this is critically important. \nThere were a number of allegations made in the last speech that I think \ndeserve to be refuted, but what is presently before us, what has taken \nplace, is something that needs to be addressed before the American \npublic.\n  I rise in support of the resolution condemning the President's \nactions in granting clemency to 16 terrorists. I want to be clear what \nI am talking about: 16 terrorists who were members of the Armed Forces \nof National Liberation, FALN. The President's condition for releasing \nthese men was that\n\n[[Page S10816]]\n\nthey would be willing to say they would not use violence anymore. This \nis a standard that I think would easily be met by almost everyone in \nprison in America today. The condition is a sham. The FBI, the Justice \nDepartment, and the Bureau of Prisons all recommended strongly that \nthese terrorists not be released. Yet the President went ahead and \nreleased these terrorists.\n  The sad part about this is this administration claims to understand \nthat terrorism is one of the greatest threats facing America. And it \nis. We see that threat towards the United States being posed and acted \nupon in many places around the world. It is only because of our own \nabilities that we have been able to stop some of this. Yet some of it \nhas still gotten through.\n  This act of the administration of releasing these terrorists will \nhave the effect of encouraging terrorism. They are repeatedly telling \nus they are bringing terrorists to justice and that is a high priority. \nHow is this act of releasing terrorists compatible with fighting \nterrorism? By his actions, the President is sending a message that, in \nfact, he does not take terrorism seriously, that it is OK to kill and \nmaim American people. After all, the President may pardon you even when \nthere is no petition of clemency before him.\n  This encourages terrorism. We should be very clear about that. At a \ntime when terrorism is a great threat to our peace and prosperity, at a \ntime when terrorism has touched everywhere in this Nation, at a time \nwhen Americans face terrorist threats all around the world, the last \nthing we should do is grant clemency to convicted terrorists. I believe \nCongress should be standing up to tell the President, as well as the \nNation, that we strongly condemn pardoning terrorists who have killed \nand shown no remorse whatsoever. Whatever the reason the President took \nthis action, it is clear the pardon was not based on the merits, and by \ncarrying through with this he severely damaged our leadership in the \nworld fight against terrorism.\n  The FALN carried out more violence than any other terrorist group in \nthe United States. They pose a direct threat to the safety of American \ncitizens on American soil everywhere. Yes, these convicted terrorists \nhave spent some time in jail, but the acts these people committed were \nthe most heinous and should not seem less so simply because of the \npassage of time. A fair court system found them guilty and punished \nthem accordingly. Nothing they have done or said since then can justify \ntheir unsolicited release.\n  Making concessions to terrorists is wrong and it is very harmful to \nus as a country and as a people. In so doing, the President has made a \nmockery of all the administration's tough talk about terrorism and the \nneed to combat it worldwide. This is an action that should be roundly \ncondemned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 6 minutes and 40 \nseconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, ever since the introduction of this \nresolution which basically put the Senate on record, if passed, we were \ndeploring the action of the President commuting the sentences of 16 \nknown terrorists, in this timeframe, the White House so far has refused \nto allow any of its representatives in the Department of Justice, the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, its own White House, or the Bureau of \nPrisons to testify before any congressional hearing. It was as late as \n9:30 p.m. last evening that the testifier from the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation called our office to decline to testify. In other words, \nthere is a total blackout at the White House.\n  The vote that occurred on the House side had 71 Members of the other \nside of the aisle voting ``I am here,'' refusing to make a statement. \nThis debate in the Senate will have soon been 2 hours long. So far, on \nthe other side there has been only one sentence discussed about this \nnational issue of the President commuting the sentences and releasing \n16 known terrorists. One sentence in the entire debate has come from \nthe other side. Mr. President, 71 of their Members in the House simply \nvoted they were in Washington, and the White House has refused to make \nany comment and refused to allow any of the administration to testify.\n  Mr. President, this book, ``Patterns of Global Terrorism, 1998,'' is \npublished by the State Department of the United States. It was \npublished in April of this year. On the first page it says:\n\n       United States policy with regard to terrorism.\n\n  And the first statement is:\n\n       Make no concessions to terrorists and strike no deals.\n\n  These 16 terrorists have been given the concession of being released \nfrom prison, and the entire process was one of dealmaking and \nnegotiations among the White House and representatives of the \nterrorists and the terrorists.\n  The question is the incongruity with the administration as well as \nour Government's policy with regard to terrorism.\n  The second premise is:\n\n       Bring terrorists to justice for their crimes.\n\n  We are in the midst of sending 16 of them from prison out into the \npopulation, again with no real assurance--in fact, we have already seen \nsome signs that they would not recant terrorist activities.\n  The President, in a rather tortured effort to explain--that these \nfolks were not the ones who actually dropped the bomb or fired the \nweapon has already been alluded to by Senator Hatch, chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee--what they are trying to do is set degrees. Under \nthat theory, bin Laden, responsible for planting the bombs in Kenya and \nTanzania, would somehow be in a more favorable position. To put it \nanother way, if you are a successful terrorist, you are going to be in \na lot more trouble than an unsuccessful terrorist because you were \ncaptured by the FBI before you set off the bomb.\n  In this very booklet published by the administration, it gives a \ndefinition of terrorism: ``The term terrorism means premeditated''--we \nhave concluded that--``politically motivated violence''--we have \nconcluded that was the case--``perpetrated against noncombatants''--and \nI met the son who was 9 years old when his father was killed when he \nwas simply having lunch in New York as a noncombatant--``by subnational \ngroups or clandestine agents usually intended to influence an \naudience.''\n  The point I am making is, all 16 whose sentences were commuted fit \nthis definition to a T. They are terrorists. What does not match is the \nPresident's violation of the terms of how we deal with such people when \nit says ``make no concessions'' and he did, it says ``and strike no \ndeals'' and he did. We can only hope and pray that law enforcement \nofficers who were involved with this, families who were involved with \nthis, are not now in harm's way, or the judge who sat in the \nadjudication of these cases and who was threatened to be assassinated \nby these people as he conducted the trial of the 16.\n  What a massive incongruity we face. We will shortly vote on this \nresolution. I very much hope this will be as successful as in the House \nso that international terrorists, law enforcement officials who put \ntheir lives on the line every day, and the victims of these terrorists \nwill understand that the people's branch, the legislative branch of the \nU.S. Government, thinks these are the rules of the road when you deal \nwith terrorists, that you do not make concessions, that you do not make \ndeals, and that they are apprehended and, if apprehended, they are \nsubsequently harshly dealt with and imprisoned accordingly.\n  The Presiding Officer is signaling me that my time is up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Time has expired.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. That being the case, and no Senator from the other \nside is here to speak on their version of the issue, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I had been presiding and listened intently \nto the debate that has been taking place. I have a couple of thoughts \nwhich I think have not been addressed.\n  For one thing, we recognize that this has to have been politically \ninspired, that you do not offer clemency to known terrorists without \nsome type of motivation to do so. If one has been watching the media \nand if one has been listening to this debate, one has to come to the \nconclusion that it was politically motivated. There can be no doubt \nabout that. Of course, there are a lot of Puerto Ricans in the United \nStates and in some of the States such as New York, New Jersey, and \nFlorida, perhaps, who could determine the outcome of a vote. So we have \npoliticians catering to them.\n  I suggest to you, Mr. President, that while this is onerous enough, \nthis is not happening in a vacuum because at the same time people are \ngoing after this voting block by offering clemency, something else is \ngoing on right now, something that not many people are aware of, and \nthat is, for the last 57 years we have been able to use an island \ncalled Vieques off the shores of Puerto Rico as a bombing range, as an \namphibious training base. This is classified and characterized by the \nNavy, as well as the ground troops, as an imperative area for our \ntraining and our readiness.\n  I guess what I am saying is, there is no place else in the Western \nHemisphere we can use for this kind of training. It is high-altitude \nbombing training and also amphibious training. What this also means is \nwhen we are about to deploy a ship such as the U.S.S. Eisenhower they \nwill not be able to train because of a moratorium on training on \nVieques.\n  How does that relate to this subject at hand? It relates directly in \nthat the reason we are having problems with the range which we have \nused successfully for 57 years and which is an imperative part of our \nstate of readiness is that it is unique, but they have stopped us from \ndoing it through a moratorium because of the people of the island of \nVieques. There are only 9,000 residents on this island who are saying, \nall of a sudden: Well, we decided we don't want to have bombing on the \nfar end of this island.\n  This island is over 20 miles long. The bombing range is way over on \none side. There is a buffer zone in between that is a national park on \nwhich we have spent literally millions of dollars to satisfy that \nhandful of people who want us to abandon the range.\n  What do we have going on right now? We have people who are running \nfor high office--and I do not think there is any reason to mention who \nthey are at this time--going in and holding press conferences in Puerto \nRico, saying: We want to stop the bombing that is taking place on this \nrange; we want to deactivate the range.\n  Those individuals who are running for office in Puerto Rico are going \none step further. Right now, there are four groups of protesters. These \nprotesters are down on the firing range, walking around where there are \nlive ordnances on the ground, picking them up, throwing them around, \nand someone is going to get killed. Consequently, having witnessed \nthis, when I came back I wrote a letter and made a phone call to Janet \nReno, our Attorney General, to insist she apply the law to these \ntrespassers to stop them from doing that.\n  I do not know what her motivation is, but she refuses to do it, and \nshe is selectively interpreting and enforcing the law. I suggest that \nthe Senator from Utah was correct when he said the Attorney General is \nasleep at the switch while the White House is running the Justice \nDepartment. We are allowing the White House to run the Justice \nDepartment insofar as clemency is being offered to these terrorists, \nbut also running the Justice Department by not enforcing the law in \ngetting these people out of harm's way.\n  I can stand on the Senate floor today and say that I believe someone \nis going to be killed, and when that someone is killed, it is going to \nbe the fault of our Attorney General and her boss, the President, \nbecause they are selectively not enforcing the law at this time.\n  While it is bad enough we allow terrorists to go unpunished--we turn \nthem loose on society; we somehow fall into this mindset that \npunishment is not a deterrent to crime for political purposes--it is \neven worse, in my opinion, to take away the one thing that is \nnecessary, the most significant, an important training area, from our \nmilitary in order to prepare to defend America.\n  So I think this thing has gone far enough, and I do believe it is \npolitically inspired. I do believe that was the reason for the offer of \nclemency. I do believe that is the reason so many politicians right now \nare saying: Fine, we'll go ahead and close the range.\n  One last thing on the range. I know this message will get out to the \nright places when I say it. It is true that the people and the citizens \nof the island of Puerto Rico would like to have this range deactivated. \nBut they also at the same time want to keep our facilities that are so \nsignificant in making contributions to their economies, such as \nRoosevelt Roads.\n  As chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on \nArmed Services, I went out and told them I am going to do everything \nwithin my power--if they deactivate this range; and are successful in \ndoing this, through the White House and the President's efforts--to do \nwhat we can to move those functions that take place in Roosevelt Roads, \nto deactivate that and bring those back to various installations in the \nUnited States that are only partially utilized.\n  So that is going out as a warning. I think it is time we take this \nwhole thing very seriously and try, just for a while, to get politics \nout of this process which we have been discussing.\n  Lastly, yes, it is significant. We are talking about a President who \nhas offered clemency to a bunch of people, some terrorists, who have \ninflicted crime on American citizens. When you stop and think about how \nthe young people of America are looking at this and saying, ``Well, I \nguess there's not anything wrong with participating in this kind of \nactivity,'' this is morally wrong, and it should be stopped.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 5 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the other morning on the ``Today'' show--\nwhich many of us wake up and listen to as it relates to the morning \nnews or the late-breaking events--there was a Puerto Rican terrorist \nwho the day before had just been released from prison under the \nclemency that President Clinton had granted him.\n  During that interview, he was consistently asked if he was \nremorseful, if he was concerned about the lives of American law \nenforcement officers that had been taken by him and other terrorists \nsuch as himself. In all instances, he did not answer.\n  He went on to speak of the cause and the movement and why \nindependence was more important than anything else--independence as it \nrelates to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, not his personal \nindependence. But never once did he speak in any tone that would \nsuggest he was sorry, only that he was glad to be free. I think anyone \nwho had been imprisoned by a court and found guilty would want that.\n  I listened to him and grew increasingly more angry--and I must use \nthat word ``anger''--at a President who is at this instant once again \ntrying to have it both ways on an issue that I know the Presiding \nOfficer and I are very concerned about--and that is the misuse of \nsecond amendment rights in our country by citizens of our country. And \noh, by the way, that Puerto Rican terrorist is an American citizen, is \na citizen of the United States by birth in the Commonwealth of Puerto \nRico. He was not a foreigner who knew nothing about our law; he was an \nAmerican citizen who violated a Federal firearms statute.\n\n  When I say I speak with a certain amount of anger in me that we have \na President who is living up to his double standard reputation once \nagain in the twilight days of his administration, he is coming to the \nAmerican people and saying: Give me more Federal firearms laws so I can \nenforce them and make the streets of America safer. If we have\n\n[[Page S10818]]\n\nheard it once, we have heard it five times from the bully pulpit of the \nWhite House in the last 6 months: And oh, by the way, to all you \nAmericans who did not catch my sleight of hand, I want to release a \nbunch of terrorists who were accused and found guilty of violating \nFederal firearms laws and give them clemency.\n  Mr. President, the American people and this Congress are simply not \nthat dumb. We know you live a double standard and that you speak it \noftentimes for political purposes. And on this one you got caught. But, \nbecause of the power of the office, you moved ahead and done it anyway.\n  For that I am sorry and wish we could pull that back. But at least, \nas a Senate, we can speak loudly, as the House did, and force this \nPresident to be honest with the American people, if not for just a \nmoment because he has not been honest with us.\n  So, Mr. President, if you want to offer clemency, when somebody is \nfound guilty of the misuse of Federal firearms laws, then do not come \nto this Senator or this Senate and ask for more Federal firearms laws \nwith which you can play.\n  I find myself on the floor more often than I would like defending the \nsecond amendment. But I find it necessary and responsible as a Senator \nwho takes an oath of office to uphold our Constitution because I \nbelieve the second amendment is, in fact, a constitutional right in \nthis country. But I have been very cautious in directing or steering \nthe Senate in the crafting of new Federal firearms laws to make sure \nthat we do not take away from those fundamental constitutional rights, \nand yet the President wants sweeping new power in those areas and then \nwants to arbitrarily and politically decide when to forgive and forget.\n  Sorry, Mr. President, this time you do not get it both ways. Fool me \nonce, my fault; fool me twice, no, I think not. That is what is \nhappening. I am glad the American people have finally caught on.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week I spoke in this Chamber \nof the damage that has been inflicted by this administration upon the \npeople and communities of rural Oregon. I spoke specifically about \ncommunities such as John Day and Roseburg, communities where the \nfailure of this administration to keep its word with regard to timber \nharvests has brought\n\n[[Page S10819]]\n\ngreat harm to families, communities, schools, and to their roads.\n  I am grateful to this Senate and the Senator from Washington for his \nleadership on this issue and voting last week to put the interests of \nchildren and families above a survey of fungus, snails, and slugs.\n  I return to the floor today to share with my colleagues a story about \nanother rural Oregon community, one that is facing an uncertain future \nbecause of possible actions by this administration.\n  I traveled this past weekend to the community of Burns, OR, in Harney \nCounty. Harney County is small in population and large in area. About \n8,000 people live in this county. It is roughly the size of the State \nof Massachusetts. It includes part of the largest Ponderosa pine forest \nin the whole Nation. It includes over 100,000 head of beef cattle on \nvast open ranges. It includes the Steens Mountain.\n  I would like to speak to you about the Steens Mountain and what this \nadministration proposes to do with it.\n  Let me begin by saying that to fly over the Steens Mountain, and to \ntour it on the ground and from the air, as I did last Saturday, is to \nsee some of the most breathtaking scenery in this country or any other; \nand to stand on the ridgetops of the Steens is to view unspoiled vistas \nof the Kiger Gorge, the Alvord Desert, and other true national \ntreasures. From its peak you can see the States of Idaho, Nevada, \nCalifornia, and nearly all of Oregon. It is a very special place.\n  The Steens Mountain has remained unspoiled for one simple reason: The \npeople of Burns and Harney County love Steens Mountain. Through unique \npartnerships between the Bureau of Land Management and private land \nowners, who own almost 30 percent of the mountain, they have found a \nformula that has worked. Harney County residents take great pride in \ntheir stewardship of the mountain that one rancher referred to, to me, \nas a ``tough old girl.'' At the heart of their stewardship is the \ncommonsense principle of multiple use.\n  Their pride is very justifiable. According to the Bureau of Land \nManagement, over the past 30 years essentially 100 percent of upland \nand riparian conditions on the Steens Mountain that needed improvement \nhas, in fact, been improved.\n  I traveled to the Steens in response to a trip that Secretary of the \nInterior Bruce Babbitt made there several weeks ago. After touring the \nmountain and praising what had been accomplished by local citizens, \nSecretary Babbitt also announced that only Uncle Sam could be trusted \nwith the future of the mountain. He said that before this \nadministration left office, he wanted to designate the mountain as a \nnational conservation area or as a national monument; no matter what \nhad been done before and how well it looked, still we cannot trust \nlocal citizens; we need to trust those with the wisdom of the \nbureaucracy in the beltway. Such a designation, as he proposed, would \nhave far-reaching impacts, not only on the future of the mountain but \non the future of those who live and work in its shadow.\n  Such an announcement would run counter to the significant efforts of \nthe Southeastern Oregon Resource Advisory Council. It is known locally \nas the RAC. The council is made up of individuals from conservation \ngroups, resource groups, public bodies, and Federal agencies that have \nassumed the responsibility of exploring the proposal for a Steens \nMountain National Conservation Area. This cooperative approach is the \ntype of open and public process that I support and one that should be \nsupported by this administration. But this group now labors under the \ncertainty that, no matter what they decide, a decision has already been \nmade here that the administration will make a designation.\n\n  I plan to meet with Secretary Babbitt in the very near future. I hope \nto do it with my colleague from Oregon and Congressman Walden who \nrepresents this area. When we do, we will share the frustrations \nexpressed to each of us by citizens of Harney County when we have \nvisited there. They have asked me why this administration is trying to \nimpose a solution where there is no problem. The old adage that this is \n``a solution looking for a problem'' has never been more true than when \napplied to the Steens Mountain.\n  They asked me why this administration does not trust them to continue \nwith their excellent management techniques and innovative practices \nthat have been at the heart of their stewardship. They asked me why \nthis administration would be promoting a designation that would \nundoubtedly bring more visitors to the area, thereby harming the very \nenvironment they supposedly seek to protect. And they asked me if the \nSecretary's promise to work with them in the months ahead was real or \nwhether this administration has already made up its mind.\n  I would also like to put on the Record the taunting that is being \nmade to the administration by some members of the environmental \ncommunity from organizations that support more Federal involvement on \nthe Steens Mountain. It was said in the open, in the presence of the \nmedia, that Secretary Babbitt and this administration were being urged \nto find a legacy other than the impeachment scandal. They were \nliterally saying: Grab private land, and you can grab a better legacy \nfor yourself. They were urging a version of a domestic ``wagging of the \ndog.''\n  I pray that this is not so because this is not the basis for good \nland management. Oregon does not need such an insult as was being urged \nupon this administration by some in the environmental community.\n  The bottom line is that I believe the future of the Steens Mountain \nin Harney County is in much better hands with the folks who live \nthere--folks such as County Commissioner Dan Nichols and ranchers such \nas Fred Otley and Stacey and Elaine Davies--than it is, than it ever \nwill be, in the hands of Federal bureaucrats who reside within the \nbeltway.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich).

Mr. President, earlier today, there was \nquite a bit of colorful rhetoric and blustering on the floor by the \nDemocratic Party about reports in the Washington Post today that \nRepublicans were going to create a ``13th month'' to allow more \nspending on education and other programs.\n  Lest I be accused of partisanship, I think many of you know I am an \nIndependent. So those who say I am going to speak on behalf of \nRepublicans, I guess, would technically be wrong. I don't pretend to \nspeak for the Republicans, and I am not privy to what was said in any \nmeetings with the Republicans regarding the so-called 13th month. But \nlet me speak for myself as an Independent and say I don't support a \n13th month for any fiscal year.\n  But in their effort to be partisan and embarrass Republicans over \nwhat was probably a mischaracterization, in my view, in a liberal \nnewspaper, my Democrat colleagues failed to address the key issue, \nwhich is, where do you come up with the money to fund all of these \nprograms?\n  In their zeal to make partisan points and poke fun--and they did have \na good time--they failed to offer any constructive solution. If you are \ngoing to poke fun and make jokes about the 13th month headline, what \nare your alternatives? My guess is they would prefer to use the same \nbudget tactics they have been using for about 50 years. The result of \nthose budget tactics over the past 50 years has been to run up the \nnational debt to where it is almost $6 trillion, raid the Social \nSecurity trust fund, and in order to do it all raise taxes.\n  Every year, we do this. Every year, the train comes down the track \nand usually has a wreck. We spend, spend, spend, spend, and then we get \nto the\n\n[[Page S10820]]\n\nend of the year and we act as though there is some magic budgetary \ngoblin running around eating up money and we invent these tricks to try \nto figure out how to break the budget, while we still tell constituents \nwe balance it. It is pretty outrageous. We use every budgetary gimmick \nwe can find: forward funding, emergency designation, baseline \nbudgeting. You name it, you have heard it. Now we have ``13th month.''\n  For those of you who may be listening or watching right now, when you \nhear those terms, my advice would be to hang on tightly to your wallet \nbecause the story is, if a Democrat has a vision, it is probably \nfocused right on your wallet, and that is what is happening now. They \nare having fun with this 13th month, but they have that luxury because \nthey are in the minority. I suppose you can say, technically, so am I, \nbut on this point I am siding with the Republicans. They didn't invent \nbudgetary gimmickry.\n  Insofar as this Congress intends to use smoke and mirrors to secretly \nfund more rather than less unconstitutional programs, I don't intend to \nbe a part of it. Our Founding Fathers would be ashamed of this whole \ndebate for several reasons:\n  No. 1, they didn't intend for us to balance our budget using \naccounting tricks and elongated fiscal years.\n  No. 2, they didn't intend for us to burden our children with \ntrillions of dollars in debt--trillions.\n  No. 3, they didn't intend for us to spend billions of dollars on \neducation programs that should be handled at the State and local level.\n  My colleague, Senator Gorton, has been very instrumental on \ninitiatives to try to bring that spending back to the State and local \nlevel where it belongs. So as perhaps the only nonpartisan person in \nthe Senate right now, let me offer a solution. It is pretty simple. I \nhave a way that we can support the Constitution, balance the budget, \nand not use any budgetary tricks at all. It is very simple: Don't spend \nthe money.\n  The Department of Education is billions of dollars worth of \nunconstitutional infringements on State and local authority. Don't \nspend the money, if the Democrats don't want the Republicans using \nbudgetary tricks, the Republicans don't want to break the budget caps, \nand the founders don't want us funding unconstitutional programs. So \nlet's abolish the Department of Education. Then we can go back home to \nour school districts and say: You now have the constitutional authority \nyou had in the first place to educate your children the way you \nchoose--home school, private school, public school, whatever. By the \nway, you have more money to spend and the budget is balanced.\n  Very simple. Nothing complicated. So let me say the best way to end \nall the budgetary gimmickry is don't spend the money.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We will have that managers' amendment--I think there is \nonly one that is possible; it may be in two sections--ready within the \nnext half hour or so to present. It does represent an accommodation of \nthe requests of many Members, with the understanding of all Members.\n\n  I think it will take only a very few minutes to present and to have \nit accepted. At that point, we will have only the Hutchison amendment \noutstanding. The majority leader has reserved the right to ask for \nreconsideration of the cloture motion that was defeated yesterday. I \nsuspect when he chooses to do that, we will in a relatively short \nperiod of time finish debate and dispose of the Hutchison amendment one \nway or another and then go to final passage of the Interior \nappropriations bill.\n  That means, as far as I am concerned, I am going to vacate the floor \nat this point. Whenever the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nTransportation wants to start his bill, he can do so. I will ask him \nfor the right to interrupt at some point when I am ready with the \nmanagers' amendment and present it then.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot, I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair and my colleagues for a \nvery brief statement.\n  Those of us who were here and those of us who were not here but \ncertainly\n\n[[Page S10821]]\n\nhave an idea about it remember the effort that was put into passing TEA \n21, the highway bill, a couple of years ago. Many Senators worked very \nlong and hard.\n  I see the ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Lautenberg; the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation, Senator Shelby; Senator \nByrd mightily helped put together a massive highway bill, otherwise \nknown as TEA 21; Senator Warner of Virginia; and, of course, the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Chafee. I assisted; Senator Moynihan \nhelped a lot; the majority leader, Senator Lott. We had many meetings \nin Senator Lott's office trying to put together all the provisions of \nthe highway bill.\n  As one might guess, it is extremely complex. There were the Northeast \nStates that had a certain point of view as to how the dollars should be \nallocated; the Western States thought they did not get a fair deal in \nthe previous 6-year highway bill known as ISTEA; the Southern States. \nThen there were donee and donor States. There were groups that wanted \nmore so-called CMAQ money. That is money that goes to areas to help \nthem mitigate against pollution in their cities caused by automobiles \nand trucks. There were enhancement funds. Enhancement funds are for \nbikeways and other associated highway programs. There was research and \ndevelopment. There were intelligent highway systems. There were public \nlands. There were discretionary funds. There was park money. You name \nit. There were lots of competing interests that were put together a \ncouple of years ago.\n  We finally put together a highway bill, and it passed on a bipartisan \nbasis, a large vote: 89 Senators voted for it after much gnashing of \nteeth about what we were going to do with the 4.3 cents that was \notherwise set aside for debt reduction in a previous Congress. We \nfinally decided that was going to go to the highway program.\n  Our basic principle we agreed to was that all Federal gasoline taxes \npaid would go to the highway fund, and from the highway fund that money \nall goes back out to the States in the form of related highway \nprograms, all funded with the gasoline tax. That was a major statement \nthat TEA 21 made, the highway bill we passed a couple years ago.\n  It has worked quite well. On average, States got about a 40-percent \nincrease each year compared with the previous 6 years; some States a \nlittle more, some less; but in the whole scheme of things it worked out \nquite well: On average, a 40-percent increase each year compared to the \nprior year.\n  This year we are considering the Transportation appropriations bill, \nthe appropriations bill which basically says: OK, this money that is in \nthe highway program, although there is contract authority that says the \nmoney has to be spent on highways, still, the Transportation \nAppropriations Committee basically just spends it. That is what it \ndoes.\n  There is a provision in the highway bill, TEA 21, which says this: \nAny additional money that comes into the highway trust fund--\nunanticipated additional money, presumably on account of a growing \neconomy; and our economy has grown--will then be allocated, to the \ndegree it is allocated, back to the States in the same way the highway \nbill itself was put together; that is, a certain percent under CMAQ, a \ncertain percent under service transportation, a certain percent under \nminimum guarantees, a certain percent to public lands, et cetera; and \nin the same way.\n  It turns out that because of the additional gasoline taxes in the \nlast year as a consequence of a prosperous economy, there is an \nadditional $1.5 billion that is to be allocated under the highway bill \naccording to the way the highway bill was put together. So there are no \nchanges.\n  It turns out, with all due respect to the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee, they have decided to change the highway \nbill, to rewrite it, and, rather than to have the money spent as \nprovided for in the highway bill, to instead take all of that money--\ninstead of, say, 10 percent as provided for under the highway bill \nunder certain discretionary programs and 90 percent under the core \nhighway programs--they take it all and put it under the core highway \nprograms. I think that is very dangerous. It is a very dangerous \nprecedent.\n  First of all, it is legislation on an appropriations bill. It is \nrewriting, adding legislation on an appropriations bill. Second, it is \na precedent of the Appropriations Committee of, in effect, rewriting \nthe program.\n  I grant you, this is a small matter. As a consequence of the \nAppropriations Committee's action, instead of $1.4 billion going to the \ncore programs, $1.5 billion is going to the core programs. The \nadditional that is going to the core programs does not go to the \nvarious programs I mentioned.\n  You might ask: Gee, what is the big deal? That is only about $120 \nmillion. The big deal is this. First of all, it is not much money, $1.5 \nbillion versus $1.4 billion. Second, it is a big principle, because \nonce we start down this slippery slope of the Transportation \nAppropriations Committee rewriting the highway bill and how dollars are \nallocated among States, then we are going to be tempted in following \nCongresses to take a bigger bite of the apple to redistribute even \nmore.\n  Why is that a problem? That is a problem because highway programs \ntake time. State highway departments must plan ahead. It takes 2 or 3 \nyears, from conception to design, to bid letting, to construction, to \nbuild highways or to resurface. It is not a spigot you just turn on and \noff yearly. It takes time.\n  Second, here is another real concern I have. If the Appropriations \nCommittee is rewriting the highway bill, then it is going to become \npolitical; the majority party is going to be determining the provisions \nin the highway bill. There will not be a bipartisan allocation of \nhighway dollars; it will be a majority party allocation of highway \ndollars.\n\n  With all due respect, this is not an abstraction; this has happened \nin the concrete. In fact, the bill that was about to come to the floor \ndid just what I feared would happen; namely--not the highway part but \nthe mass transit part--the committee rewrote the bill, which took many \ndollars away from two States, California and New York. It does not take \nmuch imagination to figure out whether the Senators from those two \nStates are in the majority party or the minority party.\n  I am just very concerned we are going to set the precedent of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee, A, rewriting the highway \nbill, which is bad because it takes a long time to plan these projects, \nand upsetting the apple cart which took a lot of effort to put \ntogether--I mentioned Senators Byrd, Warner, Chafee, Lott, and all of \nus--to try to work to put all the pieces together, but also because the \nmajority party is going to be sorely tempted to be political; that is, \nto give dollars to the States of the majority party but not dollars to \nthe States of the minority party. That might change. It might be the \nDemocrats who are in the majority. Then that precedent will be set. \nThat is not a good precedent. We should instead just do what is right.\n  I will sum up by saying it is true that every State will get a few \nmore dollars under the rewrite by the Appropriations Committee. It \naverages about .35 percent. Gee, every State is getting a few more \ndollars--not many--so why not support it? My point is, it is only a few \ndollars. It is not going to really affect the States much at all. But \nit is the principle of going down the slippery slope of rewriting the \nhighway bill without hearings, without any field hearings and hearings \nhere in the Senate. The EPW Committee has not had hearings on this \nsubject. The Appropriations Committee has not had hearings on this \nsubject.\n  Just basically, it is political. I will not object at this point, but \nat the appropriate time various Senators will be making this point. I \nvery much hope that when the point is made at the proper time, the \nSenators will very deeply consider this in a thoughtful way, because \nsometimes what you do in the short term, for short-term gratification, \ncomes back and is harmful in the long run. I do think in this case it \nis better to think a little bit more about the purpose of the bill.\n  I thank the Senators for indulging me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S10822]]\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would like, first, to modify my unanimous consent \nrequest. I think it might be best that I restate it, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Go right ahead.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Chair lay \nbefore the Senate H.R. 2084, the House-passed fiscal year 2000 \nTransportation appropriations bill, that all after the enacting clause \nbe stricken and the text of S. 1143, as modified by striking section \n321, be inserted in lieu thereof--being amendment No. 1624--that the \namendment be considered as original text for the purpose of further \namendment, and that points of order against any provision added thereby \nare preserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. A question, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that this is the \nlanguage that has been worked out with our side.\n  Mr. SHELBY. That is exactly right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of amendment No. 1624 is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/14/senate-section/article/S10822-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10822-S10825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2084) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Transportation and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2000, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, just for a few minutes I would like to \naddress some of the overview, as I see it, of this Transportation \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, after being delayed by the objection to the Transit \nEquity Provision, I am pleased that the Senate will finally have the \nopportunity to consider the fiscal year 2000 transportation \nappropriations bill. Although the subcommittee's funding allocation is \ntight, I believe we are presenting the Senate with a balanced approach \nto meeting our Nation's transportation needs by providing adequate \nfunding for all modes of transportation.\n  At the same time, the senior Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, \nand I have gone to great lengths to craft a bill that I believe \naccommodates the requests of Members and funds their priorities.\n  The current fiscal constraints were especially felt in the transit \naccount, where demand for mass transit systems is growing in every \nState. But funding is fixed by the TEA 21 firewall. My proposal for \nmanaging an account in which Members' requests were more than 20 times \nthe available funds was the Transit Equity Provision.\n  This measure, which I included in the original subcommittee mark of \nthe bill, would have limited the amount of transit capital funds any \nsingle State could receive in fiscal year 2000 to no more than 12\\1/2\\ \npercent of the total.\n  The two states that receive the lion's share of national transit \nfunds--30 percent of the total in fiscal year 1999--are California and \nNew York.\n  The provision would have redistributed any transit capital funds \nappropriated to these two states in excess of 12\\1/2\\ percent to the \nremaining 48 states. This would have resulted in approximately $5 \nmillion more for every other state, for their own transit programs--\nwhile New York and California would still have received more than $693 \nmillion each.\n  Last Thursday, however, the Senate failed to reach cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to the transportation appropriations bill if it \nincluded the Transit Equity Provision, and I have agreed to strip the \nprovision from the bill in order to move this legislation forward.\n  The equity provision is not central to the appropriations bill. The \ntotal program funding levels, which are set at the TEA-21 firewall \nlimits, remain unchanged. I included the provision to help create more \nroom within those totals for the national transit program.\n  My colleagues have written to me with new start project requests \ntotaling $2.84 billion and with bus project requests totaling $1.8 \nbillion.\n  If the appropriations bill honors all the current and anticipated \nfull funding grant agreement projects and the bus earmarks for fiscal \nyear 2000 that were included in the TEA-21 authorization, we have left \nonly $96 million in new starts funding and $235 million in bus \nfunding--to accommodate not only the billions of dollars' worth of \nrequests from my colleagues in the Senate, but also the earmarks that \nhave been included in the House transportation appropriations bill.\n  This task is beyond challenging: It is impossible. There is no way to \nbegin to satisfy the demand for discretionary transit capital funds. I \ndo not want this fact to catch my colleagues by surprise.\n  I bring this bill to the Senate floor today without the Transit \nEquity Provision. By engaging in a lengthy and public debate on this \nissue, as well as a recorded cloture vote, I hope that my colleagues \nare now more aware of the pressures on this account nationally, and \nthat they better understand why I have so actively sought a way to \nprovide funds for what I thought were my colleagues' transit \npriorities.\n  The bill honors our commitment to increase the flow of federal funds \nfor construction to improve infrastructure throughout the nation.\n  Within the framework of a $49.5 billion total bill, $37.9 billion is \nprovided for infrastructure investment in highways, transit systems, \nairports, and railroads. This is 6 percent more than last year's level \nof funding and is greater than the administration's request.\n  This bill respects the Highway and Transit firewalls that TEA-21 \nimposed. I would like to point out to my colleagues that we adhered \nstrictly to the TEA-21 firewalls, even though outlays will be greater \nthan the amount anticipated when Congress enacted TEA-21.\n  By providing the funds above the firewall level, there were fewer \ndollars available to fund other priorities within the subcommittee's \njurisdiction, including the Coast Guard and FAA.\n  I believe this illustrates the pitfalls of trying to manage annual \noutlays in multi-year authorization legislation and is one of many \nreasons the Senate should reject a proposal to establish more budgetary \nfirewalls around trust fund accounts.\n  I yield to my colleague under the unanimous consent agreement, the \nsenior senator from New Jersey, the ranking member of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague and \nfriend, Senator Shelby, for having managed a very difficult problem \nwith, frankly, less money than the amount we think transportation in \nthis country deserves. We are entering a new century. It is hoped that \nwe are going to be able to continue the prosperous and vigorous economy \nwe now see. I think if there is one place where our funding allocations \nare deficient--and I believe they are deficient in many--transportation \nheads the list. It is necessary to have the kind of infrastructure that \nwill propel us into continuing leadership in the 21st century, starting \nwith transportation.\n  We see crowding in every mode of transportation--aviation; the skies \nare jammed. The highways are congested. They are spewing contaminated \nair all over the place, and our transit systems are operating well \nabove capacity. So I approach this bill with less than total \nsatisfaction because we, frankly, could have used more funds. I will \ndiscuss those for a minute.\n  I have served on the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee for \nmore than 14 years. As they say, time flies when you are having fun. I \nchaired the subcommittee for 8 years, and I have also had the pleasure \nof serving under other subcommittee chairmen including Mark Andrews, \nMark Hatfield, who was a dear friend and inspired leader, and, most \nrecently, Richard Shelby.\n  Senator Shelby, as his predecessors, has been attentive to the \nissues. He has consulted carefully with the minority members of the \nsubcommittee. When it comes to funding levels included in this bill, \nSenator Shelby has done the best he could, given the very limited \nresources allocated to this subcommittee. And though I wish we had more \nmoney, I am supporting this bill,\n\n[[Page S10823]]\n\neven with the limitations placed upon us, because of the efforts by \nSenator Shelby.\n  When you consider the fact that this appropriations bill is going to \nusher in our national transportation agenda in the next century, it is \nclear that we are still not making the kind of investments we have to \nmake to ensure continued leadership, economically and functionally, in \nthe next millennium.\n  That is not the fault of the chairman. Rather, it is the fault of our \noverall budgeting process--and I say that both as the ranking member of \nthis subcommittee and the ranking member of the Budget Committee.\n  The bill before us is almost $700 million below the level requested \nby the President in his budget.\n  The President's proposed transportation budget for fiscal year 2000, \nfor the first time, exceeds $50 billion. This bill, however, is funded \nat less than $49.5 billion.\n  While the dollar amount in this bill does exceed the total provided \nfor in fiscal year 1999, the growth is to be found in the highway and \ntransit programs that enjoy firewalled funding under TEA-21.\n  The funding provided in this bill for other modal transportation \nwhich do not benefit from funding guarantees is severe. Funding for the \nCoast Guard is well below the President's request. Fortunately, we were \nable to include funding for the Coast Guard in the Kosovo supplemental \nappropriations bill. These funds will remain available and enable the \nCoast Guard to better meet its needs next year.\n  Funding for the Federal Aviation Administration is more than 6.5 \npercent below the President's request.\n  Funding for Amtrak: We are now approaching a time when Amtrak is \nabout to step in, hopefully, to the 21st century, but it is at least \nstarting to catch up in the 20th century even as we leave it. High-\nspeed rail is around the corner--delayed, unfortunately, a little bit \nmore than we expected it to be. But it is on its way. It is going to \nmake an enormous difference. By way of example, if we didn't have the \ninvestment in Amtrak's Northeast Corridor to keep it going, we would \nneed, as a substitute, 10,000 flights every year--10,000 new flights \nbetween the Boston area and the Washington area, including New York. \nThat would be something beyond comprehension in terms of the crowded \nskies--200 new flights a week.\n  Funding for the critical highway safety functions, or the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration, is cut by more than $50 million, \nor 15 percent below the level requested by the administration. A large \npart of the problem is that, when we marked up appropriations bill in \nMay, we were capped by the low authorization levels in TEA-21. Since \nthat markup, the House and the Senate passed, and the President signed, \na sizable increase in these authorization levels for highway safety. \nBut now that the authorization levels have been increased, there is no \nfunding in the subcommittee's allocation to fund even part of them.\n  These are difficult funding cuts. But despite these cuts, I support \nthis bill. Frankly, I am putting some hope in the fact that the bill as \npassed by the House of Representatives had an allocation that was more \nthan $0.5 billion larger than the allocation granted to the Senate \nTransportation Subcommittee.\n  As we approach conference on this bill, I expect to work closely with \nChairman Shelby and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee with \nthe goal of bringing back a transportation conference report that \nbetter meets the needs of the FAA, the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, the Coast Guard, and the other critical functions of \nthe Department of Transportation.\n  Mr. President, I emphasize once more that the reason this bill is so \ntight is not because Chairman Shelby doesn't want to fund the necessary \nparts of the transportation bill's requirements but, rather, we are \ncaught by the funding caps that have controlled the Appropriations \nprocess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1625\n\n (Purpose: To make available funds for the investigation of unfair or \ndeceptive practices and unfair methods of competition by air carriers, \n   foreign air carriers, and ticket agents involving the failure to \n            disclose information on the overbooking flights)\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) for himself, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, and Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1625.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 65, line 22, before the period at the end of the \n     line, insert the following: ``: Provided, That the funds made \n     available under this heading shall be used to investigate \n     pursuant to section 41712 of title 49, United States Code, \n     relating to unfair or deceptive practices and unfair methods \n     of competition by air carriers, foreign air carriers, and \n     ticket agents: Provided further, That, for purposes of the \n     preceding proviso, the terms `unfair or deceptive practices' \n     and `unfair methods of competition' include the failure to \n     disclose to a passenger or a ticket agent whether the flight \n     on which the passenger is ticketed or has requested to \n     purchase a ticket is overbooked, unless the Secretary \n     certifies such disclosure by a carrier is technologically \n     infeasible''.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first I express my thanks to the bipartisan \nleadership of the committee, Chairman Shelby, who has been \nextraordinarily helpful on this matter, which is a critical issue of \nprotecting the rights of airline passengers in this country, and I also \nthank my longtime friend, Senator Lautenberg, who has spent a great \ndeal of time with me on this issue over the last few months. The \nbipartisan leadership of this committee stands out in the Congress in \nterms of trying to ensure that airline passengers get a fair shake. It \nis high time, Mr. President, and colleagues.\n  Last year, we saw an unprecedented increase in the number of \ncomplaints by airline passengers about shoddy service. In the first 6 \nmonths of this year, we have seen another unprecedented increase in \ncomplaints by passengers of airline service.\n  This is the first of two amendments I intend to offer with the \nchairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Shelby, and the ranking minority \nmember, Mr. Lautenberg, to try to balance the scales and ensure that \nthe passengers get a fair shake and, in particular, get information \nabout key services, such as the lowest fare, and accurately be told \nwhen a flight is overbooked.\n  I emphasize to my colleagues that I am not proposing the Congress \nestablish a constitutional right to a fluffy pillow on an airplane \nflight or a jumbo bag of peanuts. But I think airline passengers have a \nright to timely and accurate information.\n  The purchase of an airline ticket today in America is like virtually \nno movie choice. Unlike movie theaters that sell tickets to a movie or \na store that sells soccer balls, the airline industry provides no real \nassurance that they will be able to use the product as intended. They \nhave made a variety of voluntary pledges to try to turn around this \nsituation. But what we have seen in the last few days as a result of a \nstudy by the GAO and a study by the Congressional Research Service is \nthat these voluntary pledges by the airline industry aren't worth much \nmore than the paper they are written on.\n  I am very pleased to offer this first amendment to try to ensure that \npassengers can be informed when an airline is overbooked.\n  Again, I thank the bipartisan leadership of the committee. In \naddition to Senators Shelby and Lautenberg, Senators Campbell and \nFeingold have also been supportive in finally holding these airlines \naccountable with respect to making sure passengers are informed when a \nflight is overbooked. That is the problem today in America with \noverbooking. If you call an airline right now and they are overbooked, \nthey won't tell you that before they sell you a ticket. The public has \na right to know. The passengers have a right to know. These voluntary \npledges aren't going to do it.\n  For example, the voluntary pledge the airline industry has made on \noverbooking is, and I quote:\n\n       They will disclose to passengers upon request whether the \n     flight on which the passenger is ticketed is overbooked if \n     within the usual and ordinary scope of such employee's work, \n     the information is available to the airline employee to whom \n     the request is made. \n\n[[Page S10824]]\n\n     In plain English, that means if you are lucky and happen \n     to ask the right employee, you may get a straight answer \n     on overbooking.\n\n  This bipartisan amendment says the Department of Transportation \ninspector general can and should investigate as a deceptive trade \npractice the failure to inform the consumer when a flight is \noverbooked. In 1997, the Department of Transportation reported the \nairlines bumped more than 1 million passengers. Since that time, more \nthan 100,000 passengers have been bumped involuntarily. This means more \nthan 100,000 passengers are paying for seats they never sat in.\n  I think it is time to make sure the public's right to know is \nprotected. This first bipartisan amendment gives Members that \nopportunity.\n  My thanks to my senior colleague, the chairman, and the ranking \nminority member. I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I commend our colleague for this \namendment and for the substance of the amendment.\n  There has been constant pressure on the airlines to provide seats and \nmake accommodations available. For those who think they are going on a \njourney--some emergencies, some recreational, some for routine work--it \nmatters not. The fact of the matter is, when someone makes a \nreservation on an airplane, they ought to know whether or not there is \na pretty good chance they will arrive at their chosen destination. We \nknow there is not a way to positively predict this. However, the \npassengers who have paid for their tickets should have a pretty good \nchance of arriving when the flight is scheduled to arrive.\n  I think this is positive amendment. It is pretty simple. The Senator \nfrom Oregon deals with the problem of airlines continuing to sell \ntickets on oversold flights and refusing to divulge that fact to their \ncustomers.\n  I consider myself a friend of aviation. I have worked very hard with \nthe FAA and the airlines to make sure we offer reliable and safe \nservice. With all of the crowding, our system is still remarkably safe. \nIt handles far more flights than we ever expected. Are we up to date in \neverything we can do? I say absolutely not; the requirements far exceed \nthe capacity.\n  The least we ought to do is tell passengers if there is a reasonable \nchance that they will get to their destination. The person who travels \nfrom Cincinnati to New York, perhaps to catch a flight overseas, \narrives with their baggage. They have a 2-hour connection or an hour-\nand-a-half at Kennedy or Newark Airport on their way to Rome. The only \nproblem is, they arrive 3 or 4 hours later because they were bumped off \nthe flight and they miss their flight to Rome.\n  I had an experience a couple of weeks ago. This is probably a good \nstory for democracy. I got to the airport, and they said the flight was \nsold out. I had made a reservation, given a credit card number. I \narrived at the airport, and they said the airplane was filled. I got \nthere 15, 20 minutes before flight time. I said: What do you mean, it \nis filled? They said: Yes, that seat is sold. I said: The seat was sold \ntwice, and the first one who got there got it.\n  No one told me the rules, that a passenger had to beat the other guy \nto the starting line to guarantee the seat for which they paid.\n  Needless to say, I was a little annoyed. I didn't jump over the \ncounter and threaten anybody, but it was not a pleasant experience. \nInstead of taking one direct flight back home, I had to take two--first \nflying north before I could fly south. All I could get was, ``Sorry, we \nsold the seat.'' It is an unpleasant experience.\n  When they took the reservation which I made personally and gave my \ncredit card number, they said fine and gave me a confirmation number. \nWhen I got to the gate to get on this airplane, the clerk behind the \ndesk said: This airplane has been sold out. But they took my money \nanyway.\n  The Senator from Oregon is standing behind the passenger who is not \ngetting a lot of attention these days. The airlines handle a lot more \ntraffic than they expected. They are also making a lot more money and \nI'm glad that they are. But they must also provide the service in a \nmanner that is respectful of their passengers.\n  What the Senator from Oregon is asking for is simple: If you are \ngoing to sell a ticket to him, to me, to anybody, please tell them if \nthe flight is oversold. Then passengers can plan for it or figure out a \nbackup instead of being innocently led to a blind wall where they can't \ngo farther.\n  So I support this amendment. I support it enthusiastically.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1626\n\n (Purpose: To make available funds for the investigation of unfair or \n deceptive practices and unfair methods of competition by air carriers \nand foreign air carriers involving denying airline consumers access to \n               information on the lowest fare available)\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and send another amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], for himself, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, and Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1626.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 65, line 22, before the period at the end of the \n     line, insert the following: ``: Provided, That the funds made \n     available under this heading shall be used (1) to investigate \n     pursuant to section 41712 of title 49, United States Code, \n     relating to unfair or deceptive practices and unfair methods \n     of competition by air carriers and foreign air carriers, (2) \n     for monitoring by the Inspector General of the compliance of \n     air carriers and foreign carriers with respect to paragraph \n     (1) of this proviso, and (3) for the submission to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress by the Inspector General, \n     not later than July 15, 2000, of a report on the extent to \n     which actual or potential barriers exist to consumer access \n     to comparative price and service information from independent \n     sources on the purchase of passenger air transportation: \n     Provided further, That, for purposes of the preceding \n     proviso, the terms `unfair or deceptive practices' and \n     `unfair methods of competition' mean the offering for sale to \n     the public for any route, class, and time of service through \n     any technology or means of communication a fare that is \n     different than that offered through other technology or means \n     of communication''.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this amendment I also offer with the \nbipartisan leadership of the subcommittee, Chairman Shelby and Senator \nLautenberg. Again, I express my thanks to both of them. As you could \ntell from Senator Lautenberg's excellent statement, he has strong views \non this matter. They go back a long time.\n  One of the areas I most admire about Senator Lautenberg has been his \nextraordinary work on tobacco control. The fact of the matter is, \nSenator Lautenberg for years led that effort to make air flights \nhealthier in our country. That is just one of the many contributions he \nhas made in public service. We thank him for it.\n  This amendment as well is supported by the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Chairman Shelby, and the ranking minority member, Senator \nLautenberg. As I have sought to do with respect to overbooking, again \nthis amendment would ensure there were teeth behind this so-called \npledge by the airlines to make information about the lowest possible \nfare available to the consumer. Finding the lowest air fare in America \nis now one of the great mysteries of Western life.\n  On any given flight there may be as many different fares as there are \npassengers on the plane. One of the things that experts in aviation \nhave said for some time is if you want to start a brawl on an air \nflight, ask the passengers to compare notes with respect to how much \nthey paid for a ticket because there will be remarkable differences, \neven among people who made the same sort of arrangements to fly.\n  The purpose of this bipartisan amendment is to make sure, no matter\n\n[[Page S10825]]\n\nhow a customer contacts an airline--at the ticket counter, over the \ntelephone, or at an airline's web site--the customer would get the same \ninformation about the lowest fare. Again, the airlines in these \nvoluntary pledges that they have made have a lot of lofty rhetoric \nabout telling the consumer about the lowest fare, but the harsh reality \nis that it is business as usual. This amendment would hold the airlines \naccountable to their pledge to actually make available to the consumer, \nin an understandable way, information about the lowest fare available.\n  The pledge to offer the lowest fare available as it stands now, in \nthe voluntary package from the airline industry, is, again, sort of \nmore hocus-pocus, as far as the consumer is concerned. In effect, what \nthe airlines are now saying is that if a consumer uses the phone to \ncall an airline and asks about a specific flight on a specific date in \na specific class, the airline will tell the consumer the lowest fare, \nas they are already required to do by law. Not only will the airlines \nnot provide the consumer relevant information about lower fares on \nother flights on the same airline, they will not even tell the consumer \nabout lower fares that are probably on the airline's web page--and for \nobvious reasons. Once they have you on the phone and they can get you \nat a higher price, they might not be so interested in letting you know \nabout something else that is available on the web page.\n  Recently a Delta agent quoted a consumer over the telephone a round \ntrip fare to Portland, my hometown, of $400, and 5 minutes later the \nconsumer found a price of $218 for the exact same flight on Delta's web \npage.\n  What this amendment stipulates, again, as with the bipartisan effort \nwith respect to overbooking, is that the passenger has a right to know. \nThe public has a right to know. We are not setting up any new \nGovernment agencies. We are not calling for some micromanaged, run-\nfrom-Washington kind of operation. We are saying the passenger deserves \na fair shake with respect to accurate information on the lowest fares \nthat are available.\n\n  So this amendment, that I am proud to offer again with the chairman \nof the subcommittee, Chairman Shelby, and Senator Lautenberg, would \nstipulate the Department of Transportation could investigate as a \ndeceptive trade practice the failure on the part of an airline to tell \nthe passenger the lowest fare that is available, no matter how the \ncustomer contacts the airline. Under the voluntary pledge, again, the \nairlines are going to be in a position to withhold information about \nthe lowest fares from customers, information that they have, as Senator \nLautenberg noted in his previous statement, and information that ought \nto be supplied to the consumer so the consumer can make accurate \nchoices.\n  All we are talking about in both of these amendments is access to \ninformation, full disclosure, the public's right to know. But the \nfailure to do it, the failure to inform the consumer, ought to be \ntreated seriously by this Congress.\n  These two amendments provide that opportunity to do so by saying the \nDepartment of Transportation can investigate as a deceptive trade \npractice the failure to inform the public, in this case of the lowest \nfare available, in the previous case information about overbooking.\n  I know time is short and there is much to do with respect to this \nimportant legislation. I thank Senator Shelby and Senator Lautenberg \nfor their support. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/14/senate-section/article/S10825-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10825-S10827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGESTION AND DELAYS IN AIR TRAFFIC SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, there is a very famous line that we \nall know from the heroic astronauts of Apollo 13. The line is: \n``Houston, we have a problem.''\n  Today, many of us who have spent the August recess traveling to our \nhome States and various places across the country also realize that we \n``have a problem'' in the air. This problem is not only in Houston, it \nis in Atlanta, it is in Chicago, it is in Cleveland, it is in Detroit \nand in nearly every other city across the country.\n  Over the last month, there have been very troubling reports of \nunprecedented increases in congestion and delays in our national air \ntraffic system--long hours of delay. I have not heard a speech in this \nChamber about this in the last several months. We spent most of \nyesterday having, I guess, basically a political debate about the \nPuerto Rican clemency situation, but this is urgent in a very different \nway because it involves life and death, the national economy, and \ncongestion which is beyond the scope of thinking of many of our fellow \ncitizens.\n  We are not talking about merely an inconvenience. We are talking \nabout a potential crippling of the national economy and, if ignored, we \nare talking about extremely serious safety issues.\n  I happen to be an admirer of FAA Administrator Jane Garvey. I think \nshe is very good, and I think she is tough. She ran an airport in \nBoston. That is a tough thing to do. I have a lot of confidence and \nfaith in her. She canceled her own summer vacation plans because the \ncrisis was so bad. She stayed in Washington to work with the \ncontrollers and with the airlines on this enormous congestion problem \non which I will elaborate in a minute.\n  Beginning in mid-July, the FAA and the carriers conducted an on-the-\nspot evaluation of about 33 different facilities across the country in \nthe air traffic control system. That is the one which routes our planes \nhither and yon; they better be right.\n  In this evaluation, they came up with a short-term plan for reducing \ndelays and for improving some inconveniences. It is really too soon to \nsay how effective it will be. I am glad they did it, but we cannot draw \nany final conclusions from it.\n  Everybody involved with the plan seems to agree that these short-term \nfixes are nothing more than that--short-term fixes. They are meant to \naddress symptoms of an underlying problem which we in Congress \nconsistently fail to address, which is an air traffic control system \nthat must be modernized--but we will not do it, nor put up the money \nfor it--restructuring within the FAA and other areas in order to meet \nsurging travel demands and remain viable, as they say, into the next \ncentury.\n  Of course, while this serious problem-solving effort was going on at \nthe FAA and its facilities during this summer, we in the Congress, and \nespecially we in the Senate, have largely or virtually--totally, I \nshould say--stood by. We have watched. We have not even commented. We \nhave simply watched or in some cases even looked the other way. Lack of \nconcern? Too complicated? I do not know.\n  We continue in this same vein that we have approached aviation for \nmore than a year now, ignoring the problem, ignoring the cost, ignoring \nthe solutions, ignoring the complexity, by avoiding the issue and \nrefusing to make the time to debate it in a serious way.\n  We left for the August recess without even bringing up FAA \nreauthorization or the airport improvement program reauthorization. \nThat is our most basic aviation responsibility. That is our bottom \nline. We failed to do it. In fact, we all went home knowing that the \nairport funding program was going to lapse. And, of course, on August 6 \nit did.\n  Some would have you believe that the FAA reauthorization bill is so \nmired in controversy that we just cannot do it--not a matter of not \nwanting to do it; we cannot do it. I am here to tell you--and to \nimplore you--that most of the bill is entirely resolved and that the \nremaining issues require only some healthy debate, a measure of \ncompromise; and if we will only make the time, we can certainly get all \nof this done and need to this month.\n\n[[Page S10826]]\n\n  I understand that the majority leader and the Democratic leader have \nbeen working very closely on this matter, on doing just exactly that, \nhaving us work on it, finding the time to bring the FAA bill to the \nfloor. It used to be that an FAA bill did not have all that much \nsignificance. Actually, that is probably not a true statement. Today it \nhas overwhelming complexity and significance to it.\n  Senators Hollings, McCain, Gorton, and I are doing our very level \nbest to work out as many of the remaining issues as we possibly can so \nthe bill will go smoothly and quickly on the floor. And we believe that \nit can, if given a chance.\n  But the important thing is that we get going, is that we do \nsomething, is that we bring it here, is that we discuss it, is that we \nare educated by it, by some of the facts that surround it because the \nconsequences of inaction are growing very dangerous.\n  Some facts:\n  The Air Transport Association reports that air traffic control delays \nwere up 19 percent from January through July of 1999 and 36 percent \nfrom May through June of 1999 as compared to the same periods in 1998.\n  With an average of 1,358 aircraft delayed each day from May through \nJuly as a result of something called air traffic control, and an \naverage of 106 passengers per aircraft, the Air Transport Association \nestimates that 140,000 passengers were delayed in America each day from \nMay through July of this year--140,000 passengers each and every day.\n  For the first 5 months of 1999, as compared to the same period in \n1998--a 1-year difference--delays increased at Detroit 267 percent; at \nLas Vegas, 168 percent; at Chicago Midway, 158 percent; at Cincinnati, \n142 percent; at Dallas/Fort Worth, 131 percent.\n  ATA reports that 625 million in passenger minutes of passenger delay \neach year costs the economy over $4 billion annually and results in \npassengers being delayed 28,500 hours each day on average--with the \nnumbers going up every month.\n\n  And 72 percent of the delays are weather-related, they say--it may be \ntrue, it may not be--but that does not mean that the weather is so bad \nthat we cannot avoid gridlock on our part.\n  We can, and we must, continue to invest money in training and \nstaffing, in paying for advanced automation tools to enable controllers \nto work around bad weather and minimize disruption to the extent that, \nin fact, they would be able to if we were willing to fund them and to \ngive them the possibility of doing that. This technology and this \ncapability exists at this instant and should be improved upon for \ntomorrow.\n  Before we jump to blame the FAA for all these current problems, I \nshould be very clear that I believe the carriers also share some \nresponsibility, as do we in Congress, again, particularly in the \nSenate.\n  FAA reports that traffic increases are greatest in the Northeast. \nThat is not a surprise; that is where a lot of people live. And it \nappears to be the result of several factors: a stronger economy; the \ninflux of regional jets, which fly at the same altitude but not nearly \nas fast as the big jets, so it complicates the way planes can be \nmaneuvered; significant deliveries of new aircraft to major carriers \nthat have to keep them flying--they have no economic choice to begin to \nrecoup their investment, even if fewer flights would meet their \ncustomers' actual needs--the efforts by a couple of the major airlines \nto develop low-cost/low-fare operations along the eastern seaboard to \ncompete with Southwest on point-to-point routes; and in some cases \nexcessive airline scheduling.\n  For example--and I see my good friend, the senior Senator from New \nJersey--only 48 arrivals are possible each hour at Newark Airport in \nvery good weather. But for marketing purposes, individual carriers are \nscheduling 55 to 60 arrivals at Newark Airport during the exact same \nhours. This happens at hub airports all across the country and \neffectively guarantees delay no matter what the FAA, no matter what the \ncontrollers might want to do.\n  Allow me to begin to finish with a quote from the latest major study \nof the system, the broad system, by the National Civil Aviation Review \nCommission in 1998. The Commission's warning is compelling and has been \naffirmed by the industry, affirmed by the Department of Transportation, \nthe FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board, and the Gore \nCommission on Security and Safety, and everybody else who works in or \non or with aviation.\n  Their quote:\n\n       [W]ithout prompt action the United States' aviation system \n     is headed for gridlock shortly after the turn of the century. \n     If this gridlock is allowed to happen, it will result in a \n     deterioration of aviation safety, harm the efficiency and \n     growth of our domestic economy, and hurt our position in the \n     global marketplace. Lives [will] be endangered, the \n     profitability and strength of the aviation sector could \n     disappear, and jobs and business opportunities far beyond \n     aviation could be foregone.\n\n  So given all of this, I say that we do not just have a problem at \nHouston but we have a problem all over America.\n  What more do we need to know before we are inspired to act? Must we \nwait until the gridlock is upon us? Are we waiting for some \ncatastrophic event? Are we waiting to be shot out of our inertia? That \nis what we have been doing here in the Senate for some time. And does \nit have to come to unnecessary deaths? Sometimes that happens in \nAmerica. People don't pay attention until there is something so \nhorrible that they want action.\n  That is not what we want to happen in the Senate. We are given the \nresponsibility for aviation policy--our section of it. We have an \nauthorizing and appropriating process. We have not been exercising it. \nWe have been consistently underfunding the most basic aspects of our \naviation system. We know it, we will not change it, and we do not talk \nabout it.\n  We simply cannot continue to sit on our hands, waiting until it is \n``convenient'' to start the debate. We are underinvesting in our system \nto the tune of at least $6 billion each year--$4 billion short on air \ntraffic equipment and technology, an instrument of safety, and $2 \nbillion short on airport infrastructure and capacity improvements. \nThese are just the funds needed to keep us going at the current, \nentirely unacceptable rate and not to improve our situation but just to \nkeep us where we are. I trust my words have convinced my colleagues \nthat I do not believe that is sufficient.\n  So closing this $6 billion annual funding shortfall doesn't even \nbegin to modernize and do what we need to do in the aviation system. \nThat is a sensitive subject, and $6 billion is a lot of money. We don't \nlike to talk about spending that, but we will get nowhere in aviation \nwithout it.\n  Without getting too much into some especially contentious differences \nbetween the House and Senate aviation bills, let me state the obvious \nabout this apparent funding gap. We all know there is money in the \naviation trust fund that could and should be used. There are any number \nof ways to do it. We could take the trust fund off budget; we could \nfirewall the revenues; we could simply spend more on the discretionary \nside for critical and growing needs in our aviation infrastructure. The \npoint is that we have to make a commitment to fix and improve this \nsystem, and it is going to take money to do it. We cannot avoid that.\n  So today, I say to colleagues, it is time to talk about the needs of \nthe FAA, time to talk about the needs of the aviation system. We cannot \nsimply go on to conference on a blank bill, and I don't think that is \nthe intention anymore. We can't write the bill in conference. We can't \ndo this without debate or without input from this body. Thankfully, \nthis week I am beginning to feel cautiously optimistic about our \nability to work together to get this bill to the floor. Frankly, we owe \nit to the traveling public and to the tireless air traffic controllers. \nI don't know how many of you have watched these folks work and looked \nat the equipment with which they have to work. It is a shocker. In some \ncases it is stunningly wonderful, and in some cases it is shockingly \npoor.\n  At some point, underinvestment in something as important as what will \ncarry a billion passengers in 6 or 7 years--our aviation system--will \ncatch up with us. I fear that day is already upon us. The consequences \nof continued inaction are terribly real--real for public safety and \nreal for our national economy. So let's go forward and take\n\n[[Page S10827]]\n\nthe work that our majority and minority leaders are now talking about \nand get to this bill.\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time on \ntwo amendments that have been offered by Senator Wyden relative to \nairline reporting be limited to 1 hour of total debate, to be equally \ndivided in the usual form. I further ask that votes occur on or in \nrelation to the Wyden amendments in the order in which they were \noffered, beginning at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, tomorrow, with 2 minutes \nfor explanation between each vote and no additional amendments in order \nprior to the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, there will be \nno further votes this evening, and the next votes will occur at 11 a.m. \nWednesday, tomorrow.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia for an excellent statement with respect to the air \ntraffic control system. It seems to me what the Senator from West \nVirginia has pointed out is that our country, to some extent, wants a \n21st century air traffic control system and they want to figure out how \nto do it on a 19th century budget.\n  The Senator from West Virginia, it seems to me, is saying it is time \nfor all of us in the Congress to, in effect, put our dollars where our \nmouth is with respect to safety. If you are serious about improving \nsafety, you have to fund this woefully inadequate air traffic control \nsystem.\n  The fact of the matter is, the Senator from West Virginia has spent \nmany years battling to strengthen the air traffic control system, as \nhas the distinguished ranking minority member of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, Senator Hollings. I think the Senator from West Virginia has \ngiven an extremely important address this afternoon in terms of \nhighlighting how critical it is to the safety agenda of the American \npeople. You cannot do what is needed to improve safety for airline \npassengers in this country without following the recommendations of the \nSenator from West Virginia. I wanted him to know that his remarks were \nheard, and heard clearly, by this junior member of the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  I will wrap up this afternoon by thanking again Senator Shelby and \nSenator Lautenberg for their support of the two amendments I am \noffering that will be voted on in the morning. They are simple, \nstraightforward amendments calling for disclosure with respect to \noverbooking of airline flights, making sure the passengers can actually \nknow about the lowest fares that are available, whether it is over the \ntelephone or on a web site.\n\n  As we wrap up this afternoon, my understanding is that we will have \nadditional time to discuss this on the floor of the Senate tomorrow \nmorning. I am very proud to have the support of the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Mr. Shelby, and the ranking minority member, Mr. \nLautenberg, on the two amendments that will come up tomorrow morning \nwith respect to disclosure. I also thank their staffs and the staffs of \nthe Commerce Committee, who have been working to make it possible, \nprocedurally, for the Senate to consider these in the morning.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for \nhis contribution in the form of these amendments. We work together on \nthe Budget Committee, and on other matters. He is always thoughtful on \nthe matters he brings to the Senate.\n  Before the Senator from West Virginia leaves the room, I want to say \nto him that one of the things he talked about, sort of indirectly, in \nterms of getting the FAA up to the point that it should be in order to \ntake care of the volume of traffic we have--we must make air travel \nmore user friendly. You do that by providing an infrastructure that can \naccommodate the volume of traffic we have. I commend the Senator from \nWest Virginia. He works very hard on matters of aviation. We are \ngrateful to him for his contribution.\n  I would like to say this. One of the things that kind of pervades the \ndiscussion that has gone on here for the last while by the Senator from \nOregon and the Senator from West Virginia is that there has to be a \nchange in attitude, in my view.\n  The airlines have to understand that they have a precious commodity \nwhen they have license to offer the services that they do. They are not \nunlike the doctor who provides excellent service who uses the hospital \noperating room for his or her work.\n  We provide airspace--limited airspace. We provide huge investment in \ntechnology to have a system operate better. We provide airports. We \nprovide facilities. And all of this is not designed to punish. My \nconversation is not designed to punish the airlines but to make sure it \nis remembered that they are serving the public, with the permission of \nthe Government indirectly, by providing the kinds of facilities that \ncan accommodate the number of flights and the routes that are being \nused. It is user friendly.\n  I recently proposed something in New Jersey that has some people in \ngovernment a little nervous. I suggested that when someone has to wait \nto pay a toll and it gets beyond a certain point, the drivers be \npermitted to go through free. I call it a deadline, Don't Encumber \nDrivers--DED--because otherwise those toll road authorities just \ncollect their money. It just takes them a little while longer. But the \none who pays and gets less service is the driver. You sit there in all \nof that smog, fog, and congestion. You miss your appointment, you don't \nget to work, you don't get to school, you don't get to the doctor, and \nshopping is not done on time.\n  Why is it that the user is the one always pays the price?\n  You go into a well operated supermarket, and they open more lanes so \nyou can pay your bills faster because they know you don't want to stand \naround there to have to give them your money. So it is also, I think, \nwith the airlines.\n  I don't want to see them punished. This isn't designed to be \npunitive. What we are suggesting here is designed to make it fairer for \nthe traveling passenger. Rather than bumping people, there ought to be \nother ways to deal with it, so that if someone is bumped, the airline \nalso feels the pressure--not just the passenger if the airline chose to \noversell the seats.\n  I don't want to see the airlines flying with empty seats. That is not \na mission at all. Maybe they have to come up with a different scheme. \nMaybe there has to be a deposit when you make an airline reservation. I \nhave talked to lots of people who would make two or three reservations \non airplanes on different flights so they could do it at their \nconvenience, which means that someone else could not fly because they \nhave blocked these seats. Maybe there has to be a deposit when the \nreservation is made to be used either for a trip or as a cost for doing \nbusiness.\n  If you want to have furniture delivered to your house, you can't get \nit delivered without suffering some kind of a penalty if they deliver \nit and nobody is home and they have to turn around and take it back, or \nif you want to cancel midstream. Try buying a car without a deposit. \nThey will tell you no. You can't have your wash done without having a \nlaundry ticket.\n  In any event, I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will comment further on that amendment. \nA number of objections from people in the vicinity of a portion of that \nland exchange were made both to me and to my colleague, Senator Murray. \nThe letter responds to many of those concerns, and others will be \nresponded to by the Plum Creek Company itself.\n  I would like to say a number of those objections were valid \nobjections and deeply concerned this Senator, and we hope they will \nlargely be alleviated by the prompt response of Plum Creek.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a letter addressed to me from \nPlum Creek be printed in connection with the Plum Creek land exchange \namendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S10829]]\n\n\n\n\n                                        Plum Creek Timber Co.,\n\n                                  Seattle, WA, September 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Slade Gorton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gorton: We greatly appreciate your continuing \n     efforts to resolve the issues created by the discovery of \n     marbled murrelets on lands to be acquired by Plum Creek as \n     part of the I-90 Land Exchange. Plum Creek agrees with the \n     legislative language worked out by your office and the U.S. \n     Forest Service to accommodate the new lands package and we \n     are prepared to assist in any way that we can.\n       We are aware that some opposition has developed over the \n     lands near Randle, Washington, that Plum Creek would receive \n     in the exchange. The opponents have painted a dismal scenario \n     of what Plum Creek might do when the exchange is complete and \n     we want to assure you of the facts.\n       First, Plum Creek has an excellent reputation of including \n     neighbors and local communities in the planning process. We \n     have not yet developed any specific plans for the Randle \n     area, and will not until we have met with community leaders \n     and heard first-hand their concerns. We are prepared to \n     consider any options that will help to resolve the issues.\n       Second, our own standards and the strict forest practice \n     rules of the state of Washington require that great care be \n     taken to identify and avoid any areas of geological concern, \n     such as unstable soils and steep slopes. Indeed, after \n     extensive public study and comment, nearly 10,000 acres of \n     U.S. Forest Service land was removed from consideration early \n     in the exchange process for just this reason. The land that \n     remains in the exchange has been thoroughly studied and can, \n     with careful planning, be managed in a thoughtful and \n     appropriate manner.\n       Third, any Plum Creek operations will be strictly governed \n     by our own Environmental Principles and the standards of the \n     American Forest and Paper Association's Sustainable Forestry \n     Initiative.\n       Plum Creek is willing to continue to work with local \n     citizens, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Delegation to \n     resolve important issues upon completion of the I-90 Land \n     Exchange. We continue to believe the Exchange is a fair deal \n     for Plum Creek and a great deal for the public.\n                                                       Bill Brown.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, included within the Manager's amendment \nto the FY 2000 Interior Appropriations bill is a technical fix to last \nyear's legislated I-90 Land Exchange. The amendment to the legislation \nwas necessary to address to discovery of nesting marbled murrelets on \ntwo parcels of Forest Service land originally set to be exchanged to \nPlum Creek Timber Company. The language in the amendment is agreeable \nto both the Forest Service and Plum Creek.\n  Other issues, particularly that of potential landslides on parcels of \nland being transferred to Plum Creek near the town of Randle, \nWashington, have recently arisen. Members of the community are fearful \nthat if some of these lands are harvested by Plum Creek that dangerous \nlandslides are possible. I believe this a legitimate concern and have \nbegun discussions with the Forest Service, Plum Creek, Congressman \nBaird and Senator Gorton as to possible solutions. I believe, however, \nthat the land exchange is a benefit to the people of Washington and \nshould proceed as we continue to work on the issue of concern to Randle \nresidents.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter to me \nfrom Plum Creek regarding the company's commitment to protecting the \nwelfare of local communities, the forest land it acquires, and \nwillingness to work with all parties to address the issues in Randle. I \nhope, that if a solution to the issues of concern to Randle residents \nis found in time, that such a solution be placed into the Interior bill \nat conference.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        Plum Creek Timber Co.,\n\n                                  Seattle, WA, September 14, 1999.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I wish to discuss an amendment originally \noffered by my colleague from Montana to prohibit the reintroduction of \nthe grizzly bear in the Selway-Bitterroot area of Idaho and Montana. \nThis language is being included in the managers' amendment.\n  I strongly support reintroduction of the grizzly bears under the \nEndangered Species Act. Presently in the lower 48 States, there are \nonly 800 to 1000 bears in scattered pockets of habitat in Idaho, \nMontana and Washington. Large species such as the grizzly are most \nvulnerable when they are limited to small populations and confined to \nsmall portions of habitat. Because grizzlies are not likely to migrate \nbeyond the pockets in which they now exist, they are not likely to find \ntheir own way to the Selway-Bitterroot area, even though it is an area \nthey once inhabited. The reintroduction of grizzlies in this area will \ngreatly bolster efforts to recover grizzlies in the lower 48 States.\n  The current proposal by the Fish and Wildlife Service establishes a \nCitizen Management Committee to make the primary decisions on \nreintroduction and management. This committee would consist of 15 \nmembers, with 7 chosen by the Governor of Idaho, 5 chosen by the \nGovernor of Montana, one chosen by the Nez Perce Tribe, one chosen by \nthe Chief of the Forest Service and one chosen by the Director of the \nFish and Wildlife Service. The committee would have authority to \nestablish specific recovery goals, determine areas for reintroduction, \nand establish land-use standards.\n  This proposal has been developed after tremendous public involvement \nand outreach. Since 1992, with the formation of a citizens' group, \nlocal individuals and industries have been involved in the decisions \nrelating to grizzly bear recovery in Idaho and Montana. Preparation of \nboth the draft and final Environmental Impact Statements provided \nsignificant opportunity for public comment. In sum, the proposal has \nbeen developed with painstaking effort and deliberation.\n  The result is a coalition of supporters among timber companies, \nranchers, and environmental groups. Governor Racicot of Montana has \nlong backed the reintroduction plan. While Governor Kempthorne opposes \nthe plan, he recently stated that he wants Idaho to take a strong \nleadership role if the reintroduction is going to happen. Numerous \nnewspapers in both states have endorsed the plan.\n  Nevertheless, there continues to be opposition to the proposal among \nnumerous local citizens, particularly within the Valley in Montana \nalong the eastern border of the Selway-Bitterroot area. I strongly \nencourage both the Fish and Wildlife Service and Forest Service to \ncontinue their outreach and education efforts, and to address the \nconcerns of these citizens.\n  Mr. President, you may recall that this Chamber has seen fierce \nopposition to the reintroduction of other species in an effort to \nrecover them under the ESA. Specifically, we have debated \nreintroductions of the red wolf in North Carolina in 1995 and the gray \nwolf in Yellowstone in 1996. What has come of those programs? Nothing \nbut tremendous success. Both species are close to full recovery. Both \nprograms resulted in less livestock depredation than originally \npredicted. Both programs cost less to the Federal taxpayer than \noriginally estimated. Have there been occasional problems with \nindividual wolves? Of course. But each program had provided for such \noccasions, and problems were addressed efficiently and expeditiously.\n  With the care and attention that has been poured into the grizzly \nbear program from not just the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest \nService, but local citizens, industries, conservation groups and of \ncourse the States, I have no doubt that this program will also be a \nsuccess.\n  Indeed, I will venture to say that, in hindsight, we will marvel at \nthe ability of Nature to take over the grizzly bear program--as it has \nwith the Yellowstone gray wolves and North Carolina red wolves--and run \nits own course smoothly, with nothing more than a little encouragement \nfrom us. All we need to do is to provide that encouragement.\n  I do not oppose the amendment adopted today by the managers of the \nbill, but that is only because it is narrowly limited to a prohibition \nof funds for physical relocation of bears in the Selway-Bitterroot \narea. The Service does not intend to relocate bears into the area \nbefore FY 2001. The language does not prohibit completion of the EIS \nand the Record of Decision, publication of a rulemaking under section \n10(j) of the ESA, or activities to provide outreach and to set up the \ncitizen's committee. It will not prevent activities in FY 2000 in \nsupport of reintroduction, short of physically relocating grizzlies in \nthe area. Because the language does not prohibit what the Service would \notherwise do in FY 2000, I do not oppose the language.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 1587 as modified\n\n(Purpose: to establish the scientific basis for noise standards applied \n                   to the Grand Canyon National Park)\n\n       At the end of Title I, add the following new section:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bennett-Jeffords-\nReed amendment. For the past 34 years, the National Endowment for the \nArts has served the public good by nurturing the expression of human \ncreativity, supporting the cultivation of community spirit, improving \nour children's education, and fostering the recognition and \nappreciation of our nation's artistic accomplishments.\n  The arts and humanities have an immense positive impact on the lives \nof all Americans. Children and adolescents in particular benefit \ntremendously from artistic expression. Studies show again and again \nthat comprehensive arts education programs in schools with at-risk \nstudent populations improve academic achievement; student self-\nassurance; creative and critical thinking skills; attendance; as well \nas student and parent attitudes about school.\n  And yet, we as a society have consistently underfunded arts education \nand community arts programs at the local, state and federal level. In \nrecent years, Congress has exacerbated this situation by dramatically \nreducing funding to the National Endowment for the Arts.\n  The NEA has not seen a budget increase in 8 years--not since 1992, \nwhen the agency had a budget of $175.9 million. In 1996, the NEA's \nbudget was slashed by 40% to $99 million, and it has remained near that \nlevel ever since.\n  This year, the President requested an increase of $52 million for the \nNEA, nearly all of which would have been used to pay for a major new \ninitiative called Challenge America. A priority of Challenge America \nwould be to get NEA funds to areas of the country that have not \nreceived sufficient funds in the past. Challenge America would focus on \noutreach projects for education, after-school programs using the arts, \nhistoric preservation, and upgrading the arts infrastructure in our \ncommunities. In effect, Challenge America would put the arts at the \ncenter of family and community life.\n  Mr. President, by reaching out to new communities and new regions of \nthe country, the Challenge America program would directly address the \nconcerns that members of this body have expressed with regard to the \ndistribution of NEA funds.\n  Unfortunately, the Interior spending bill before us contains no \nfunding for the Challenge America initiative. The Appropriations \nCommittee's report indicates, however, that the lack of funds for \nChallenge America ``should not be interpreted as a lack of support by \nthe Committee for the Endowment's proposal.''\n  The problem, of course, is the budget. The distinguished Interior \nSubcommittee Chairman and Ranking Member have done an outstanding job \nto report a bill within the tight allocations provided to them. I \ncommend them for their effort and fully appreciate the constraints \nwithin which they operate.\n  However, I believe we can, and should, find the money to make the \nChallenge America program a reality and to allow the NEA to do what so \nmany members of this body want it to do. At a time when we are \nconsidering an $800 billion tax cut, I think it is not unreasonable to \nprovide a small increase to an agency that has such a meaningful impact \nin communities across the country. This amendment, which would provide \n$4 million in additional funding to the NEA in fiscal year 2000, would \npermit the NEA to get the Challenge America initiative off the ground. \nEvery dime of additional money would be used for project grants--mostly \nthe small, expedited grants that will get funding to previously \nunderserved areas of the country.\n  Mr. President, the NEA is under new management. Chairman Bill Ivey \nhas worked hard to reform the Endowment's operations and to respond to \nthe concerns expressed by members of Congress in recent years.\n  It is time we gave the NEA a chance to show that it has changed. \nLet's give it the opportunity to do what we've asked it to do--to get \nmore grants to new rural and urban areas, to do more in the area of \narts education, and to help us rebuild our cities and make them more \nattractive places for people to live and work.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, a number of my colleagues and I have \nadvocated a small increase in funding for the National Endowment for \nthe Arts. I also want to commend Senator Cochran's efforts to increase \nfunds for the National for the Humanities. Neither endowment has \nreceived a significant increase since their budgets were cut by nearly \n40 percent in fiscal 1996. I believe a $4 million increase is warranted \ngiven the reforms intended to make the endowments more efficient and \nmore accountable have been implemented and we have seen results.\n  While a positive story could be told about the National Endowment for \nthe Arts, I believe the real story of the NEA and NEH is a local story. \nAnd in my case, a Utah story. In previous years, I have outlined the \norigins of the strong arts and humanities tradition in Utah. The arts \nflourished in Utah before Utah was even a state. Utah also had one of \nthe first publicly funded arts councils in America.\n  Today, I would like to tell two stories of traveling exhibition \nprograms in the arts and humanities. Both benefit rural areas. Both \nprovide communities with opportunities that might not be available \notherwise. These types of programs make a strong case for a small \nfederal investment in the arts and humanities.\n  For the last 35 years, the Utah Arts Council's Traveling Exhibition \nProgram, supported in part by the National Endowment for the Arts, has \ntoured visual arts exhibitions all over Utah. In some areas, \nparticularly in the more rural regions of the state, the exhibition is \nthe only source of visual arts programming. Utah's San Juan county \nbussed children from surrounding communities to view these exhibitions. \nAnother rural county boasted a 100-percent citizen participation for \none of the exhibits.\n  The Utah Arts Council's Traveling Exhibition Program serves more than \n150,000 people in all but two counties of the state each year. Every \nyear the Utah Arts Council receives more than 250 requests for the \nprogram, but is only able to satisfy half. Each Traveling Exhibition \nincludes educational materials that emphasize not only the artistic \naspects of the exhibits, but also its connections to other aspects of \nthe curriculum.\n  Denise Hoffman, a librarian at the Green River Library and \nparticipant in the program, made this comment:\n\n       We are a very small and isolated town in rural Utah. Almost \n     every student in the grade school comes to the library on a \n     weekly basis. A vast majority of our students will never be \n     exposed to the arts. We use the traveling exhibitions as a \n     basis for learning. By making these displays easily \n     affordable, you cannot count the young lives that have been \n     touched, or guided into the arts. Please consider dollar for \n     dollar what we are getting with this program. It is critical \n     to us.\n\n  Another program that benefits rural areas is a collaborative project \nbetween the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Services \n(SITES)\n\n[[Page S10834]]\n\nand state humanities councils. Its goal is to give small rural museums \naccess to Smithsonian resources. What resulted was a small traveling \nprogram with Smithsonian type exhibits called ``Museum on Main \nStreet.'' The two projects developed under this program are ``Produce \nfor Victory: Posters on the American Homefront 1941-1945'' and ``Barn \nAgain! Celebrating an American Icon.'' The Utah Humanities Council \nspearheaded this effort and the following communities have participated \nin this program: Castle Dale, population 1,704; Vernal, population \n6,644; Kanab, population 3,289; Wellsville, population 2,206; \nMonticello, population 1,806; Delta population 2,998; Ephraim, \npopulation 3,363; Heber, population 4,362; and Payson, population \n9,510.\n\n  Castle Dale, Kanab, Payson, Vernal, and Delta hosted their first \nSmithsonian exhibit using ``Produce for Victory'' as a basis for the \ncommunities to remember what was occurring in America during the years \n1941 through 1945. Each community developed local programs including \nUSO dances, ration recipe luncheons, reunions of women who worked in \nmunitions industries (``Rosie the Riveter''), discussions of the 1930s \nand 1940s movies and newsreels, and exhibitions of local artifacts.\n  Kanab had activities all year commemorating World War II. Events \nincluded a poster exhibit from the Smithsonian, World War II movies \nfrom Brigham Young University's film collection, and countless other \nvery personal contributions from many of the town's people who had \ndirectly participated in the war or were relatives of those who had.\n  An immediate result of various groups working together on this \nproject was to make young people aware of those whose lives were \ndirectly touched by World War II. Many of the local youth had no idea \nthat they were living next door to people who had first-hand knowledge \nof this historic event. Grandchildren were talking to grandparents and \nasking questions about the war. Many teens were surprised to learn that \nsome of those serving in the armed services were no older than their \nbig brothers or themselves. During the celebration, those who had \ncontributed their possessions from that period stood by their displays, \nready to describe each artifact.\n  These types of activities help us remember our history, the \nindividual sacrifices that were made for freedom, how individuals coped \nwith difficult times, and how America emerged stronger. Understanding \nthis legacy through these types of exhibits is a worthwhile pursuit.\n  The traveling exhibits that I have described today are in keeping \nwith the goal of bringing our historical and cultural heritage to areas \nthat would not otherwise have the opportunity. Much of the criticism of \nthe NEA has been anecdotal and has painted an ugly picture. Utah's \nstory is anything but. The state arts and humanities councils, assisted \nby the National Endowments, and the Smithsonian, has demonstrated how \narts and humanities can be a positive influence in our communities.\n  Mr. President, I believe a continued federal arts and humanities \npartnership is worthwhile, and encourage my colleagues to support a \nsmall increase.\n  I would also like to thank Chairman Gorton for his leadership on this \nbill. He has had to balance several competing priorities and has done \nan admirable job. I appreciate very much his attention to the details \nof so many important issues.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the most important provisions in \nthis bill is its support for the National Endowments for the Arts and \nHumanities. These agencies provide essential Federal support for \ncultural activities in communities across America. The arts and \nhumanities are a central part of our democracy, our history and our \nheritage and they eminently deserve this federal support.\n  It is important for the federal government to create an environment \nwhich supports the arts and humanities in our nation. The Endowments \nhave done an outstanding job in providing this needed support. They \nhave provided assistance to theaters, museums, dance companies, and a \nwide range of cultural activities in communities and neighborhoods in \nevery state.\n  The federal role is not an isolated one. It functions in partnership \nwith local and state governments and the private sector. Across the \ncountry, mayors have been among the strongest supporters of the arts, \nbecause they know that a strong cultural community attracts families \nand businesses to our cities. Cultural tourism is a growth industry in \nstates throughout the country.\n  Federal support provides needed assistance to cultural institutions, \nand it also provides critical support in schools. Today's schools face \na broad range of challenges, and a compelling body of research \ndemonstrates a strong correlation between study of the arts and \nacademic achievement. The arts are ``the Fourth R,'' and they deserve \nto have a significant role in the educational experience of all \nchildren.\n  In 1998, students with course work in music scored 52 points higher \non the verbal portion and 36 points higher on the math portion of the \nSAT. With results like these, it is clear that we should find effective \nways to integrate arts education into the classroom curriculum so that \nmusic, painting, drama and other arts can enrich the educational \nexperience of all students.\n  The Endowments have often been the subject of criticism over the last \nseveral years. But Congress has imposed reforms that have virtually \neliminated controversy over grant awards.\n  The Arts Endowment has worked hard to improve its operations and to \nrespond to the concerns expressed by members of Congress. Its current \nchair, Bill Ivey, has proposed a major new initiative, Challenge \nAmerica, that will emphasize outreach projects for education, including \nafter-school programs involving the arts, historic preservation and \nmeasures to develop the arts infrastructure in communities. He has also \nimplemented ``ArtsReach'' which will encourage applications and grants \nto states that have received few grants in the past.\n  The Humanities Endowment has undertaken a leadership role to improve \nteacher training using the Internet and other technologies to ensure \nthat new public programs in the humanities reach classrooms in as many \ncommunities as possible.\n  These agencies are doing all that they can to expand the scope of \ncultural activities in America. It is essential that we provide them \nwith the resources necessary to carry out their important mission. I \nsupport efforts to increase funding for the agencies, so that they can \nmore fully achieve their important goals. As the statute creating the \nagencies emphasized, the United States cannot afford to limit its \nefforts to science and technology alone, but should give fair and full \nsupport to the other great branches of scholarly and cultural endeavors \nin our society, in order to achieve a better understanding of the past, \na better analysis of the present, and a better vision of the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support funding for these agencies, and I \nhope that at long last we can give them the support that they have \nearned.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators \nBennett, Chafee, Kennedy, Moynihan, and Reed, I am pleased that the \nManagers of the bill have agreed to support our proposal for a funding \nincrease for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National \nEndowment for the Humanities.\n  First let me commend Senators Gorton and Byrd for starting this \ndiscussion out on the right foot. They provided modest increases for \nthe NEA, NEH and IMLS under very difficult circumstances. I applaud the \nleadership they have shown in recognizing the important role that each \nof these agencies play in strengthening our nation's cultural \ninstitutions and expanding opportunities for participation in cultural \nactivities.\n  My support for these agencies runs deep because I know that the \ngrants that they make have a positive impact on the state of Vermont \nand nearly all who live there. The NEA and NEH make it possible for \nmore Vermonters to have access to the arts and humanities in their many \ndifferent forms and shapes--literature, art history, dance, music, \nfolkarts, history and theater.\n  In number terms, the positive impact of the arts and the humanities \nis statistically significant. It can be measured in terms of increased \nacademic\n\n[[Page S10835]]\n\nachievement and better outlook on life for those school-aged children \nthat have the opportunity to participate in the arts or humanities \nexperience.\n  In terms of education, students of the arts outperform their ``non-\narts'' peers on the SAT. Even when one takes into consideration the \neconomic status of a family, kids from low-income families that \nparticipate in the arts had higher grades in English, were less likely \nto drop out by grade 10, were less ``bored'' in school, had a higher \n``self concept,'' and placed a higher value on volunteerism than their \nlow-income peers with low arts involvement.\n  The arts have demonstrated effectiveness in making a difference for \nyouth at-risk by decreasing truancy and increasing enthusiasm for \nlearning. Students engaged in the learning process are less likely to \nget into trouble and the arts have proven themselves are one of our \nbest tools in this effort. The hard data backs up these claims.\n  In other instances, the positive impact of the arts and humanities \ncan be ``measured'' by a smile that grows on the face of a person \nlistening to the music of the Vermont Symphony at a free summer \nconcert; it can be ``quantified'' by the deeper understanding one gains \nabout storytelling and the New England folk culture thanks to programs \nsponsored by the Vermont Folklife Center; it can be ``gauged'' by a \nyoung person's spirit that soars to new heights from imagining worlds \nbeyond their own while daydreaming at the Fairbanks Museum and \nPlanetarium in St. Johnsbury.\n  We must recognize and acknowledge the ways in which the arts expand \nthe imagination of young people; broaden their interest in creating; \nintroduce them to other worlds, other people, and other cultures; make \nlearning other subjects generally more ``fun;'' and build their skills \nof cooperation that they must practice when performing a play, playing \nin a band, or singing in a choir. The NEA and NEH make these \nopportunities possible for the people of Vermont. With a little \ninvestigation, many of you will find that these agencies are doing the \nsame in your home states.\n  Because of the consideration shown by the Chairman of this \nsubcommittee, each of the three agencies will be able to extend their \ngrant programs more broadly. With the additional money that we are \nrequesting today, NEA and NEH could further expand their outreach \nefforts with an eye towards introducing more Americans, many for the \nfirst time to the beauty of dance, the spectacle of theater, the \nenchantment of reading and the magic of the museum.\n  We have new, visionary leaders at the NEA and NEH. Bill Ivey and Bill \nFerris are Chairmen who have their ears to the ground and they are \nprepared to respond to the cultural needs of the people of this nation, \nregardless of where they live. They have made it their business to \ninvolve the grassroots. They fundamentally understand where congress is \ncoming from both in terms of its support for the agencies and with \nregard to the criticisms of ``elitism'' and favoritism.\n  To address concerns, they have focused on grassroots initiatives \nlike: ``Challenge America,''--an effort to target grant dollars to \ncommunities that lack a significant arts presence and invest in arts \neducation, preservation of cultural heritage and after school \nprogramming for young people-at-risk;\n  ``Our History is America's History''--a program that will encourage \nall Americans to explore our family's history and stories, enter these \nstories to the Internet and connect these personal histories to the \nbroad sweep of American and world history; and\n  ``ED-sitement''--a partnership involving the NEH, MCI corporations \nand others designed to help humanities teachers use the Internet \neffectively in their teaching.\n  Each of these programs better connect the local community with its \nrich and vibrant local history and cultural offerings. They draw upon \nthe rich cultural heritage and traditions of a region and share those \ntreasures and stories widely with our nation's community. I am anxious \nto support their efforts. It is due to their leadership and the \nleadership of my own Vermont Arts Council, Vermont Humanities Council \nand all of Vermont's museums and cultural institutions that I stand \nwith confidence behind these agencies and call for a modest increase in \ntheir budgets.\n  The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for \nthe Humanities are agencies with small budgets that provide \nextraordinary service to the people of this nation. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support each of these agencies.\n  In closing, I would like to applaud the leadership of my colleague \nfrom Mississippi, Senator Cochran for his unwavering support for the \nNEH. In addition, I would like to publicly state my support for the \nInstitute for Museum Services and hope that during conference \nnegotiations with the House, we will adopt the highest appropriation \npossible for that important agency.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd for \ntheir leadership on this issue and thank my colleagues for supporting \nthis modest increase for NEA and NEH.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 1572, as modified\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding to carry out the Urban Park and Recreation \n                 Recovery Act of 1978, with an offset)\n\n       On page 16, line 25, strike ``$49,951,000'' and insert \n     $51,451,000, of which not less than $1,500,000 shall be \n     available to carry out the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery \n     Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.)''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                    amendment no. 1573, as modified\n\n (Purpose: To provide funding for the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania \n                National Military Park, with an offset)\n\n       On page 18, line 16, strike ``$84,525,000'' and insert \n     ``$87,725,000''.\n       On page 18, line 19, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``, and of which not less than $3,000,000 shall be \n     available for the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National \n     Military Park''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                    amendment no. 1575, as modified\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funding for tribally controlled colleges and \n                             universities)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n       Sec. 1 .

Mr. President, the amendment I am offering would compensate \na company that built a school building for the Lac Courte Oreilles \nTribe in my state of Wisconsin. It would also clarify ownership of the \nbuilding. The educational program of the school, as well as the \noperation and maintenance funding are provided to the Tribe through a \ngrant from the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  When a number of classrooms were condemned, the BIA provided a grant \nto the school to lease temporary space while the classrooms were \nreplaced. Rather than lease space, the Tribe entered into a lease/\npurchase agreement with a contractor for construction of an 8,400 \nsquare foot building. When the\n\n[[Page S10836]]\n\nBureau learned that the Tribe had not used the initial grant payment to \nlease space, they declined to provide additional money to the tribe for \nthis project since the BIA was, at the same time, providing about $2 \nmillion for the tribe to replace the condemned classrooms. All of this \nand more is detailed in an audit report issued by Interior's Inspector \nGeneral last March.\n  It is my understanding that this amendment will have no impact on \nconstruction projects which are to begin in fiscal year 2000. To that \nend, I would urge the chairman to call on BIA to identify before \nconference any potential negative impact associated with this \namendment.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 1592, as modified\n\n (Purpose: To provide funds for the Forest Service to acquire lands at \n                            Lake Logan, NC)\n\n       On page 65, line 18, strike ``$37,170,000'' and insert \n     ``$38,170,000''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1597\n\n    (Purpose: To provide an additional $4,000,000 for the National \n                     Endowment for the Humanities)\n\n       On page 95, line 5, strike ``$97,550,000'' and insert \n     ``$101,000,000''.\n       On page 95, line 13, strike ``$14,150,000'' and insert \n     ``$14,700,000''.\n       On page 95, line 14, strike ``$10,150,000'' and insert \n     ``$10,700,000''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                    amendment no. 1606, as modified\n\n (Purpose: To provide funding for the acquisition of new properties in \n      Kenweenaw National Historic Park, Michigan, with an offset)\n\n       On page 18, line 19, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``, and of which not less than $1,700,000 shall be \n     available for the acquisition of properties in Keweenaw \n     National Historical Park, Michigan''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                    amendment no. 1612, as modified\n\n   (Purpose: To make funds available for planning and development of \ninterpretive sites for the quadricentennial commemoration of the Saint \n       Croix Island International Historic site, with an offset)\n\n       On page 17, line 22, insert the following before the colon: \n     ``and of which $90,000 shall be available for planning and \n     development of interpretive sites for the quadricentennial \n     commemoration of the Saint Croix Island International \n     Historic Site, Maine including possible interpretive sites in \n     Calais, Maine''.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of two amendments I \nhave filed in connection with the Interior appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2000.\n  My amendments, which are cosponsored by Senator Snowe, are expected \nto be accepted as part of the managers' package, which the chairman of \nthe subcommittee will be sending to the desk shortly.\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank the subcommittee chairman, \nSenator Gorton, and the ranking minority member, Senator Byrd, for \ntheir assistance and support of my proposals.\n  The amendments I am proposing will provide funding and National Park \nService support for projects of great historical and international \nsignificant to my State and our country. Yet probably only a few of our \ncolleagues have ever heard of St. Croix Island, nestled in the St. \nCroix River that separates Maine from Canada, or this island's place in \nthe history of the United States and Canada and in the hearts of North \nAmericans of French descent.\n  We have all probably heard of the Pilgrims' landing at Plymouth Rock \nin 1620, or the English colonial settlement at Jamestown in 1607, but \nfew know the story of an even older settlement, dating back to 1604, \nwhen French nobleman Pierre Dugua Sieur de Mons, accompanied by a \ncourageous group of adventurers that included Samuel Champlain, landed \non St. Croix Island and quickly set about to construct a settlement. \nThey cleared the island, planted crops, dug a well, and built houses, \nfortifications, public buildings, and gun emplacements. In the process, \nthey were aided by Native peoples who made temporary camps on the \nisland and assisted in various ways. At the same time, Samuel Champlain \nundertook a number of reconnaissance missions from the island. On one, \nhe found and named Mount Desert Island, now the home to Acadia National \nPark.\n  By October, the settlement was ready. But the Maine winter was more \nthan the seventy-nine settlers had bargained for. By winter's end, \nnearly half had died and many others were seriously ill.\n  The spring brought relief from the harsh weather. Sieur de Mons \nrelocated his colony to Port Royal in what is now Nova Scotia and, in \n1608, Champlain and a company of men founded Quebec.\n  According to the National Park Service, the French settlement on St. \nCroix Island in 1604 and 1605 was the first and ``most ambitious \nattempt of its time to establish an enduring French presence in the \n`New World.' '' Many view the expedition that settled on St. Croix \nIsland in 1604 as the beginning of the Acadian culture in North \nAmerica. This rich and diverse culture spread across the continent, \nfrom Canada to Louisiana, where French-speaking Acadians came to be \nknown as ``Cajuns.''\n  The rich history and cultural significance of the 1604 settlement at \nSt. Croix Island are beyond question. Yet, with only four years \nremaining before the 400th anniversary of the settlement, there is \nstill much to prepare for a proper and appropriate commemoration of \nthis historical event.\n  Let me try to put the occasion in perspective. For the 300th \nanniversary of the settlement, U.S., British, and French naval ships, \nflagged out for the occasion, steamed up the St. Croix River and \nanchored off the historic island. Speakers at the ceremony honoring the \nanniversary included the consul general of France and the famous U.S. \ngeneral and Maine patriot, Joshua Chamberlain.\n  Several thousand people attended the celebration.\n  In 1996, the U.S. National Park Service and Parks Canada agreed to \n``conduct joint strategic planning for the international commemoration \n[of the St. Croix Island], with a special focus on the 400th \nanniversary of settlement in 2004.'' For its part, Parks Canada \nconstructed an exhibit in New Brunswick overlooking St. Croix Island. \nThe exhibit uses Champlain's first-hand accounts, period images, \nupdated research, and custom artwork to tell the compelling story of \nthe settlement.\n  The National Park Service, on the other hand, has plans to expand a \nsmall, existing site located just south of Calais, Maine. The Park \nService plan envisions a modest, but appropriate outdoor exhibit \noverlooking St. Croix Island and exhibits in an indoor visitor center, \npreferably located in nearby Calais. These plans are intended to \ncommemorate in an appropriate way one of only two international \nhistoric sites in the U.S. national park system and, as far as they go, \nthe plans are a welcome first step. The next steps have yet to be taken \nand time is growing short. That is why I offered two amendments to this \nappropriations bill.\n  The first amendment makes $90,000 available in FY 2000 to finish pre-\nconstruction planning for and begin development of the outdoor site at \nRed Beach and to plan for the possible location of interpretive \nexhibits in Calais, Maine. Currently, no money is scheduled to be \nappropriated for the Red Beach site until FY 2002, and National Park \nService officials in Maine and in the Northeast Regional Office agree \nwith me that the funding schedule provides for too little too late. \nThis money is needed now in order to ensure that the project is \ncompleted in time for the 400th anniversary celebration.\n  My second amendment asks the National Park Service to work with the \npeople of Calais to make an indoor visitors center--known as the \n``Downeast Heritage Center--a reality. The people of Calais and \nsurrounding areas have worked tirelessly to move the project towards \ncompletion. They need the assistance of the National Park Service--\nwhich already has endorsed the concept--but which now must help with \nplanning and financial assistance to bring the project from a dream to \nreality. My amendment asks and directs the Park Service to work with \nthe people of Calais on this project and to ensure that appropriate \nexhibits are completed in time for the 400th anniversary celebration.\n  I further request that the Park Service include in its fiscal year \n2001 budget submission funds for both the Red Beach site and the \nDowneast Heritage Center in downtown Calais.\n  My amendments seeks only a small commitment of funds that are \ndesigned to commemorate a 1604 settlement of enormous historical \nsignificance.\n  I again want to thank Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd for their \nassistance in helping our country prepare for a terrific 400th \nanniversary celebration of the early French settlement at St. Croix \nIsland.\n\n[[Page S10837]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 1615, as modified\n\n       On page 76, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n       ``The Forest Service is authorized through the Forest \n     Service existing budget to reimburse Harry Fray for the cost \n     of his home, $143,406 (1997 dollars) destroyed by arson on \n     June 21, 1990 in retaliation for his work with the Forest \n     Service.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1637\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funds to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n Resource Management account for grants under the Great Lakes Fish and \n     Wildlife Restoration Program and for spartina grass research)\n\n       On page 10, line 15, strike ``$683,519,000'' and insert \n     ``$684,019,000''.\n       On page 10, line 16, after ``herein,'' insert the \n     following: ``of which $400,000 shall be available for grants \n     under the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Program, \n     and of which $300,000 shall be available for spartina grass \n     research being conducted by the University of Washington, \n     and''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1638\n\n(Purpose: To increase funding for weatherization assistance grants and \n           state energy conservation grants, with an offset)\n\n       On page 78, line 16, strike ``$682,817,000'' and insert \n     ``$684,817,000''.\n       On page 78, line 19, strike ``$166,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$168,000,000''.\n       On page 78, line 24, strike ``$133,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$135,000,000''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1639\n\n      (Purpose: To set aside funding for development of a habitat \n   conservation plan for cold water fish in the States of Idaho and \n                                Montana)\n\n       On page 10, line 16, after ``herein,'' insert ``of which \n     $500,000 of the amount available for consultation shall be \n     available for development of a voluntary-enrollment habitat \n     conservation plan for cold water fish in cooperation with the \n     States of Idaho and Montana (of which $250,000 shall be made \n     available to each of the States of Idaho and Montana), and''.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment proposed \nby Senator Crapo, along with myself, Senator Burns, and Senator Craig, \nto provide funding for the development of a habitat conservation plan \nfor the recovery of the bull trout and other cold water fish in Montana \nand Idaho.\n  By way of background, the bull trout favors cold, high-mountain \nstreams with lots of cover. Some are resident, remaining in the same \ntributary all year round. Most, however, are migratory, heading \nupstream spawn in the spring, when the water starts to get warm.\n  Historically, bull trout were found throughout the Northwest, from \nCalifornia to the Yukon Territory. Today, they are found primarily in \nIdaho and Montana. The Montana population is located in the Clark Fork \nRiver and in Lake Kookanusa, above the Libby Dam.\n  There are many reasons for the decline in the bull trout population, \nincluding timber harvesting, road building, farming and grazing, and \ndam construction. Ironically, efforts to help recover various salmon \nspecies in the lower part of the Columbia River system may actually \nhave harmed the bull trout in the upper part of the system, by reducing \nwater levels in the upper reservoirs.\n  In any event, in 1998, the Fish and Wildlife Service listed the bull \ntrout as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.\n  For years, the State of Montana has been working hard to recover the \nbull trout. This work has intensified since the listing. For example, \nlast year, Montana spent $568,000 on recovery efforts: things like \nimproving stream channels, stabilizing stream banks, fencing, \nmonitoring, educating anglers, and preventing poaching. But, to get the \njob done, we need to do more. And we need more help from the Fish and \nWildlife Service.\n  The amendment that we are offering today takes an important \nadditional step. It sets aside $500,000, from the Fish and Wildlife \nService budget, to help the states of Montana and Idaho develop a \nvoluntary habitat conservation plan for the bull trout and other cold \nwater fish, including the westslope cutthroat trout, for which a \nlisting petition has been filed.\n  The idea of the HCP is to provide guidance, to small landowners, \nparticularly owners of woodlots, farms, and ranches. For example, the \nHCP might set standards re-channelizing streams. Or for timber \nharvesting and road building to prevent sedimentation. Compliance will \nbe completely voluntary, but landowners who follow the guidance will \nknow that they are in full compliance with the Endangered Species Act.\n  This can encourage the kind of voluntary, cooperative efforts that \ncan go a long way towards recovering the bull trout. Let me give you an \nexample. A few years ago, I spent the day at the Foote Ranch, along the \nBlackfoot River, in Ovando, in Northwest Montana. Geoff Foote and \nothers were restoring Bull Trout habitat. Years ago, a stream had been \nstraightened. This had the indirect effect of reducing the amount of \nmud that gathered along the sides of the stream, where bull trout \nspawn. So Geoff and others were re-channelizing the stream.\n  We cut logs, hauled them by horse, and placed the logs and large \nrocks so that the stream would meander and, by doing so, provide better \nbull spawning habitat.\n  It was a cooperative effort, involving folks from the Fish and \nWildlife Service, the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks, \nlocal farmers and ranchers, and members of local environmental \norganizations. Our amendment will encourage further efforts, along \nthese same lines.\n  The amendment does not modify the substantive provisions of the \nEndangered Species Act in any way. Nor does it implicate any of the \ncontroversies surrounding the standards for HCPs.\n  But it does provide funding to help Montana and Idaho continue their \nwork to recover the bull trout. That's important, in it's own right.\n  Moreover, it will help our State highway programs. The listing of the \nbull trout has caused concern about the potential effect on highway \nconstruction. By providing clear guidance, the HCP should go a long way \nto ensuring that the bull trout and our highway programs both can \nthrive.\n  I commend the sponsor of the amendment, Senator Crapo, the Chairman \nof the Fisheries, Wildlife, and Drinking Water Subcommittee of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, for his leadership on this \nissue. I also commend the other members of the delegation, Senators \nBurns and Craig.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment with \nSenator Lautenberg and 25 other Senators to provide $20 million for the \nstateside Land and Water Conservation Fund or LWCF matching grant \nprogram.\n  Too often we forget that--in addition to a National Park System--we \nhave national system of parks which includes tens of thousands of State \nand local parks. More than 37,000 of these State and local parks and \nrecreation facilities have received a stateside LWCF matching grant, \nbut there is a problem. The stateside LWCF program has been shut down \nbecause Congress hasn't funded it. Yet O.C.S. revenues currently are at \n$4 billion.\n  Over 30 years ago, in a bipartisan effort, Congress created the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund. The LWCF is funded with Federal revenues \nfrom off-shore oil and gas leasing which now exceed $4 billion a year. \nLWCF money can be used for two purposes:\n  (1) Acquisition of land by the four Federal land management agencies; \nand (2) matching grants to State and local governments for recreation \nfacilities, parks, playgrounds, and campgrounds. The LWCF Act envisions \na balance: between the Federal and State and local parks; between the \nneeds of rural and urban populations; and between easterners and \nwesterners.\n  Mr. President, I now want to refer to a ``LWCF Authorization/\nAppropriation'' chart. As this chart shows, the balance has been lost. \nFY1995 was the last year the LWCF stateside matching grant program was \nfunded. In that year, over $600 million was requested and only $25 \nmillion was appropriated. Despite the past successes and growing \ndemand, Washington pulled the rug out from under the stateside program. \nFour years ago, Congress and the administration zeroed out the \nstateside program. That was a serious mistake. Washington was being \npenny-wise and pound foolish. The promise to Americans set forth in the \nLWCF Act was broken.\n  When the offshore oil leasing program began, a portion of the \nreceipts were pledged to recreation and conservation of America's great \noutdoors. I see no reason not to meet that pledge. I see many reasons \nto keep it. As the chart shows, 2 years ago was a record year for \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund when over $900 million was \nappropriated. Out of the total, the Senate appropriated $100 million \nfor the stateside matching grant program.\n\n  Unfortunately, the good work of the Senate went for naught. This \nmoney was lost in conference. None of this money went to the stateside \ngrant program. Every appropriated dollar went to Federal land \nacquisition and maintenance of Federal land.\n  This year the mistake of closing down this program is being \nrecognized. The administration requested $150 million for a State land \nconservation grants program and $50 million for open space planning \ngrants to States and local governments as part of their Lands Legacy \nproposal. As Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, I had to oppose the administration's proposal because these \nprograms are not authorized by the LWCF Act.\n  The President's Land Legacy proposal sought to fundamentally \nrestructure the stateside matching grant program authorized by the LWCF \nAct. The LWCF stateside program is a formula grant program which \nprovides monies to State and local communities for the planning, \nacquisition, and development of parks and recreation facilities. The \nPresident proposed to replace this program with a competitive grant \nprogram to the States for the purchase of land and open space planning. \nThis proposal would have changed the focus of the stateside program and \nundercut the federalism inherent in the existing program.\n  Nonetheless, I was encouraged that the President, after 4 years, \nrecognized the importance of sharing LWCF moneys with State and local \ngovernments. More progress in restoring stateside was made last month \nwhen the House appropriated $30 million for the program.\n  With this amendment, the Senate is doing its part. With tough budget \ntargets, it was not easy to find $20 million in such a lean bill; \nhowever, we were able to find offsets from a variety of programs. These \nare difficult choices, but well worth it.\n  I wish we could have provided more money for this important program. \nHowever, it is a start. I will do all I can do to ensure that in \nconference the Senate recede to the House and provide $30 million for \nthe stateside matching grant program. I also will continue to seek \npermanent funding for this program so that we do not have to fight this \nannual appropriations battle.\n  Our system of government works best when all levels of government \nwork together with the private sector to pursue shared goals. Few goals \nare as worthy as recreation for families and communities. Recreation is \nnot a child's play. It is more than a hobby. It is a necessary \ncomponent of our lives. It boosts the economy. It helps build stronger \nfamilies and communities. And it encourages conservation efforts and \nhelps preserve open space.\n  So why deny communities matching funds for recreation from proceeds \nof our offshore leasing program? I support offshore leasing and the use \nof some proceeds for stateside LWCF matching grants to State and local \ngovernments.\n  This amendment gives us a good reason to focus on the value of \nrecreation to our lives and how we can do a better job encouraging \npeople of all ages to enjoy America's natural splendor. Trips to \nnational parks are remembered for a lifetime, but most day-to-day \nrecreation takes place close to home and demand for local recreation \nresources is high and increasing. We must restore the LWCF stateside \nprogram; it is a good investment. This amendment is a start.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \namendment to the Interior Appropriations bill that I am offering with \nmy colleague from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski.\n  I would like to thank our broad range of bipartisan cosponsors: \nSenators Boxer, Chafee, Dodd, Roth, Sessions, Feingold, Kerry of \nMassachusetts, Leahy, Landrieu, Lincoln, Frist, Graham, Collins, Smith \nof New Hampshire, Gregg, Moynihan, Warner, Bayh, McCain, Akaka, \nFeinstein, Jeffords, and Hagel.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would restore funds to a program that \nhas helped protect open space in every State in the Nation through the \nState grants section of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This \namendment restores $20 million in fiscal year 2000 for these matching \ngrants to States.\n  This ``Stateside'' program can be used to fund a variety of public \nopen space efforts, including State and county parks, State forests, \nboating and swimming areas, and a variety of other recreational sites.\n  Mr. President, the House of Representatives saw fit to include the \nprogram at $30 million in its Interior Appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S10839]]\n\n  We hope to come to their level in conference after our initial \nfunding at $20 million.\n  Over the past 30 years, through the stateside program, over $3 \nbillion has been provided to the States, and through them, to local \ngovernments, on a matching basis, to preserve approximately 37,000 park \nand recreation areas.\n  Mr. President, the decision to fund open space programs through the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund is one of the wisest investments we \ncan make. Open spaces are more than just undeveloped land. We all know \nthat protecting open spaces can guard sensitive drinking water supplies \nand preserve wildlife habitat.\n  Open spaces are also a lasting legacy we pass on to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  But there is another equally important benefit of open spaces.\n  In my State of New Jersey--the most densely populated State in the \nNation--open spaces provide working families of limited means a place \nto enjoy the outdoors at little or no cost. A day at the beach or a \npicnic in the park or a hike in the woods is a day well spent.\n  Mr. President, open space is extremely valuable in my State. In a \npoll last year by Quinnipiac College published in the Newark Star-\nLedger, 70 percent of New Jersey residents said that preserving open \nspace and farmland is more important than commercial growth and \ndevelopment in rural areas.\n  Mr. President, it is extremely gratifying when members of both \nparties can join together in support of a program that has provided \nuntold benefits for millions of Americans. I want to thank Senator \nMurkowski and my other colleagues who support this amendment. I ask all \nof my colleagues to join us to preserve open space for America's \nfamilies.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to cosponsor the \nbipartisan amendment, offered by my colleague from Alaska, regarding \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund. The amendment provides $20 \nmillion for matching grants to States under the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, which, for almost 30 years, had enabled small \ncommunities throughout the Nation to establish local parks, build \nsports fields, acquire green ways and trails, and support community \ngardens.\n  The stateside program under the LWCF is a worthwhile conservation \nprogram that for too long has been without any funding at all. It has \nreceived nothing since 1995, and States have been strapped to find \nmoney for their own conservation efforts without any Federal \nassistance. As pressures for development and sprawl increase in many \nparts of the Nation, it is more important than ever to help States \nprotect the open and green spaces that are crucial for a healthy \ncommunity.\n  And with the recent ballot initiatives to promote conservation that \nhave been approved by voters across the Nation, States now have money \navailable to match Federal dollars through the stateside program. It is \nnow up to Congress to make the Federal money available. For those who \ncriticize the program as a form of pork, let me stress that States must \nput up 50 percent of the money for their projects. This is not a hand-\nout. This is a fiscally sound program that makes land and water \nconservation for thousands of small communities around the country a \nnational priority.\n  The stateside program has been supported by mayors, county officials, \ngovernors, civic associations, outdoor recreation groups, land \nconservancy groups, conservation groups--the list goes on and on.\n  I add myself to that list as a strong proponent of the LWCF, \nincluding the stateside program. The Federal Government, in my opinion, \nplays a vital role in assisting State and local governments establish \nlocal parks and protect open and green space. Indeed, when I was \nGovernor of Rhode Island, I started the Green Acres Program in 1964 for \nthis purpose, and the Federal Government matched some of the money to \nhelp get the program going.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Leahy and I circulated a letter to our \nfellow Senators, asking them to support full funding for the LWCF. \nThirty-six of our colleagues in the Senate endorsed that letter and \nsigned it. What a tremendous showing of bipartisan support!\n  I am very pleased that the managers of the bill have agreed to this \namendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from \nAlaska, Mr. Murkowski, and the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, \nin offering this important bipartisan amendment to provide much needed \nfunding for the stateside program of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund.\n  Additional co-sponsors include Senators Chafee, Roth, Dodd, Landrieu, \nSessions, Feingold, Lincoln, Leahy, Frist, Kerry, Graham, Collins, \nSmith of New Hampshire, Gregg, Moynihan, Warner, Bayh, McCain, Akaka, \nFeinstein, Jeffords, and Hagel.\n  The stateside program has, once again (since fiscal year 1995) been \nzeroed-out. Our amendment provides $20 million for this popular \nprogram.\n  As the 21st century approaches, we must renew our commitment to our \nnatural heritage. That commitment must go beyond a piecemeal approach. \nIt must be a comprehensive, long-term strategy to ensure that when our \nchildren's children enter the 22d century, they can herald our actions \ntoday, as we revere those of President Roosevelt.\n  And preservation in the 21st century goes beyond protection of such \nwonders as Yosemite and Yellowstone. It must include an urban park in \nEast Los Angeles where children can play basketball, a farm in Tulare \nCounty that can continue to grow oranges or a historic building in \nOrange County that can be restored.\n  Today, our natural heritage is disappearing at an alarming rate. Each \nyear, nearly 3 million acres of farmland and more than 170,000 acres of \nwetlands disappear. Each day, over 7,000 acres of open space are lost \nforever.\n  Across America, parks are closing, recreational facilities \ndeteriorating, open spaces vanishing, historic structures crumbling.\n  Why is this happening? Because there is no dedicated funding source \nfor all these noble purposes--a source which can be used only for these \nnoble purposes.\n  I have offered a comprehensive bill--Resources 2000--that provides \nthe most sweeping commitment to protecting America's natural heritage \nin more than 30 years. It will establish a dedicated funding source for \nresource protection.\n  But until such legislation is enacted, we must do what we can to fund \nthese important programs now. This amendment does just that.\n  This amendment will provide $20 million for the stateside portion of \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  This is an important amendment for the future of our local \ncommunities, our quality of life, the recreational opportunities of our \nfamilies and the preservation of our important lands.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund is a fund that was developed out \nof a bargain between the development of the offshore oil and the \npreservation of nonrenewable assets in our communities and throughout \nour Nation.\n  Since 1965, we have appropriated some $3 billion to local \ngovernments, States and local governments, to help them protect and \nconserve these assets. States and local governments have matched that \nwith an additional $3 billion. That match tells us the kind of priority \nthat our local communities place upon this program.\n\n  Unfortunately, in 1995 it all stopped and Congress failed to \nappropriate money for the program. One of the most successful programs \nthat we have at the Federal level stopped. Since that time, if had \nprovided the money that this program was truly entitled to, there would \nhave been an additional $2.5 billion that would have then been matched \nby another $2.5 billion in non-federal dollars. That would be $5 \nbillion going toward improving quality of life and protecting and \nconserving natural resources based upon the priorities of those local \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, every state across the Nation benefits from this \nprogram. I have here a book put together by the National Recreation and \nPark Association listing hundreds of projects in every state that are \nin dire need of this funding.\n  In my State of California, we have used stateside funding to team up \nwith local sponsors to purchase areas of\n\n[[Page S10840]]\n\nRedwoods State Park, the Santa Monica Mountains, Lake Tahoe and San \nDeguito Park. But there is still more that needs to be done.\n  One project that I requested funding for this year is the Urban \nNature Center and Sanctuary in Ernest Debs Park in Los Angeles. This \nPark would provide nature experiences for some of the city's most \nunderserved children and their families.\n  The National Audubon Society in cooperation with the City of Los \nAngeles, is developing a model Urban Nature Center in Ernest Debs \nRegional Park in Northeast Los Angeles. This surprisingly natural, 195-\nacre site, run by the City's Recreation and Parks Department, is five \nmiles northeast of downtown Los Angeles. It rises above some of the \ncity's densest urban neighborhoods, yet is home to more than 80 species \nof birds and other wildlife. Within two miles of the park, there are \nmore than 30,000 children, mostly Latino, attending school for whom the \npark and the nature center could be a giant outdoor classroom.\n  The Nature Center is an exciting opportunity to bring together \nAudubon's traditional sources of support for conservation education \nwith city, state and federal funds for parks, trails and habitat \nrestoration. For its part in this innovative public/private \npartnership, the City of Los Angeles will dedicate $1 million in \nexisting County bond funds for habitat enhancement. The Audubon Society \nis dedicated to raising $4 million in private contributions. I \nrequested $1 million for the federal contribution for this project, but \nnothing was provided.\n  Mr. President, this is the kind-of thing we are always pushing for--\nfederal/non-federal, public/private collaboration on important \nprojects. And while others are contributing their share, the federal \ngovernment is doing nothing. This must change.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is a small step toward fulfilling our \ncommitment to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1644\n\n (Purpose: To provide for increased funding of certain programs of the \n Smithsonian Institution and the Indian Health Service, with an offset \n                       for National Park Service)\n\n       S. 1292 is amended by the following:\n       On page 17, line 19, strike ``$221,093,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$216,153,000''.\n       On page 82, line 13, strike ``$2,135,561,000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``$2,138,001,000''.\n       On page 90, line 3, strike ``$364,562,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$367,062,000.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1645\n\n       On page 78, line 17, insert after the comma ``of which $1.6 \n     million shall be for grants to municipal governments for \n     cost-shared research projects in buildings, municipal \n     processes, transportation and sustainable urban energy \n     systems, and''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1646\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funding for Wheeling National Heritage Area)\n\n       On page 17, line 22, strike ``$4,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$5,000,000''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1647\n\n (Purpose: Provide funding for an environmental impact statement to be \nprepared by the Forest Service, as mandated by the 9th Circuit Court of \n                                Appeals)\n\n       On page 63, line 6, strike the period and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following: ``: Provided, That of the amount \n     provided under this heading, $750,000 shall be used for a \n     supplemental environmental impact statement for the Forest \n     Service/Weyerhaeuser Huckleberry land exchange, which shall \n     be completed by September 30, 2000.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1648\n\n   (Purpose: To strike section 129 in its entirety and replace with \n language that directs a review of possible alternatives to the Weber \nDam on the Walker River Paiute Reservation in Nevada without requiring \n   completion of an Environmental Impact Statement.

Mr. President, last year I worked closely with my \ncolleagues Senator Byrd and Senator Gorton to place language in the \nreport accompanying the Fiscal Year 1999 Department of Interior \nappropriations bill directing the Secretary to report to Congress on \nthe need for a uniform federal policy guiding the collection of fossils \nfrom public lands. This was an important step that was long overdue.\n  Public lands such as those administered by the Forest Service, Bureau \nof Land Management and other agencies are some of our nation's finest \nrepositories of fossils. By studying fossils, paleontologists learn \ninformation that is vital to understanding the Earth and the history of \nlife on this planet. Unfortunately, the variety of policies used by \nfederal agencies to guide the collection of fossils from these lands \nare confusing to the public, do not ensure that scientists have a full \nopportunity to study valuable specimens, and do not ensure that fossils \nare adequately preserved for the future. I believe it is time that we \ndeveloped such a policy and implemented measures to maximize access to \nand preservation of important fossil specimens.\n  I am very pleased that the Department has undertaken a serious review \nof this issue and is consulting with all stakeholders to ensure that it \nprovides Congress with the best information and recommendations \npossible. It is my hope that this report will be completed \nexpeditiously so that we can work with the administration on any \nfollow-up measures that may be required.\n  In the meantime, it is my hope that the administration will move \nforward with one important way that it can immediately make fossils \nmore readily available to the public. New information technology has \ngiven us the ability to send vast amounts of data anywhere in the world \nalmost instantaneously. I believe the administration should begin \nimmediately to explore ways to utilize this capability to make data \nabout critical fossils available to scientists worldwide. For example, \nthe South Dakota School of Mines and Technology has the capability to \nuse CT scans to create high-resolution, three-dimensional images of a \nfossil and its internal structure that can be accessed by scientists \nover the next generation Internet. I strongly urge the administration \nto fund initiatives of this type in its fiscal year 2001 budget, and to \nmove forward as quickly as possible with steps that can improve public \naccess to these fossils.\n  Mr. GORTON. I agree with the Senator from South Dakota that it is \nimportant that the Secretary complete this study expeditiously and \nexplore ways to use information technology to maximize the ability of \npaleontologists to study scientifically significant fossils.\n  Mr. BYRD. I also agree with the Minority Leader. The Department of \nthe Interior should provide the results of its analysis to Congress \nquickly and support funding for initiatives that will use new \ntechnology to make important scientific data available.\n\n\n        pilot program for tribal priority allocation in the bia\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Tribal Priority Allocation (TPA) \nProgram of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has been an issue of \ncontroversy for several years. For next year, the Senate Interior \nappropriations bill provides $693 million for TPA. This money is used \nby local tribal governments to operate a wide range of programs like \npublic safety, resources management, education, economic development, \nand human services.\n  Many tribes are not able to relate TPA funds to their own tribal \nneeds with any specificity. As a result, the BIA simply does not know, \nand is not able to relate TPA spending to actual tribal needs. We are \nnot saying that tribes misuse these funds. We are saying that there is \nprecious little information about how TPA funds are directed toward \ntribal needs as determined by the tribes themselves.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I concur with this observation about the \npoor BIA oversight and management of locally operated TPA programs. The \nBIA has not been able to tell the Senate just how these funds are spend \nby tribal governments. Other than broad categories, the tribes \nthemselves do not have to report how these funds are meeting trial \nneeds and goals. There are so many eligible uses for these funds that \ntribes do not report TPA spending to the BIA with any specificity. In \npublic safety, for example, TPA funds can be spend for police cars. \nNatural resource funds can be spent on growing blue corn or improving a \nfish hatchery.\n  The BIA has little information about how tribal goals are being met \nwith TPA funds, and TPA funds make up almost half of the entire BIA \noperations budget for Indian programs. Any effort to help us clarify \nthe precise use of TPA funds will be a major step forward in \naccountability for both tribes and the BIA. I welcome a pilot effort to \nmove toward that goal.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Chairman Gorton and I have both \ndiscussed the TPA accountability issue with Kevin Gover, the Assistant \nSecretary for Indian Affairs at the BIA. Mr. Gover has recommended a \npilot project at Eight Northern Pueblos Agency in New Mexico. The \npurpose of this pilot program would be to demonstrate the ability of \ntribes to assess their own needs and then develop TPA budgets that \nallow the BIA to track just how TPA funds are being used to achieve \nspecific results for tribes.\n  Mr. GORTON. I was glad to see this pilot program recommended in the \nTPA report I have recently received from the BIA. We required this \nreport in last year's appropriations bill. I have also noted that Nambe \nPueblo has gone through a long process of local meetings to catalog \ntheir needs and organize their plans for using TPA funds. They have \npersevered in developing a model needs based budget process.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, Mr. Chairman, Nambe Pueblo leaders have broken new \nground in developing budgets to meet their own needs. Nambe Pueblo is a \nsmall pueblo with 633 members. It is located about 20 miles north of \nSanta Fe. Their Governor, David Perez, and Councilman Tony Vigil and \nmany others at Nambe have spent hours, days, and nights developing a \nvery thorough description of their precise needs. They have worked \nclosely with Eight Northern Indian Pueblos (ENIP) Executive Director \nBernie Teba and ENIP Chairman Walter Dasheno, who is also Governor of \nSanta Clara Pueblo, to document their needs in several key categories.\n  In the area of Land Resources, for example, Nambe Pueblo has \nidentified a solid waste disposal system, flood and erosion control \nneeds, and an agricultural land recovery plan. For community services, \nthey have identified youth services and senior citizen services. Their \nfacility needs have been catalogued, and their economic and tourism \nplans have been laid out.\n  Mr. GORTON. This sounds like a very thorough effort. I would like to \njoin Senator Domenici in commending the Nambe Pueblo for their hard \nwork in developing a needs data base system that will enable them to \ntrack the use of TPA funds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. When Assistant Secretary Gover first presented this \nidea to me a few months ago, he told me that ENIP had developed a solid \napproach for accountability that should be tried as a pilot for other \ntribes to emulate. Some of the other members of ENIP are anxious to try \nthis approach to becoming more accountable to their tribal members, the \nBIA, and the Congress. It is a lot of work, but there is also a lot of \nbenefit to be able to map out a complete picture of tribal needs and \nresources.\n  With Assistant Secretary Gover's continuing enthusiasm and support, I\n\n[[Page S10842]]\n\nam confident that a new beginning for accountability in TPA funding \nwill actually be born at Nambe Pueblo. We will count on him to \nimplement this ENIP pilot from existing TPA funds. We believe we have \ngiven him enough authority in this bill and other legislation to \nimplement this accountability pilot program, and we look forward to its \nearly success.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, like Senator Domenici, I look forward to a \nbetter future in accountability for TPA funds. This program is critical \nfor tribes and they should also be able to measure their own progress \nagainst local needs as suggested by the Nambe Pueblo plan. I support \nthis recommendation for a TPA accountability pilot program from \nexisting TPA funds and I look forward to some positive results.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chairman of the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee for his extraordinary efforts to bring fairness and \naccountability to the BIA's TPA Program. It is the single largest \nexpenditure in the BIA, followed by school operations. I believe tribes \nwill benefit from the fruits of this pilot, and the Congress will be \nbetter able to justify TPA expenditures. We will have better knowledge \nof just how TPA funds help tribes to meet their own local needs and \ngoals.\n\n\n                        alternate fuels research\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I understand that my colleague from \nAlaska wants to comment with me on Department of Energy funding for \nalternate fuels research.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Committee on \nAppropriations knows, the Environmental Protection Agency and the \ncountry have been constantly seeking cleaner-burning diesel fuel. In \nfact, the administration has already announced new, stricter emissions \nstandards for heavy vehicles as an incentive to move to other \ntechnologies. Would the Senator agree that the answer to this issue \nlies partly in the engine design, but more importantly in the type of \nfuel we burn?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, I agree with the Chairman of the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources. The Department of Energy has been \ninvestigating alternate fuels that would improve air emissions but not \nrequire a new infrastructure or delivery system such as would be \nrequired in the use of compressed natural gas. One possibility is Gas-\nto-Liquids or GTL. The GTL process takes natural gas and converts it to \na liquid fuel that has the characteristics of diesel fuel, only without \nsulfur, which interferes with the catalysts that clean up emissions.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Natural gas is nearly everywhere in the United States \nand does not need to be imported. We have somewhere between 30 to 60 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas in Alaska, which could replace a \nsignificant amount of the diesel fuel market, if the GTL process can be \nproved to be viable.\n  I have been interested in securing funding a private-public \npartnership to study GTL's performance as fuel. The study will report \non the following: (1) How important fuel characteristics affect the \nperformance and emissions of different diesel engines; (2) Experimental \nperformance of diesel engines burning fuels like GTL fuels; (3) Engine \ndesign modifications which enhance performance using such fuels; and \n(4) Chemistry of GTL production. I would ask if the subcommittee \nchairman is aware of the premise that GTL technology has in producing a \ncleaner burning fuel?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am aware. ARCO, which is well known in Alaska, recently \nconstructed and started a 70 barrel per day Gas-to-Liquids plant in \nBlaine, Washington, near Bellingham. ARCO did this with its own money \nand that of Syntroleum. With industry support like that we should \nencourage these developments. Pacific Northwest Lab is also heavily \ninvolved in diesel engine development because it is the most efficient \ninternal combustion engine. Unfortunately, we had numerous constraints \non the Interior appropriations this year.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Perhaps my colleagues agree that we should try to work \nwith the Department of Energy on organizing a more pronounced effort \nthere to support research on cleaner diesel from natural gas.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I hope we can join together to work with the \nDepartment of Energy to find some funds within the Department to \nsupport this effort.\n  Mr. GORTON. I will be pleased to work with my colleagues from Alaska.\n\n\n                              lake powell\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, recently a handful of environmentalists \nhave called for the draining of Lake Powell and the decommissioning of \nthe Glen Canyon Dam. As the second largest man-made lake in the \ncountry, Lake Powell provides critically important water storage for \nthe states of the Colorado River basin--the driest region in the United \nStates. As many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle already \nknow, Mr. President, draining Lake Powell is unsupportable. This \namendment puts this issue to rest once and for all. This legislation \nsimply prohibits the federal government from taking any action to drain \nLake Powell or to decommission the Glen Canyon Dam without \nCongressional approval.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I wish to say to my good friend from Utah \nthat I agree that draining Lake Powell is not a reasonable proposal, \nand I support his effort to put the issue to rest with this amendment. \nHowever, I would like to ask my colleague from Utah if he believes that \nhis amendment in any way opens the door to the administration to pursue \nthe decommissioning of other Bureau of Reclamation projects without \nCongressional approval?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the support of the chairman of \nthe Interior Appropriations Subcommittee in this matter which is of \ngreat concern to my constituents. Mr. President, this amendment in no \nway gives assent to the Secretary of the Interior or any other \ngovernment official to decommission other water projects without \nCongressional approval. Any effort by the administration to \ndecommission a Bureau of Reclamation project without the approval of \nCongress or of those most affected by the action, in my view, would be \nunsupportable.\n\n\n         regarding the institute of museum and library services\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I want to commend the chairman for the \nexcellent job he has done under difficult circumstances in providing \nfunding for our cultural agencies--the National Endowments for the Arts \n(NEA) and the Humanities (NEH), and the Institute of Museum and Library \nServices (IMLS).\n  Mr. GORTON. In Committee on the Senate side, we were able to boost \nfunding for the Institute of Museum and Library Services by $500,000, \nfrom its fiscal year 1999 level of $23.405 million, to $23.905 million \nfor fiscal year 2000. And now we have adopted the Cochran and Bennett \namendments as part of the managers' amendment to boost funding for the \nNEH and NEA by $4.000 million each.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I was pleased to co-sponsor those amendments. I think \nwe have done well by those two agencies. Now, as I understand it, the \nHouse of Representatives appropriated $24.400 million for IMLS.\n  Mr. GORTON. Initially--that amount was subject to a 0.48 percent \nacross-the-board reduction; consequently, the House-passed funding \nlevel is $24.282 million, or $377,000 more than what the Senate \nCommittee on Appropriations reported.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. As the chairman knows, several of us--Senators Warner, \nBennett, Cochran, Jeffords, Reed, and Kennedy, among others--support \nthe House-passed funding level for IMLS, and contemplated offering an \namendment here on the floor to achieve it.\n  Mr. GORTON. I say to my friend from New York that I am aware of the \nstrong support for the IMLS here in the Senate. Rest assured that I \nwill give every consideration to providing additional support for the \nIMLS when we go to conference on the bill.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. This is wonderful news indeed. The Institute of Museum \nand Library Services provides essential support to our nation's 8,000 \nnon-Federal museums and, through a different appropriation, 120,000 \nlibraries. It goes about its business quietly and professionally, with \nscant attention paid here, but the thriving condition of our museums \nprovides ample evidence of its competence and importance.\n  I think, perhaps, we have turned the corner on Federal support for \nthe arts\n\n[[Page S10843]]\n\nand humanities, for culture. The chairman deserves much of the credit \nand an enormous debt of gratitude for his unwavering support for the \nNEA, NEH, and IMLS and for steadily shepherding their appropriations \nduring these past few, difficult years.\n\n\n    Federal Museum Collections at the Utah Museum of Natural History\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I want to raise an issue that was \nrecently brought to my attention in Utah. It is a long-term project \nthat I intend to undertake and I hope that the committee will support \nme in this effort.\n  The Utah Museum of Natural History contains collections of more than \none million objects and specimens in the fields of geology, biology and \nanthropology. It ranks as one of the largest and most comprehensive \ncollections for the western states. Overall, more than 75 percent of \nthe museum's collections are federally owned; that is, recovered from \nfederally managed public lands. Of the remaining 25 percent of the \ncollections, a significant portion was collected on state lands under \nfederally mandated permitting procedures. The museum is a repository \nfor collections from BLM, Forest Service, Park Service and Bureau of \nReclamation lands. Additional specimens have been collected from \nDepartment of Defense lands as well.\n  There are numerous authorities defining the legal relationship \nbetween the federal agencies and museums and research universities such \nas the Smithsonian's Organic Act passed in 1879, the Antiquities Act of \n1906, NEPA and most recently, the National Archaeological Graves \nProtection and Reburial Act of 1990. The large number of federal \ncollections in the museum is the consequence of the high percentage of \nfederally owned lands in Utah. Utah ranks second among all states in \npercentage of federal lands; thus, field research in the natural \nsciences in Utah largely takes place on federal lands.\n  Unfortunately, the current facilities at the Utah Museum of Natural \nHistory used to house the federal collections are inadequate. Lack of \nspace, materials, supplies and personnel have created a situation where \nthe collections are in jeopardy of being permanently lost. This is not \nin anyway caused by the neglect of the museum staff, but it is simply a \nlack of space and funding to adequately store all of the collections \nproperly.\n  I became interested when this situation was brought to my attention a \nfew months ago. Since that time, my staff have been looking into \nvarious options to help remedy the situation. In the meantime, the \nmuseum has done a tremendous job putting together a master plan, \norganizing partners and seeking private donations to relocate the \nmuseums. But they are limited in their ability to raise funds without \nsome federal participation and commitment. And with that in mind, I \nwant to seek the chairman's input on that question. Does the chairman \nbelieve that the federal agencies such as the BLM, Forest Service and \nthe National Park Service have a legitimate role in helping remedy this \nsituation?\n  MR. GORTON. The Senator raises a good point. Obviously there is a \nfederal interest in protecting these collections. While I cannot commit \nto providing funding for this project in the future, I will work \nclosely with my colleague from Utah. Until that time, however, I think \nit would be quite appropriate for the various agencies to lend their \nresources and expertise by participating the partnership that has been \ncreated. I would encourage them to do so.\n  MR. BENNETT. I thank the chairman and I look forward to working with \nhim.\n\n\n                institute of museum and library services\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Washington care to \nenter into a colloquy regarding museums funding?\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Virginia and will be happy to \nengage in a colloquy.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand the need to adequately address arts funding \nand commend the Chairman's leadership in securing $500,000 above last \nyear's appropriations for our nation's museums and libraries. However, \nthis is still $500,000 short of the House funding level to continue the \ngreat work done by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS).\n  As the Chairman knows, federal funds play an important role in \nassuring that Americans have access to excellent museum services. 8,000 \nmuseums and 120,000 libraries throughout the country have benefited \nfrom Congressional support of IMLS.\n  IMLS programs affect a broad segment of Americans and not an elite \nfew. It helps small, rural museums gain access to resources such as \ndatabase technology development by the larger museums. IMLS improves \npublic accessibility of museums, while allowing local communities to \ndecide on the content and programs of their own museums.\n  Additional funding will allow IMLS to provide technological \nimprovements, making museum and library collections available online \nand accessible to learners of all ages.\n  I ask you to urge the Senate conferees to recede to the House \nposition on IMLS funding and support a relatively modest $500,000 \nincrease in the IMLS budget so museums and libraries across the country \nwill be able to extend their educational services, expand teacher \ntraining, preserve our cultural heritage for our posterity and increase \naccess to valuable resources for America's children.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Virginia and I will be pleased \nto recommend that the conferees consider your thoughtful request to \nrecede to the House proposal, which increases funding for the IMLS by \nan amount of $500,000 above the Senate level. I appreciate the Senator \nfrom Virginia's support for the work of the IMLS and hope that our \nfinal allocation is such that we are able to provide additional funding \nfor museum programs of the IMLS.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                      funding for mark twain house\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my regret that the \nInterior Appropriations bill under consideration here includes no money \nfor the Save America's Treasury Campaign. I would like to describe one \nof the many important projects that will go unrealized for lack of \nfunding. This valuable project is the preservation of the Mark Twain \nHouse in Hartford, Connecticut, and construction of a complementary \neducation and visitor center near the house.\n  Mark Twain wrote seven major books, including ``Tom Sawyer'' and the \n``Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' while living with his family in the \nhouse, which he built in 1874. It is projected that the visitor's \ncenter would help double--to a total of 100,000--the annual number of \nvisitors to Mark Twain House and contribute an estimated 12 million \ndollars every year to the Connecticut economy.\n  If money does come available for the Save America's Treasures \nCampaign, would you agree that the Mark Twain House should be high on \nthe priority list?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes. Mark Twain is a historical and cultural icon of \ngreat importance. Mark Twain's written works represent an American \nliterature legacy and I know that this project is of great importance \nto Connecticut and to America.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank Senator Gorton. I appreciate his hard work on \nthis important legislation.\n\n\n               glacier bay np visitor facilities funding\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wonder if the Subcommittee chairman \nwould be willing to discuss with myself and the senior senator from \nAlaska, the Chairman of the full committee on Appropriations certain \nissues regarding the Glacier Bay National Park Visitor Facility.\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, I will join the Appropriations Chairman and the \nChairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my good friend. Being a member \nof the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources the subcommittee \nchairman is well aware of Glacier Bay National Park. He is aware of it \nthis year for some of the controversy that has been caused by the Park \nService's attempts to prohibit commercial and subsistence fishing \nwithin the bounds of the park.\n  However, there is an area that the local community, the Park Service, \nand the Alaska Congressional Delegation do want to work together on in \nthe park--a new visitor facility. Glacier Bay National Park is one of \nAlaska's treasures. More than 350,000 visitors come to the park each \nyear. Currently, there is no single place for them\n\n[[Page S10844]]\n\nto go to learn about the park resources, native inhabitants, and \nspectacular beauty. The local native corporation has proposed a shared \ncost effort with the Park Service to build such a facility. Is the \nsubcommittee chairman aware of this?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am aware of these efforts and would encourage the \nNational Park Service to work closely with the native corporation to \nfurther develop this proposal in light of the fact that they use \nprivate dollars to maximize public resources. Visitor centers are \nbecoming a very expensive item in the Interior budget. This approach \nshould set an example for future facilities of this type.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Currently there is not a specific line item \nappropriation in the bill before us, H.R. 2466, for this project. \nHowever, it would be my hope that in conference the senior senator from \nAlaska and the Subcommittee Chairman could work to find the dollars for \ndesign and construction needed to make this visitor center a reality.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say to my colleague from Alaska that I will work with \nhim to try and find the funds needed for this project. It is a god \nproject for the community and a worthwhile one for the government. I \nhave been a Glacier Bay on numerous occasions and am supportive of \nincreased visitor facilities. As I understand it no authorization is \nneeded for this as the Secretary has existing authority under section \n1307 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator is correct. Authorization does exist to do \nthis.\n  Mr. GORTON. I will be pleased to continue to work with my colleagues \non this project. I note that the Subcommittee has made a significant \neffort in this bill to provide for visitor facilities in Alaska, but \nagree that additional facilities at Glacier Bay National Park are \nneeded.\n\n\n                          UTAH SPECIFIC ISSUES\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to briefly raise four issues \nwith the Chairman for clarification. Utah is in the process of creating \na GIS database on public lands. Is it the Chairman's understanding that \nthe $300,000 of federal funds appropriated through the BLM Realty and \nOwnership management will be combined with the funds appropriated by \nthe State of Utah and then distributed to the rural counties by the \nspecial committee created by the State Legislature?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct. However, the rural counties \nshould also seek the expertise of Utah State University and the State \nof Utah and rely on their personnel to complete this mapping project.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chairman. With regards to the Olympic Tree \nprogram funded under the Community and Urban Forestry account, given \nthe nature of Olympic partners and the reliance upon in-kind donations, \nis it the Committee's position that the local match may also include \nin-kind donations such as land, labor and materials?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. With regards to the proposed final management plan for \nthe Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, is it the Chairman's \nunderstanding that the State of Utah's authority over wildlife \nmanagement and wildlife damage prevention within the monument shall \nremain unchanged?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct. The Committee would be concerned \nshould the language of the final management plan diminish the ability \nof the State of Utah to manage wildlife damage prevention within the \nMonument. If this is the case, I would hope BLM would consult with the \nState of Utah during the Governor's Consistency Review to amend that \nlanguage to prevent any potential conflict that might occur.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Again, I thank the Chairman. I have one final question \nregarding the Desert Tortoise Recovery program. There is a proposal by \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to create a new position of a \ntortoise recovery coordinator that reports out of the Reno Nevada \noffice. This is of concern to me. As the Chairman knows, Washington \nCounty has made tremendous progress toward completing a Habitat \nConservation Plan and recovery program. They have put together an \neffective, balanced team and compared to other recovery units, \nWashington County and its key partners including the State of Utah, BLM \nand State Parks have accomplished a great deal over the last five \nyears. All of this was accomplished without a tortoise coordinator to \noversee the project.\n  There are a couple of issues I believe should be addressed prior to \nthe creation of proposed coordinator position. Issues such as \ndetermining which office would make section 7 evaluations regarding \ntortoises in Washington County--Salt Lake City or Reno? I would also \nlike to know how the creation of such a position will impact funding \nand how do we insure that state and local communities are not adversely \nimpacted. In order to preserve the good working relationship among the \nparties in Utah, I would hope the Chairman would support me in this \nposition until these questions are answered.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator raises a good point. I am aware of the \nprogress which has been made to date and I congratulate the Advisory \nBoard on their efforts. I share the Senator's concerns about the \ncreation of such a position. It is unclear to me how a single \ncoordinator position from outside the Region would specifically help \nWashington County and BLM administer the HCP and improve things on the \nground.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chairman for his support.\n\n\n               biocatalytic desulfurization technologies\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the intent of \none provision within the bill. As we all are aware the Environmental \nProtection Agency is proposing to reduce the levels of sulfur in \ngasoline and diesel fuel. I note that the bill before us recognizes \nthis new proposal and urges the Department of Energy to continue \nresearch on biocatalytic desulfurization technologies to assist the \nrefining industry in meeting these new requirements. Was it the \nCommittee's intent that the Department continue to support the ongoing \ngasoline biodesulfurization project in the Industries of the Future \nprogram in an effort to ensure that the technology is available to the \nrefining industry to meet the new EPA rules?\n  Mr. GORTON. That was the intent of the Committee. This research is \nvery promising and I thank you for bringing this point to our \nattention.\n\n\n                  archie carr national wildlife refuge\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee if he would consent to discuss with Senator Mack and me \none of Florida's national wildlife refuges, the Archie Carr National \nWildlife Refuge in Brevard County, Florida.\n  Mr. GORTON. I am pleased to join my colleague from Florida in a \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge is located in \nBrevard County, Florida, home of Florida's ``Space Coast.'' The 900-\nacre refuge extends along the coast from Melbourne Beach to Wabasso \nBeach, and it is home to the most important nesting area for loggerhead \nsea turtles in the western hemisphere and the second most important \nnesting beach in the world. Twenty-five percent of all loggerhead sea \nturtle and 35% of all green sea turtle nests in the United States occur \nin this twenty mile zone.\n  Mr. MACK. The Refuge currently co-exists with Florida's Space Coast. \nHowever, sea turtle nesting at this site is sensitive to impacts from \ndevelopment and human activity. To mitigate these impacts, the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service coordinates with the local and state \ngovernments regarding joint management of beaches, index nesting beach \nsurveys, public education programs, and appropriate public use \nfacilities.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It is my experience that in this type of situation, the \nbest answer is land acquisition. Right now, approximately half of the \n900-acres of the designated refuge is available for acquisition. Four \nkey parcels make up the core area of the potential acquisition.\n  I recognize the extreme funding pressures that the subcommittee faced \nwhile determining its Land and Water Conservation Fund priorities. We \nfeel that the Archie Carr Refuge is a key priority for Florida given \nits criticality to the loggerhead sea turtle population.\n  We request your consideration of this project during the conference \nwith the House on the Interior Appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S10845]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I appreciate the Senators' comments. The Committee shares \nyour view that the protection of the loggerhead sea turtle is critical, \nand we will consider the needs of the Archie Carr National Wildlife \nRefuge during our conference with the House.\n\n\n                        sea turtle conservation\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, will the distinguished Chairman of the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee yield for a question?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I will gladly yield to a question from my \ngood friend from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chairman. I \ncommend the gentleman from Washington and the distinguished ranking \nmember Mr. Byrd for the great leadership they have demonstrated in \ncrafting the FY2000 Interior Appropriations bill. Of great personal \ninterest to me is a Kemp's Ridley sea turtle project that is, in part, \nfunded through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This project is a \ntwenty-year-old on-going success story in the recovery of a high \nendangered species. Since 1978, the United States Fish and Wildlife \nService, USFWS, has spearheaded the sea turtle conservation work at \nRancho Nuevo, Mexico. This collaborative conservation project with the \nMexican government and the U.S. shrimp industry through the National \nFisheries Institute protects Kemp's Ridley sea turtle nests an females \nfrom predation and other hazards, and ensures that young turtles make \nit into the sea. This project is the longest standing collaborative \nconservation project between the United States and Mexico without a \nformal treaty. This year, despite the demonstrable success of the \nproject, the Fish and Wildlife Service did not dedicated funds to the \nKemp's Ridley sea turtle project. I am extremely concerned and want to \nexpress my strong support for continued funding for this valuable \nconservation effort.\n  Mr. GORTON. It is clear from my friend's statement that he knows much \nabout the sea turtle conservation project, and I share his enthusiasm \nfor these important efforts to protect the Kemp's Ridley sea turtle. \nWhile I am keenly aware of the fiscal constraints on the Fish and \nWildlife Service, I encourage the Service to consider providing \nwhatever support it can within these existing budget constraints.\n  Mr. BYRD. I agree with my colleagues from Washington and Louisiana. \nThe Fish and Wildlife Service should make every effort to support this \nproject in order to uphold a scientifically justified success in \nendangered species management\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank my colleagues.\n\n\n       advanced development project powder river coal initiative\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for addressing the \npotential benefits that could come from a new coal enhancement \nprocedure being developed in my home state of Wyoming that would \nprovide a unique economic development opportunity for the Crow nation \nand its surrounding rural communications in Montana and Wyoming.\n  This project, known as the advanced development project Powder River \ncoal initiative, is designed to develop a training program for the Crow \nnation that will create future employment opportunities for members of \nthe tribe by utilizing a new technology that permanently removes the \nmoisture from the Powder River Basin's low grade sub-bituminous coal. \nIt is important that we must continue to develop programs like this \nadvanced development project to further the twin goals of environmental \nprotection and economic stability.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague \nfrom Wyoming and agree there is a serious need to bolster the economy \nwithin the Crown nation. Further development of the tribe's vast coal \nreserves would go a long way toward improving the tribes current \nsituation. I would like to assure my colleague that I will continue to \nwork with him and with my colleague from the South Dakota to explore \nprojects like the advanced development project Powder River coal \ninitiative to see if we can't find a way to help the Crow nation \ndevelop its vital coal resources.\n\n\n                      mari sandoz cultural center\n\n  Mr. KERREY. I rise today with my good friend and colleague, Senator \nHagel, to talk about a very important and worthwhile project, the Mari \nSandoz High Plains Heritage Center in Chadron, Nebraska.\n  Mari Sandoz was a world-renowned and internationally-acclaimed \nwriter, born and raised in the Nebraska Sand Hills. Drawing on her \nchildhood experiences and her research at the Nebraska State Historical \nSociety, Sandoz wrote passionately and poetically about life on the \nGreat Plains. Her works dealt with the early fur traders, the Plains \nIndians, the cattlemen and ranchers, the immigrant homesteaders, and \nthe persecution of the Northern Cheyenne and Ogallala Sioux. Through \nher writing, Sandoz played an important role in the cultural \npreservation of the Western Nebraska of the 1800s and early 1900s. \nPreserving her works and her legacy is a way of preserving our own \ncultural heritage.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I join my friend, the senior Senator from Nebraska, in \nsupporting a federal appropriation for the Mari Sandoz Cultural Center.\n  Nebraska has produced a number of this nation's most significant \nwriters. The John Neihardt Center in Bancroft and the Willa Cather \nCenter in Red Cloud commemorate two of Nebraska's most famous literary \nfigures. A facility dedicated to Mari Sandoz would be an appropriate \naddition on to the state's literary heritage.\n  Following Mari Sandoz's death, Chadron State College came into \npossession of her writing and personal artifacts. The College developed \nthe idea of the cultural center as the best way to preserve her legacy. \nPlans for the center include museum display areas for American Indians \nand Sandoz family artifacts, rooms for meetings and workshops on \nSandoz' work, archives for Sandoz' manuscripts, and an herbarium that \nwill complement the descriptions of regional flora central to Sandoz' \nliterature. The center would be a perfect tribute to one of Nebraska's \nfinest writers.\n  Mr. KERREY. I agree that the construction of the Center is an \nimportant commemoration of Sandoz' contributions to Nebraska. Earlier \nthis year, I requested that $450,000 be appropriated from available \nfunds in the National Park Service's Historic Preservation Fund or the \nSave America's Treasures to fund the Mari Sandoz Cultural Center. These \ndollars will help renovate, rehabilitate, and equip the former library \nfacility on the Chadron State campus.\n  Mr. HAGEL. It is my understanding that these federal dollars will be \nin addition to the private dollars raised by Chadron State College and \nthe Mari Sandoz Heritage Society.\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes, both organizations have been working diligently to \nraise $900,000 in private funding for the construction and equipment of \nthe new Center. I am hopeful that we will be able to provide additional \nFederal dollars for this historically and culturally significant \nCenter.\n  Mr. HAGEL. We both realize that budget restraints are tight this \nyear. But I am hopeful that Chairman Gorton and Ranking Minority Member \nByrd will find a way to fully fund this project when the conference \ncommittee meets on the Interior appropriations bill later this fall.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, issues surrounding natural resource \nmanagement present some of the most contentious and difficult problems \nwe as policymakers face. Trying to ensure that our federal forestry \npolicy is responsible and environmentally sustainable has been \nespecially difficult, and we have sometimes fallen woefully short in \nthis area. We can and must do much better. I have seen the awful \nresults of clear-cutting, uncontrolled erosion, and other abuses by the \nlogging industry, and I believe we must bring those abuses to an end \nnow.\n  Even so, our national forests are tremendous resources for a variety \nof uses, including everything from timber harvesting to recreation. My \nstate of Minnesota depends on these resources for jobs and family \nincomes; wood, industrial materials, paper and pulp; and family \nvacations and recreation. Above all, we must protect our national \nforests to ensure that these resources will be available for future \ngenerations. For these reasons, I have long supported carefully \ncontrolled, environmentally sustainable multiple use of our national \nforests.\n  I share many of my colleague Senator Bryan's legitimate concerns \nabout the future health of our nation's\n\n[[Page S10846]]\n\nforests, and about the abuses that have been allowed in certain regions \nunder the Forest Service's timber sales program--especially in \nessential areas of biodiversity such as the Pacific Northwest. I \nrecognize that these environmentally harmful forest management \npractices have serious long-term consequences for the health of our \nforests, and that they must be stopped.\n  The Timber Sale Management Program is in need of significant reform \nin many regions of our nation. I believe that my record shows clearly \nmy support for reforming the program to ensure a more responsible and \nenvironmentally sustainable forestry effort. But this amendment would \nreduce by approximately $32 million current funding levels for the \nprogram, and it could create some special problems in my state, where \nthe Forest Service has generally been quite responsible in its timber \nsale efforts.\n  In my state of Minnesota, on July 4, 1999, we experienced a huge, \nonce-in-a-thousand-year wind and rain storm that damaged and destroyed \nhomes, businesses, public facilities, and wilderness areas in our \nnational forests. Approximately 300,000 acres in seven counties were \nhit by the storm, which damaged as much as 70 percent of the trees in \ncertain areas and washed out numerous roads. The damage caused by this \nstorm has severely hindered the U.S. Forest Service's ability to \nresponsibly manage the Chippewa and Superior National Forests. While I \nhave worked successfully with my colleagues in the Minnesota delegation \nto ensure that approximately $12 million in emergency funding is \nreprogrammed from elsewhere in the Forest Service budget to support \ntimber salvage efforts in Minnesota, it is clear that much is yet to be \ndone, and that it is going to take many years to dig out from under the \nstorm and to restore the forest to its former state.\n  As I've observed, the Forest Service in Minnesota has a long \ntradition of generally responsible and publicly accountable forest \nmanagement practices. I believe, especially as the post-storm clean-up \nthere proceeds over the coming months and years, that the Forest \nService must have adequate resources to deal with the storm's \ndevastation. This amendment would cut approximately $32 million from \nproposed funding for the Timber Sale Management Program, decreasing \nlast year's funding for this program by approximately $30 million. \nWhile I know that this funding is not yet precisely allocated to the \nvarious regions, I am concerned that a cut of this size might constrain \nthe Service's overall capacity to adequately support efforts to \nrecover, repair and rehabilitate public lands in Minnesota hard hit by \nthe storm, and for that reason I think it would be unwise.\n  As I said, I recognize the problems with the Timber Sales Management \nProgram, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, and I remain committed \nto supporting efforts to bring a halt to these environmentally \nunsustainable abuses. Even though I cannot support this amendment \ntoday, I look forward to working with my colleague Senator Bryan and \nothers to find ways to reform and improve the forest management \npractices of the Forest Service, and of those private industry firms \nwith whom it cooperates, to eliminate the abuses of our forests which \nhave been brought to light during this debate.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Endangered Species Act listing of \nvarious runs of salmon throughout the Northwest has been a wake-up call \nfor Washingtonians. We have seen an unprecedented decline in a \nhistorically vibrant salmon population, relied upon by countless \nsportsmen, commercial and tribal fishermen, and those of us who see \nsalmon as a Northwest cultural icon.\n  And for years, at all levels of government, we've spent billions of \ndollars in an effort to recover this important species, but we've seen \nlittle in return. Millions and millions of dollars have been spent on \nmassive studies. Millions of dollars have fueled growing bureaucracies \nto address the problem and create new regulations that may or may not \nsave the fish.\n  In all the flurry of activity and spending, one, largely unrecognized \neffort has done more in our rivers and streams to improve salmon \nhabitat than almost anything else in which we've invested our \nresources. Across Washington state, small, local volunteer groups spend \ntheir weekends restoring streams, revegetating riparian areas and \ncreating healthy, inviting places for salmon to return. They recruit \npeople from all over the community to spend a few hours on the weekend \nworking in their local stream, river, or anywhere else that will make a \ndifference for the fish.\n  In many cases, these locally-grown groups are able to work \ncooperatively with private landowners to restore streams and rivers \nthat run through their property. These efforts achieve results and make \nall parties satisfied with the outcome in a way that government-\nmandated directives could never do.\n  That's why my 1999 Interior Appropriations bill includes a $4 million \nappropriation for these groups to be able to continue their hard work \nand worthy efforts. The money will be appropriated to the National Fish \nand Wildlife Foundation to distribute, as quickly as possible, to \nlocally-organized, on-the-ground salmon enhancement organizations.\n  These groups' potential for positive contributions to salmon recovery \nare immeasurable. For instance, a stream on the North Shore of Hood \nCanal would be an excellent salmon spawning and over wintering habitat \nif it were not for man-made barriers to fish passage. The Hood Canal \nSalmon Enhancement Group (HCSEG) would like to remove the 3 foot \ndiameter pipe, which the stream now runs through, and correct the \nimmediate four foot drop in the stream level. Replacing the pipe with \nan appropriately sized culvert and fishway would open up 1.7 miles of \nhabitat for chum, coho, and steelhead. Hood Canal SEG likes to call \nthese projects ``no-brainers'' because the habitat already exists, the \nfish just need to be able to get there.\n  Local residents are critical to these salmon recovery efforts, where \nintimate historic knowledge of seasonal flows, fish populations, and \nspecific migratory trends don't typically exist outside the community.\n  Another group, Long Live the Kings (LLTK), is contributing to the \nrecovery of listed salmonids in Hood Canal. At their Lilliwaup \nfacility, LLTK is operating a captive rearing and supplementation \nprogram for threatened steelhead and summer chum. I was happy to have \nhelped find funding for this program last year, and am pleased to \ncontinue this support.\n  While in the state during our August recess, I met with the Nooksack \nSalmon Enhancement Association out of Bellingham, Washington. This \ngroup, with the passionate leadership of volunteers like Mike and \nElaine McRory, have taken on habitat restoration projects in urban and \nrural areas alike, successfully soliciting the cooperation of private \nlandowners to recover local stocks. Landowner participation is often \ncontagious, and NSEA has seen one project on a given stream turn into \ntwo, three, or even more.\n  It should be clear that organizations across Washington State, not \njust those within the Puget Sound basin, are eligible to apply for \nthese funds. In fact my staff will be traveling to Okanogan county at \nthe end of this month to introduce members of the local community to \nNFWF representatives.\n  Grants for local groups through the National Fish and Wildlife \nFoundation provide a much needed funding source for long overdue \nprojects ranging from Skagit FEG's Little Baker River Side Channel \nproject, which would open one mile of chinook spawning and rearing \nhabitat, to riparian restoration in Newaukum and Portage Creeks, \nconducted by Mid-Sound FEG and Stilli-Snohomish Fisheries Enhancement \nTask Force.\n  The amount appropriated to the NFWF does include an earmark for a \ngroup that deserves special recognition for their efforts to clean up \nour local water, essential to salmon recovery success. River CPR's \nPuget Sound Drain Guard Campaign will employ volunteer labor to install \ndevices aimed at trapping 90 percent of the oil and sediment that \ntypically flows into storm drains. It is evident that this small amount \nof money is going to go a long way towards recovering salmon across our \nstate.\n  Here is what some of these groups have to say about this initiative:\n\n[[Page S10847]]\n\n  ``Senator Gorton's proposal to use the National Fish and Wildlife \nFoundation to direct funding to the local level is very innovative and \nwill ensure that the funds are used where they most help fish, on the \nground,'' said one Mid Sound Fisheries Enhancement Group board member.\n  Alison Studley writes, ``As a member of the Skagit Fisheries \nEnhancement Group (Skagit FEG), I whole-heartedly support your endeavor \nto get salmon dollars to support on-the-ground projects. Local \norganizations are ready, willing and able to take on this challenge.''\n  In sum: I believe that Washingtonians and local salmon restoration \norganizations--not bureaucracies in Washington, D.C.--are in the best \nposition to make decisions that will return salmon. That's why my 1999 \nInterior Bill includes money for these local groups--who have been \nworking on this problem for years--so they can decide how to restore \nthe fisheries. It's time for the federal government to let those who \nwill be affected by the decisions make these decisions. Salmon are a \ncritical part of the Northwest way of life, so let Northwesterners \ndecide how to fix this problem without being told how to do it from \nWashington, D.C.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/14/senate-section/article/S10847-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, today, plaintiffs from my home State of \nVermont made opening arguments in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia. The plaintiffs, representing the New England \nCouncil for Energy Efficiency and the Environment, have raised serious \nquestions about the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's decision in \n1997 to grant power marketer status to a subsidiary of the Canadian \ncompany Hydro-Quebec.\n  The Council is protesting that Hydro-Quebec was unlawfully granted \nthe ability to buy and sell power in the U.S. without regulatory \noversight. According to expert testimony in that case, Hydro-Quebec \nalready exercises too much control over Northeastern energy markets, \nand Vermont ratepayers will have to pay higher energy bills if this \nlicense is upheld.\n  Hydro-Quebec's ability and willingness to exert undue influence on \nelectricity markets in the United States is of serious concern. The \ncompany's request last month that the Canadian government sue the \nUnited States over fair trade practices is a clear infringement of the \nlegitimate rights of Vermonters to set Vermont electric rates. The \nVermont Public Service Board sets rates equally for all companies, be \nthey foreign or domestic, yet Hydro-Quebec is using its status as a \nsemi-governmental foreign company in an attempt to control these rates.\n  It is deeply ironic that Hydro-Quebec, a monopoly protected by Quebec \nlaw against all retail and virtually all wholesale competition in \nQuebec, should utilize principles of ``fair trade'' to lodge a \ncomplaint against the United States under NAFTA. Entrepreneurs in New \nEngland and New York who want to compete in Quebec are prohibited from \ndoing so, thus precluding meaningful international competition in \nenergy. Yet Hydro-Quebec is able to freely sell its energy in the U.S.\n  I call upon Hydro-Quebec to come out from behind its monopolistic \nshield and act like a true competitive utility. Drop your NAFTA \nlawsuit. End your efforts to undermine Vermont law. Stop using \ninternational law to threaten Vermont ratepayers. We want to do \nbusiness with Hydro-Quebec, but we cannot do so while it tries to exert \nundue influence in Vermont and New England markets. In Vermont, the \nPublic Service Board sets electric rates, not foreign companies. We \nwill never, ever let a foreign entity write our rules on power sales.\n  I further call upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to \nthoroughly examine all means by which a foreign utility may exert \ninfluence in the United States. Foreign companies should not be given \ncarte blanche to sell energy in the U.S. until all impacts of that \ndecision are considered--not only market share, but also environmental \nimpacts and means outside of the market by which a foreign company may \nexert influence. Hydro-Quebec is taking advantage of its enormous size \nand semi-governmental status to gouge ratepayers in Vermont. This issue \nis of enormous importance to the people of Vermont, and I hope the \nCommission will thoroughly examine all of these issues.\n  Mr. President, I will do all in my power to protect Vermont electric \nratepayers from unnecessary manipulation and threats. I am carefully \nreviewing the law related to wholesale and retail power sales and will \nbe sure to work for a revision of this law if we see that a region of \nthis nation, or a particular state, is being treated unfairly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/14/senate-section/article/S10847-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EAST TIMOR\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am horrified by the atrocities \noccurring in East Timor--where an armed militia is using murder and \nintimidation to nullify the results of a free and fair referendum. The \nUnited States must join the international community in protecting the \npeople of East Timor from mass murder and religious persecution.\n  During this century, we have seen horrifying examples of dictators \nand despots whose brutality begins with attacks on the peaceful men and \nwomen of the church. This is happening again in East Timor--where \nmembers of the Church are being brutally persecuted.\n  The stories coming out of East Timor are heart-wrenching.\n  Women and children are massacred within the sanctuary of their \nchurches. Catholic priests, nuns and Caritas workers are being murdered \nas they try to protect their communities. Nobel Loreate Bishop Beli has \nbeen forced into exile. Churches, convents and schools are being \nburned. Thousands of men, women and children are fleeing from their \nhomes in fear. They are taking refuge in the countryside--where there \nisn't enough food, water or medicine.\n  This brutality is occurring with the complicity of the Indonesian \nmilitary. This is a military that has conducted twenty five years of \nrepression in East Timor. It is a military that the United States has \ntrained and armed.\n  The international community cannot stand by while civilians are \nbrutally murdered. That is why I support President Clinton's statement \nof support for US participation in an United Nations peacekeeping \nforce. The force would be led by regional powers--including our strong \nally Australia. The United States would help to provide logistical \nsupport.\n  This peacekeeping force would have three goals: to protect the people \nof East Timor; to restore order and to enable the referendum for \nindependence to be implemented.\n  The United States must stand up for our interests and our values. We \nmust join our allies in protecting the people of East Timor and \nrestoring peace and stability to their country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/14/senate-section/article/S10847-4", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10847-S10848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RISK MANAGEMENT FOR THE 21ST CENTURY\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President I rise today as one of the proud cosponsors \nof the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act.\n  This bill offers much-needed changes in the area of risk management \nfor farmers and ranchers. Managing risk in agriculture has become \nperhaps the most important aspect of the business. Agricultural \nproducers who are able to effectively manage their risk are able to \nsustain and increase profit. An effective crop insurance program will \nprovide farmers and ranchers possibilities for economic sustainability \nin the future and help them out of the current financial crisis.\n  The Federal Government can help facilitate a program to unite the \nproducer and the private insurance company. The control must be put \nultimately in the hands of the agricultural producer. Although he \ncannot control risk, an effective management plan will help him to \nmanage the effects of risks, such as weather, prices and natural \ndisasters.\n  This bill addresses the inadequacies of the current crop insurance \nprogram.\n\n[[Page S10848]]\n\n The problems and inconsistencies with the current program make it both \nunaffordable and confusing to agricultural producers. Costly premiums \nare the biggest problem. In years of depressed market prices, crop \ninsurance, though badly needed, is simply unaffordable for farmers.\n  This bill inverts the current subsidy formula, in order to provide \nthe highest levels of subsidies to producers at the highest levels of \nbuy-up coverage, and thus alleviate the unaffordable premiums. It also \nallows for the revenue policies to be fully subsidized.\n  Another important provision in this bill is to allow an additional \nsubsidy for risk management activities. If a producer uses futures or \noptions, utilizes cash forwards, attends a risk management class, uses \nAgricultural Trade Options or FFARRM accounts or reduces farm financial \nrisk, they will receive a 5 percent write-down on their premium for \ntaking part in two of the above risk management tools.\n  This bill also takes into account lack of production histories for \nbeginning farmers or those who have added land or use crop rotation. \nThis will make it possible for those producers to get a foot in the \ndoor and receive affordable crop insurance.\n  Many times, especially in Montana, multi-year disasters occur. This \nbill helps producers that take a blow several years in a row, which \nreduces their Annual Production History (APH). If a producer has \nsuffered a natural disaster during at least 3 of the preceding 5 years \nand their APH was reduced by at least 25 percent they may exclude one \nyear of APH for every five years experience. During this time, the \nproducer's APH may increase without limit back up to the level before \nthe multi-year disaster began.\n  Specialty crops such as canola or dry beans, are another important \naddition to this bill. The Risk Management Agency (RMA) will allocate \nat least 50 percent of their Research and Development funds to \nspecialty crop development. Additionally, RMA is authorized to spend up \nto $20 million each fiscal year to create partnerships for developing \nand implementing specialty crop risk management options.\n  This bill will also ultimately put more control in the hands of \nactive producers by including four active producers; as well as one in \ncrop insurance, and one in reinsurance. The board would also include \nthe Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services, the \nUnder Secretary for Rural Development and the Chief Economist of USDA. \nIn addition, it mandates that the Board Chairperson be one of the non-\ngovernmental members. These are important steps to ensure that the new \nprogram is run for the producers by the producers.\n  This bill is an important tool to reform the current crop insurance \nprogram into a risk management program, designed to help the producer \nin the long-term. It is vital to find a solution to provide a way for \nfarmers to stay in agriculture. They must be able to continue to \nproduce and distribute the world's safest food supply at a profitable \nmargin.\n  I look forward to working with Senators Roberts and Kerrey on this \nimportant piece of legislation. I believe this bill will pave the way \nfor massive crop insurance reform and help agricultural producers out \nof this economic crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/14/senate-section/article/S10848-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10848-S10849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF RICHARD PAEZ\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Hispanic whose actions and fate I would \nlike the Senate to focus on for action is Richard Paez. Richard Paez \nhas never been convicted of a crime and is not associated with the \nFALN. He is not a petitioner seeking presidential clemency. Rather, he \nis a judicial nominee who has been awaiting consideration and \nconfirmation by the Senate since January 1996--for over 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  The vacancy for which Judge Paez was nominated became a judicial \nemergency during the time his nomination has been pending without \naction by the Senate. His nomination was first received by the Senate \nalmost 44 months ago.\n  This nomination has now been held even longer than the unconscionable \n41 months this Senate forced Judge William Fletcher to wait before \nconfirming his nomination last October.\n  Judge Paez has twice been reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee to the Senate for final action. He is again on the Senate \ncalendar. He was initially delayed 25 months before finally being \naccorded a confirmation hearing in February 1998. After being reported \nby the Judiciary Committee in March 1998, his nomination was held on \nthe Senate Executive Calendar without action for over 7 months, for the \nremainder of the last Congress.\n  Judge Paez was renominated by the President again this year and his \nnomination was stalled without action before the Judiciary Committee \nuntil late July, when we were able to have his nomination reported \nagain. The Senate refused to consider the nomination before the August \nrecess. I have repeatedly urged the Republican leadership to call this \nnomination up for consideration and a vote. If they make time on the \nSenate floor for debate and consideration of a Senate resolution \ncommenting on the clemency grant, which is a power the constitution \ninvested in the President without a congressional role, the Senate \nshould find time to consider the nomination of this fine Hispanic \njudge.\n  Judge Paez has the strong support of both California Senators and a \n``well-qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association. He has \nserved as a municipal judge for 13 years and as a Federal judge for 4 \nyears.\n  In my view Judge Paez should be commended for the years he worked to \nprovide legal services and access to our justice system for those \nwithout the financial resources otherwise to retain counsel. His work \nwith the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, the Western Center on Law \nand Poverty and California Rural Legal Assistance for nine years should \nbe a source of praise and pride.\n  Judge Paez has had the strong support of California judges familiar \nwith his work, such as Justice H. Walter Crosky, and support from an \nimpressive array of law enforcement officials, including Gil Garcetti, \nthe Los Angeles District Attorney; the late Sherman Block, then Los \nAngeles County Sheriff; the Los Angeles County Police Chiefs' \nAssociation; and the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs.\n  The Hispanic National Bar Association, the Mexican American Legal \nDefense and Educational Fund, the League of United Latin American \nCitizens, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed \nOfficials, and many, many others have been seeking a vote on this \nnomination for what now amounts to years.\n  I want to commend the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his \nsteadfast support of this nominee and Senator Boxer and Senator \nFeinstein of California for their efforts on his behalf.\n  Last year the words of the Chief Justice of the United States were \nringing in our ears with respect to the delays in Senate consideration \nof judicial nomination. He had written: ``Some current nominees have \nbeen waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote \nor a final floor vote. . . . The Senate is surely under no obligation \nto confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for \ninquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.'' Those words resonate \nwith respect to the nomination of Judge Paez.\n  I trust the American people recognize who is playing politics with \nthe issue of clemency. I disagreed with the President's decision, but \nit was his to make. He says that he granted clemency with conditions \nafter study and based on a sense of proportion and justice. The calls \nfor clemency in these cases came from Bishop Tutu, Coretta Scott King, \nother Nobel peace prize winters, a number of churches and religious \ngroups. It has drawn praise in some circles and criticism in others.\n  I do not agree with the President, but I caution that the \noverreaching by Republican critics in the Congress on this is \nworrisome, as well. To contend that this shows a weakness of resolve \nagainst international terrorism is both wrong and may itself be \ncreating a dangerous atmosphere.\n  We ought to be careful when anyone, let alone the Senate and Congress \nof the United States, start bandying about declarations that accuse the \nUnited States Government of making ``deplorable concessions to \nterrorists,'' ``undermining national security'' or\n\n[[Page S10849]]\n\n``emboldening domestic and international terrorists.''\n  Playing politics with this matter and accusing the President of \n``undermining our national security'' or ``emboldening terrorists'' \ncarries significant risks. Could a potential terrorist somewhere in the \nworld believe this political rhetoric and be ```emboldened'' by it? \nThis is risky business. I do not believe the short-term political gain \nto the other party is worth having the Senate endorse a resolution that \nmight itself have precisely that effect.\n  The Senate cannot find time to vote on the nomination of Judge \nRichard Paez or that of Bill Lann Lee to head the Civil Rights Division \nor that of Justice Ronnie White to be a Federal judge in Missouri or \nany of the scores of other nominees pending before it. The Senate has \nnot completed work on 11 of the 13 appropriations bills that must be \npassed before October 1. The Republican Congress cannot find time to \nconsider campaign finance reform or pass a real patients' bill of \nrights or consider raising the minimum wage or reforming Medicare or \ncomplete the juvenile crime bill conference, but there is plenty of \ntime for floor debate and on the President's decision to exercise his \nclemency power. The Senate has had three hearings on judicial \nnominations all year and the Republican Congress will have that many \nhearings on the clemency decision this week.\n  In closing, I ask: If the Senate has the time to debate and vote on \nthis resolution, why does it not have time to vote on the nomination of \nJudge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/14/senate-section/article/S10849-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to address recent \ndevelopments in the world trading system that occurred over the past \nseveral days at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings.\n  Since its birth in 1989, APEC has been a useful forum to advance U.S. \ngoals for world trade. In 1993, President Clinton hosted the first \nsummit meeting of APEC leaders. That meeting helped to nudge the \nUruguay Round of global trade talks to a successful conclusion. The \nfollowing year, APEC leaders made a political commitment to free trade \nin the Pacific Basin by a date certain. Two years later, APEC leaders \nprodded WTO members to sign Information Technology Agreement. That \nagreement eliminates tariffs on products where U.S. companies have a \nclear advantage.\n  APEC has also launched some worthwhile projects aimed at making it \neasier to do business in the Pacific Rim.\n  The 21 members of APEC are responsible for almost half of the world's \ntrade. They include country's at various stages of economic \ndevelopment. Members are as diverse as Papua New Guinea, Russia, Peru, \nand Australia. APEC is the only organization where China, Taiwan and \nHong Kong sit together as equals to discuss economic issues. In 1998, \nU.S. trade with APEC members was just over one trillion dollars, about \n70% of our trade. Our three biggest trading partners--Canada, Mexico \nand Japan--are in APEC\n  Last week in Auckland, New Zealand, APEC's trade and foreign \nministers held their annual meeting. This was followed by the annual \nsummit meeting of APEC leaders, including President Clinton. These \nmeetings provided an opportunity for using APEC to further American \ntrade interests in two ways. One was bilateral. It dealt with U.S.-\nChina relations. The other was multilateral. It dealt with the World \nTrade Organization (WTO).\n  On the bilateral front, the annual APEC summit meeting provided \nPresident Clinton an opportunity to meet with China's President Jiang \nZemin and get our relations with China on track. In particular, it was \na chance to restart the talks on China's accession to the WTO.\n  To join the WTO, China must make one-way concessions in order to gain \npermanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR) status. Before the China trade \ntalks broke down for political reasons unrelated to trade, China made \nsome important commitments to us in its accession protocol. For \nexample, in addition to tariff cuts and agriculture concessions, China \npromised to eliminate technology transfer requirements for investment \nlicenses. It will end investment performance requirements designed to \ntake jobs from other countries.\n  China's WTO accession requires no American trade concessions. And \nChina has agreed to a ``product-specific safeguard'' which will \nstrengthen our ability to fight sudden import surges. A good accession \nprotocol will be good for America. The Clinton-Jiang meeting in \nAuckland infused our bilateral trade talks with new life.\n  The U.S. negotiators thus far have done an excellent job. They have \nalready offered American farmers a ray of hope during a very difficult \nyear. And we are close to an accession that will make trade with China \nfundamentally more fair for our country. It will then be up to this \nSenate, and to our colleagues, to take the final step by making the \nnormal trade relations we now offer to China permanent.\n  On the multilateral end, the Auckland meetings were an opportunity \nfor APEC members to show a united front for progress to the other \nmembers of the WTO. There was some forward movement on this in \nAuckland, but not as much as we needed. The key issue is how much we \nshould achieve in the next WTO trade round. The next round will be \nlaunched two months from now, when the United States hosts the Seattle \nWTO Ministerial.\n  In this regard, last week I introduced Senate Concurrent Resolution \n55. It contained the elements of what I believe we should achieve in \nthe next round. At their Auckland meeting, APEC trade ministers \nendorsed a number of these elements. Procedurally, they said that the \ntalks should be completed in three years, rather than the seven years \nit took for the Uruguay Round. They said that WTO members should treat \nthe talks as one single package, not a collection of separate topics \nwhere members can opt out of the tough issues. They mentioned the need \nto address tariffs on manufactured products.\n  All that was useful. But the APEC minsters did not go far enough. \nPresident Clinton and the leaders of the other APEC members set out \nambitious goals for them five years ago. To achieve those goals, the \ntrade ministers must set specific targets. In agriculture, for example, \nthe Auckland meeting supported abolishing all export subsidies. That is \na specific, ambitious target. We need the same specificity on other \nagricultural trade issues which, such as tariffs, trade-distorting \ndomestic subsidies, and government trading companies. It would have \nbeen very helpful to have APEC trade ministers support progress in \nthese areas\n  The trade ministers should have made a much stronger statement on \ntrade in services. This is not only an important component of developed \neconomies. Services of all sectors--financial, communications, legal, \nengineering--are vital to developing nations as well.\n\n[[Page S10850]]\n\n  I wish the APEC trade ministers had been more concrete and specific \nin their treatment of the WTO talks. I hope this does not foreshadow \nthree years of negotiations which yield weak results.\n  Finally, I would like to endorse a point that the heads of the APEC \ngovernments made in their summit communique. They noted that great \ndisparities in wealth threaten social stability. That is true both \nwithin a country and between nations. We must ensure that the benefits \nof globalization are widely shared. We must show that the global \ntrading system improves the quality of life for WTO members.\n  We need to emphasize the human dimension of globalization. That human \nincludes issues such a labor and the environment, which APEC ministers \nand leaders largely ignored at Auckland. I hope that future meetings of \nAPEC summits focus on these issues, and that APEC becomes a positive \nforce for their full consideration in the WTO.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/14/senate-section/article/S10850-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      VOTE ANNOUNCEMENT CORRECTION\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

There have been several discussions \nthat contemplate the transfer of the lands of the Oil Shale Reserve to \nthe Bureau of Land Management. Due to the religious and historical \nsignificance of certain lands and the presence of wild horses and \nburros, the Ute Tribe is concerned that any transfer may infringe on \ntheir tribal rights and deviate from the current management direction.\n  This bill would continue the Department of Energy's administration of \nthe Oil Shale Reserve, and also provide a significant opportunity for \neconomic development to the Ute Tribe. The bill requires the Department \nof Energy to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Ute Tribe to \ndevelop a long-term plan to manage, develop, and administer the Oil \nShale Reserve. Further, 180 days after enactment of this bill, the Ute \nTribe will enter into an oil and gas lease with the Department of \nEnergy to develop the hydrocarbon resources present in the Oil Shale \nReserve. It should be noted that the Ute Tribe has a history of \nresponsible stewardship over the development of one of the largest oil \nand gas fields in Utah. I fully anticipate that the leasing process \nwill go forward in an environmentally responsible manner. I expect \nnothing less from the Department and the Tribe.\n  Through the management and utilization of these resources, the Ute \nTribe will have an opportunity to develop high quality, high paying \njobs that are sorely needed on the Uintah and Ouray Reservation while \nsustainably managing the land.\n  The Ute Economic Opportunity Act of 1999 is an important piece of \nlegislation that will allow the Ute Tribe to pursue economic \nindependence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url":

                S. Con. Res. 56\n\n       Expressing the sense of Congress regarding the importance \n     of ``family friendly'' programming on television.\n       Whereas American children and adolescents spend between 22 \n     and 28 hours each week viewing television;\n       Whereas American homes have an average of 2.75 television \n     sets, and 87 percent of homes with children have more than 1 \n     television set;\n       Whereas there is a need to increase the availability of \n     programs suitable for the entire family during prime time \n     viewing hours;\n       Whereas surveys of television content demonstrate that many \n     programs contain substantial sexual or violent content;\n       Whereas although parents are ultimately responsible for \n     appropriately supervising their children's television \n     viewing, it is also important to provide positive, ``family \n     friendly'' programming that is suitable for parents and \n     children to watch together;\n       Whereas efforts should be made by television networks, \n     studios, and the production community to produce more quality \n     family friendly programs and to air those programs during \n     times when parents and children are likely to be viewing \n     together;\n       Whereas members of the Family Friendly Programming Forum \n     are concerned about the availability of family friendly \n     television programs during prime time viewing hours; and\n       Whereas Congress encourages activities by the Forum and \n     other entities designed to promote family friendly \n     programming, including--\n         (1) participating in meetings with leadership of major \n     television networks, studios, and production companies to \n     express concerns;\n         (2) expressing the importance of family friendly \n     programming at industry conferences, meetings, and forums;\n         (3) honoring outstanding family friendly television \n     programs with a new tribute, the Family Program Awards, to be \n     held annually in Los Angeles, California;\n         (4) establishing a development fund to finance family \n     friendly scripts; and\n         (5) underwriting scholarships at television studies \n     departments at institutions of higher education to encourage \n     student interest in family friendly programming: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the efforts of the Family \n     Friendly Programming Forum and other entities supporting \n     family friendly programming;\n       (2) supports efforts to encourage television networks, \n     studios, and the production community to produce more quality \n     family friendly programs;\n       (3) supports the proposed Family Friendly Programming \n     Awards, development fund, and scholarships, all of which are \n     designed to encourage, recognize, and celebrate creative \n     excellence in, and commitment to, family friendly \n     programming; and\n       (4) encourages the media and American advertisers to \n     further a family friendly television environment within which \n     appropriate advertisements can accompany the programming.\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today along with my \nfriend and colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, to submit a \nresolution recognizing the importance of expanding the amount of family \nfriendly television programming, and to saluting the contributions that \nthe Family Friendly Programming Forum is undertaking to make this goal \na reality.\n  As nearly any parent will attest, it can be a very difficult task to \nkeep track of what their children watch after school. It is \nparticularly hard for working parents. Each week the average child \nwatches 22 to 28 hours of television, which is more time than is spent \non nearly any other activity, except sleeping. The trick for parents is \nto establish good family viewing habits that emphasize quality \nprogramming and which are suited to the age of these young viewers. \nMany parents have indicated their desire to have more program choices \nfor family friendly viewing during the evening hours when everyone is \nhome together.\n  To help in this endeavor, a number of our nation's leading companies \nhave joined forces to establish the Family Friendly Programming Forum. \nThe Forum's members, which includes some of the nation's largest \ntelevision advertisers, are encouraging the production of more \ntelevision programs geared toward the entire family. As sponsors of a \nwide range of programs, the Forum's members believe that there is a \ndefinite call for more family friendly movies, documentaries, series \nand other programs that are relevant and interesting to a broad family \naudience.\n  The members of the Forum are working on a variety of initiatives in \nan effort to promote more family friendly programs. They are: engaging \nin constructive dialogue with industry leaders, presenting awards to \nfamily friendly television programs, establishing a development fund \nfor family friendly scripts, awarding university scholarships in \ntelevision studies that highlight family television themes, as well as \nembarking on a public awareness campaign.\n  Mr. President, as a father and a grandfather, I am deeply concerned \nabout the healthy development of all our nation's children. The future \nof our nation depends to a great degree on the safe and nurturing \nenvironment that will give children a positive outlook on life. \nTherefore, I encourage efforts that will increase the number and \nquality of family TV programs. I congratulate the Family Friendly \nProgramming Forum on their leadership toward that goal.\n  I believe that the passage of the resolution that Senator Lieberman \nand I are introducing honors the Forum's commitment and helps raise the \nawareness of others in the business community to align themselves with \nthe goal of bringing quality television to our nation's families for \nthe benefit of our children. I encourage my colleagues to join us in \ncosponsoring this resolution and I urge the Senate to provide it's \nquick approval.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/14/senate-section/article/S10854-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10854-S10855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 183--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING ON SEPTEMBER 19, \n1999, AND ENDING ON SEPTEMBER 25, 1999, AS NATIONAL HOME EDUCATION WEEK\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT (for himself, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \nHelms, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Smith of Oregon) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, September 15, 1999, marks the beginning of \nHispanic Heritage Month. Today, I rise before my colleagues in the \nSenate to pay tribute to Nevada's dynamic Hispanic community, as well \nas the more than 30 million people in the United States who are of \nHispanic heritage.\n  Mr. President, Nevada, which has consistently been the fastest \ngrowing state in the union, boasts a Hispanic population of more than \ntwo-hundred and fifty thousand. While the Hispanic community \nconstitutes fifteen percent of the population of Las Vegas, more than \none in four schoolchildren in the Las Vegas/Clark County School \nDistrict are of Hispanic heritage. Our children are the future, and the \ninference is clear: the Hispanic community is the fastest growing \nminority group in Nevada and the entire country.\n  The many contributions of Hispanics in American society are \ndemonstrated in the areas of culture, academics, business, education, \nthe arts and entertainment. In Nevada, Hispanic leadership continues to \nadvance as members of the community occupy more and more elected and \nappointed positions. I was especially honored to have my dear friend, \nReynaldo Martinez, serve as my Chief of Staff in the United States \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, to celebrate these many contributions, but also, to \naddress the path that lies ahead, Nevada Hispanic leaders from Nevada \nwill gather in Washington, D.C. from September 15-17, 1999, for Unidos \npara el Futuro (United for the Future), my National Conference for \nNevada Hispanic Leadership. Armed with the lessons of the past, and \nready to confront the challenges of the future, these members of the \nNevada Hispanic community will have the opportunity to meet with my \ncolleagues in the Senate and the House of Representatives, including \nthe Congressional Hispanic Caucus. I am honored that Energy Secretary \nBill Richardson, the highest ranking Hispanic in President Clinton's \nadministration, will also address the gathering. Furthermore, the group \nwill meet with numerous national Hispanic organizations, as well as \nofficials from the various federal agencies that interact with the \nHispanic community. I am hopeful that the efforts we are undertaking \nwill provide our friends and colleagues in the Hispanic community with \nessential information on a variety of issues, as well as the necessary \ninteraction with those individuals and entities that shape policy. Such \npro-action on our part is imperative in the Senate which, \nunfortunately, is without a Hispanic Member.\n  As elected officials, we must be constantly apprised of the issues \nthat are important to our constituents. Simply put, the priorities of \nthe Hispanic community must be our priorities as well.\n  Mr. President, I rise to recognize and honor the following members of \nNevada's Hispanic community who have joined me in our nation's capital, \nunited for the future:\n  Bob Agonia, Elmira J.

LIGHT, EDITOR OF THE BUFFALO NEWS\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Murray B. Light will end his \ncareer in journalism on September 19th, the 50th anniversary of his \nfirst day at The Buffalo News. Throughout his long and outstanding \ntenure at The News, he has had a profound influence on Buffalo and \nWestern New York. He will be greatly missed.\n\n  Murray and I have been friends for many years. On one occasion, \nduring my first term, Murray was kind enough to loan me his typewriter. \nI have a photo using it. They have long since switched to computers at \nThe News, but I have yet to abandon my typewriter.\n  As The Buffalo News Editor, Murray B. Light has had an honored \ncareer. Stanford Lipsey, The News President and Publisher, said ``The \nresponsibility of editing a daily metropolitan newspaper is enormous. \nIt involves critical and complex decisions made against stressful \ndeadlines. Murray Light never faltered in his courage, principles or \njudgment. He has left his mark on this newspaper and the entire \ncommunity. It has been both stimulating and satisfying to have worked \nwith him these past 20 years.''\n  I have long admired Murray's aggressive editorial style. Nearly 20 \nyears ago, I said that The Buffalo News and The Courier Express \n``succeeded in making a not so simple point to the Congress of the \nUnited States: The leaking of hazardous chemicals at the Love Canal in \nNiagara Falls was not an isolated event but indeed the ominous warning \nof a national epidemic.'' This couldn't have been more right. They made \nthe case for immediate passage of the Superfund Bill in 1980 and many \nmore since then.\n  As I was often a guest of The Buffalo News at the annual Gridiron \ndinner, I had many opportunities to speak with Murray about our common \nconcern of\n\n[[Page S10871]]\n\npreserving Buffalo's architecture and historic buildings. Murray made \nefforts to secure funding for the Darwin Martin House. He also made \noutstanding contributions to save Louis Sullivan's marvelous Guaranty \nBuilding, surely the world's first skyscraper, and to the renovation of \nKleinhans Music Hall. My Buffalo office is in the Guaranty Building. \nSaving it from destruction is one of my greatest achievements as a \nsenator.\n  Murray is a patriot having served in the Army in World War II as part \nof the Pacific force. Thanks to the assistance of the GI Bill of \nRights, he did graduate work at Medill School of Journalism at \nNorthwestern University and earned a master's degree in 1949. He also \nwas a member of the State Judicial Screening Committee for the Fourth \nDepartment and the State Fair Trial Free Press Conference. At the \nrequest of Gov. Mario Cuomo, he served on the New York State Temporary \nCommission on Constitutional Revision in 1994.\n  A native of Brooklyn and a graduate of Brooklyn college, Murray came \nto Buffalo in 1949 as a reporter. While at The Buffalo News, he worked \nas a copy editor, assistant city editor, assistant news editor, swing \neditor, makeup editor and news editor, and managing editor. Thirty \nyears after he began working for The News, Warren E. Buffett named him \neditor and vice president. He became senior vice president in 1983. \nMurray and his wife of 45 years, Joan, have three children.\n  In a letter to Murray, Warren Buffett wrote: ``From both a \nprofessional and a personal standpoint, you are the perfect person to \nbe editor of The Buffalo News. I've always considered myself very lucky \nin having you there when I arrived in 1977.''\n  Mr. President, in this spirit, I ask that Edward Cuddihy's article \nfrom The Buffalo News, be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n       [From The Buffalo News, August 9, 1999]\n\n            Light to Retire as Editor After 50 Years at News\n\n                          (By Edward Cuddihy)\n\n       Buffalo News Editor Murray B. Light, the only editor most \n     of his newsroom staff members have ever worked for in \n     Buffalo, announced Sunday that he will retire Sept. 19, \n     ending an illustrious journalism career at The Buffalo News \n     that spans a half-century.\n       Light, who also is senior vice president of The News, made \n     the announcement ``his way,'' not before a gathering of the \n     public officials and civic leaders he has worked with for the \n     past 30 years, but before about 1,200 fellow workers and \n     their families at an employee appreciation picnic, amid the \n     smell of hot dogs and the sounds of children.\n       Light's announcement came immediately after he was honored \n     by News President and Publisher Stanford Lipsey on the \n     upcoming 50th anniversary of Light's first day at The News. \n     The actual date of that anniversary is Sept. 19, the day \n     Light has chosen as his last day at The News.\n       In brief remarks, Lipsey said of Light: ``The \n     responsibility of editing a daily metropolitan newspaper is \n     enormous. It involves critical and complex decisions made \n     against stressful deadlines. Murray Light never faltered in \n     his courage, principles or judgment.\n       ``He has left his mark on this newspaper and the entire \n     community. It has been both stimulating and satisfying to \n     have worked with him these past 20 years.''\n       Light's newsroom leadership began in 1969, the day this \n     feisty young news editor was named managing editor for news. \n     Since then, he set both the tone of the newspaper and the \n     news agenda for the community.\n       During the past 30 years, Light has been on a first-name \n     basis with governors, senators, congressmen, state \n     legislative leaders, mayors, county executives and anyone \n     else who might have, or wanted to have, an influence on \n     Buffalo and Western New York.\n       Light's three all-consuming concerns have been The Buffalo \n     News, which he recently described to one colleague as ``my \n     life,'' the City of Buffalo, his adopted hometown, and his \n     newsroom staff with whom he agonized over the paper's \n     failures as much as he gloried in its many triumphs.\n       Among those triumphs were the launching of the Sunday News, \n     which he describes as ``the most exhilarating challenge of my \n     entire career''; the creation of the popular weekly \n     entertainment section Gusto; and the development of the \n     Sunrise Edition, which made The News one of the nation's \n     all-day newspapers.\n       Light has been comfortable taking part in every aspect of \n     the newspaper, whether it be his daily attendance at the \n     Editorial Board meetings, where the newspaper's editorial \n     page policy is developed, or his choosing of comics and \n     puzzles for the back pages.\n       No matter what part of the newspaper he dealt with, his \n     news instincts, often initially seen by his colleagues as a \n     quick shot straight from the hip, usually proved impeccable. \n     For example, Light's idea for Gusto initially was rejected by \n     many as impractical and unnecessary. But Light persisted, and \n     a generation later, nearly every metropolitan newspaper in \n     the country has a section like Gusto, which proved to be \n     popular beyond his imagination.\n       Light has been directing the morning and evening news \n     meetings at which the editors decide which stories will be \n     played on the front page since those meetings were initiated \n     at The News 15 years ago. At times, an informal vote is taken \n     on what editors describe as ``a close call,'' but everyone \n     around the table knows that only the single ballot at the \n     head of the table counts.\n       Light, who will be 73 in October, runs the newsroom by the \n     sheer force of his dominant personality. His enthusiasm for \n     every detail, large or small, has been a hallmark of his \n     career. He once told the story of his teen-age job in \n     Brooklyn, operating a machine that inserted three pennies \n     change into cigarette packs for vending machines. ``No job is \n     ever too small to demand your attention,'' he told young \n     editors, adding with a smile that he nearly knocked his \n     finger off when he let his concentration drift for a moment.\n       Only the fourth person to hold the title of editor at this \n     newspaper during the 20th century, Light came to Buffalo and \n     The News as a reporter in 1949. A native of Brooklyn, his \n     first newspaper job was as campus correspondent for the old \n     Brooklyn Eagle while he was earning his bachelor's degree at \n     Brooklyn College.\n       He enlisted in the Army and was part of the force in the \n     Pacific being readied for an invasion of Japan, a force that \n     this country never needed to utilize. After his return, he \n     did graduate work at Medill School of Journalism at \n     Northwestern University under the GI Bill of Rights and \n     earned a master's degree in 1949.\n       During his brief stint as a copy editor at the old New York \n     World-Telegram, Light was hired by the legendary editor of \n     The News, Alfred H. Kirchhofer, a man whom Light quotes to \n     this day with the degree of respect and loyalty he has \n     expected from his employees. Light worked as a copy editor, \n     assistant city editor, assistant news editor, swing editor, \n     makeup editor and news editor before being named managing \n     editor for news in June 1969.\n       In October 1979, Light was named editor and vice president, \n     and in 1983, he was named senior vice president.\n       Light recalls that in 1977, when investor Warren E. Buffett \n     purchased The News, the amiable billionaire from Omaha, Neb., \n     told Light he would never interfere in newsroom operations.\n       ``And to this day, he has lived up to that pledge one \n     hundred percent,'' Light said.\n       Among his memorabilia of 50 years is a carefully folded \n     letter Light received from the chairman of The Buffalo News \n     just prior to Light's 70th birthday.\n       Buffett wrote: ``From both a professional and a personal \n     standpoint, you are the perfect person to be editor of The \n     Buffalo News. I've always considered myself very lucky in \n     having you there when I arrived in 1977.''\n       During Light's watch as managing editor and editor, he saw \n     the transformation of American newsrooms from manual \n     typewriters to word processors, and in the mid-80s, when many \n     of his younger colleagues were balking at giving up their \n     typewriters for computers, Light insisted that he be among \n     the first to turn in his trusty Royal for the new invention.\n       Light has been characterized as an editor right out of \n     ``The Front Page,'' a hard-nosed, often irreverent newsman, \n     hell-bent at getting the big story on the press. He has lived \n     through tumultuous change in American journalism, but he has \n     not altered his fundamental views on a newspaper's \n     relationship with its readers.\n       Speaking to a group of advertising executives 20 years ago, \n     Light summed up those views when he said:\n       ``The News will not sensationalize to create a headline. We \n     will not, through reference or emphasis, play to the emotions \n     of a segment of our readership and in the process denigrate, \n     dismay or demolish the reputation of a group--whether it be \n     civic, political or ethnic * * *\n       ``We will not use our news columns to reinforce and/or \n     espouse the causes of our editorial page. The News wants to \n     sell newspapers * * * but we will not attempt to do so by \n     yielding to expediency and destroying our news integrity.''\n       In January 1979, Light began writing a column, ``Your \n     Newspaper,'' in which he shared his views on the newspaper \n     and its staff with the readers. Since then, he has written \n     hundreds of such columns, which he keeps in a cardboard box \n     in his office. Light said he plans to write a column for The \n     News Sunday Viewpoints Section, starting this fall.\n       Light held offices and holds membership in a large number \n     of professional organizations, including past president of \n     the New York State Society of Newspaper Editors.\n       He also has been honored by scores of business, civic, \n     social and charitable organizations. Never a man to court \n     personal honors, one of his most treasured accomplishments \n     was to be chosen by his peers to be part of the nominating \n     jury for journalism's coveted Pulitzer Prizes, a post he held \n     in 1990 and 1991.\n       Light served on the advisory council to the journalism \n     department at St. Bonaventure University and has served on \n     the Community Advisory Council of the University at Buffalo.\n       He is a member of the American Society of Newspaper Editors \n     and the Associated Press\n\n[[Page S10872]]\n\n     Managing Editors Association. He also was a member of the \n     State Judicial Screening Committee for the Fourth Department \n     and the State Fair Trial Free Press Conference. Gov. Mario \n     Cuomo appointed him to the New York State Temporary \n     Commission on Constitutional Revision in 1994.\n       A staunch supporter of the City of Buffalo, Light and his \n     wife of 45 years, Joan, moved from suburban Amherst in the \n     1970s to a home near the city's Allentown section and most \n     recently to a condominium in the Waterfront Village \n     community. Joan recently retired as vice president of Sovran \n     Self Storage, Williamsville.\n       The Lights have three children. Lee, a registered nurse \n     with the Buffalo Red Cross Chapter; Laura, a medieval scholar \n     on the Harvard University faculty; and Jeffrey, deputy editor \n     of the Orange County (Calif.) Register.\n       Light seeks to quench his life-long thirst for knowledge \n     through reading. He recently told his colleagues, without as \n     much as raising an eyebrow, that he reads ``about a hundred \n     books a year, give or take a few,'' in addition to \n     newspapers, news magazines and professional journals.\n       In his younger years, Light would be hard-pressed to pass \n     up a poker game, and he and Joan were regulars on the tennis \n     court.\n       Just 19 years ago, Light was quoted as insisting he could \n     never share his wife's fondness for golf. But in recent \n     years, the Lights have been regulars on the golf course at \n     Wanakah Country Club, where they are members. And this \n     summer, the Lights were spectators at the British Open in \n     Carnoustie, Scotland.\n       Murray B. Light has always had the ability to alter his \n     view in the face of a persuasive argument made by someone he \n     trusts--even an argument about golf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/14/senate-section/article/S10872-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONGRATULATING THE BROWNS AND THE CARSONS ON THE BIRTHS OF THEIR \n                                CHILDREN\n\n Mr. ALLARD.

ELLINGSWORTH\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nDelaware's top police officer--the Superintendent of the Delaware State \nPolice, Colonel Alan D. Ellingsworth.\n  After one of the most distinguished careers in Delaware law \nenforcement history, Colonel Ellingsworth has retired following 24 \nyears of service with the Delaware State Police. His life as a police \nofficer began on August 1, 1975, when he was assigned as a road trooper \nat Troop 6 in Prices Corner. Moving up the ranks quickly, he worked in \nevery major unit, including criminal investigations, as the officer-in-\ncharge of the homicide unit and as a Troop Commander.\n  In May, 1994, he was promoted to Superintendent, where he has been a \ntrue leader for the citizens of Delaware, and a true partner and friend \nto me.\n  Mr. President, I want to mention something very near and dear to my \nheart, the 1994 Crime Law that I authored--it became a reality in \nDelaware thanks to Colonel Alan Ellingsworth. Under his leadership, the \nranks of the Delaware State Police increased 10 percent, with a force \nof 525 officers today. With funding from the Crime Law, he not only put \n60 more police officers on our streets--he established effective \n``Community Policing'' units in Delaware's toughest neighborhoods. He \npersonally tackled the drug problem in rural parts of Sussex and Kent \nCounties, creating new units to go into these poorer areas so that \nadult residents and their children knew the Delaware State Police were \ntheir friends and partners in ``taking back their neighborhoods.'' And \nhe sent a strong message to drug dealers and criminals--get out and \nstay out. His officers arrested the drug dealers and users, and helped \ndirect the neighborhood kids to Boys and Girls Clubs and other \nconstructive, supervised activities. I've seen these officers at work \nin these communities--it is remarkable how residents trust them. \nEqually impressive are the results.\n  His strategy has worked. Crime in Delaware is down 12 percent.\n  But there's much more to his story. In another of his initiatives, he \nused Crime Law grants to put non-uniform police in every high school as \nYouth Resource Officers. Again, students get the message that, one, \nviolence, bullying, drugs, gangs and guns will not be tolerated; and \nsecond, police are role models, coaches and mentors.\n  Under Colonel Ellingsworth, the Delaware State Police have \nestablished Community Police sub-stations in shopping malls, local \ncommunities--even in a converted laundry room in an apartment complex \nin Georgetown, Delaware. The goal and message are simple: police need \nto be on the beat to help prevent and readily respond to crime.\n  Colonel Ellingsworth's legacy to the Delaware State Police is even \ndeeper than his accomplishments in reducing crime. The Delaware Crime \nStatistical Center is now state-of-the-art. The State's crime data is \nlinked with the National Crime Information Center. Delaware's Sex \nOffender Registry was created under his watch and with his persistent \ndoggedness that Delaware get this system implemented efficiently and \neffectively.\n  During his tenure, Colonel Ellingsworth presided over the memorable \n75th Anniversary of the Delaware State Police and successfully pursued \nthe fund-raising, building and dedication of the new Delaware State \nPolice Museum.\n  During his career, Colonel Ellingsworth has received numerous awards \nand commendations, including Trooper of the Year in 1979 and 1985-- In \nthe history of the Delaware State Police, he is the only officer who \nhas been named Trooper of the Year twice. He also has received three \nSuperintendent's Citations, and he was selected as the Crime Stoppers' \nDetective of the Year.\n  He is a 1988 graduate of the FBI's National Academy, and a 1987 \ngraduate of the Pennsylvania State University Police Executive \nDevelopment Institute.\n  As we like to say in Delaware, Colonel Ellingsworth is ``home \ngrown.'' He was born in Sussex County, a 1972 graduate of Sussex \nCentral High School, received his bachelor and master's degrees from \nWilmington College, and now lives in Bear with his wife Ann Marie and \ntheir three daughters, Amanda, Lauren and Megan.\n  Mr. President, it is my great privilege to honor Colonel Ellingsworth \non his career as Delaware's top police officer. His officers are the \nfirst to say he has served as a real ``trooper's trooper.'' He has been \nan officer who is tough as nails when solving a heinous crime, yet he \nalways could be counted on as a sensitive shoulder of support to \nfamilies of officers killed or injured in the line of duty. I will miss \nhis counsel and advice, and I wish him and his family Godspeed, good \nhealth and good fortune in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/14/senate-section/article/S10872-3", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
