Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning \nbusiness until 6:45 p.m., with Senators speaking for up to 10 minutes \neach. A vote on a continuing resolution that funds the Government for \nanother day will occur at approximately 6:45 p.m. if the papers have \nbeen received from the House. We will try, once again, to see if we can \nget a vote before that time. The House, I believe, goes in at 6, so we \nprobably will not have the papers before 6:45. We will see if we can go \nahead and arrange for a vote to occur before that time but hopefully no \nlater than 6:45. Senators will be updated throughout the afternoon's \nsession.\n  By previous order, the Senate will convene on Monday at 5 p.m. to \nconsider another continuing resolution. That vote will occur at 7 p.m. \nand will be the first vote of the day. I might say that there have been \nmeetings with the appropriate Members of Congress and the \nadministration on Saturday. There have been ideas exchanged--are being \nexchanged even now--that are being developed. I think we are very \nclose, even though it is never over until we get an agreement on the \nfinal four or five issues that are still in play.\n  I think it would be wise for the Senate, the House--the Congress--and \nthe administration to complete their work as soon as possible so that \nwe can leave to be with our constituents and attend to our duties back \nin our respective States. But it is more important that we look after \nthe people's business first. We will continue, as we have been now, \nuntil an agreement can be worked out. We are prepared to exchange some \nsuggestions today, and hopefully we will get some additional \ninformation later on this afternoon.\n  It is still my hope that perhaps by Tuesday we could have the final \ntwo or three votes that would be required. That would mean the Labor-\nHHS appropriations bill, in whatever final form it might be, would have \nto be filed not later than Monday night. So we would need to have time, \nof course, for that to be filed and printed and for Senators to have a \nchance to review it. I presume that would then mean that the vote, if \nit came on Tuesday, would be late on Tuesday. But I will confer with \nSenator Reid--we were just talking about it--and with Senator Daschle \nto make sure we give Senators the maximum amount of notification when \nthose substantive recorded votes might occur.\n  Again, I do not want to give the impression it is just about to be \ndone, but that would be our fervent hope. We will give as much advance \nnotice as possible for a final vote on the tax relief package, and also \nthe Labor-HHS appropriations bill, and bankruptcy. I expect to file \ncloture on the bankruptcy bill today or tomorrow, depending on what \nmight be happening with the schedule.\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I see Senator Reid is here. Would the \nSenator like me to yield to him?\n  Mr. REID. For a brief statement.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I hope the optimism I hear in the leader's voice is well \nfounded. I hope so. I think we have all worked hard and should wrap \nthis up. I say to the leader, however, I hope today we follow daylight \nsavings time, even though that is not what we have shown in the Senate. \nAs you can see, it is really 5 after 4, not 5 after 5, as the Senate \nclock shows us. So we will have to make sure we go by the real time and \nnot by what is shown in the Senate Chamber.\n  Mr. LOTT. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. Is that reasonable?\n  Mr. LOTT. That certainly is reasonable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/29/senate-section/article/S11318-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI FOOTBALL TEAM\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I thought this time was an opportunity of \nwhich I could take advantage to talk about something we all experienced \nthis morning when we awakened here on the east coast. That was the \nchill of fall in the air.\n  I think most of us had failed to recognize that we were late into \nOctober because the weather has been so mild and so generally warm. But \nwe are really at the threshold of winter, and as winter comes, so does \ncold weather. And as cold weather comes, the average American reaches \nto the thermostat on the wall of his or her home and begins to turn it \nup.\n  This fall, as that experience occurs, something else is going to \nhappen in America that will be very dramatic, and that will be the \nturning up of the heating bill because, whether it is electricity or \noil for space heating, the cost of those commodities in the average \nAmerican's household budget has increased dramatically.\n  In fact, in the Northeast, where home heating oil for space heat is a \nmajor commodity, those costs will have better than doubled since last \nyear and could go even higher this year as the amount of supplies for \nthose needs continues to not increase at the rate of demand.\n  Why has this happened? Why are we at the threshold of an energy \ncrisis in this country that we have not experienced in a long, long \nwhile?\n  In nearly every part of the energy consumer basket--be it \nelectricity, or home heating oil, or automobile gasoline, or diesel for \nour truck transportation, or fuel for the great turbines of the jet \nengines that fly Americans across America--there is no surplus today.\n  That is a historic fact. This country was built on the abundance of \nenergy. Our successes in our economy have always been the result of \nhaving the necessary energy to accomplish what we wanted. It was always \none of the least-cost items in that accumulation of costs that made up \nthe price to the consumer of a product on the market shelf. That is no \nlonger the case.\n  For the next few moments, I would like to once again address, as have \nI and other Senators for the last year and a half, the energy crisis we \nare now into and why we are there.\n  Largely, it gained our attention about a year ago when we became \naware that the members of the OPEC countries were going to move the \nprice of oil from about $10 a barrel to $28-$30 a barrel. It had been \nselling for around $10 in the world spot market, and it was beginning \nto increase because they were beginning to decrease their production.\n  Admittedly, no one was making money at $10 a barrel. Whether it is \noil of the Middle East or oil in Texas or Oklahoma or on the overthrust \nbelt of the west in Colorado and Wyoming, oil is not profitable at $10 \na barrel simply because of the cost of production and compliance, \nespecially in this country, with environmental rules and regulations. \nSomewhere at $17 to $20 a barrel\n\n[[Page S11319]]\n\nis where it begins to be profitable. So for a long time, for the last \nseveral years, we were operating on less-than-profitable oil for at \nleast the producers.\n  For the consumer, it was a bonus. I remember just a year ago, across \nthe Potomac in Northern Virginia, I bought regular gasoline for 90 \ncents a gallon. Today, one is going to pay at least $1.60 to $1.75, \nmaybe even more than that, depending on your location and the location \nof the particular service station. That is a dramatic increase. That is \na 110-120 percent increase. So that 90-cent gas, while there was a bit \nof a price war going on out in Northern Virginia at the time, was still \nbased on $10-a-barrel oil.\n  We know that has changed. We saw it change. Now we see the Arab \nnations receiving anywhere from $28 to $30, $31, $32, $33 a barrel for \ntheir crude oil. That all translates into a much greater cost at the \npump to the consumer, but it also translates into a variety of other \nthings.\n  As we know, the petrochemical industry of this country is involved in \nalmost all we do and sometimes a lot of what we wear because of the \nbyproducts of the petrochemical industry, be it plastics or nylon or a \ncombination of consumer goods. Slowly but surely, the increased cost of \nthose byproducts is beginning to roll across the American economy.\n  The other evening I did a conference call in Idaho with a group of \nfarmers. They happened to be sugar beet farmers and potato farmers. The \nprice of potatoes is well below break even this year. It has been for 3 \nyears. Many of those farmers will not make money again this year, and \nthey are very frustrated. Some of them will lose their farms. It is \nalso true in sugar beets, with the price of sugar at near an all-time \nlow.\n  What they were most concerned about was their energy costs. As we all \nknow, agriculture is a large consumer of energy. It is an intensive \nindustry. Those large tractors and trucks used in the process of \nfarming all consume large quantities of energy. The pesticides, \ninsecticides, herbicides are all hydrocarbon or petrochemical based. \nAll of their costs have started going up. Fertilizer costs will nearly \ndouble this year as a direct result of energy costs because when you \nare dealing with phosphates and phosphate fertilizers, huge volumes of \nenergy are used to transform those from the rock to the fertilizer \nproduct that ultimately goes to the ground that the farmer uses.\n  All of those costs are going up, and all of them are based on one \nsimple fact; that in this economy, the energy costs to the consumer \nhave nearly doubled in just about a year. So the farmers, while their \nprices were at an all-time low, were talking to me about energy. What \nis this country going to do? What is this administration going to do. \nWhat is this Congress going to do about an energy policy that would \nultimately begin to bring those prices down. They were dramatically \nconcerned.\n\n  When the Congress gets back in January and February, we are going to \nhear a hue and cry coming out of the Northeast in relation to the cost \nof space heat and home heating oil, even though we have tried to deal \nwith that in short-term measures. But those are some of the \ncircumstances in which we are involved.\n  The consumer is still going to the pump, and they are still filling \nup their vehicles. In most instances, consumers are working. They all \nhave good jobs at this time. We are at nearly full employment. Nobody \nhas really stopped to factor in that over the course of a year, they \nare going to be paying more than $300, $400, sometimes $500 out of \ntheir household budget for their energy costs than they did a year ago. \nBut it will be the single highest increase in relation to cost over a \n12-month period of any one item the American consumer will buy this \nyear. It will be their energy. Never in the history of this country has \nenergy gone up that fast for that sustained period of time and affected \nall segments of the economy.\n  Those are some of the realities we are facing. Let me, for a few \nmoments, explore why it has all happened. We now import about 56 \npercent of our supply of crude oil. That has gone up very dramatically \nover the last few years. In 1975, when we established the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, we were 36-percent dependent on foreign oil. The \npolitical rhetoric at that time--I was not here; the Presiding Officer \nwas not here--was loud and boisterous: Never again will America be \ndependent on foreign sources of oil; we will establish a Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve in case of a national or an international crisis. \nNever will we have to be held hostage to the attitudes or the political \nconcerns of a small group of Arab nations known as OPEC.\n  That was 1975 when we were 36-percent dependent. So we established \nSPR and we put hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in a salt dome \ndown in Louisiana as a special reserve to be used in an international \nor national emergency where supply would be disrupted.\n  Today, we are 58-percent dependent on foreign oil, not 36-percent \ndependent.\n  I have run my 10 minutes and there are others here to speak. I ask \nunanimous consent to continue for 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. We have not heard this administration in any way talk \nabout the need to change things very much. Why is that the case? Why \nare we now at the threshold I have described?\n  The large reason is that for the last 8 years, during a time when \nthis dependency on foreign oil has skyrocketed, we have had no energy \npolicy coming from the Clinton-Gore administration. In fact, in almost \nevery instance, they have, by rule and regulation or by process slowed \ndown production in our fundamental sources of energy, be it domestic \ncrude production, down 14 percent over the last decade; be it any \nexploration because of new environmental regulations; the inability to \nget out on the land and explore, even though our oil companies have the \nhighest environmental standards to protect the land and to protect the \nenvironment around any new discoveries and developments.\n  Out in my State of Idaho and in the Pacific Northwest, this \nadministration is talking about taking down four very large hydrodams. \nThey believe that by doing so and turning the Snake and the Columbia \nRivers back to a more natural flow, they could actually improve \nfisheries. Somebody says: It is only 5 percent of the supply.\n  Well, 5 percent of the supply of that region from those four dams \ngenerates enough electricity for the entire city of Seattle, WA--again, \nanother attitude as to why we are not producing this and solving this \nproblem but simply getting more deeply into this problem.\n  Well, there are a lot of other reasons, and my time is short. But as \na result of all of those problems and no solution coming from the \nadministration--well, they did have one solution. They sent Bill \nRichardson, the Secretary of Energy, to the Middle East, and he had in \nhis briefcase a tin cup. He got it out and he held out his tin cup and \nhe said to the Arab Emirate oil nations: Please fill up my cup; please \nturn your valves on. You see, we have no energy policy. You are our \nsupplier. We are victim to your political and economic whims.\n  That has been the energy policy of the Clinton administration. That \nis the only real thing they have attempted to do, other than the \npolitically charged action to open the SPR and bring about 30 million \nbarrels of oil out of there to somehow change the price and the supply. \nOf course, we have held several hearings on that and, no, that hasn't \nhappened. But this year, I, Senator Frank Murkowski, Trent Lott, and \nmany others introduced the National Energy Security Act of 2000, S. \n2575. We brought it to the floor. It is a major, new effort to bring \nour dependency on foreign oil at or below 50 percent, to encourage and \nmaximize utilization of alternative fuels and renewable energy and \nincreased domestic supply of not only oil but gas production, because \nnatural gas has better than doubled in price in less than a year.\n  Yet this administration sits happily by, as if nothing were \noccurring, knowing very clearly, but not wanting to talk very loudly in \nthis political season, that their energy policy will drive costs to the \nconsuming public to a higher rate than ever in the history of our \ncountry. Their only real good argument is that they did it all in the \nname of the environment.\n  In closing, let me talk about the environment we are about to \nexperience.\n\n[[Page S11320]]\n\n It is going to be a cold environment this winter. That is a normal \nenvironment then. When elderly people and poor people have to make \nchoices this winter between food and medicine and heat, that is not a \nvery good environment. We will do all we can here to supply them with \nalternative resources to hold down their heating bills, but there is \none remaining fundamental fact about why they must make those choices \nin this environment. We have lived for 8 years without an energy policy \ncoming from this administration, except one--the tin cup in the hand of \nBill Richardson--and a policy that somehow the production of \nhydrocarbons in our country was environmentally damaging. I think most \nof us know that is no longer true today.\n  So I thought as I awoke this morning and felt the cool in the air and \nturned up the thermostat on the wall, while I may be able to afford my \nheating bill this winter, I know a good many people won't be able to \nafford theirs. That is a tragedy in this country that should not have \nto happen--a country that has always been so wise to allow the \nmarketplace to provide one of the great abundances that we have always \nhad that has set our Nation apart from all others, in our ability to \nproduce and succeed, and that was an abundant supply of energy.\n  In 8 short years, that abundant supply has dwindled to a point where \nwe really have no surpluses at all today. The average demand for growth \nin energy goes up 1.4 percent in our country on an annualized basis, \nand we have only increased production by 0.4 percent in the last 8 \nyears--in all segments of energy. That tells you one thing very \nclearly. Somebody has failed along the way, and I must tell you, \nserving on the Energy Committee and studying and examining this issue \nvery thoroughly over the last several years, I know who has failed. It \nis the Clinton-Gore administration. They failed to recognize the \nreality of the marketplace, the reality of the world production supply, \nand disallowing us from producing our way out of it.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/29/senate-section/article/S11320-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for my friend \nfrom Idaho. We served together in the House, and we have worked \ntogether many years on public resources issues dealing with the West. I \ndon't mean to be disagreeable, but on this issue we simply disagree. I \nam going to take a couple of minutes because I have told the Senators \nfrom Ohio and Iowa they can speak next.\n  The oil problem started in the Republican administration; it \ncertainly wasn't the fault of the Republican administration. There was \nan embargo by the OPEC nations. Following that, there was an bipartisan \neffort to change things. There were incentives to develop oil shale, do \nalternative energy with wind and solar and geothermal. But with the oil \nglut that came about, all of that was taken away. Some of the research \ninvolving alternative energy was simply not renewed by Congress. That \nis too bad.\n  During the years of the Clinton-Gore administration, they have tried \nvery hard every year that I have served on committees and subcommittees \nwith jurisdiction to deal with energy matters. They have tried every \nyear--especially in the appropriations process--to get more money for \ndevelopment of alternative energy sources. They have been stymied every \ntime.\n  We should also understand that if we could reduce the consumption of \nfuel in America--for example, if we had more fuel-efficient cars and if \nwe had automobiles that were 3 miles per gallon more efficient, we \nwould save a million barrels of oil a day.\n  There are things we need to do here. We need to join in a bipartisan \neffort, not a finger-pointing effort, to develop energy policy in this \ncountry. None of us wants to be dependent on foreign oil. In fact, with \nthe oil being so cheap, there was no incentive for us to do it. \nCongress failed, and it wasn't simply that we didn't meet what the \nadministration wanted. Certainly, this legislation has been suggested \nby my friend from Idaho, has as its centerpiece oil development in \nANWR, the pristine Arctic wilderness, which we are not going to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/29/senate-section/article/S11320-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11320-S11322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TAX LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last week, we started to debate a tax \nbill and it had to be brought down because there wasn't consent to move \nahead on it. Before we adjourn and go home, hopefully, we will pass a \ntax bill. But there are a lot of provisions in that bill that are very \ngood; common sense dictates them; and a lot of these are very \nbipartisan. So the President has threatened to veto the tax bill. I \nwant to bring up some of these issues and ask the President why he \nwould veto something as good as these provisions, where there is \nbipartisan consensus that we ought to pass them.\n  Obviously, this bill doesn't contain everything I would like to see \nin it as a Member of the Senate. As a member of the Finance Committee, \nwe have a chance to be on the ground floor of the drafting of the \nlegislation coming out of that committee. On the other hand, no one \nperson, even a member of the committee, can get everything he wants in \nthe bill. There are even some things in this bill that I don't like, \nbut on balance it will do a lot of good for a lot of people. Therefore, \nI think it should be enacted.\n  To begin with, the bill contains a number of provisions I authored or \ncoauthored with some colleagues and these are the bipartisan provisions \nthat I am thinking about. For instance, on the issue of pensions, I \nworked very closely with Senator Graham of Florida--several critical \npension provisions. As we anticipate the upcoming retirement of the \nbaby boomers, we are always astonished at how much it is going to cost \nduring their retirement. Retirement is expensive, not only due to \nrising life expectancy but also because inflation and taxes must be \nfactored into the cost of retirement.\n  We keep insisting that baby boomers--now 10 years away from their \nretirement--must do more to prepare for that retirement. How can they \ndo that if we don't give them the tools they need? This bill has a lot \nto do with that because it would make small but significant steps to \nimprove the ability of baby boomers and subsequent generations to \nprepare for retirement. This bill will increase retirement savings and \nthe national savings rates by allowing workers to save more in their \npension plan or in their individual retirement account.\n  How can the President find disagreement on that point--the necessity \nof having better pension systems, the necessity for updating the \nindividual retirement accounts so more can be saved in those accounts \nand so more people can be encouraged to save in those accounts?\n  Our bill would restore section 415 limits for pension contributions \ncloser to--not all the way, I am sorry to say--where they were before \nthe 1993 tax increase bill was passed.\n  You remember that 1993 tax increase bill? As Senator Moynihan said on \nthe floor of the Senate, it was the largest tax increase in the history \nof the world after Bob Dole said it was the largest increase in the \nhistory of the country.\n  That was a pretty significant tax increase in 1993. You remember that \nit passed on the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Gore as he sat \nright there in the chair. He cast the tie-breaking vote to pass a tax \nbill that most all Republicans thought was bad for the country. Even \nsome Democrats thought it was bad for the country. When Republicans \nwere in the minority, it would have still died on a 49-to-49 vote--\nexcept for the tie-breaking vote of the Vice President.\n  This bill will restore some of the bad aspects that the 1993 tax bill \nhad on pensions contributions with these 415 limits. This bill \nincreases existing IRA contribution limits because under this bill \nAmericans would be able to contribute $5,000 annually. That is an \nincrease up from the current $2,000 maximum contribution. This IRA \nlimit has not been increased in the 18 years since the last time it was \neffective.\n  For workers without a pension, a pretax individual retirement account \nis one of the best ways they can save for retirement. This limit is \nbeing increased for traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs.\n\n[[Page S11321]]\n\n  Why would the President want to veto that for people who don't have \nanything other than individual retirement accounts with the present \n$2,000 limit? You can see what has happened to that $2,000 limit \nbecause of inflation. After 18 years, it is not anywhere near the \nincentive for savings that it was in 1982.\n  Increasing it to $5,000 would be a tremendous incentive for people \nwho don't have pensions to save on their own for retirement, in \naddition to a baby boom generation that is not going to get out of \nSocial Security as much as my generation will get out of Social \nSecurity when they retire.\n  Consequently, that helps make up for some of the shortcomings of the \nSocial Security surplus for the baby boom generation.\n  Further, the bill encourages more people to save through an IRA by \naccelerating the scheduled increases in IRA income eligibility \nrequirements. Individuals making up to $50,000 and couples making up to \n$80,000 could participate in an IRA. And the bill allows catch-up \ncontributions for IRAs of an additional $1,500 for those age 50 or \nover.\n  That will give people an opportunity who have been hit by the \ninflation-lessening value of the $2,000 individual retirement account \nnow that they are 50 and over to put aside an additional $1,500 to make \nup for some of the shortcomings of Congress not keeping the $2,000 \nlimit adjusted for inflation.\n  Why would the President want to veto a bill that gives people who are \nsaving an opportunity to make up for some of the shortcomings of \nCongress over the last 18 years, or even the negative impact of the \n1993 tax bill on some of these pension provisions?\n  This bill also encourages small businesses to start and maintain \npension plans.\n  One of the problems with the pension law is that there is tremendous \ndiscouragement for companies with under 100 employees to go to the \nexpense of setting up a pension plan. For employers with over 100 \nemployees and with the overhead that companies such as that have, it is \nnot such a problem. You find larger corporations have pension plans--\nnot small businesses.\n  The provisions encouraging expansion of coverage are vital and \noverdue improvements in pension law.\n  I will give you an example. The bill modifies the top-heavy rules \nwhich only apply to small businesses. The top-heavy rules have been \nrightly criticized because they place burdens on small business pension \nplans. Those same requirements are not applicable to big business. The \ntop-heavy rules make sponsoring a pension plan expensive, complicated, \nand out of reach for many small employers. In fact, the ERISA Advisory \nCouncil in this administration even supported the outright repeal of \nthese top-heavy rules.\n  This bill does not repeal the top-heavy rules, as much as we should, \naccording to the Advisory Council's recommendation. It simply modifies \nthe most onerous aspects of the rules to make having a plan more \nattractive for small firms.\n  The bill also reduces plan costs and PBGC premiums for small \nbusinesses and eases administrative burdens by streamlining onerous \npension regulations. These changes help to make the experience of \nmaintaining a plan less difficult for small companies. Further, the \nbill simplifies annual reporting requirements, eliminates IRS user fees \nfor new plans. These provisions encourage small businesses to provide \npension coverage. When small businesses start up new plans, American \nworkers win!\n  The bill contains many provisions which will help rank and file \nworkers specifically.\n  For example, this bill enables workers aged 50 and over to make so-\ncalled catch up contributions to their retirement plan.\n  That may sound like something that is new and we shouldn't do. But we \nallow State and local government workers to make these catchup \ncontributions under current law if they are within 3 years of \nretirement.\n  I know of no reason why we should not make the benefit of catchup \ncontributions available to all workers--not just for those of State and \nlocal governments. We would do so in this bill for workers in for-\nprofit businesses and also not-for-profit businesses.\n  Unfortunately, this bill will not allow workers who make $80,000 or \nmore to make these ``catchup'' contributions despite the fact there is \nnot such an $80,000 limit on the current law for State and local \nemployees.\n  This is a further inequitable situation--something we give State and \nlocal government employees but we don't give employees in the private \nsector. We make up some of that in this legislation but not 100 \npercent, I am sorry to say. I regret that the bill made this \nrestriction necessary because of negotiations that were going on \nbetween the House and Senate.\n  The bill reduces the vesting period for receipt of the employer's \nmatching contribution and defined contribution plans--such as a \n401(k)--from 5 years to 3. Make no mistake about it; this is a huge \nhelp to many workers. This will particularly help women, maybe because \nof taking care of an elderly relation, or maybe to start a family or \nwomen who are in and out of the workforce or maybe even in some cases \nmen who are in and out of the workforce, but they are more apt to be \nwomen.\n  This will give them an opportunity to enhance their match so they can \nmake up for lost time because of not being in the workforce.\n  This bill makes another important change to law that will help low- \nand modest-income workers. The bill repeals the 25 percent of \ncompensation limit on savings and defined contribution plans.\n  That is a savings barrier that frustrates those of modest income. \nMost workers in this Nation will be saving through section 401(k) plans \nor section 403(b) plans or section 457 deferred compensation plans. In \na 401(k) plan, for example, the limit for saving is 25 percent of \ncompensation or a maximum of $10,500. Our bill repeals the 25 percent \nof compensation for the benefit of low and modestly paid workers who \ncould be very thrifty people but are prohibited from saving more. They \nmay want to sacrifice during their work years to have a better quality \nof life in retirement, but the present limit of 25 percent will keep \nthem from doing that. We ought to make it possible for people who want \nto look ahead to do more for enhancing their retirement and have more \nsavings for that retirement to be able to do it. This legislation does \nthat.\n  I don't know why the President wants to veto such good provisions for \nlow- and modest-pay workers. In Iowa and much of the Midwest, people \nare not only thrifty but they are very frugal. Let them save their \nmoney if they want to; that money belongs to them, not to the \ngovernment.\n  The bill also greatly enhances pension portability. Because of these \nprovisions, workers will be able to take their pension money with them \nwhen they leave one job to go to another job. Their retirement plan \ncontributions will not be stuck in the plan of their previous employer. \nWhen more of those matching contributions are vested as I just \nmentioned a minute ago, a larger account can be rolled over to an IRA \nand to the retirement savings plan of a subsequent employer, regardless \nof whether the employer is for profit, not for profit, or a government \nemployer.\n  Under current law, you can't make those rollovers. The pension \nportability provisions of this bill are a great way to reduce pension \nplan leakage. The issue of leakage is real, and I hope we get to \nexamine it in more detail next year and even improve it more than this \npresent legislation does.\n  The business also improves pension funding so benefits will be more \nsecure over the long term. Good pension funding is one of the very \nfoundations of the ERISA law. Most plans are well funded but some are \nnot funded properly at all. We need to be taking a closer look at the \nunderfunded plans and shine the spotlight on them.\n  I want to look at the reasons why some plans have not been better \nfunded, and I hope to look at the status of the underfunded plans in \ngreater detail next year.\n  Finally, I take note for my colleagues and cosponsors that this bill \ndoes not include everything I would have liked, and I hope we will be \nable to do more for pensions according to what Senator Graham of \nFlorida and I suggested in our legislation, which had many cosponsors.\n  When all is said and done, there are a lot of good provisions in this \nbill, particularly those that deal with women who are in and out of the \nworkplace so\n\n[[Page S11322]]\n\nthey can make up lost time on their pensions if they want to pay more \ninto it. It does an awful lot for low- and medium-paid employees so \nthat they can make up for the fact, if they want to save more for \nretirement, that the present 25-percent limit doesn't allow them to do \nthat.\n  The bottom line is, why would any President want to veto such a good \nbill?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is the day the Lord has made; let \nus rejoice and be glad. This is Sunday, when it is the Sabbath for \nmillions of Americans. Many of my colleagues have explained why we are \nhere today, but I hope this is the last Sunday that the Senate, the \nU.S. Congress, is in session unless it is for a crisis of national or \ninternational concern. I hope this is the last Sunday that we would be \nhere for anything but that.\n  Next Tuesday, the citizens of this nation will go to the polls and \nelect the next president of the United States. One of the first \nchallenges that the new president will face is the need to recapture \nwhat has been lost for a generation of Americans: trust in the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The American people used to believe in the competence of the Federal \nGovernment to provide services and meet this nation's needs in a \nvariety of ways. Unfortunately, in too many instances, this is not \nhappening. Today, the Federal Government is held out as a source of \nscorn and ridicule.\n  The fact of the matter is that the Federal Government has brought \nmost of this on itself through a gross inattention to management.\n  In 1993, Vice President Gore launched his ``Reinventing Government'' \ninitiative. Purported to make government ``work better and cost less,'' \nit had every intention to turn the diminished reputation of the Federal \nGovernment around.\n  However, this initiative will be remembered not for its modest \naccomplishments, but for missed opportunities. It has rejected bold \nefforts to reform Federal programs and personnel issues, and actually \ncontributed to the growing human capital crisis that will be a major \nheadache of the next administration.\n  It will be one of the most formidable tasks of the next \nadministration.\n  As we have all seen, the Vice President is trying to run away from \nthe label of being for ``Big Government.'' In recent remarks in \nArkansas, and in the presidential debates, he pointed to Reinventing \nGovernment as proof that he favors small government.\n  He claims credit for shrinking the Federal Government by 300,000 \npositions. In the third Presidential debate held earlier this month, \nthe Vice President boasted that, due to his efforts, the Federal \nGovernment is ``now the smallest that it has been since . . . John \nKennedy's administration.''\n  The Vice President's record of reinventing government is second only \nto his record of inventing the Internet for genuine achievement and \naccuracy.\n  The truth is: more than 450,000 positions have been removed from the \nFederal Government since January 1993, not 300,000 as the Vice \nPresident claims. However, his offense lies not just in the fuzzy math \nbut also in taking credit for reductions where he does not deserve it.\n  More than 290,000 of the personnel cuts that were made--64 percent of \nthe total--came from the departments of Defense and Energy. These cuts \nwere made at the end of the Cold War in the resulting Pentagon budget \nreductions, as well as through four rounds of military base closings.\n  My colleagues should be aware that this process began before the \nadvent of the Clinton-Gore administration and existed independently of \nthe Reinventing Government initiative.\n  Other significant personnel reductions were also independent of \nReinventing Government, including 15,000 employees of the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation who were downsized at the end of the \nsavings and loan crisis, and 8,500 employees of the Panama Canal \nCommission--now just a force of seven after the canal's hand off to \nPanama.\n  In truth, most of the non-defense positions discussed by the Vice \nPresident have not been eliminated, but merely transferred to the \nprivate sector through Federal contracts and Federal mandates. Paul \nLight, of the highly-respected Brookings Institution, has documented a \n``shadow workforce'' of almost 13 million contractors, grantees, and \nstate and local government employees who serve as a de-facto extension \nof the Federal workforce--yet without the oversight and accountability. \nEvidence suggests that oversight of the contractor workforce is poor, \nyet contract managers were targeted for downsizing by Reinventing \nGovernment.\n  Far more noteworthy than the Vice President's characteristic \nexaggerations, however, is the sorry state of the civil service seven \nyears after Reinventing Government was initiated.\n  As chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, I have led an ongoing review of overall government \nperformance. I have found an appalling lack of forethought by the \nClinton-Gore administration toward workforce planning as well as the \ntraining and development of Federal employees. The ``A-Team,'' the \npeople who get the job done, and who, for the last 7 years, have been \nignored.\n  In testimony earlier this year before my subcommittee, nonpartisan \nexperts testified that inattention to management has taken a heavy toll \non the ability of the Federal workforce to do the job the American \npeople deserve and expect.\n  Don Kettl, from the University of Wisconsin, testified:\n\n       The problem is that we have increasingly created a gulf \n     between the people who are in the government and the skills \n     needed to run that government effectively.\n\n  Paul Light of the Brookings Institution put it more bluntly. He \ntestified that the downsizing initiated by Reinventing Government:\n\n       Has been haphazard, random, and there is no question that \n     in some agencies we have hollowed out institutional memory \n     and we are on the cusp of a significant human capital crisis.\n\n  The U.S. General Accounting Office may well designate human capital \nas a Federal ``high risk'' area when it releases its next series on \ngovernment high risk problems in January 2001. The numbers are \nalarming, and most of the people are not aware of this, even Members of \nthis body.\n  Right now, the average Federal employee is 46 years old. By 2004, 32 \npercent of Federal employees will be eligible for regular retirement, \nand 21 percent more will be eligible for early retirement.\n  Taken together, more than half the Federal workforce--900,000 \nemployees--could potentially leave in just 4 years. Obviously, if that \nhappens, neither Vice President Gore nor Governor Bush would have any \nproblems meeting their campaign promises regarding this nation's \nFederal workforce.\n  Regrettably, the Clinton-Gore administration squandered 7 years \nbefore getting serious about this potential retirement wave. Indeed, \nReinventing Government targeted human resources,\n\n[[Page S11323]]\n\ncontract oversight, financial management and other professionals for \ndownsizing, leaving the Federal Government without the expertise it now \nneeds to recruit talented, technology-savvy people to fill the coming \nvacancies.\n  When it comes to the achievements of Reinventing Government, Vice \nPresident Gore has nothing to brag about. In my opinion, this effort is \na liability for the Vice President, not a feather in his cap. \nReinventing Government has failed to improve Government management or \nconfront the fundamental question of how the civil service should be \ndeployed to serve our nation. Cutting costs by only cutting jobs fails \nto acknowledge the central concern Americans have with Government, and \nthat is ineffective programs, Government waste, command and control \npolicies, and in many instances just plain gridlock.\n\n  Agencies with less staff but the same workload only experience more \nof the bureaucratic meltdown which undermines the public trust and \ndemoralizes the remaining Federal workforce.\n  Wouldn't it be better if we focused on putting the right individuals \nin the job the American people actually want the Federal Government to \naccomplish--missions such as strengthening our national defense, saving \nSocial Security, and saving Medicare--and giving them the training they \nneed to get the job done?\n  When I asked OMB how much money they spent on training, they said \nthey didn't know. So my subcommittee did a survey of the Federal \nagencies and we asked them: How much do you spend on training? They \ndidn't know. We did get letters back from a couple of agencies and they \nsaid: We know, but we won't tell you because if we do, you, Congress, \nwill take the money away from us.\n  Mr. President, I am not advocating the Federal Government fill every \nvacancy, person for person. What we need to do is ensure that every \nFederal agency has assessed its current and future workforce needs and \nhas planned accordingly. Agencies must have the flexibility to design \nthe recruiting and training programs that will allow them to attract \nand retain quality personnel and ensure they are deployed in the most \neffective way. In other words, the Federal workforce should be treated \nas an investment, not an expense.\n  Earlier this year, when I had begun to examine the management of \nhuman capital in my subcommittee, I asked for the training budgets of \nall Federal agencies. As I mentioned, they did not know; they did not \ncollect the information. That is incredible.\n  The coming human capital crisis creates an opportunity for the next \nadministration to reshape the 21st century Federal workforce, to \nimprove Federal performance and efficiency, and to invest in the people \nwho make the Government run. My hope is that in 4 years the next \nPresident will boast, not just of reducing the size of Government, but \nalso of a well planned reorganization of Federal jobs, and of having \nequipped our Federal workforce to support a more focused and more \nstreamlined Federal mission so they can work harder and smarter and do \nmore with less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/29/senate-section/article/S11323-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11323-S11324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   A FEDERAL MORATORIUM ON EXECUTIONS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the last time the Federal Government \nexecuted someone was in 1963. That year, the Federal Government \nexecuted Victor Feguer, who had kidnapped and killed a young doctor. At \n5:30 in the morning of February 15, 1963, at Fort Madison, IA, a \nFederal hangman tied a noose around Feguer's neck and put him to death.\n  Feguer's execution was the first and last Federal execution of the \n1960s. In fact, the Federal Government has carried out executions \nfairly infrequently during the entire twentieth century. Only 24 \nFederal executions took place between 1927 and 1963. One-third of those \nwere for wartime espionage or sabotage.\n  But, Mr. President, all of that is about to change. In the next 2 \nmonths, two inmates on Federal death row could become the first to be \nexecuted by the Federal Government in nearly forty years. Their names \nare David Hammer and Juan Garza.\n  As many of my colleagues recall, Congress modernized the federal \ndeath penalty in 1988 and then significantly expanded it in 1994. Those \nvotes are about to have very real consequences. Like it or not, the \nnational debate over the death penalty is actually intensifying and \nwill build further next month, the months after that, and in the year \nto come.\n  And we should have this debate. We should have this debate, because \nthe Federal Government is heading in a different direction from the \nrest of the country. The States have learned some serious lessons about \nthe administration of capital punishment, and the Federal Government, \nabove all, should learn from them.\n  After the Supreme Court's 1976 decision reinstating the death \npenalty, most States swept the cobwebs off their electric chairs and \nresumed executions. And most of these states have not looked back \nsince. Just last year, the United States set the record for the number \nof executions in one year in this modern death penalty period: 98 \nexecutions. And already this year, there have been 70 executions in the \nUnited States.\n  But recently, in States all across America, awareness has been \ngrowing that the death penalty system has serious flaws and that its \nadministration has sometimes been far from fair. From Illinois to Texas \nto North Carolina to Pennsylvania, I believe that a consensus is \nbuilding that there is a problem. Since the 1970s, 89 people--Mr. \nPresident, 89 people--who had been sent to death row were later proven \ninnocent. Nine of these 89 were exonerated on the basis of modern DNA \ntesting of biological evidence. Defendants have sometimes been \nrepresented by lawyers who slept during trial, were drunk during trial, \nor who were so incompetent that they were later suspended or disbarred. \nProsecutorial and police misconduct sometimes have led to faulty \nconvictions. The death penalty has been applied disproportionately to \nAfrican Americans and the poor. The revelations of problems with the \nsystem mount. These are very real, serious problems that fail to live \nup to the fundamental principles of fairness and justice on which our \ncriminal justice system is based.\n  Just last month, the Justice Department released data on Federal \ndeath penalty prosecutions. That Justice study showed racial and \ngeographic disparities in the administration of the Federal death \npenalty. The study found that whether the Federal Government seeks the \ndeath penalty appears to relate to the color of the defendant's skin or \nthe Federal district in which the defendant is prosecuted. Both the \nPresident and the Attorney General have acknowledged--they have \nacknowledged--that this data paints a disturbing picture of the Federal \ndeath penalty system. The Attorney General admits that she does not \nhave answers to the questions raised by the DOJ report.\n  My colleagues may believe that the system is flawed, but some of them \nseem to fear that the people will object to efforts simply to address \nthese inequities. The American people, however, are in fact ahead of \nthe politicians on this, as they are on so many issues. A majority of \nthe American people are troubled. They are troubled by these flaws in \nthe death penalty system that they support a moratorium on executions. \nAn NBC/Wall Street Journal poll taken this past July found that 63 \npercent of Americans supported a suspension of executions while \nquestions of fairness are reviewed. And in a bipartisan poll released \njust this last month, 64 percent of Americans supported a suspension of \nexecutions while questions of fairness are reviewed.\n\n  Mr. President, as you have said and others have said, the Federal \nGovernment can often learn from the States. Let's apply that to the \nadministration of the death penalty.\n  With so many nagging questions raised and still unanswered, how can \nthe Federal Government go forward--how can the Federal Government go \nforward with its first execution in almost 40 years?\n  I believe it is unconscionable for the Federal Government to resume \nexecutions under these circumstances.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced two bills that would suspend \nexecutions\n\n[[Page S11324]]\n\nwhile an independent, blue ribbon commission simply reviews the death \npenalty system. The National Death Penalty Moratorium Act would suspend \nexecutions at the state and federal levels. The Federal Death Penalty \nMoratorium Act would suspend executions at the Federal level. And I am \npleased that Senators Levin, Wellstone, Durbin and Boxer have joined me \non one or both of these bills. The five of us may not--in fact, do \nnot--agree on whether the death penalty is a proper punishment, but we \nare united in our belief that our nation should pause and thoroughly \nreview the system that has sent many who were later proven innocent to \ndeath row.\n  Addressing flaws in the death penalty system is, Mr. President, \nunfortunately, yet another chapter of the unfinished business of this \nCongress. With two executions scheduled for after adjournment, I must \nurge President Clinton to suspend Federal executions and order a \ncomprehensive review of the Federal death penalty system.\n  Next Congress, when we return, I intend to reintroduce my \nlegislation. I shall keep pushing forward on this issue. We have made \nprogress this year, but we still have a long way to go toward restoring \nthe integrity of our criminal justice system. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues toward that goal in the year to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/29/senate-section/article/S11324-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11324-S11329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE OMNIBUS TAX BILL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise now to oppose yet another \nmonstrous product that this majority has loosed on the Senate, this one \nan omnibus tax bill. In a number of speeches this year, as early as \nthis May, I have tried to raise objections to the procedures that the \nmajority is employing in this session of the Senate. It is proverbial \nthat ``a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.'' If any more proof were \nneeded that these procedures are bad, the fruit of this tax bill \nprovides it.\n  Let me begin by recounting how bad the tree is that bore this bill. \nThe procedures that the majority has employed to bring this bill to the \nfloor are egregious. And when the majority employs the procedures that \nit has on this bill, it is not surprising that they yield such an \nunattractive outcome. What has happened? A small number of Senators and \nCongressmen, all from one party, have cooked up this bill behind closed \ndoors. Of the bill's major provisions, none has enjoyed consideration \non the Senate floor. The majority leadership has then shoveled the \ncontents of this back-room agreement into a conference on a \ncomparatively minor Small Business Administration loan measure. When \nthe fruit of such a process has, as this bill has, experienced no \ndiscussion, no vetting, and no amendment, it cannot help but have some \nrotten parts to it.\n  And there is much that is rotten about this bill. It would spend, Mr. \nPresident, a significant amount of the surplus--about a quarter of a \ntrillion dollars--before, before having taken any steps to save Social \nSecurity, or to reform Medicare, or to lock away on-budget surpluses to \npay down the debt. Now, Mr. President, there are of course some \nprovisions in this bill that I would support. But first and foremost, \nit is irresponsible to spend this much of the projected surpluses \nbefore having taken a single step to address our long-term fiscal \nresponsibilities.\n  And so, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial on \nthis point that appeared in the Washington Post entitled ``Say Goodbye \nto the Surplus'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Beyond that, Mr. President, this bill is also blighted by its lack of \nfairness. As have so many of the other fruits of this majority, this \ntax bill would disproportionately favor the very wealthy. When we as \nSenators decide on tax policy, we must ask ourselves: With a limited \namount of surplus available, whose taxes should we cut first? Should \ntax relief go first to the wealthiest among us? The majority answers \n``yes'' every time. Instead of the Robin-Hood-in-reverse priorities of \nthe majority, we should instead be seeking to direct tax relief first \nto those who need it most: the hard-working American middle-income \nfamily.\n  According to an analysis prepared by the Institute on Taxation and \nEconomic Policy, 64 percent of the benefits of this tax bill would go \nto the top one-fifth of the income distribution. And less than a fifth \nof the benefits of this tax bill would go to the bottom 60 percent of \nthe population--one-fifth of the benefit to three-fifths of the people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an executive summary of a \npolicy paper on this bill prepared by the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities entitled ``Leadership's Tax Plan Reinforces Inequities in \nHealth and Pension Coverage'' be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks. The entire text of this policy paper can be \nfound at http://www.cbpp.org/10-26-00tax.htm\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  And now, let me take a few moments to address particular sections of \nthe bill. And let me begin with the health care provisions of this \nbill, which, at $88 billion for the tax provisions alone, account for \nwhat is actually the largest component of this bill. We can all agree \nthat health care should be a priority. But the health tax provisions of \nthis bill are structured so that the vast majority of middle-income \nAmericans will not be able to benefit from them.\n\n  This is so because the health tax provisions in this bill operate \nexclusively through the mechanism of tax deductions, instead of tax \ncredits. Thus, Mr. President, it would provide no benefit for families \nof four making up to $32,000, and actually provide precious little \nbenefit for families making up to $50,000. Those at the top of the \nincome scale are not those who are having the most difficulty getting \nhealth insurance or paying for long-term care.\n  Indeed, the health care insurance deduction in this bill could \nactually reduce health care coverage. That is because the presence of \nthe deduction might encourage private employers to drop health care \ncoverage at the workplace.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to ask unanimous consent that an executive \nsummary of a policy paper on this point prepared by the Center on \nBudget and Policy Priorities entitled ``Health Insurance Deduction of \nLittle Help to the Uninsured'' be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks. The full text of this policy paper can be \nfound at http://www.cbpp.org/8-30-00tax2.htm\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Among its health provisions, this bill also includes spending \nlegislation to restore health care cuts made in the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1997. I strongly oppose the provisions in the Medicare provider \npayment restoration bill that disproportionately allocate scarce \nMedicare resources towards Medicare health maintenance organizations--\nHMOs--and away from beneficiary and health care provider needs.\n  The Medicare HMO program already treats our Wisconsin seniors \nunfairly. I cannot support increasing payments to a system that treats \nWisconsin's seniors like second class citizens. Not only are these \nincreased payments unjustifiable, they would raise payments without any \naccountability provisions that would ensure there is actually planned \nparticipation in States like Wisconsin.\n  Congress should not dedicate over one-third of its Medicare spending \nto Medicare HMOs, when only 15 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are \nenrolled in HMOs.\n  Instead of supporting HMOs, I strongly favor provisions that would \nsupport Wisconsin's seniors by preserving care through hospitals, home \nhealth care agencies, hospices, and other providers. The home health \ncare provisions--I know firsthand from many conversations around the \nstate--are especially inadequate, and do little to address the needs of \nrural beneficiaries and the most medically complex patients.\n  Let me turn now to the pension provisions, which, at $64 billion, \nmake up the next largest part of the bill. The official estimates of \nthe costs of these provisions are large, but they understate what will \nbe the true costs of the bill. That is because the bill's so-called \nRoth IRA provisions, which allow taxpayers to pay some taxes now to \navoid\n\n[[Page S11325]]\n\npaying more taxes later, bring funds into the Treasury in the early \nyears at the expense of the outyears. The bill's costs will thus likely \nexpand when fully phased in, and will likely grow particularly in just \nthose years when the baby boom generation is retiring and we most need \nthe resources to actually keep Social Security and Medicare solvent.\n  The bill's pension provisions expand individual retirement accounts \nor IRAs. Among other things, it raises the amount that individuals may \ncontribute to IRAs, raises the maximum income for those who may \ncontribute to an IRA, raises the maximum income for those who may \nconvert a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA, and allows individuals over \nage 50 to make larger catchup contributions. The bill makes similar \nchanges in 401(k) plans, raising the amount that individuals may \ncontribute to 401(k)s, allowing deferral of 401(k) tax treatment as \nwith a Roth IRA, and allowing individuals over age 50 to make larger \ncatchup 401(k) contributions.\n\n  Taken as a whole, these changes that I just listed would manifestly \nbenefit the bestoff among us. A recent Treasury study found that just \nfour percent of eligible taxpayers--largely the most affluent people \neligible--make the maximum $2,000 contribution to IRAs under the \nexisting law. By definition, these would be the only people within \ncurrent income limits who would benefit from raising the contribution \nlimit. And by definition, only those above current income limits would \nbenefit from lifting the income limits. According to the Institute on \nTaxation and Economic Policy analysis, more than three-fourths of the \nbenefits of the bill's pension and IRA provisions would go to the fifth \nof the population with the highest incomes.\n  The bill's proponents claim that the bill would also increase \nsavings. But this claim is almost Orwellian. Lifting these limits would \nactually decrease saving, for three reasons.\n  First, by making it easier for wealthy business owners to do tax-\nfavored saving as individuals, the bill would decrease their incentives \nto set up business-wide, business-wide 401(k) or pension plans to get \nthose tax benefits. As a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury \ntestified:\n\n       Currently, a small business owner who wants to save $5,000 \n     or more for retirement on a tax-favored basis generally would \n     choose to adopt an employer plan. However, if the IRA limit \n     were raised to $5,000, the owner could save that amount--or \n     jointly with the owner's spouse, $10,000--on a tax-preferred \n     basis without adopting a plan for employees. Therefore, \n     higher IRA limits could reduce interest in employer \n     retirement plans, particularly among owners of small \n     businesses. If this happens, higher IRA limits would work at \n     cross purposes with other proposals that attempt to increase \n     coverage among employees of small businesses.\n\n  That is what the former Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy said. By \ndepriving lower- and moderate-income employees of opportunities for \ntax-favored saving, the higher IRA limits would thus decrease saving by \nthose employees.\n  Second, the savings contributed by high-income savers would tend to \nbe money that they would have saved anyway. Rather than cause new \nsaving among higher-income savers, the higher limits would merely \nsubstitute tax-favored saving for fully-taxed saving. Rather than \nincrease saving among this group, the bill would thus just cut taxes \nfor these higher-income savers.\n  And third, because the bill is not paid for and therefore spends \nsurplus money, it reduces the surplus and thus reduces the amount by \nwhich the Government pays down the debt. When the Government pays down \ndebt, it contributes to national savings. And thus by reducing the \namount by which the Government pays down debt, the bill will worsen \nnational savings.\n  When the Finance Committee considered a pension bill earlier this \nyear, it did include a provision that might have helped increase \nsaving, Mr. President. That section, championed by Democratic Members \nof the Finance Committee, would have actually provided a matching \ncredit, a matching credit, for saving by low- and moderate-income \nsavers making up to $50,000 for a couple. The provision was still \ndeeply flawed, in my view, because it was not refundable, and therefore \nit was of no use to families of four making up to $32,000. But if \nGovernment action is to encourage increased private saving, it needs to \nbe directed--as that credit was--to low- and moderate-income people, \nwho are not saving now.\n  What has the majority done? The majority has stripped this bill of \nthat proposal. The majority has deleted from the bill that section most \nlikely to increase private saving.\n\n  As well, the bill includes many offensive individual pension \nprovisions.\n  Current law imposes additional requirements on plans that primarily \nbenefit an employer's key employees, what are called ``top-heavy \nplans.'' These additional requirements provide more rapid vesting and \nminimum employer contributions for plan participants who are not key \nemployees. The bill would relax these rules for top heavy plans in a \nnumber of ways. For example, fewer family members would be counted for \nthe determination of whether a plan was top-heavy. This change in the \nbill would allow plans to provide greater benefits to owners and their \nfamilies without providing minimum benefits and more-rapid vesting to \nrank-and-file workers.\n  The bill raises the limit on the amount of income that may be \nconsidered compensation for purposes of contributions to 401(k) \naccounts. This change would allow an employer who wanted to save a \nfixed amount each year to reduce the percentage contribution that all \nemployees could make to their 401(k)s.\n  As I noted at the outset, the bill's Roth IRAs shift tax receipts \nfrom the distant future into the near future. They are thus fiscally \nvery risky, as they drain tax revenues from the Government during the \nretirement years of the baby-boom generation, while giving us a false \nsense of additional revenues now. And they also benefit the very \nwealthiest among us.\n  Thus, the pension provisions of this bill would particularly benefit \nthe very wealthiest. And I would assert that it is not a coincidence--I \nam afraid it is not a coincidence--that some of the most powerful \nwealthy interests in our campaign finance system are today pushing for \nthis so-called pension ``reform.'' I would like to take a moment to \ndirect my colleagues' attention to these big donors.\n  It is time again to ``call the bankroll.'' As I have said, this \nlegislation doesn't benefit average working Americans who are counting \non their pension when they retire, so exactly whom does it benefit? I \nthink ``calling the bankroll'' could answer this.\n  I would like to do a truly comprehensive ``calling of the bankroll'' \nhere, but that would be almost impossible. There are just too many \nwealthy interests behind this tax bill: financial interests, insurance \ncompanies, and labor unions, just to name a few. We could be here all \nday, or all week, if I tried to cover all those contributions. So in \nthe interest of time, I will just review the unlimited soft money \ncontributions of some of the interests pushing for this bill.\n  The figures I am about to cite come from the Center for Responsive \nPolitics. They include contributions through the first 15 months of the \nelection cycle, and in some cases include contributions given more \nrecently in the cycle.\n  Some of the biggest investment and finance firms are supporting \npassage of this bill.\n  For example, Merrill Lynch, its executives and subsidiaries, have \ngiven more than $915,000 in soft money, according to the Center for \nResponsive Politics.\n  That's just one company.\n  Mr. President, I have other examples I will cite regarding the \n``calling of the bankroll.'' American Express, its executives and \nsubsidiaries have given more than $312,000 in soft money so far in this \nelection cycle. And Fidelity Investments and its executives have given \nat least $258,000 in soft money to date.\n  The American Benefits Council, which is strongly supporting this \nbill, sent around a list of supporters of provisions of the \nlegislation. That list includes still more big donors.\n  The American Council of Life Insurers and its executives have given \nmore than $260,000 to the parties' soft money warchests during the \nperiod.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and affiliated chambers of commerce have \ngiven more than $110,000 in soft money during the period.\n  The list also included many of the nation's labor unions, which are \nalso\n\n[[Page S11326]]\n\npushing for some of the provisions of this bill, including: American \nFederation of Teachers, which has given at least $820,000 so far during \nthis election cycle; and the International Brotherhood of Electrical \nWorkers, which has given more than $853,000 in soft money during the \nperiod.\n  Regrettably, many of these institutions will see a return on their \ncampaign finance investment in the pension provisions of this bill. \nMore regrettably still, the working family is not likely to see much of \nany benefit at all.\n  Mr. President, I am troubled, as well, that the school construction \nprojects in this bill--being paid for, in part, with Federal tax \ncredits for the bondholders--will not be subject to the Davis-Bacon \nAct. The Davis-Bacon Act ensures that construction workers on Federal \nconstruction sites get paid a fair wage for a days' work by requiring \nthat those workers be paid the local prevailing wage.\n  The worker protections embodied in the Davis-Bacon Act are essential, \nand one specific set of Federal construction projects--and the workers \nwho build them--should not be deprived of these protections. I am \ndeeply concerned that some in this body are attempting to alter the \nprotections under the Davis-Bacon Act without a substantive debate.\n  Yes, Mr. President, this bill does include a long-overdue increase in \nthe minimum wage. I have long supported that increase. Congress should \nhave passed it two years ago, and we should have passed it in a \nstraightforward bill, clean of tax give-aways.\n  Sadly, it has become the habit of this majority to extract a series \nof tax subsidies in exchange for a minimum wage increase. And what is \nworse is that the cost of these subsidies is increasing. In 1996, the \nCongress had to pass $20 billion in tax cuts to get an increase in the \nminimum wage. Sadly, the cost of that minimum wage increase in terms of \ntax subsidies extracted has grown exponentially.\n  Another section of this bill would reinstate and expand the Foreign \nSales Corporation--or FSC--export tax subsidy. We ought to be skeptical \nof subsidies, whether provided through the tax code, through \nappropriated programs, or through entitlements. In general, the best \npolicy is to let free markets work. The FSC export tax subsidy does not \ndo that.\n  While the FSC export tax subsidy may provide a very small benefit to \ncertain firms that produce exports or that produce goods abroad, it \nalso triggers increases in U.S. imports, so that its net effect on our \nbalance of trade is probably negligible. As the Congressional Research \nService explains, the FSC tax subsidy increases foreign purchases of \nU.S. exports, but to buy the U.S. products, foreigners require more \ndollars. That, in turn, increases demand for U.S. dollars, driving up \nthe price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets and making U.S. \nexports more expensive. This partly offsets the effect of the FSC in \nincreasing U.S. exports. This effect also makes imports to the United \nStates cheaper, which causes U.S. imports to increase.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that while some firms may enjoy \nincreased export sales, other firms will lose business and jobs because \nof increased imports.\n  This special tax subsidy thus has benefits and costs. The firms that \nqualify for this export subsidy gain a benefit, of course, but so too \ndo foreign consumers. CRS notes that the FSC tax subsidy produces a \ntransfer of economic welfare from the United States to consumers abroad \nwhen part of the tax benefit is passed on to foreign consumers as \nreduced prices for U.S. goods. U.S. taxpayers are paying to keep these \nexports cheap for foreign consumers.\n\n  But there are other costs, as well. First, and perhaps most \nobviously, the billions of dollars we spend through the FSC export tax \nsubsidy could otherwise be used to lower the tax burden on businesses \nand individuals, or to lower the level of our massive national debt. \nAnd as with other special tax breaks, the FSC export tax subsidy \ndistorts the marketplace, and makes our economy less efficient.\n  There is also an additional and potentially huge cost that may be \nimposed on American firms and workers because of this FSC subsidy: what \namounts to a possible multi-billion dollar tax imposed by the World \nTrade Organization on American products that are purchased in European \nUnion countries that could mean lost business and jobs.\n  I am no fan of the World Trade Organization. I opposed the 1994 \nlegislation that implemented the most recent General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade, or GATT, in large part because it created this \nundemocratic, unaccountable, often secretive international organization \nknown as the World Trade Organization or WTO.\n  As my colleagues know, the reason we are considering changes to the \nFSC export tax subsidy is because of a WTO ruling that this tax break \nis an illegal subsidy. If we fail to change our tax laws to comply with \nthis ruling, we can expect billions in punitive tariffs to be levied \nagainst American goods exported to the European Union.\n  While the FSC tax subsidy may be bad tax policy, it is our tax \npolicy--a policy arrived at through the elected representatives of the \npeople of this Nation. The ability of some international bureaucracy to \neffectively impose punitive taxes or tariffs on American goods should \noffend us all. Unfortunately, that is what we face because of the \naction Congress took in 1994 to ratify the GATT, and unless we \neliminate the FSC export tax subsidy, American firms and American \nworkers are at risk.\n  Regrettably, the proposed expansion of the FSC may not remove this \nthreat. Mr. President, I have grave concerns that the WTO will see this \nexpanded tax break as little more than a reconfiguration of the \nexisting tax subsidy for exports. At a briefing for Senate staff on \nthis issue, the Treasury Department conceded that not a single business \ncurrently able to use this export subsidy will lose its tax break. \nIndeed, the export tax subsidy has been expanded to provide an even \nlarger subsidy for foreign military sales.\n  If the WTO rules that this change does not comply with its previous \nruling, our businesses and workers will face billions in punitive \ntariffs on the goods they produce. That is what is at stake here. The \nproponents of this legislation are willing to risk billions in tariffs \non American goods rather than eliminate this questionable tax \nexpenditure.\n  It would be better economic policy and better fiscal policy simply to \nrepeal the FSC altogether.\n  I am particularly troubled, Mr. President, by the provision of the \nFSC export tax subsidy section of this bill that would actually double \nthe current tax benefit for arms sales.\n  That is right, Mr. President, this bill would double the tax benefit \ncurrently enjoyed by U.S. companies that sell weapons abroad.\n  Had the Senate been able to consider this bill under the Senate's \nregular procedures, I would have joined in an amendment by the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, that would have sought to correct this \nproblem by reinstating the current tax benefit for arms sales.\n  United States arms manufacturers continue to lead the world in \nconventional arms sales to developing countries, both in terms of arms \ntransfer agreements and in terms of arms delivered to the countries of \nthe developing world. Conventional arms sales include such items as \naircraft, tanks, complete weapons systems, spare parts, upgrades for \npreviously purchased items, and munitions; as well as training and \nsupport services for the items purchased.\n  This August, the Congressional Research Service released its annual \nreport, Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations. This 79-page \nreport details the worldwide arms transfer business conducted with \ndeveloping nations from 1992 through 1999. During that eight-year \nperiod, the United States entered into arms-transfer agreements with \ndeveloping nations worth in excess of $62.7 billion. Our nearest \ncompetitor, France, entered into agreements with developing nations \nworth just about half of that total, $31.6 billion.\n  During that same eight-year period, the United States delivered arms \nworth in excess of $84 billion to the countries of the developing \nworld. The United Kingdom ranked a distant second with deliveries \ntotaling $37.7 billion--less than half the value of the arms delivered \nby the United States.\n  And those numbers represent only the arms agreements and deliveries\n\n[[Page S11327]]\n\nwith the countries of the developing world. When we add in the arms \nagreements and deliveries to our worldwide customers, the numbers rise \neven higher. During the same period, the United States also ranked \nfirst in worldwide arms transfer agreements with an astonishing $104 \nbillion dollars worth of agreements. Russia comes in a distant second \nwith $31.2 billion in worldwide arms transfer agreements.\n  And during those eight years, the United States delivered a total of \nmore than $124 billion worth of arms worldwide. Russia again came in \nsecond with $21.6 billion in deliveries.\n  In both instances--arms transfer agreements and arms actually \ndelivered--the vast majority of United States arms transactions were \nconducted with the countries of the developing world.\n  As you can see from these numbers, Mr. President, the United States \nhas no real competitors in the arms transfer business. And the United \nStates will continue to lead the world in arms sales into the \nforeseeable future, because those who would buy arms want to buy them \nfrom American manufacturers. It is that simple. These companies are \nalready making millions and millions of dollars from these sales each \nyear. And they are already receiving substantial tax benefits. There is \nno need to double that benefit.\n  In fact, as I noted earlier with regard to the entire FSC export tax \nsubsidy, I would argue that we should actually be talking about \neliminating this benefit entirely. At the very least, we should \nmaintain the current level--we should not double this subsidy.\n  This 100 percent increase in the tax benefit for arms sales is \nopposed by such groups as the Council for a Liveable World Education \nFund, the General Board of Church and Society of the United Methodist \nChurch, the Justice and Witness Ministries of the United Church of \nChrist, NETWORK, the Church of the Brethren, the Friends Committee on \nNational Legislation, the National Council of Churches of Christ in the \nUSA, the Mennonite Central Committee, and the Maryknoll Mission \nAssociation of the Faithful.\n  The world is already a very dangerous place. The Congress should not \nbe increasing the subsidy for U.S. companies to sell weapons abroad.\n  Make no mistake about the importance of this piece of legislation to \narms manufacturers and other business interests who would benefit from \nthe various tax subsidies contained in this bill. As you know, wealthy \ninterests don't just sit idly by on the sidelines waiting for us to act \non this kind of legislation. They lobby to insert favorable provisions \ninto a bill, and once they secure a special deal, they lobby to keep it \nin the bill. And when I say ``lobbying,'' I mean more than a visit or a \nphone call to staff--I mean campaign contributions, Mr. President, \nmillions upon millions of dollars worth.\n\n  As we discuss the legislation before us, we cannot ignore the \npresence of powerful monied interests. I have often likened campaign \ncontributions to an 800-pound gorilla that's in this chamber every \nday--nobody talks about him, but he cannot be ignored. On this issue as \nwell, I refuse to ignore the 800 pound gorilla who's throwing his \nweight around in our political process. Instead I choose to Call the \nBankroll, to inform my colleagues and the public of the contributions \nmade by wealthy interests seeking to influence what we do here on this \nfloor.\n  On this provision of the bill, I feel it is once again very important \nto take a moment to review the campaign contributions of the defense \nindustry. As I have said, this bill would double the tax benefit \ncurrently enjoyed by U.S. companies that sell weapons abroad. This bill \nmeans a huge bonanza for arms manufacturers. It is only appropriate to \ntake a look at the bonanza of contributions they have provided to the \npolitical parties.\n  Many members of the Business Roundtable, an organization which has \nurged the passage of this legislation, are some of the biggest arms \nmanufacturers in the U.S., and some of the biggest political donors. \nI'd like to review the contributions of some of these companies. These \nfigures are for contributions through at least the first 15 months of \nthe election cycle, and in some cases include contributions given more \nrecently in the cycle.\n  Lockheed Martin, its executives and subsidiaries have given more than \n$861,000 in soft money, and more than $881,000 in PAC money so far \nduring this election cycle.\n  United Technologies and its subsidiaries have given more than \n$293,000 in soft money and more than $240,000 in PAC money during the \nperiod.\n  During that period, Raytheon has given more than $251,000 in soft \nmoney to the parties and more than $397,000 in PAC money to Federal \ncandidates.\n  Textron has contributed more than $173,000 in soft money and more \nthan $205,000 in PAC money.\n  And last but not least, Boeing has given more than $583,000 in soft \nmoney since the election cycle began, and more than $593,000 in PAC \ncontributions.\n  Mr. President, these defense companies are getting a one hundred \npercent increase in an already unnecessary tax break, and frankly I \nwonder why. I wonder why we would double a tax break for the defense \nindustry, when we haven't passed a Patient's Bill of Rights, when we \nhaven't provided Medicare coverage for prescription drugs, and when we \nhaven't passed so many other important measures that Americans really \ncare about.\n  Sadly, it appears that there is a pretty simple way to figure out why \nwe dole out corporate tax breaks while we neglect the priorities of the \nAmerican people. All you have to do is follow the dollar.\n  Mr. President, this bill thus amply proves the adage that ``a bad \ntree cannot bear good fruit.'' We should revise the procedures that \nallow such a monstrosity to be loaded into a conference report on an \nunrelated matter. And we should reject this bill, whose rotten \nprovisions outnumber its sound ones.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From The Washington Post, Oct. 26, 2000]\n\n                       Say Goodbye to the Surplus\n\n       Congressional Republican reached agreement yesterday on the \n     contents of the tax cut bill they intend to send the \n     president before adjourning. They suggest it's a relatively \n     minor measure, but it's not. If it becomes law atop all the \n     spending increases also agreed to in this session, Congress \n     and the president will have used up, before the election, \n     well over a third of the projected budget surplus--the $2.2 \n     trillion over 10 years in other than Social Security funds--\n     that the presidential candidates are so busily distending on \n     the campaign trail. It's an astonishing display of lack of \n     discipline and misplaced priorities.\n       The president sent a letter implying that he might sign the \n     tax bill even while objecting to major parts. He ought \n     instead to veto it if congressional Democrats won't block it \n     first. As with the other Republican tax cuts he vetoed \n     earlier in the year, this would cost too much--an estimated \n     quarter-trillion dollars over the 10 years--and too much of \n     the money would go to the part of the population least in \n     need.\n       In the name of increasing access to health care, the \n     legislation would grant a new tax deduction to people who buy \n     their own insurance. The deduction would mainly benefit those \n     in the top tax brackets who tend already to be insured. The \n     president observed that, far from increasing access, it would \n     have the perverse effect of inducing employers to drop \n     insurance they now maintain for their employees. Among much \n     else, the bill would also increase the amounts that can be \n     contributed annually to tax-favored retirement accounts, a \n     step that by definition benefits only those who can afford to \n     save the maximum now.\n       The health insurance deduction was part of the Republicans' \n     price for the $1-an-hour increase in the minimum wage that \n     the bill also contains. The price is too high. Also in the \n     bill will be so-called Medicare givebacks, increases in \n     payments to providers that the president earlier objected \n     were tilted in favor of managed care companies already \n     overpaid. This is on balance a bad bill dusted with \n     confectioner's sugar and offered up at year's end on a take-\n     it-or-leave-it basis. The right response would be to vote it \n     down.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                  Center on Budget\n\n\n                                        and Policy Priorities,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 2000.\n\n   Leadership's Tax Plan Reinforces Inequities in Health and Pension \n                                Coverage\n\n\n   tax cuts primarily benefit high-income household and could reduce \n    health and pension coverage for low- and moderate-income workers\n\n       Congress will shortly consider a significant tax package \n     developed by the House and Senate Republican leadership. \n     Despite some beneficial provisions in the bill, such as the \n     $1 increase in the minimum wage phases-in over the next two \n     years, the bill's tax provisions will primarily benefit \n     those-with high incomes. In developing the package, the \n     leadership dropped bipartisan provisions--such as the \n     retirement savings tax credit and the small business tax \n     credit adopted by the\n\n[[Page S11328]]\n\n     Senate Finance Committee and the Medicaid access provisions \n     adopted by the House Commerce Committee--that could have \n     benefitted low- and middle-income workers. Rather, they \n     retained provisions benefiting primarily those that already \n     have health insurance and pension coverage. Even more \n     worrisome is that some of these provisions could make it more \n     difficult for low- and moderate-income workers to get health \n     insurance and pension coverage through their jobs.\n       The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the cost of the \n     package to be $240 billion over 10 years. But when combined \n     with anticipated discretionary appropriations, the repeal of \n     the telephone excise tax, new health benefits for military \n     retires, and Medicare give-backs as well as the resulting \n     interest costs, this bill brings the 10-year cost recent of \n     congressional actions to close to $1 trillion (see box at the \n     end of the paper). This Congress will therefore use a \n     substantial share of the available surplus without addressing \n     key priorities, such as reducing the ranks of the uninsured \n     or funding prescription drug benefits. The benefits of the \n     leadership's plan remain focused on these who have benefitted \n     the most from the economic boom, offering little to those who \n     continue to struggle to get ahead.\n       Nearly two-thirds of the tax cuts in the bill go to the 20 \n     percent of taxpayers with the highest incomes. The top five \n     percent of taxpayers receive a greater share of the tax cuts \n     than the bottom 80 percent. Thus the benefits of the bill are \n     concentrated on those that already have high rates of health \n     insurance and pension coverage. These estimates were \n     calculated by the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy.\n       The bill's health insurance deduction is expensive and \n     poorly targeted. This deduction is most valuable to those in \n     the highest tax brackets, yet those most in need of coverage \n     have no tax liability or are in the lowest (15 percent) \n     bracket. Taxpayers with incomes too low to pay income taxes \n     would receive no assistance from this deduction. For most \n     taxpayers in the 15 percent bracket, the 15-cents-on-the-\n     dollar subsidy that the deduction provides is unlikely to \n     be sufficient to make costly health insurance affordable.\n       According to the Joint Tax Committee, approximately 94 \n     percent of the cost of the health insurance tax deduction \n     would go to subsidize taxpayers that already have health \n     insurance, with only 6 percent of the tax benefits going to \n     further the goal of extending health insurance coverage to \n     the uninsured.\n       The Council of Economic Advisers, among other researchers, \n     found that tax deductions are a very inefficient way of \n     extending coverage to the uninsured. A more cost-effective \n     approach is the Administration's FamilyCare plan, which, at a \n     lower cost, would provide coverage to more than twice the \n     number of uninsured than the proposed tax deduction.\n       Because the health care tax deduction would provide a far \n     deeper percentage subsidy for purchasing health insurance to \n     higher-paid business owners and executives than to lower-wage \n     earners, it could encourage some small business owners to \n     drop group coverage (or not to institute it in the first \n     place) and to rely on the deduction for their own coverage. \n     As a result, some workers could be forced to buy more costly \n     and less comprehensive insurance on the individual market, \n     and the ranks of the uninsured and under-insured could rise.\n       The bill also includes tax deductions for long-term care \n     insurance and long-term care expenses that would provide the \n     largest benefit to higher-income taxpayers. Most low- and \n     middle-income taxpayers would get no more than a 15 percent \n     subsidy; this is too little to enable most of these families \n     to afford costs related to long-term care.\n       Most of the bill's pension benefits would accrue to higher-\n     income workers who already enjoy high rates of pension \n     coverage. An analysis by the Institute for Taxation and \n     Economic Policy of the bill's pension and IRA provisions \n     found that 77 percent of the benefits would go to the 20 \n     percent of Americans with the highest incomes. In sharp \n     contrast, the bottom 60 percent of the population would \n     receive less than five percent of these tax benefits.\n       Moreover, the bill would likely lead to reductions in \n     pension coverage for some low- and middle-income workers and \n     employees of small businesses. For instance, it would weaken \n     ``non-discrimination'' and ``top-heavy'' rules that ensure \n     company pension plans treat low-income workers fairly and are \n     not skewed in favor of highly compensated workers. It also \n     increases the IRA contribution limits to $5,000, which could \n     make IRAs more attractive than company pension plans for \n     owners of small businesses, possibly leading them to drop \n     plans that benefit their workers.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n                                              Center on Budget and\n\n\n                                            Policy Priorities,\n\n                         Washington, DC, Revised October 18, 2000.\n\n       Health Insurance Deduction of Little Help to the Uninsured\n\n                   (By Joel Friedman and Iris J. Lav)\n\n       House Speaker Dennis Hastert held a press conference last \n     week in which he called for including in the minimum-wage \n     package a new tax deduction for health insurance premiums. \n     The deduction would be available to taxpayers that pay at \n     least 50 percent of the cost of their health insurance.\n       This proposal, which would cost nearly $11 billion a year \n     in fiscal year 2010, is a poorly targeted and expensive way \n     to help the uninsured obtain coverage. Those most in need \n     would receive little or no subsidy to help them buy \n     insurance. Moreover, the proposal could have the effect of \n     raising the cost of insurance for some workers.\n       According to an analysis by the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation, approximately 94 percent of the cost of the \n     Speaker's tax deduction would go to subsidize taxpayers that \n     already have health insurance, with only 6 percent of the tax \n     benefits going to further his stated goal of extending health \n     insurance coverage to the uninsured.\n       The proposed tax deduction is most valuable to high-income \n     taxpayers, who are in the higher tax brackets. Nine of every \n     10 people without health insurance, however, have no tax \n     liability or are in the lowest (15 percent) tax bracket. \n     Taxpayers with incomes too low to pay income taxes would \n     receive no assistance in purchasing insurance from this \n     deduction. For most taxpayers in the 15 percent bracket, the \n     15-cents-on-the-dollar subsidy that the deduction provides is \n     unlikely to be sufficient to make insurance affordable.\n       Because the deduction provides a far-deeper percentage \n     subsidy for the purchase of insurance to higher-income \n     business owners and executives than to lower-income wage \n     earners, it could encourage small business owners to drop, or \n     fail to institute, group coverage and to rely instead on this \n     deduction to help defray the cost of their own coverage. As a \n     result, some workers could be forced to buy more costly and \n     less comprehensive insurance on the individual market, and \n     the ranks of the uninsured and underinsured could increase.\n       New research shows that a far more cost effective way to \n     assist the uninsured, particularly uninsured children, would \n     be to extend publicly-funded health insurance coverage to \n     low-income parents. The Administrator's FamilyCare plan \n     relies on this approach. At his press conference, however, \n     the Speaker inappropriately compared his proposal to the \n     Administration's small business health insurance tax credit. \n     The Administration's tax credit is a very small scale \n     proposal compared to the Hastert tax deduction. The \n     Speaker's proposal costs $10.9 billion a year by 2010, \n     while the Administration's small business tax credit would \n     cost just $319 million over 10 years, according to JCT. \n     The more-appropriate comparison would have been to the \n     Administration's FamilyCare plan, which the Congressional \n     Budget Office estimates would cost $8.7 billion in 2010.\n       Available estimates show that the FamilyCare approach would \n     result in a substantially larger number of currently \n     uninsured people obtaining insurance coverage than would the \n     Speaker's proposed tax deduction. This is the case despite \n     the somewhat lower annual cost of the FamilyCare plan, when \n     both proposals are fully in effect.\n       A recent report by the Council of Economic Advisers \n     concludes that tax deductions will do little to improve tax \n     health insurance coverage and that approaches like FamilyCare \n     are better at targeting the uninsured.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Wisconsin yield for a question?\n  Mr. President, I would want the question to be on my time, not on \nhis, because he has been given 30 minutes.\n  May I ask the Senator a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Prior to asking a question, I personally appreciate what \nthe Senator from Wisconsin has done on campaign finance reform. Would \nhe think it is a fair statement to say one of the gross failures of \nthis Congress is that we have done nothing to get the money out of \npolitics?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is just a shame that we have managed \nto get to the year 2000 election without having any significant action \non campaign finance reform. We did take the first tiny step in the \nright direction on a strong bipartisan vote by doing something about \ndisclosure by these 527 groups that were sort of a scam in the making, \nbut we did not address the need to ban soft money which the \noverwhelming majority of both Houses support and the President is ready \nto sign. It is a glaring failure of this Congress.\n  Everybody else in the country knows, including those who supported \nthe campaign of the Senator from Arizona for President on the \nRepublican side, that soft money is a real cancer on the system. But \nsomehow, again, the Congress is behind the people. I can't help but \nnote, in answer to the question, that we are going to make a very \nimportant decision in the next few days on who the next President of \nthe United States should be. The candidate of the Democratic Party, Al \nGore, has pledged to make the McCain-Feingold ban on soft money the \nfirst piece of domestic legislation he will introduce, and he has \npledged to work for it and sign it when Congress passes it. The \ncandidate for the Republicans, Governor Bush, apparently is prepared to \nveto it.\n\n[[Page S11329]]\n\n  So the tragedy, in answer to the question, of this Congress not \nacting is that if somehow Mr. Gore is not elected, we may finally get \nthe 60 votes we need to break the filibuster but we will have a \nPresident who is not ready to do something about the corrosive and \ncorrupting influence of money in politics. Of course, the Senator knows \nfrom my work on this, that I consider this to be one of the two or \nthree greatest problems in our society. We just have to do something \nabout the corrupting effect of money on our political and legislative \nsystem.\n  Mr. REID. I have a final question. It is not a complicated issue, is \nit? The fact is, one of the things the Senator wants to do is keep \ncorporate money out of politics; that is, have a corporation not be \nable to write large corporate checks or small corporate checks; keep \ncorporate money out of politics, as was the law early last century. \nIsn't that right?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, that is absolutely right. Let me make it \nclear, the ban on soft money that Senator McCain, I, and a majority of \nthis body support, bans corporate contributions, union contributions, \nand unlimited individual contributions. It is fair and balanced.\n  The Senator from Nevada is absolutely right. People who might be \nlistening to this discussion might say: Well, these kinds of \ncontributions have always been allowed anyway. That is not true. These \nkinds of unlimited contributions by corporations, unions, and \nindividuals really didn't exist for purposes of these television ads \nuntil 5, 6 years ago. This is a new corrupting influence on our system, \nthe likes of which has not been seen since the turn of the last \ncentury. I refer to the turn from the 19th to the 20th century. In \nanswer to the question of the Senator from Nevada, that is what led to \nthe 1907 Tillman Act which prohibited contributions by corporations in \nconnection with federal elections, and then, when the unions came into \ntheir prominence in the middle part of the century, the Taft-Hartley \nAct said unions also must be prohibited from giving contributions.\n  All we are trying to do is put the genie back in the bottle. \nUnlimited contributions have always been considered inappropriate in \nour system of government, and shame on this Congress that we can't see \nthe worst corrupting influence in 100 years and that we didn't, before \nthe turn of the century, shut it down, because it must be shut down.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of the \nSenator from Utah, the Senator from Illinois be recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/29/senate-section/article/S11329-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11329-S11331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GRANTING AMNESTY TO ILLEGAL ALIENS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to make some points that need to be \nmade at the end of the session.\n  Here we are, running right up against election time, and we are being \nheld hostage because the President of the United States wants to grant \namnesty to up to 4 million illegal aliens, people who haven't played by \nthe rules, haven't paid the price, who literally want to jump over \nthose who have played by the rules and who belong here--this blanket \namnesty all for the purpose of politics.\n  In fact, I heard one of the leading Democrats say: Boy, Telemundo and \nall of the Hispanic newspapers are really playing this up.\n  Well, that might be true in the Hispanic media, but I think Hispanic \npeople in this country want fairness above everything else. I think \nthey know what is going on here. They know darn well they are being \nplayed, and they are being played in a vicious way.\n  I once again urge President Clinton not to veto the Commerce-Justice-\nState appropriations bill the Senate passed on Friday.\n  President Clinton has threatened a veto because we did not include \nhis so-called Latino Fairness Act. But we have included something much \nbetter than his Latino Fairness Act: the Legal Immigration Family \nEquity Act, the LIFE Act.\n  This act reunites families and restores due process to those who have \nplayed by the rules. Our proposal does not pit one nationality against \nanother, nor does it pit one race against another. Our legislation \nprovides relief to immigrants from all countries, not just special \ncountries. A veto of CJS would be a blow against immigrant fairness. \nBut a veto would do far more than that.\n  A veto would cut off funding for some of our most important programs. \nThe CJS appropriation allocates $4.8 billion for the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service and an additional $15.7 million for Border \nPatrol equipment upgrades. It provides $3.3 billion for the FBI and \n$221 million for training, equipment, and research and development \nprograms to combat domestic terrorism. We are not playing around here. \nThis is important stuff. I don't think it is right to be playing \npolitics with the lives of immigrants at the end of the session just to \nobtain some cheap political advantage.\n  There is $4.3 billion allocated for the Federal prison system in CJS. \nThat is money we need to run the prison system and to treat people with \ndue process. Then we have $1.3 billion for the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration. This is critical to our fight against illegal drugs in \nthis country. There is $288 million for the Violence Against Women Act. \nThat is legislation that I have strongly supported and that provides \nassistance to battered women and children through a variety of \ndifferent programs.\n  Actions have consequences. If President Clinton vetoes this bill, he \nis putting the public safety and well-being at risk both at home and \nabroad, all in an effort to play wedge politics. The President's veto \nthreats ring hollow because this appropriations bill provides many \nproposals to help immigrants. The President himself has stated he wants \nto ``keep families together and to make our immigration policies more \nequitable.''\n  This is exactly what our LIFE Act that we have in the appropriations \nbill does. Had the White House proposed this during President Clinton's \nfirst 7 years in office, he might have been able to develop a mandate \nto grant amnesty to millions of undocumented aliens, aliens who have \nbroken our laws. But no such mandate exists.\n  The American people need to know that the INS, the FBI, and the \nBorder Patrol are being brought to the brink of a shutdown because \nPresident Clinton wants Congress to grant amnesty for up to 4 million \nillegal aliens, people who haven't played by the rules.\n  When we fought the H-1B legislation on the floor, many on the other \nside pointed out the difficulties of legal immigrant families. They \npointed out that children needed to be reunited with their parents, \nthat spouses needed to be reunited with their husbands and wives. I \nsaid I would try to do something about that.\n  We realized there was a problem with the late amnesty class of 1982 \nwho qualified for residency under the 1986 Act. We said we would try to \ndo something about that, and the LIFE Act does. The American people are \na fair people. The LIFE Act will take care of 1 million people who \neither don't have due process or who need to be reunited with their \nfamilies. It takes care of them first rather than granting amnesty to \nup to 4 million illegal people who haven't played by the rules, which \nis what the President wants to do. Fairness dictates that we not grant \namnesty to millions of illegal aliens when there are 3.5 million people \nwho have played by the rules waiting to come to the United States. The \nPresident should remember this inequitable proposal and reconsider what \nhe wants to do here.\n  Let me say a couple of other things. I have even let the White House \nknow that to determine if there are further inequities we will hold \nhearings right after we come back at the first of the year, and we will \nfind out what needs to be done to restructure INS, if necessary, to \nmake sure they treat people with more respect. We will consider these \npeople who President Clinton would like to help. But most of them are \nhere illegally and without further information, we think they should \nnot be jumped above or in front of these people who aren't here legally \nor who have been waiting in line to be reunited with their families.\n  We brought both sides together in this LIFE Act and brought a variety \nof\n\n[[Page S11330]]\n\ndifferent people into this. But there are some people who don't want \nany immigration to our country. They may live in States that are \noverrun with illegal immigrants; at least some of them do. Others don't \nseem to care about any rules, and I suspect the President is in that \ncategory. But we have brought these people together in the LIFE Act to \nresolve the problems that were mentioned during the H-1B debate. By \ngosh, I think it is time for the President to sign this bill and get \nabout doing the Nation's business. He should quit playing wedge \npolitics with these issues that are highly inflammable and about which \nhe can blame people in illegitimate and wrongful ways.\n  I have worked very hard, along with a number of others, to bring this \nabout in a way that is equitable, fair, and takes care of those who \nfirst need to be taken care of, with promises to hold hearings to see \nif there are any others who need the help and fairness that we can \ngrant. That is the best we can do this year. That is the best we can do \nat the end of this session. It is the best we can do in bringing people \ntogether.\n  I think we have done a good job getting it done, and I hope the \nPresident will go along with our proposal so we can continue funding \nthe INS, the Border Patrol, the FBI, training and equipment research \nand development programs to combat domestic terrorism, the Federal \nprison system, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. We must enact \nthe CJS Appropriations into law because it funds things that are \nabsolutely critical to this country. Moreover, it makes it possible for \n1 million people to get permanent residency, people who have been \nwaiting in line, have paid the price, and played by the rules.\n  This is a front-page issue in the Hispanic media, but most Americans \ndon't know what the President is trying to do because the mainstream \nmedia is not reporting this issue. The American people need to know \nwhat is going on here. I think it is a crass approach to play wedge \npolitics at the end of this session, holding us hostage so we can't get \nhome and campaign and do what we need to do. Right now, I would much \nrather be home in Utah than here in Washington. But as long as we have \nto be here, I am going to make these points to try to help all \nimmigrants, including Hispanics to receive fair treatment by the INS \nand by our immigration policies.\n  I am a cochairman of the Republican Senatorial Hispanic Task Force. I \nstarted it a number of years ago to make sure Hispanics are treated \nfairly and that Hispanic issues are given the attention they deserve. \nWe have done an awful lot in this area, and I think the LIFE Act is a \nvery good piece of legislation that will take us far down the road. \nAdditionally, we have made a promise to hold hearings next year to see \nif there are any other inequities that need to be remedied. We will be \nglad to do that.\n  We have 535 Members of Congress and a wide variety of viewpoints. I \nthink we have brought them together in a way that will work and solve \nsome of these problems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Utah would \nstay on the floor for a moment. It is my understanding that, as \nchairman of the Senate Committee, the Senator from Utah has \njurisdiction over immigration issues. I am trying to recall. In the \nlast 2 years, the only major immigration bill that I can recall was the \nH-1B visa bill that we considered. Is my memory accurate on that?\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't think it is. We have held a number of hearings. \nThe Subcommittee on Immigration holds hearings, which is chaired by \nSenator Abraham and the ranking member, Senator Kennedy. We have been \ntrying to do an agricultural bill, H-1B, H-1A. There are a whole raft \nof things we have been trying to do. We have also worked consistently \non the committee with the INS, the administration, and the Justice \nDepartment to resolve problems. I work on them all the time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Was there a bill brought to the floor from the \nSubcommittee on Immigration that dealt with the larger issues that the \nSenator is now addressing other than H-1B during the last 2 years?\n  Mr. HATCH. The visa waiver bill was brought to the floor. As I \nunderstands, we have had 8 years of this administration and they \nhaven't brought anything to the floor either, nor have they asked us to \ndo anything here.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, Senator Kennedy, and I have \neach introduced bills relative to the three elements the administration \nis urging and they have been pending for months now.\n  Frankly, I understand the good faith of the Senator from Utah, but \nwhen we literally have hundreds of thousands of people across America \nwhose fate is hanging in the balance here on a decision to be made by \nthe Senate and we have not seen on the Senate floor--other than the H-\n1B visa bill--frankly, some bills of smaller consequence, I think \nperhaps the Senator from Utah can understand the anxiety and concern of \nthese families.\n  I deal with these families all the time, and I am sure the Senator \ndoes, too. Two out of three of my constituent cases coming into the \nChicago office deal with immigration. I hear these heartbreaking \nstories about families that are torn apart because of some of the laws \nwe have passed, the failure of this Congress to respond to this. And I, \nfrankly, have urged the President to take the position he has taken--\ndon't go home and leave these poor families out there, frankly, \nlanguishing because we failed to address three basic things. We failed \nto say we are going to give those refugees who have come to this \ncountry and have faced the same kind of political persecution as \nrefugees from Nicaragua and Cuba--we believe they should receive equal \nand fair treatment. I don't think that is a radical idea. Secondly, \n245(i) says if you are going to get a chance to finally get your green \ncard and become a naturalized citizen, go through the process, we think \nit is an unreasonable hardship to force you to go back to your country \nof origin and apply for a visa, which is an economic hardship and, in \nmany cases, a danger that families should not go through.\n  I can't imagine why that is a radical idea. The idea of updating the \nregistry in this country that we have used to affect immigrants has \nbeen updated regularly since 1929. We are not bringing a radical notion \nto the Senate. In fact, we are following the tradition of Democratic \nand Republican administrations, and we have not had a bill come to the \nfloor.\n  We have hundreds of thousands of people whose lives hang in the \nbalance. Frankly, I can understand the position of the President, and I \nagree with him. I am sorry we have not had hearings on this issue nor \nbrought it to the floor; but to say that it is something we might look \nat next year is cold comfort to these people who, frankly, face the \nfear of being extradited or somehow removed from this country in a \nsituation that could be a great hardship to their families.\n  I say to the Senator from Utah, there is another side to the story. I \ndeal with it every day in my Chicago office and all across Illinois.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will allow me to respond, yes, there is \nanother side of the story. I work on it all the time. A high percentage \nof people who come to my office have immigration problems. I work very \nhard to try to resolve them. But for 7\\1/2\\ years the administration \nhas not raised this. We have had hearings on restructuring INS and \nstraightening out some of the problems. But for 7\\1/2\\ years, the INS \nhas fought against the 1982 people who we resolved in this bill called \nthe LIFE Act that is in this bill.\n\n  The Clinton administration INS has fought the 1982 class' efforts to \nget due process every year since I have been here. It is one of the \nthings that I wanted resolved, we have resolved it with the LIFE Act.\n  With regard to 245(i), I would like to do more, to be honest with \nyou. But that is a minor problem compared to bringing in before them \npeople who basically are illegal and who haven't played by the rules.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask the Senator----\n  Mr. HATCH. If you would let me finish my thought.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to ask you a question specifically on that point.\n  Mr. HATCH. Here is the problem. This was never faced by the \nadministration until the spring of last year.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have to say to the Senator that I sent a letter along \nwith\n\n[[Page S11331]]\n\nSenator Kennedy and Senator Reid asking, I think almost a year ago, for \nthis matter to be considered.\n  Mr. HATCH. You may have done that. The administration has fought us \non these issues, and frankly----\n  Mr. DURBIN. The administration supports our position.\n  Mr. HATCH. They do now and they didn't then. They support it now for \ncrass political purposes.\n  Let me say one other thing. The Senator has been on the Judiciary \nCommittee. He knows these are hot-button issues, and hot-button issues \nare very difficult issues to handle. He knows I want to solve these \nproblems. But he also knows that there is a wide disparity of belief in \nboth bodies, and it is almost impossible to bring everybody together \nand solve every problem, just like that. We have done our best.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We have not had a vote on this floor on this, have we?\n  Mr. HATCH. We have on the LIFE Act. It is part of the bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In terms of what we have proposed--the three bills we \nhave proposed--I don't believe we have had a vote on the floor on them.\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't think we have.\n  Mr. DURBIN. There are a number of people who have criticized Congress \nbecause we can't act in a bipartisan fashion. Frankly, we don't get a \nchance to act, if we can't bring a bill to the floor--and if we can't \nhave amendments and if we can't have debates and votes.\n  Mr. HATCH. One reason why it is difficult to do so is because of the \nwide disparity of different beliefs, and if one House or the other \nwon't let it come to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the only matters that we can consider are matter of \nconsensus, what in the world has this Chamber turned into? Why are we \nafraid of debate and amendments?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is not my point. In this climate, any single Senator \ncan stop anything. In the House of Representatives, any block of \nMembers can stop anything. These are hot-button issues, and I think it \nis pretty amazing what we have been able to get done.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me reclaim my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Can I make one last comment with the indulgence of my \nfriend?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. President Clinton properly signed the 1996 immigration \nbill. But now weeks before election day he seeks to turn the 1996 act \non its head.\n  I, too, want to help constituents. But putting several million people \nwho violated the immigration laws ahead of the line of the 3.5 million \npeople who are legitimately waiting and have waited for years to come \nhere legally, it seems to me, is wrong.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was happy to yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Especially under these circumstances.\n  Mr. DURBIN. But I certainly want to add a few things.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this image is being created under this \nimmigration act that we are talking about people who managed to sneak \ninto the United States illegally and who have lived their lives in \nviolation of the law and are now trying to sneak into citizenship. \nThere are people like that, I am sure, but they are an extremely small \nminority.\n  The vast majority of people we are concerned about are people such as \nSarah. Sarah is a 19-year-old girl in southern California. She was born \nin Mexico and adopted at the age of 4. English is her primary language. \nShe lives at home with her family. She is adored by her parents and her \nfive older siblings. She is also an illegal immigrant. Why is she an \nillegal immigrant? It turns out that Sarah's parents made a crucial \nmistake at the time of adoption. They didn't apply for citizenship. The \nfamily wrongly assumed that she automatically became a citizen when \nthey completed the formal adoption procedures in the California \ncourtroom. No one told them they had to file separately for \ncitizenship. It was only last year when they decided to take a trip to \nMexico and asked for a passport that they realized Sarah is here \nillegally.\n  Is this someone who managed to sneak across the border and is living \nin violation of the law?\n  There are thousands of Sarahs who are, frankly, looking for relief in \nCongress and who can make a contribution to the United States.\n  But the fact that we have not brought a serious immigration bill--but \nfor one H-1B visa bill--before Congress is the reason this President \nhas put his foot down and said: Congress, don't go home until you \naddress this problem.\n  There are people such as Sarah across America who deserve fair \ntreatment. Frankly, they have been ignored.\n  I count the Senator from Utah as my friend. But I have to say that \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee has not taken up this issue. They have \nignored it. He identified the reason: It is controversial.\n  When you talk about immigrants, there are a lot of people who say I \nknow how to exploit that issue. Let me tell you something. I know that \nis the case in my home State of Illinois. But I happen to be the son of \nan immigrant. I am very proud of the fact that I serve in this Senate \nas the son of immigrants. And many of us in this country look to our \nparents and grandparents as immigrants with great pride.\n  We should look at immigration fairly and honestly and in a legal way. \nYou can't do it if you run away from a debate on immigration law the \nway we have in the Senate for the last two years.\n  President Clinton, hold your ground. For those across America who are \nwaiting for us to do the fair and right and equitable thing for \nimmigrants, hold your ground. Insist that this Senate, before it goes \nhome, and this Congress, before it leaves to go back to campaign, are \nfair to those across America who are looking to be treated equitably \nand justly under our immigration system.\n  I am responding, of course, to what the Senator from Utah raised as \nan issue. It wasn't the reason I came to the floor, but I feel \npassionately about it.\n  Senator Kennedy, Senator Reid, and myself are the three major \nsponsors of the measure on which President Clinton is insisting. They \ncan add, I am sure, during the course of this debate their strong \nfeelings as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/29/senate-section/article/S11331-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11331-S11332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CHOOSING A PRESIDENT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in just a few days the American people get \nto make one of the most important decisions that we are ever called on \nto make, and that is to choose a leader for our country. It appears \nfrom all of the polls that the American people just can't decide. The \npolls go up and down every single week. You see one candidate ahead one \nweek and another candidate ahead the next. Frankly, the verdict of \npublic opinion will be rendered on November 7, and we will decide the \nleader for the next 4 years.\n  Many of us believe this is a decision of importance way beyond 4 \nyears. We think the next President is going to chart a course for many \nyears to come.\n  We have to make a very basic decision.\n  Frankly, if you believe that the Presidency is an easy \nresponsibility, and if you believe that America will run forward in a \npositive way on automatic pilot, then I think, frankly, you might be \ninclined to vote for Governor Bush because he has spoken in very \ngeneral terms about what he thinks about America. He has made specific \nproposals, which are fairly radical departures from what we have been, \nand he says everything is going to be fine; in fact, it will be better.\n  Many of us, though, can remember something that perhaps Governor Bush \nnever experienced. He was not a Governor in Texas during the period of \ntime when we dealt with the worst deficits in the history of the United \nStates in Washington. Under Presidents Reagan and Bush, we dealt with \ndeficits that were crippling to this American economy. I saw it in my \nhome State of Illinois with high unemployment and high inflation. \nPeople weren't building homes and weren't starting businesses. It was a \nvery bad time. We were in a recession. We paid a bitter price for it--\nfamilies and businesses across America. Thank goodness, in 1993, we \nturned a corner and started moving forward. Some of the things that \nhave happened since are absolutely historic.\n  If you take a look, since March 1991--which goes back to the Bush \nPresidency for a few months--we have had\n\n[[Page S11332]]\n\n115 months of straight economic expansion, the longest in the history \nof the United States.\n  Governor Bush may not remember what it was like back in the old days \nwhen we would get 12 months or so of economic expansion. But that is \nwhat America truly was like.\n  Look at what happened to the inflation rate during that same period \nof time.\n  In 1980, the inflation rate was over 12 percent. Then it went down at \nthe end of the administration of Jimmy Carter. Of course, it went down \nand it stayed down. But we have kept the inflation rate at the lowest \nsustained level since 1965.\n  These things don't happen easily or automatically. Those who think \nGovernor Bush can come to it with little or no experience and keep it \ngoing have to answer some questions. Will he be able to do as we have \ndone in the last 8 years--create 22 million new jobs? His father \ncreated 2\\1/2\\ million jobs during his 4 years; President Reagan, 16 \nmillion during his 8 years. Twenty-two million is a record, and it is a \nrecord of which we are proud. It means people have a chance.\n  But we can see Presidents who came on board such as former President \nBush who really didn't have good luck when it came to job creation and \ngetting people back to work.\n  Take a look at Federal spending.\n  The Republicans criticize Democrats as big spenders. Look what has \nhappened to Federal spending as a percentage of our gross domestic \nproduct. It has gone to one of the lowest levels since 1966. We have \nseen Federal spending heading down and we are being criticized for \nbeing big spenders. The fact is, we have not been. Just the opposite is \ntrue: For the people often left behind, the lowest poverty rate in 20 \nyears; African Americans and Hispanic Americans with the highest \nemployment rates in modern memory; improvement in education scores, an \nindication that everybody gets a chance to improve in this country.\n  The overall surplus we have seen generated is the largest in our \nhistory: $237 billion under the Clinton-Gore administration. Look at \nthe red ink under Presidents Reagan and Bush in the early years of \nClinton-Gore and how we turned the corner. There are those who think \nthat will continue, but it isn't true. If we go the wrong way on \ncritical decisions, we will pay the price.\n  The American Academy of Actuaries came out with their report last \nweek. They took a look at Governor Bush's proposal for Social Security \nand they said we would return to Federal budget deficits around 2015 \nunder George W. Bush's proposal. This group, which is nonpartisan, and \nis supposed to know basically more than most of us when it comes to \naccounting and actuary practice, concluded that Governor Bush's plan to \ncut taxes and divert Social Security payroll tax for individual \naccounts would make it all but impossible to eliminate the publicly \nheld national debt.\n  There is the choice, America. A choice for the next 4 years is \nwhether we will continue to make sure that we invest in America, keep \nthe economy moving forward, use fiscal discipline and fiscal \nconservatism, if you will, to make sure we pay down the national debt. \nI don't believe, nor does Vice President Gore, for that matter, that we \nshould risk the Social Security system by taking $1 trillion out of it, \nsomething that Governor Bush couldn't even explain in the last debate. \nHow do you take $1 trillion out of Social Security and then go ahead \nand spend the $1 trillion, except at the expense of Social Security \nrecipients? Are you going to cut the benefits? Are you going to \nincrease their payroll taxes? Are you going to change the retirement \nage?\n  All of these things are options that none of us want to face. If you \ntake an approach, and he suggested you may have no other alternative, \nyou may find yourselves battling away at a stock market which looks a \nlot like the roller coaster at Coney Island in Senator Moynihan's home \nState.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The time of the Senator is \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, be recognized for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/29/senate-section/article/S11332-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11332-S11334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WORK OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Nevada. I \ncommend my friend and colleague, the Senator from Illinois, in raising \nthese issues. I commend him because he has presented the facts to the \nSenate.\n  We never had an opportunity to vote on the 1996 Immigration Act. To \nrepresent that we did is not stating clearly the facts. That was \nwrapped into a conference report on an entirely different \nappropriation, which was a take-it-or-leave-it, after the legislation \npassed, I believe, 97-3, with strong bipartisan support, and it was \nafter days of hearing in the Senate that the Republicans took that and \nadded these provisions, some provisions which the Senator has \nmentioned.\n  This figure of 4 million is a traditional way of distorting and \nmisrepresenting a position, and then disagreeing with it. That is \npoppycock. It is red herring. The Senator from Utah ought to know \nbetter than that because that is completely inaccurate.\n  I can understand the frustration that many feel about this issue, and \nI commend the President for attempting to try and deal with it.\n  When we had this Latino Fairness Act, two prominent Republicans, the \nSenator from Florida and the chairman of the immigration committee, \nmade statements in favor of the position outlined by the Senator from \nIllinois. They were prepared. They understood that there may have been \ndifferences here, but they spoke to it.\n  The President is in a commendable position. I thank him for his \nleadership in this. I again thank the Senator from Illinois for \nbringing this matter to the attention of the Senate. I am very hopeful \nthat we will stay the course on this until we get some action on this, \nanother proposal that has a moratorium on the deportation of \nindividuals, which has been passed through the House on the suspension \ncalendar which addresses one of the regrettable aspects of the 1996 \nact. That has the bipartisan support of Chairman Hyde of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and Lamar Smith from the immigration committee, which \nvirtually passed unanimously in the House. I am hopeful we will pass \nthat, as well.\n  Halloween is here. I am watching the clock that is over the Senate \nright now. It has not been corrected. I don't know whether the goblins \nare out here, as well, but Halloween is here. While the Nation observes \nthis occasion only once a year, for this Republican Congress, every day \nis Halloween. This is the Halloween Congress: lavishing treats on the \nwealthy and cruel tricks on average families.\n  If he is elected, Governor Bush will borrow the idea and have a year-\nround Halloween White House in which powerful special interests hold \nsway and working families are left out and left behind. He said no to \nworking families in Texas and he wants to say no to average Americans \nfor 4 more years this time from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He wants to \nsay no to Social Security, no to Medicare, no to a fair prescription \ndrug benefit for senior citizens, no to the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nno to improving the public schools, no to health care for uninsured \nchildren, no to fair tax cuts for average families, no to fighting hate \ncrimes, no to fairness for lawful immigrants, no to gun safety laws.\n  There is no clearer example of how our Republican friends have \nkowtowed to powerful special interests than the tax bill before the \nSenate. Rather than meet the urgent priorities of the American people, \nRepublicans have spent the past 2 weeks huddled behind closed doors to \nproduce a quarter-trillion-dollar tax package tilted overwhelmingly \ntoward the powerful and not toward the average families.\n  In fact, the top 5 percent of taxpayers will receive a greater share \nof the tax breaks under this Republican tax scheme than the bottom 80 \npercent of all taxpayers combined. There is little to distinguish this \nplan from the previous discredited proposals by the Republican \nleadership in Congress and by George W. Bush. In many ways the items in \nthis package are even more cynical.\n\n  The Republicans know that millions of Americans are deeply concerned\n\n[[Page S11333]]\n\nabout the lack of health insurance for low- and middle-income families. \nSo this bill lowers the cost of health insurance for wealthier people \nwho are already insured. Madam President, 95 percent of the people who \nwill benefit under this bill in terms of the health insurance benefits \nare individuals who are already insured, not any expansion for those \nwho have no health insurance today.\n  Republicans know that millions of Americans are concerned about \nsaving enough for retirement, so this bill fattens the pension \nopportunities available to the highest level corporate executives. \nRepublicans know that millions of children and working families are \nhaving trouble feeding their families even in this time of prosperity. \nSo this bill increases the tax breaks that corporations can claim for \nthree-martini lunches, dinners, and other entertainment.\n  Republicans know that millions of families struggle to care for \nelderly or disabled family members at home, so their tax bill lowers \nthe cost of luxury nursing facilities for wealthy families.\n  Millions of low-wage workers are depending on Congress to raise the \nminimum wage this year before we adjourn. But Republicans seem to care \nso little about the minimum wage that they have repealed it for 6 \nmonths of next year in their tax bill. It was, apparently, an \ninadvertent mistake, or perhaps a Freudian slip. But if they had worked \nwith Democrats and shown us the provision, we could have prevented such \nan embarrassing mistake. An increase in the minimum wage may be an \nafterthought for the Republican leadership, but it means food on the \ntable and clothes for the children for the 12 million workers who \nbenefit. To eliminate the minimum wage, even for 6 months, would be a \ndisaster for these families.\n\n  Here we are in the final hours of this Congress and still we have \nbeen denied the opportunity to even vote whether this body thinks we \nshould vote for a 50-cent increase in the minimum wage today--which is \nnow $5.15 an hour--and 50 cents next year, at the time we have the \ngreatest economic expansion in the history of this country.\n  On the other hand, under Republican leadership the Congress raised \nits salary by $4,800 last year and again by $3,600 this year. Congress \nmade sure nothing got in the way. Congressional pay was not eliminated \nfor 6 months. Congress did not say Congressional salaries would be \nincreased only if accompanied by $100 billion in tax breaks. Isn't that \ninteresting? Our Republican leaders have told us yes, you can have \nraises, rather than the people who are going to be affected by an \nincrease in the minimum wage if we have $73 billion in tax breaks. We \ndid not have that kind of requirement when we increased our own \nbenefits, but evidently for the hardest working families, many of those \nwho have two or three jobs to try to make ends meet, that is the block \nthat is put in front of them.\n  Madam President, 535 Senators and Representatives received a raise \nwithout a hitch. The 12 million Americans who would receive a raise in \nthe minimum wage deserve the same. It is a children's issue, a families \nissue, a civil rights issue.\n  I hope this Republican Congress will act to pass the minimum wage \nbefore adjourning this year.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I will be happy to.\n  Mr. REID. Isn't it true, all over this country there are State and \nminimum wage laws that are much higher than $5.15 an hour? It is not as \nif Congress is breaking some new ground. The fact is, in several States \nthey have a higher minimum wage than we are trying to advocate; is that \nnot true?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. In a number of communities we \nhave living wage regions, in many of the major cities of this country, \nwhich have been successful. But there are those, including Governor \nBush, whose position is to say the States ought to be able to opt out \non the minimum wage. When you realize the minimum wage in the State of \nTexas is $3.35 an hour, when we have seen the prosperity which is \nacross this country, that raises serious questions about the real \ninterest in any working families.\n  I want to take the time remaining to talk about two public policy \nareas, first on education and then on health care. If Governor Bush's \nrecord in Texas is any indication, average Americans, who work day \nafter day to make ends meet, will be an afterthought in a Bush \nadministration.\n  The Republican Congress says he has the answers to education. He \ncalls his record in Texas an education miracle. But if you look at the \nrecord, it is more of an education mirage than an education miracle. \nUnder Governor Bush, in 1998, according to the National Center for \nEducation Statistics, Texas ranks 45th in the Nation in high school \ncompletion rates; 71 percent of high school dropouts in Texas are \nminorities; Hispanic students in Texas drop out at more than twice the \nrate of white students in the State. So if education is the biggest \ncivil rights issue in America, as Governor Bush proclaimed at the \nPresidential debates, he flunked the test in Texas.\n  Last August, the College Boards reported that nationally, from 1997 \nto the year 2000, SAT scores have increased. But in Texas, they have \ndecreased. In 1997, Texas was 21 points below the SAT national average. \nBy 2000, the gap had grown by 26 points.\n\n  Then, last Thursday, Governor Bush heard more bad news. The Rand \nCorporation released an education bombshell that raises serious \nquestions about the validity of gains in student achievements in Texas \nclaimed by the Governor. The Rand bombshell was all the more \nembarrassing because in August Governor Bush said:\n\n       Our State has done the best, not measured by us, but \n     measured by the Rand Corporation who take an objective look \n     at how States are doing when it comes to education.\n\n  Those are the Governor's words. Clearly, at that time Governor Bush \ntrusted the conclusions made by the Rand Corporation because he was \nreferring to a Rand report that looks at scores in Texas from 1990 to \n1996. In fact, Senator Hutchison cited those findings on the floor of \nthe Senate on Thursday.\n  But most of the years covered by the earlier Rand report were before \nBush became Governor. The new Rand report released earlier this week \nanalyzes the scores from 1994 to 1998, when George W. Bush was the \nGovernor. The achievement gap in Texas is not closing, it is widening. \nWhat is the Governor's solution? Test, test, tests and more tests.\n  In August, Governor Bush said:\n\n       Without comprehensive regular testing, without knowing if \n     children are really learning, accountability is a myth and \n     standards are just slogans.\n\n  We all know tests are an important indication of student achievement, \nbut the Rand study questions the validity of the Texas State test \nbecause Governor Bush's education program was teaching to the test \ninstead of genuinely helping children to learn.\n  These are the results. We find out the objective standards, whether \nwe take it from the Rand Corporation or the National Center for \nEducation Statistics. When it was favorable to Texas, it was quoted ad \ninfinitum by strong supporters of the Governor. But, those successes \napplied to the education policies that were developed prior to the time \nthe Governor became Governor.\n  If we want a true solution to improving education, we should look at \nthe success of States such as North Carolina, which is improving \neducation the right way: Investing in schools, improving teacher \nquality, expanding afterschool programs--all in order to produce better \nresults for students. The Bush plan mandates more tests for children, \nbut it does nothing to ensure that schools actually improve and \nchildren actually learn.\n  We know immediate help for low-performing schools is essential. We \nknow we can turn around failing schools when the Federal Government, \nStates, parents, and local schools work together as partners to provide \nthe needed investments.\n  In North Carolina, low-performing schools are given technical \nassistance from special State teams who provide targeted support to \nturn around low-performing schools. In the 1997-1998 school year, 15 \nNorth Carolina schools received intensive help from these State-\nassisted teams. In August 1998, the State reported most of these \nschools achieved exemplary growth and not one school remained in the \nlow-performing category. Last year, 11 North Carolina schools received \nsimilar help; 9 met or exceeded their targets.\n\n[[Page S11334]]\n\n  That is the kind of aid to education that works--not just tests, but \nrealistic action to bring about realistic change for students' \neducation. And, correspondingly, the test scores for the students in \nNorth Carolina have risen 10 points above the national average during \nthis period.\n  The Democratic proposal to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act incorporate the proven approaches that have demonstrated \nbetter results for children. But the Republican leadership has blocked \nany opportunity to debate education. The Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, for the first time in 35 years, will not be acted on by \nCongress.\n  The Vice President, Al Gore, supports programs to improve public \nschools which have been proven effective. The best example we have is \nNorth Carolina. Those programs are tried and tested and demonstrated to \nbe successful. That is what we believe ought to be done in the future \nfor public education in this country. Yet those programs that have been \ntried and tested in the State of Texas are not improving education for \nchildren. Education is a prime issue for families, and we ought to look \nat the results. When you look at them carefully, you have to realize \nthat what has been outlined as an educational miracle by the Governor \njust does not measure up--it's just an education mirage.\n\n  Instead of taking steps that will work, Governor Bush abandons the \nlow-performing schools. He proposes a private school voucher plan that \ndrains needed resources from troubled schools and traps low-income \nchildren in them. In the Vietnam war, it was said we had to destroy \nsome villages in order to save them. That is what Governor Bush has in \nstore for failing schools: a Vietnam war strategy that will destroy \nthem instead of save them.\n  Parents want smaller class sizes where teachers can maintain order \nand give one-to-one attention students need to learn. Parents want a \nqualified teacher in every classroom in America. Parents want modern \nschools that are safe learning environments for their children. GAO \nfound that $112 billion was necessary for our schools to meet health \nand safety standards and environmental standards, to make critical \nrepairs, and to ensure they are wired for modern technologies. That is \nwhy we want strong support for our school modernization and \nconstruction program that the Republican leadership has consistently \nopposed.\n  Here we are 4 weeks into the next fiscal year. Republicans have said \nthat education is their top priority, but instead, they have made \neducation their last priority.\n  Parents and students alike want an increase in Pell grants to help \nyoung people afford the college education they need to compete in the \nnew economy.\n  The vast majority of Americans want us to address these challenges, \nand Al Gore and the Democrats in Congress will do just that. We will \ncontinue to fight hard for education priorities that parents and local \nschools are demanding.\n  There is much good news about education across the nation. More \nstudents are taking the SATs so they can gain entrance into college. We \nsee these numbers going up every year.\n  More and more students are taking advanced math and science classes \nin precalculus, calculus, and physics. We know there are schools in \nsome parts of the country where the children cannot even read and write \nan essay. We ought to be doing something about it. The Republicans \ncondemn those schools, but they have no plan to improve them.\n  Finally, the SAT math scores are the highest in 30 years. The SATs \nare taken by young people who want to go on to college. Those who are \ntaking math now--many of the children who are taking the advanced \ncourses are going to do better. That is what we want, isn't it? We want \nall these indicators to go in the right direction--better results for \nchildren.\n  As we come into these final weeks, parents ought to look at the \nMembers of Congress, the Members of the Senate, and the Presidential \ncandidates and where they stand on education. Democrats and Al Gore \nstand for an investment in children that will produce better results: \nsmaller class sizes, a qualified teacher in every classroom in America \nin 4 years, a strong downpayment on meeting the nation's school \nmodernization and construction needs, more afterschool programs to keep \nchildren safe and out of trouble and give them extra time for learning, \ntoo.\n  We should support these policies to improve public schools, and we \nshould oppose policies by the Republican leadership and Governor Bush \nto abandond public schools. The nation's children deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/29/senate-section/article/S11334-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11334-S11335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, few issues are of greater concern to \nAmerican families than quality, affordable health care. Americans want \nan end to HMO abuses. They want good health insurance coverage. They \nwant a prescription drug benefit for senior citizens under Medicare. \nThey want to preserve and strengthen Medicare, so that Medicare will be \nthere for both today's senior citizens and tomorrow's senior citizens. \nAnd they want these priorities not only for themselves and their loved \nones but for every American, because they know that good health care \nshould be a basic right for all.\n  The choice in this election is clear on health care--and it is not \njust a choice between different programs. It is also a choice based on \nwho can be trusted to do the right thing for the American people. Al \nGore's record and his proposals are clear. He has been deeply involved \nin health care throughout his career. The current administration has \nmade significant progress in improving health care in a variety of \nways--from expanding health insurance for children to protecting \nMedicare for seniors. He has consistently stood for patients and \nagainst powerful special interests.\n  Al Gore has laid out a constructive program that is consistent with \nhis solid record. He is for expanding insurance coverage to all \nAmericans, starting with children and their parents. He is for a strong \nPatients' Bill of Rights to end abuses by HMOs. He has a sensible plan \nfor adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare. He will fight to \npreserve Medicare, without unacceptable changes designed to undermine \nMedicare and force senior citizens into HMOs and private insurance \nplans.\n  George W. Bush's approach is very different. His proposals are deeply \nflawed. But even worse than the specifics of his proposals is his \nfailure to come clean with the American people about his record in \nTexas or about his own proposals.\n  On health care, George Bush doesn't just have a credibility gap. He \nhas a credibility chasm.\n  He has consistently stood with the powerful against the people. He \nrefuses to take on the drug companies--or the insurance companies--or \nthe HMOs. His budget plan puts tax cuts for the wealthy ahead of every \nother priority, and leaves no room for needed investments in American \nfamilies. On health care, his values are not the values of the American \npeople.\n  On the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights, George Bush said in the \nthird debate that he supports a national Patients' Bill of Rights. He \nsaid he wanted all people covered. He said that he was in favor of a \npatient's right to sue, as provided under Texas law. He said he brought \nRepublicans and Democrats together in the State of Texas to pass a \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  That's what he said, but it is not true. Governor Bush knows his \nrecord on health care can't stand the light of day. So on national TV, \nhe patently deceived the American people about his record, hoping no \none would notice, or else hoping people would give him a pass because \nhe didn't know any better and simply spouted what his spin doctors had \ngiven him.\n\n  But the truth has a way of coming to the surface. Here is what he did \non the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  He vetoed the first Patients' Bill of Rights passed in Texas. He \nfought to make the second bill as narrow and limited as possible. He \nwas so opposed to the provision allowing patients to sue their HMOs \nthat he refused to sign the final bill, allowing it to become law \nwithout his signature. That is not a record that recommends him for \nnational office to any citizen concerned about a strong, effective \nPatients' Bill\n\n[[Page S11335]]\n\nof Rights. It is the record of a candidate who stands with powerful \ninsurance companies and HMOs, not with American families, and he isn't \nhonest about his record.\n  On Thursday, Senator Hutchison stated that the only reason Governor \nBush vetoed the first bill and let the right to sue under the second \nbill become law without his signature was because there was \ndisagreement on how high the caps on pain and suffering would be. I \nregret that my colleague has been misled. The fact is that there was no \nprovision for lawsuits in the first Patients' Bill of Rights bill \nvetoed by the Governor. Let me reiterate--there was no provision for \nlawsuits at all in the first bill. Yet the Governor vetoed it.\n  In the second bill, there was also no issue about the caps on pain \nand suffering. Texas already had caps on pain and suffering under its \ngeneral tort law, and everyone assumed that those caps would apply to \nlawsuits against HMOs. There was never any discussion of this issue. \nThe fact is that Governor Bush, despite what he says today, simply does \nnot believe that health plans should be held accountable. That is why \nhe refused to sign the law allowing suits against HMOs. Once again, he \nhas distorted his record in Texas--and both the record and the \ndistortions call into serious question where he would stand as \nPresident.\n  Governor Bush is quick to challenge the integrity of others. But on \nthis issue, his integrity is on the line as well. ``Distort, dissemble, \nand deny'' on an issue as important as this is not a qualification for \nthe next President of the United States.\n  On health insurance, the record is equally clear--and equally bleak. \nGovernor Bush claims he wants insurance for all Americans. He blames \nVice President Gore for the growth in the number of the uninsured. But \nGovernor Bush's record in Texas is one of the worst in the country. \nTexas has the second highest proportion of uninsured Americans in the \ncountry. It has the second highest proportion of uninsured children in \nthe country. Yet, Governor Bush has not only done nothing to address \nthis problem, he has actually fought against solutions. In Texas, he \nplaced a higher priority on large new tax breaks for the oil industry, \ninstead of good health care for children and their families.\n  When Congress passed the Child Health Insurance Program in 1997, we \nput affordable health insurance for children within reach of every \nmoderate- and low-income working family in America. Yet George Bush's \nTexas was one of the last States in the country to fully implement the \nlaw. Despite the serious health problems faced by children in Texas, \nGovernor Bush actually fought to keep eligibility as narrow as \npossible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would like to say a number of \nthings. First of all, there is no reason for us to be here today on \nSunday. It is not necessary. No good purpose is occurring. We had weeks \nof debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. The Senator from \nMassachusetts is repeating those arguments. We had weeks of debate on \neducation, of which I was a part.\n  Now we come back, at the very end, and we are going to have a rehash \nof all of that. The President is going to hold up this legislation \nneeded to operate this Government. He asks that the Congress come back \non a daily basis--even on Sunday--to debate it. Somehow he thinks maybe \nthrough this political mechanism he can change a dynamic that is taking \nplace in the American public. They are beginning to make a decision \nthat, in my view, the White House is not happy about, and they are \ndesperate to try to change that dynamic, to change that trend, and to \ntry to create a disturbance on the floor of this Congress about matters \nwe have been talking about all year, that should not be coming up now.\n  There is no need for us to be here today. But we are here. I will be \nhere every day that we need to be here. I will be here until Christmas. \nI will be here, Lord willing, after this President leaves office. And \nwe will be talking about these issues.\n  It is important that we do the right thing, that we not just be \nstampeded and pushed around and be worried about elections so we are \nafraid to vote because the President is out here saying ugly things \nabout us if we don't do what he says. It is our duty to do the right \nthing. We have been considering these issues for months. We have been \ndebating them for months. That is all we are about here today, to do \nthe right thing.\n  I hope the leaders on this side of the aisle do not do things just to \nget out of here. I am willing to stay, and other people I know are \nwilling to stay, if need be, to debate and work toward a reasonable \ncompromise, or to stand firm, if need be, on the issues that are \nimportant to America.\n  I know the Senator from Massachusetts discussed the patients' bill of \nrights that Governor Bush allowed to become law in Texas. That bill did \nhave the right to sue in it. It was a big part of our debate in the \nHELP Committee--the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--\nof which I am a member and of which the Senator from Massachusetts is a \nmember.\n  As I recall, several months ago, the Democrats were all touting this \nTexas bill because it has the right to sue in it, beyond what I think \nought to be made a part of a health care reform bill.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights that came out of this Senate was \ndebated. Amendments were offered on this floor. And they lost. The bill \nthat came out of this Senate--and that is in debate in conference \ntoday--what does it do?\n  When we talk about the right to sue, we are not talking about a \ndoctor who might cut off the wrong leg and that you can't sue that \ndoctor. It simply is, if an insurance company says this procedure--for \nexample, maybe it is a cosmetic procedure and is not covered in your \ninsurance policy, so they cannot pay for it; and the patient says: Yes. \nI think you should pay for it. So they want to have suits for punitive \ndamages that go for years.\n\n  So what was created in this legislation was a mechanism for every \npatient to have certain rights to get a prompt and full determination \nof what is just, and get their coverage if they are entitled to it.\n  The way it would work would be that a physician could call and talk \nto an insurance company physician, an expert. If they do not agree that \nthis was covered, they then could appeal to an out-of-the-insurance \ncompany expert or arbitrator approved by HCFA, the Health Care \nFinancing Administration--the Federal Government--President Clinton's \nHCFA. They could then appeal and get an objective ruling on whether or \nnot this was covered. Then there are certain litigation rights that \ncontinue to exist, in any case.\n  But what I am hearing is, business companies that are providing \ninsurance to their employees are saying: This costs us a lot of money. \nWe are doing it for our employees. But if you are going to have us \nsued, Congress, we will just get out of the business of insuring our \nemployees. We will just give our employees a certain amount of money \nand they can buy insurance or not buy insurance. It will not be our \nproblem if they do not buy it. Tough luck. We have been doing this, but \nwe are not going to be in the position that we are going to be sued.\n  That was a big deal in this very Congress. And the law in Texas is \nmore generous on lawsuits than the one we approved in this Senate.\n  Senator Kennedy wanted wide-open lawsuits. He supported that \naggressively, but he lost. He did not win that issue. It is not the \nwill of this Senate. We ought not to be worrying about this\n\n[[Page S11336]]\n\nat this point in time, this late in the day, when we need to approve \nlegislation to fund this Government.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts also came to the floor to talk about \neducation. Yes, it is a top priority. We are increasing funding for \neducation. I am on the education committee. We discussed that. In the \nlast 2 years this Congress has spent more money on education than \nPresident Clinton asked for. We increased his request for education \nmoney. We spent more than he asked for.\n  But what was the debate? It went on an extended period of time right \nhere. The debate was: Who is going to direct how it all gets spent? \nWere we going to trust the men and women who run our schools, the men \nand women who have been elected in each one of our communities to be on \nthe school board? Are we going to trust them to spend more of this \nFederal money or are we going to continue to micromanage education \ndollars from Washington?\n  I have been in 20 schools this year. I have met with principals, \nteachers, and students in each of these schools. I always set a time to \nmeet with the principals and teachers, and usually school board members \ndrop in, and I ask them what their problems are.\n  I say: The Federal Government gives about 7 percent of the cost of \neducation in America; 93 percent comes from State and local \ngovernments. I ask: Based on the regulations and paperwork, the \ninterruption in your ability to discipline in the schools caused by \nFederal regulation, which would you prefer--the Federal Government take \nits 7 percent and leave, take away the paperwork and the rules and \nregulations, or get the 7 percent?\n  The answer: Take your money and go.\n  These are teachers who have given their lives to education. They are \npassionate about this. They don't want a Federal bureaucracy in \nWashington running their schools. What they would like is as much money \nas we can get to them. And we are increasing funding for State \neducation well above the inflation rate, two or three times the \ninflation rate above what President Clinton has asked for. We tried to \npass a new Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which is up for \nreauthorization this year. We had to stop considering it basically \nbecause of a filibuster from the other side. We voted. We had \namendments. We went on for over 2 weeks debating the issue.\n  The other side was losing that debate. They were losing the votes. \nBut if you don't have over 60 votes here, you can't shut off debate. \nThe majority leader urged them to agree to a time limit. He said we can \nhave many more amendments, and let's vote on them and bring this bill \nto conclusion. But they would not because, in fact, they had a \nfilibuster going on. They did not want to change this old educational \nsystem that is run by bureaucracies 10 feet deep, people who have lost \nsight of what education is all about. All they want to do is make sure \ntheir accounting is right in every school system in America.\n  There are over 700 Federal education programs in this country. The \nother side keeps arguing that we can't get rid of them. No, we can't \nconsolidate them. No, we can't trust the people in our communities we \nelect to run our schools. No, they are not to be trusted. We have to \ntell them what to do. One Senator on this floor said: They may spend \nthe money on swimming pools. Who knows best how to educate children--\nprofessional educators, teachers who have given their lives to it, \nprincipals who are dedicated to it, or some Senator here who has \nthousands of issues that come before them, everything from Medicare, \nSocial Security, the attack on the U.S.S. Cole, all those issues? We \ndon't know education. Neither does Al Gore know education.\n  I will tell you who has been wrestling with education for six years, \nand that is the Governor of Texas. Governors are involved in education. \nWhen he talks about education, he talks about it with a deep and \nabiding passion because he understands it. He has been in schools all \nover Texas. He is hearing the same things I have heard in the 20 \nschools I have been in around Alabama this year: that the Federal \nGovernment is not an aid, is not helping us, it is hurting us.\n  We have Federal regulations that keep children in classrooms who are \na threat to the teacher and the students, and they cannot be removed \nbecause of Federal rules. We have paperwork that is driving them crazy. \nThey can't spend the money on what they need to spend it on. They have \nto spend it only on what this Government and its 700 education programs \nsay to spend it on.\n  So we tried to fix that. We couldn't do it because of the President \nand the filibuster that went on here. If we elect the Governor of \nTexas, who has managed education, as Governors do, who ran on \neducation, got elected on education, and was elected with a 69-percent \nvote for reelection on education, we are going to get some changes.\n\n  The bureaucrats in Washington, the special interest crowd in \nWashington, the group that tries to turn out votes in elections, those \npeople are not going to be happy. But teachers, principals, parents, \nand school board members are going to be happy because it is time for a \nchange. It is time to break this Washington stranglehold on education. \nWe give less than 10 percent of the money for education, but we \nmicromanage how it is all spent. It is not acceptable, and we must stop \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/29/senate-section/article/S11336-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11336-S11337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that morning \nbusiness be extended with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 \nminutes each until 7:30 p.m.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, will the time from now until \n7:30 be equally divided? I think the Republicans may have extra minutes \nremaining from the earlier hour. Could the Chair tell us how much time \nthe Republicans have used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Republican side, there is approximately \n10 minutes remaining; on the Democratic side, there is 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that the Chair take that into consideration in \ndividing up the next approximately 55 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the time being equally \ndivided between the parties?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The time that has been allocated, the 10 minutes to \nthe majority and 1 minute to the minority, should go forward, after \nwhich it would be equally divided.\n  Mr. REID. That is what I said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, to conclude on this education matter, \nthis Congress has been responsible. It has increased funding for \neducation well above the inflation rate. It has increased funding for \neducation the last 2 years that I have been on the education committee, \nI know for a fact, above what the President asked for.\n  We believe that money ought to be sent down to the States. It ought \nto be sent to them, and they ought to be challenged to develop, as \nTexas did, a plan of excellence. That ought to be ultimately determined \nby good, sound testing that that State adopts so it can tell whether \nlearning is occurring.\n  There are schools in this country, unfortunately, where learning is \nnot occurring. They are dysfunctional schools. We do not need to keep \nputting money in those kinds of circumstances. Good quality testing can \ntell whether learning is occurring. We ought to allow the men and women \nwhom you and I elect in our hometowns all over America to decide how to \nrun that fundamentally.\n  Yes, we will want to have controls on it, certain rules and \nregulations, but fundamentally we need to have a different mindset. We \nneed to have a mindset that says to the educators, the people who are \nin our classroom, that we trust you, we are trying to help you, not \nmake your life more troublesome, not giving you more headaches and \npaperwork; we want to help you teach our children, to help create more \nmagic moments in that classroom where learning occurs.\n  There are good schools in Alabama and all over America. I have been \nin those schools. I had the honor to acknowledge a few days ago Mr. \nTerry Beasley, the principal of the year for the State of Alabama. He \ntaught my children in public schools in Alabama.\n\n[[Page S11337]]\n\n He is a magnificent person with an unbelievable degree of dedication \nto learning. He has gone from one of the greatest teachers I have known \nto one of the best principals one would know.\n  There are people like that all over the system. We are not helping \nthem. This governmental regulation and bureaucracy is making it worse \nand making their lives more difficult. We can improve that, but not the \nway we are going. We are going to need some changes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I see the distinguished senior \nSenator from Massachusetts has been at it again, trying to bring the \nPresidential campaign to the Senate floor and misrepresenting the \nrecord in Texas. Once again, as promised, I am here to stand up for the \nrecord of the Governor of Texas and to stand up for the State of Texas.\n  I ask my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts, if \nhe would consider in the future not misrepresenting Texas for two \nreasons:\n  One is, I don't think it is persuasive to anyone in America to \ncontinue to hear the downgrading of a State in our country, and I \ncertainly don't think it affects the Presidential race. Secondly, I \njust don't think that it is necessary or proper to downgrade a great \nState such as Texas or any other State in America.\n  Of course, I am from Texas; of course, I love my State. But I think, \nobjectively speaking, a lot of other people do because we have just \nsurpassed New York to become the second largest State in America. \nPeople are not moving there because they think we have a terrible \neducation system. They are not moving there because they think we don't \ntreat our children well. They are not moving there because we don't \nhave health insurance for our children. They are not moving there \nbecause we have a bad environment. They are moving there because it is \na wonderful place in which to live, and it has gotten better since \nGeorge W. Bush became Governor.\n  So let me just set the record straight. We have a patients' bill of \nrights in Texas. It is the model upon which other States are now basing \nthe laws that they are beginning to pass or look at passing. We have a \nvery good patients' bill of rights because it has an independent review \nmechanism. You have an internal review and you have an external review. \nIt is an independent review so that the bottom line that we all want \nwill occur, and that is that a patient will get the care the patient \nand the doctor believe is in the best interest of the patient. That is \nwhat a patients' bill of rights is. We also have caps on limits for \nlawsuits which are allowed after the exhaustion of the internal and \nexternal reviews. There are caps on pain and suffering and noneconomic \ndamages. That makes sure that we don't have a plethora of lawsuits, and \nit would keep the patient and the doctor making the decisions for \nhealth care in the forefront of our interest. So it is a model law. It \nis a good law. Whatever misrepresentations have been made about it, the \nGovernor allowed it to become law. It happened on his watch.\n  Secondly, we are very proud of the improvements we are making in our \npublic education system. Most States are not satisfied with where they \nare in public education. Texas is working very hard to improve our \npublic education system, and under the leadership of Governor George W. \nBush we are winning. Test scores are going up and, most especially, the \ntest scores are going up in the minority communities. That is one of \nthe focuses that Governor Bush has made in my home State of Texas \nbecause we all looked at the high school dropout rate. We were all \nunsatisfied with that number. We said, what can we do, especially in \nour Hispanic community, where the high school dropout rate is the \nhighest per capita? We said, we have to go back to the basics.\n  That is what Governor Bush did. He went back to the basics and he put \nthe resources into it. That is about $8 million more than had been \nspent before. He said, we are going to go to the third grade level and \nthat is going to be the firewall. We are going to test children in \npreschool; we are going to test them in the first grade and in the \nsecond grade. But if they can't read at grade level in the third grade, \nthey will not be promoted to the fourth grade because we know that if \nchildren can't read at the early stages, they will never be able to \nreach their full potential in the public education system. That was the \ninitiative of Governor Bush and, I might add, along with a great house \nspeaker, Pete Leahy, a Democrat, and a Lieutenant Governor--at the time \nit was Bob Bullock, a Democrat; today, it is Rick Perry, a Republican. \nBut we do work in a bipartisan way in the legislature. We always have \nin Texas. That is something that we have done since the days I served \nin the Texas legislature. We worked together, Democrats and \nRepublicans. It is why I was so surprised when I came to the Senate and \nit didn't work that way here. We are not used to doing business that \nway.\n\n  With all due respect, I think Texas has it right because after the \nelections in Texas, we come together--the Governor and the \nlegislature--to do what is best for the children and the people of \nTexas. Wouldn't it be refreshing if that were the case in Washington, \nDC? Wouldn't it be refreshing if the leadership that Governor Bush has \nshown, along with Pete Leahy and Bob Bullock, could be transferred to \nWashington, DC, with President Bush and Tom Daschle and Richard \nGephardt? Wouldn't that be refreshing? That is what Governor Bush would \nlike to do because we think it works. We know it works because the test \nscores show that it works.\n  Madam President, we are making a huge leap in the right direction for \nimproving public education, and we are going to the heart of the \nmatter. We are making sure our children in the third grade can read, \nand we are focusing on the basics. We are focusing on reading, writing, \narithmetic, history.\n  All of us have seen these polls of young people in our country where \nthe television person walks up to the young person and says: What is \nthe only State in America that is totally surrounded by water?\n  The young person can't answer the question. We know Hawaii is the \nanswer, but I think we should focus on the basics--geography and \nhistory. That is what we are trying to do in Texas, and that is the \nkind of leadership we need for this country.\n  So I hope that we will examine the record in Texas in a positive \nway--or even in a neutral way, for Heaven's sake--because if you are \nneutral, you would see that Texas is a great place in which to live; \nthat we have a great quality of life. Do we have problems? Sure. Are we \nworking on those problems? Yes. We are doing it under the leadership of \nour Governor, George W. Bush.\n  Let me say, too, that we are also making great strides on the \nenvironment. We have a particular problem, particularly in Houston, TX, \nwhere 50 percent of the chemical refining plants in the world are \nlocated--the petrochemical refining plants. Fifty percent of the \npetrochemicals in the world are located on the gulf coast between \nHouston and Victoria.\n  I see that my time is up. I will step back and allow others to speak, \nbut I will not step back if the record of Texas is misrepresented. I am \nhere to stand for the facts and the good record of our Governor and our \ngreat State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Parliamentary inquiry. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Of course.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand we will have some time. The House has not \nconcluded with the continuing resolution. I understand it is agreeable \nwith the leaders that the time remaining will be divided equally. Is \nthe time remaining equally divided between the two sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The previous order provided that the remaining \ntime until 7:30 would be equally divided.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/29/senate-section/article/S11337-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11337-S11338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      GORE-CHERNOMYRDIN AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise as one Senator in this \nbody\n\n[[Page S11338]]\n\nand as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee to express the hope \nthat by noon tomorrow the State Department will provide for the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee the document that it has rightfully \nrequested so that it might know the truth with respect to the Gore-\nChernomyrdin agreement.\n  Since I have been a Senator these last 4 years, I have had occasion \nto meet with the Vice President and Mr. Chernomyrdin when they came to \nCapitol Hill to trumpet what was represented to us as the great \nsuccesses of their relationship and our outreach to Russia and to help \nRussia in its transition to democracy. In every way possible, we have \nhoped to conduct our business with Russia on better terms than we have \nin the past.\n  I think it is appropriate for this Republican to say that, without \nquestion, no one should question the motives of Vice President Gore \nwith respect to what he has tried to accomplish in this relationship. \nHowever, there is reason to believe that some of what has gone on with \nthe best of motives may, in fact--I emphasize ``may''--have violated a \nlaw and a statute of this country, if not a constitutional requirement \nin article II of the Constitution that agreements be reviewed by \nappropriate congressional committees.\n  I am told that with respect to the Gore-Chernomyrdin relationship a \nHouse committee was informed. Congressman Hamilton said he received \nsome information to that effect. Dick Lugar, the Senator from Indiana, \nhas said he knew in general terms what they were trying to achieve.\n  But then all of us were taken aback a couple of weeks ago by an \narticle in the New York Times in which this agreement was specifically \nquoted. I do not know of any Congressman or Senator who has yet to say \nthey have seen the particulars of this arrangement. That is the point \nof the Foreign Relations Committee's inquiry of the State Department.\n  Let me read briefly a sentence from that New York Times story that \nquotes what the Vice President pledges to do. He pledges to ``avoid any \npenalties to Russia that might otherwise arise under domestic law.''\n  There is nothing in the Gore-McCain law of 1992 that allows the \nexecutive branch to unilaterally waive the law. Their duty under that \nlaw is to impose sanctions, and then to waive them if that is the \njudgment of the executive but not to do it in a way that keeps Congress \nin the dark and violates specific terms of American law.\n  Why should we care? Many of our friends on the Democratic side said \nthis is all just about politics. You shouldn't be raising that now.\n  I point out to them that the Vice President, the executive, and the \nState Department have had 5 years to take this out of politics and to \nsimply disclose, as is rightfully our right to know, those documents \nand those particulars as to agreements.\n  Some of my colleagues have said these aren't agreements; that these \nare understandings. If it quacks like a duck and waddles like a duck, \nto me it is a duck.\n  In my opinion, when you see specific responsibilities and \nconsiderations on both sides and end dates, folks, that is an \nagreement, and the Congress has a right--and particularly the Senate--\nto see this document, and in confidence if necessary. But we have a \nright to documents that have been requested of the State Department.\n  I hope that it exonerates the Vice President. But let me tell you why \nI am concerned that it may not.\n  The Washington Times, a week ago, ran a story in which a letter was \nleaked from the State Department--not by the Republican Party but by \nthe State Department somehow to a reporter of the Washington Times--a \nletter from the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, to the Russian \nForeign Minister, Igor Ivanov. You have to read these words to, \nfrankly, understand it and really believe it. I don't know how words \ncan be any clearer that the administration is admitting to a violation \nof law.\n  This is what the Secretary wrote to the Russian Foreign Minister:\n\n       We have also upheld our commitment not to impose sanctions \n     for these transfers disclosed in the Annex to the Aide \n     Memoire. The Annex is very specific in its terms, and we have \n     followed it strictly. . . . Without the Aide Memoire, \n     Russia's conventional arms sales to Iran would have been \n     subject to sanctions based on various provisions of our laws. \n     This possibility still exists in the event the continued \n     Russian transfers after the December 31 termination date.\n\n  Madam President, the Secretary of State has said here that they have \nviolated the law.\n  What the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the majority in this \nparty are asking for is to have the proof of the State Department's \nassurances to us that they haven't violated the law. That is all we are \nasking for. If they haven't, we will be glad to say that to the whole \nworld. But what we have received so far is their assurances that they \nhaven't violated the law.\n\n  Guess what. I want to believe them. But I am entitled as a Senator to \nsee the document so I might know that they have not violated the law as \nthe Secretary of State has said.\n  Should we know that? I think we should.\n  Does that mean the Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement isn't a good deal? I \ndon't know that. It may be a great deal.\n  But it is not a deal where the means justify the ends to violate \nAmerican law and treat the Senate with disrespect. It does not warrant \nthat. We are a country of laws, and we need to obey them.\n  We are simply asking, as a signatory to this letter, that the \nadministration comply with the law authored by the Vice President \nhimself.\n  In addition to Sam Brownback and myself, the signatories to this \nletter are the majority leader, Trent Lott, the majority leader whip, \nDon Nickles, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse \nHelms, John McCain, Fred Thompson, the chairman of Governmental \nAffairs, Richard Shelby, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, John \nWarner, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Richard Lugar, \nwho, by the way, wouldn't mind knowing the truth of what has been \nrepresented to him, too. He is curious about indeed what the facts are.\n  I regret that this is close to an election. I don't believe politics \nshould be international. I think they should stop at the water's edge. \nBut I think the responsibility lies with the administration to foster a \nbipartisan foreign policy. That is clearly not happening here.\n  We are entitled to know the truth. If the law has been complied with, \nthis is over with. If it has not, then, frankly, that ought to be known \nby the American people as well.\n  Whether or not a Kilo-class submarine is a dangerous weapon, frankly, \nis a judgment the administration is entitled to make. But there may be \nother weapons on that, as the Secretary suggests, that were subject to \nsanctions.\n  We have a right to know whether or not we have been treated as \nmushroom farmers--keep them in the dark and shovel the manure on them.\n  That is not how it is supposed to work--not according to our \nConstitution, not according to our statutory law and various \nprovisions.\n  We are entitled to know the truth. As one Senator, I plead with the \nState Department to show us the documents and this goes away. But you \nhave to show us the documents. We are owed it. We deserve it. We are \nentitled to it. It ought to happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask to be able to proceed for 8 minutes \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. We are operating \nunder a time agreement until 7:30.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/29/senate-section/article/S11338-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11338-S11340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AIDE MEMOIRE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I have great respect for my friend from \nOregon. I know he knows I think he is dead wrong on this issue. For two \nreasons I think he is dead wrong: On the facts and I think he is dead \nwrong on the approach he has taken.\n  The fact of the matter is, the administration at the time this aide \nmemoire--a fancy phrase for saying this agreement--was signed by Gore \nand Chernomyrdin, a follow-on to a verbal agreement made by Clinton and \nby Yeltsin in 1994--that agreement was made known to the public; it was \npublicly stated, and that was actually offered. The House of \nRepresentatives was briefed at the time.\n  Here we are less than 10 days before an election and it has become a \ncause\n\n[[Page S11339]]\n\ncelebre. I don't have the time, and I am sure my friend from Oregon \ndoesn't have the inclination, to listen to why this is a violation of \nthe separation of powers doctrine. And this is not a binding \nobligation. There are distinctions between binding obligations and \nagreements. One requires disclosure; the other does not. The fact is, \nthis was a good deal and it was disclosed and made available to be \ndisclosed.\n  Let me cut to the chase. The fact of the matter is we did have a \nclosed meeting with members of the State Department. I was present, my \nfriend from Oregon was present, our colleague from Kansas was present, \nSenator Brownback, and maybe someone else; I can't recall. I indicated \nat the time that although the White House and the State Department were \nnot required to share these documents, in my view they were making a \ntactical political mistake not doing it.\n  I am here to tell my friend from Oregon what I told Senator Lugar and \nwhat I told Senator Hagel, and I understand it is being communicated to \nthe majority leader. The State Department is going to make available to \nthe leadership of the House and the Senate--which is the way we do \nthese things--the so-called annexes. If there is any violation of law--\nwhich there is not, but if there is any--the only violation could flow \nfrom there being a weapons system that was transferred on the annex, \nthat falls within the purview of the law, that covered certain weapons \nsystems and destabilizing systems under the McCain-Gore legislation. So \nif there is nothing in that annex that was transferred, there can be no \nquestion there was no law broken here.\n  This will be the test to know whether this is politics or not. This \nwill be the test. If the administration makes that available to the \nmajority leader, minority leader, Speaker of the House, and the \nminority leader of the House, the leadership of the House, then, in \nfact, we will find out. They will bring the document up, and they can \nsee it.\n  If they really want to know the answer, if they really believe a law \nwas broken, then it is really clear; they can sit down and look at it \nand find out. But if the offer is made and it is refused--I will say \nand challenge anyone to give me a good reason why I am wrong--that is \npure politics.\n  I really mean this; I have an inordinately high regard for my friend \nfrom Oregon. That probably hurts him back home, but I like him a lot. \nThe fact of the matter is, we have worked closely together on a whole \nnumber of items. I have never misled him and he has never misled me. I \ngot off the phone with Strobe Talbott. The Secretary of State is \nintending to call the majority leader, going to make the offer tomorrow \nto come up and show the documents.\n  It is interesting that the letter requesting documents says they \nbasically want these annexes. I know we need more time to explain this \nto someone listening because this is kind of confusing. My friend from \nOregon knows what I am talking about because he knows the area well. \nThe annex lists all those weapons systems that would be sanctionable if \ntransferred by the Russians to the Iranians, if that were to occur.\n  We will find out whether anything was transferred. By the way, unlike \nin any other administration, it has been pointed out that 10 times as \nmany weapons were transferred to the Iranians when Bush was President \nthan since Clinton has been President. But we will find out whether \nanything was violated.\n  I want to make it clear, the offer will be made. If the offer is \nrejected, I want everyone to know--and the press who may be listening--\nthat a big neon light should go on, ``Politics, politics, politics.'' \nIf the offer is accepted, then, in fact--and my colleagues look at it, \nthe majority leader of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives, if they look at it and they say this looks like a \nduck, to use my friend's phrase, that is a different story. That is \ndebatable; that is something that warrants concern.\n  To reiterate:\n  The Senators' letter says that ``the Vice President pledges to `avoid \nany penalties to Russia that might otherwise arise under domestic law.' \n''\n  The letter omits the words immediately preceding that quote from the \nleaked understanding: ``take appropriate steps'' to avoid penalties. \nThat meant that the United States would not circumvent U.S. law. \nRather, if necessary, we would sanction Russia, but waive the \npenalties, pursuant to the law.\n  But in fact, there was no need to waive penalties at all, because \nRussia was not proposing any conventional arms transfers that would \ntrigger sanctions under U.S. law--and the Vice President was assured of \nthis by the Department of Defense before he signed the understanding.\n  One relevant law was the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of \n1992, the so-called ``McCain-Gore Act.'' That law requires sanctions \nagainst governments that transfer ``destabilizing numbers and types'' \nof ``advanced conventional weapons'' to Iran or Iraq. Thus, you must \nfind both the sale of advanced conventional weapons to Iran, and that \nthese are a number and type so as to tip the balance of power in the \nregion.\n  We have been assured--by experienced, career officials--that the \nAnnex listing planned Russian arms transfers to Iran contains nothing \nthat would meet all those tests.\n  But we don't have to trust the Government on this. Anthony Cordesman, \nwho was John McCain's national security assistant in 1992, working on \nthe McCain-Gore bill, wrote recently: ``Iran . . . has not . . . \nreceived destabilizing transfers of advanced conventional weapons.''\n  The third Kilo-class submarine to be sent to Iran was specifically \nconsidered by the Pentagon, which decided that it would not be \ndestabilizing.\n  In any case, submarines are not listed in the 1992 law's definition \nof advanced conventional weapons; and even President Bush made no move \nto add them to the list, even though the law permits such additions.\n  The Senators' letter quotes Secretary Albright's letter to Russian \nForeign Minister Ivanov, in which she says we ``upheld our commitment \nnot to impose sanctions'' and that ``without the Aide Memoire, Russia's \nconventional arms sales to Iran would have been subject to sanctions \nbased on various provisions of our laws.'' As you said yesterday:\n  One reasonable interpretation is that Secretary Albright is saying, \n``if you hadn't obeyed the Aide Memoire, you would have gotten in \ntrouble.'' And that's true. If Russia had signed new deals to sell \n``lethal military equipment'' to Iran, or if it had sold lots of \n``advanced conventional weapons'' to Iran, it would have forced us to \ninvoke sanctions under our law. But they basically did obey the Aide \nMemoire, and stayed out of trouble in this regard.\n  Another reasonable interpretation is that the Secretary was \noverstating her case, using U.S. law as a club with which to beat the \nRussians. If so, more power to her.\n  A third reasonable interpretation is that Secretary Albright was \nthinking of those sanctions, based on other U.S. laws, that do not \nrequire any trigger other than a Presidential determination that the \nnational security warrants them.\n  The Albright letter does not show any violation or circumvention of \nthe 1992 Iran-Iraq law, and there is no evidence of any such action.\n  The Senators' letter rejects Vice President Gore's point that \nRussia's arms transfers were pursuant to previously-signed contracts, \nbecause the McCain-Gore law does not exempt such transfers.\n  That misses the point. There are other laws that would require \nsanctions for any transfer of ``lethal military equipment'' to Iran. \nThose laws exempt transfers under pre-1996 contracts.\n  The administration never claimed that it was cutting off all Russian \narms transfers to Iran. But it did put a cap on those transfers, \nlimiting them essentially to ones contracted for during the Bush \nadministration.\n  The Senators' letter says that the Congress must review all the \nrelevant documents, renews a demand for all the previously requested \ndocuments, and threatens a subpoena if these are not produced by noon \nMonday.\n  The fact is, however, that only the Annex to the Aide Memoire is \ncited as a really necessary document.\n  I think the executive branch ought to find a way to let appropriate \nsenators review the Annex and the Secretary's\n\n[[Page S11340]]\n\nletter to the Russian Foreign Minister, while maintaining the \nconfidentiality of those documents.\n  Once that is done, I believe that there will be no good reason to \nseek further documents.\n  Tony Cordesman, the expert in Middle Eastern military affairs who was \nSenator McCain's national security assistant, summed up this case \nadmirably a couple of weeks ago:\n\n       Political campaigns are a poor time to debate complex \n     military issues, particularly when the debate is based on \n     press reports that are skewed to stress the importance of the \n     story at the expense of objective perspective and the facts.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the pertinent letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 2000.\n     Hon. Madeleine Albright,\n     Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Albright: We were extremely disappointed \n     that the Department of State continues to refuse to give the \n     Committee access to critical documents relating to the Gore-\n     Chernomyrdin agreement.\n       Madame Secretary, this is simply unacceptable. All of the \n     evidence in the public domain leads us to the conclusion that \n     Vice President Gore signed a secret deal with Russian Premier \n     Viktor Chernomyrdin, in which he agreed to ignore U.S. non-\n     proliferation laws governing weapons transfers to Iran.\n       The text of the agreement signed by Mr. Gore and Mr. \n     Chernomyrdin (as published in the New York Times), the Vice \n     President pledges to ``avoid any penalties to Russia that \n     might otherwise arise under domestic law.''\n       And, in your letter to Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov \n     earlier this year (published in the Washington Times), you \n     state: ``We have also upheld our commitment not to impose \n     sanctions for these transfers disclosed in the Annex to the \n     Aide Memoire, Russia's conventional arms sales to Iran would \n     have been subject to sanctions based on various provisions of \n     our laws. This possibility still exists in the event of \n     continued Russian transfers after the December 31 termination \n     date.''\n       The administration's defense--repeated by the Vice \n     President this morning on ``Good Morning America''--that the \n     Russian transfers to Iran he agreed to were under ``pre-\n     existing contracts'' simply does not wash. The date the \n     contracts were signed is irrelevant. The Gore-McCain law \n     covers the transfer of weapons after 1992. There is no \n     ``contract sanctity'' exception in the law--it does not \n     matter whether the transfers took place under new or pre-\n     existing contracts. What matters, under law, is when the \n     transfer took place.\n       The Administration's other defense--that the weapons \n     transferred are not covered by the Gore-McCain law--is belied \n     by the Administration stubborn refusal to share with the \n     Committee the Annex that lists the weapons.\n       In essence, you are saying to Congress and the American \n     people: ``Trust us.'' Considering the fact that almost \n     everything we have learned about this secret deal has come \n     from the news media and not the Administration, we \n     respectfully decline.\n       Congress has a right and responsibility to review all the \n     relevant documents, and to judge for itself whether the \n     transfers the Vice President signed off on were covered by \n     U.S. non-proliferation laws.\n       We expect the Administration to share all of the requested \n     documents with the Committee no later than noon on Monday, \n     October 20.\n       If the Administration continues to stonewall, and withhold \n     these documents from Congress, then the Foreign relations \n     Committee will have no choice but to issue a subpoena to \n     obtain them.\n           Sincerely,\n         Gordon Smith, John McCain, Jesse Helms, Trent Lott, John \n           Warner, Sam Brownback, Don Nickles, Fred Thompson, \n           Richard Shelby, Richard G. Lugar.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 25, 2000\n     Hon. George P. Schultz,\n     Thomas W. and Susan B. Ford Distinguished Fellow, Hoover \n         Institution, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I read with interest your election-eve \n     condemnation of an understanding that Vice President Gore and \n     Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin reached some five years \n     ago. I was surprised--and saddened--to see that you and other \n     men who have served our nation with dignity and distinction \n     would sign a letter that was promptly used in an effort to \n     exploit a national security issue for partisan gain.\n       It is time to set the record straight. First, the June 1995 \n     U.S.-Russia understanding prevented new Russian arms sales to \n     Iran and thus enhanced the security of the United States and \n     its allies. Second, the understanding did not circumvent, \n     violate or undermine any U.S. law. Indeed, it appears to have \n     led Russia to stay within the bounds of U.S. law regarding \n     conventional arms transfers to Iran. Third, although the \n     executive branch was under no legal obligation to submit the \n     June 1995 understanding to the Congress as an international \n     agreement, it did make public the broad outlines of the \n     understanding and provide classified oral briefings at least \n     to one committee.\n       One highly respected expert in this field is Mr. Anthony H. \n     Cordesman, who was national security assistant to Senator \n     John McCain when his employer and then-Senator Al Gore wrote \n     the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992. Mr. \n     Cordesman now holds the Arleigh Burke Chair at the Center for \n     Strategic and International Studies. Earlier this month, he \n     wrote an analysis of Russia's conventional arms transfer to \n     Iran. The opening of that study strikes me as especially \n     worthy of your consideration: ``Political campaigns are a \n     poor time to debate complex military issues, particularly \n     when the debate is based on press reports that are skewed to \n     stress the importance of the story at the expense of \n     objective perspective and the facts. Iran does represent a \n     potential threat to US interests, but it has not had a major \n     conventional arms build-up or received destabilizing \n     transfers of advanced conventional weapons.''\n       If you remain uncertain regarding any of the points I have \n     made, I invite you to consult such sources as Mr. Cordesman's \n     CSIS study, Iranian Arms Transfers: The Facts, the public \n     testimony this morning of Deputy Assistant Secretaries of \n     State John P. Barker and Joseph M. DeThomas before the Senate \n     Committee on Foreign Relations, and even my own opening \n     statement at this morning's hearing.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I don't know a lot about matters over \nwhich I don't have jurisdiction as a Senator. So I don't expect all \nSenators to know as much about sanctions as the Senator from Oregon and \nI because we spend probably 20 percent of our time working on that in \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. My friend from Massachusetts forgot \nmore about HCFA than I will ever know. It took me a while to know what \nHCFA was. They set the rates for everything, and it affects the \nAmerican people a heck of a lot more than sanctions policy.\n  There are discretionary sanctions available to the President of the \nUnited States.

Madam President, I want to address the concerns of my \nfriend, the Senator from Texas, in her comments earlier. I want to make \nvery clear I have no complaint against the State of Texas. It has an \noutstanding history and has produced some great leaders, including Sam \nHouston, Sam Rayburn, President Johnson. My complaint is not against \nTexas at all, it is against the clear misstatements of Governor Bush \nabout his Texas record. The facts are there. I am not attacking the \nState of Texas. I am sure many citizens of Texas share my concerns \nabout the United States.\n  It is proper and necessary to talk about these issues. They are \nimportant. They are important in the national Presidential debate \nbecause they aren't being addressed by this Congress. The Republican \nleadership has blocked responsible action on education. For the first \ntime in 35 years, Congress has failed to reauthorize ESEA. We are now 4 \nweeks late in passing an education funding bill. Since the majority has \nstifled any debate on education in this Congress, it is appropriate and \nnecessary to speak on the Senate floor about how education will be \ntreated in the next Congress under the next administration. The \nAmerican people deserve a Congress that will act on education, not \nignore it.\n  When we think about what will happen to education next year, we must \nlook at the Presidential candidates and how they will address \neducation. It is essential to look at the record of Governor Bush, the \nRepublican candidate for President. That is what I have done.\n  On the children's health issue, when the Congress passed the CHIP \nprogram in 1997, we put affordable health insurance for children within \nreach of every moderate- and low-income working family in America. Yet \nGeorge W. Bush's Texas was one of the last States in the country to \nfully implement the\n\n[[Page S11341]]\n\nlaw. Despite the serious health problems faced by children in Texas, \nGovernor Bush fought to keep eligibility as narrow as possible.\n  In fact, the Bush campaign's defense of this unacceptable record is \nalmost as telling as the record itself. According to the New York \nTimes, the Bush campaign acknowledged that Governor Bush fought to keep \neligibility narrow, but that he did so because he was concerned about \ncosts and the spillover effect on Medicaid. This so-called spillover \neffect is the increase in enrollment of children in Medicaid that \noccurs when the Children's Health Insurance Program is put into effect. \nVigorous outreach efforts are made by state governments to identify \nchildren who qualify for the new program--but the same outreach \nidentifies many other children who should have already been enrolled in \nMedicaid.\n  In other words, Governor Bush not only opposed expanding eligibility \nfor the new CHIP program--he was also worried that the very poorest \nchildren--those already eligible for Medicaid--might actually receive \nthe coverage to which the were clearly entitled. That is not just what \nI am saying. That is also the conclusion of the New York Times when it \nreviewed the facts. It's no wonder that Governor Bush's Texas \nAdministration was cited by a federal judge for its failure to live up \nto a consent order to let families of poor children know about their \neligibility for Medicaid and about the health services to which they \nwere entitled.\n  An article in Time magazine says it all. It is titled, ``Tax Cuts \nBefore Tots. Candidate Bush is pushing his compassion, but poor kids in \nTexas have not seen much of it.'' And under a box entitled ``Lost \nOpportunity? Bush and Poor Kids,'' the article makes four key points:\n\n       [Bush] helped to secure tax cuts by underfunding Medicaid, \n     causing a $400 million shortfall in the program. He delayed \n     the state law to expand Medicaid coverage for 303,000 new \n     kids. They went five years without health insurance. He \n     fought efforts to require automatic coverage for families \n     forced off welfare rolls.\n\n  Now, my Senate colleagues from Texas offered all sorts of \nexplanations for Governor Bush's miserable record on health care for \nchildren. They said that the court case I referred to was begun before \nGovernor Bush took office. That is true. But the consent decree \nsettling the case was agreed to by Governor Bush's administration in \nFebruary of 1996. And the latest action by the federal judge was based \non the Bush's administration failure to live up to the consent decree \nthat it had agreed to. The Bush administration did not keep its word. \nChildren were not its priority.\n  Defenders of the Governor say that Texas could not implement the CHIP \nprogram promptly because its legislature only meets every two years. \nBut other states have legislatures that meet only two years, and they \nwere able to get their programs going more promptly. In fact, Texas was \nthe next to last state in the entire country to approve a Chip plan--\nthe next to last state.\n  Governor Bush's misstatements on his Texas record do not end with \nuninsured children. In the debates, Vice President Gore pressed \nGovernor Bush on the Texas record on the uninsured. Governor Bush said \nthat Texas was spending $4.7 billion a year for uninsured people. But \nit turns out that actually only one-quarter of that amount was being \nspent by the State of Texas. The vast majority of the spending was by \nhospitals and doctors for charity care, and by county governments, not \nby the state.\n  On the Texas record on the uninsured, Governor Bush claimed that the \npercentage of the uninsured in Texas had gone down, while the \npercentage of the uninsured in America had gone up. In 1998, the \noverall percentage of the uninsured dropped by identical amounts both \nnationally and in Texas--4.9 percent in Texas and 4.9 percent \nnationally. But, because of Governor Bush's inaction on children, the \npercentage of children in Texas who were uninsured dropped only half as \nmuch as the drop nationally--10 percent nationally and only 5.2 percent \nin Texas. When Governor Bush took office, Texas ranked second from the \nbottom of all 50 States in covering children and citizens of all ages. \nToday, after six years under his watch as Governor, Texas still ranks \nsecond from the bottom.\n  There is still time for the truth to be told. I am hopefully that \nevery American will examine the records of the two candidates \ncarefully. On health care, there should be no question at all as to \nwhich candidate stands with the powerful special interests and which \ncandidate stands with the American people. The choice is clear. \nGovernor Bush stands with the powerful, and Al Gore stands with the \npeople.\n  I reserve the remember of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, once again I would like to make the \nrecord clear. Since the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts \nfocused on health care and children's health care, I would like to talk \nabout the Texas record. I would like to talk about Governor Bush's \nleadership on health care for our children.\n  Under Governor Bush, the percentage of Texans without health \ninsurance has gone down while the number of Americans without health \ninsurance has gone up.\n  I also think it is worth mentioning that the Governor, along with the \nbipartisan legislature, took all of Texas' tobacco money, $17.4 billion \nin tobacco money, and allocated almost every single penny--in fact, \nevery single penny that was not put aside for education programs to try \nto encourage young people not to smoke has gone for health care, health \ncare for children, health care for indigents. The money, wisely, was \nput into trust, and every county in Texas reaps the benefit of that \ntrust fund because the interest on the trust fund is spent in each \ncounty for indigent health care.\n  So I think Governor Bush and the Texas Legislature are to be \ncommended for focusing on health coverage for the people of Texas and \nfor the children of Texas. In fact, under the leadership of Governor \nBush, Texas spent $1.8 billion in new funding for health care for the \nuninsured. He also increased funding for childhood immunizations by \n$330 million, resulting in an increase in the percentage of immunized \nchildren from 45 percent to 75 percent.\n  Mr. President, although I have to say, once again, I do not think it \ngets anyone anywhere to talk about the record in Texas, and \nmisrepresent that record, I think it is very clear that Texas is one of \nthe leading States in our Nation in taking care of children, in \nimproving its public education system, and it has been a focus of \nGovernor Bush and our Democratic speaker and our former Democratic \nLieutenant Governor; We now have a Republican Lieutenant Governor. We \nhave improved health care and education.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May we have order, Mr. President? The Senator is \nentitled to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely \ncorrect. The Senate will be in order so the distinguished Senator from \nTexas can be heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. So I think Governor Bush's record is clear. I think \nthe great speaker, Pete Leahy, working with the Governor, Bob Bullock, \nand Rick Perry, working with the Governor, have done very well in \nhealth care for the children and for the uninsured in Texas. Just as we \nare proud of the improvements in our public education system--and \ncertainly we recognize every State has problems. I do not think it does \nmuch good to talk about the records of different States. But I do think \nif you look at the record of Governor Bush in Texas on these issues, \nyou will be impressed that it was a priority and that we have been \nsuccessful in improving public education, in covering our children \nunder the SCHIP program, making more people eligible for these \nprograms, and immunizing our children so they would be protected from \nthe normal childhood diseases.\n\n  I stand by my Governor and by my State. Once again, I do hope we can \nstop the misrepresentation of the record.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? \nDoes the Senator from Texas yield for a question?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will be happy to yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n\n[[Page S11342]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. My question is, is the Governor given an \nimportant role in education under State laws of Texas? And does he play \na big role in education?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. In Texas, actually----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allocated to the distinguished \nSenator has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Let me just say, our Governor has made it a role for \nthe Governor. He has been a leader. He had a program; he worked with \nthe legislature to enact it; and it is successful.\n  I thank the Senator for the question.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/29/senate-section/article/S11342-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               BANKRUPTCY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there are two additional important issues \nthat I would like to discuss tonight. There are few clearer examples of \nthis Republican Congress siding with powerful special interests against \naverage people than the pending bankruptcy bill.\n  The bankruptcy conference report targets working men and women who \ncomprise the vast number of Americans in bankruptcy. Two out of every \nthree bankruptcy filers are workers who have lost their jobs because of \nlayoffs or downsizing. One out of every five has huge debts because of \nhealth care expenses. Divorced or separated people are three times more \nlikely than married couples to file for bankruptcy.\n  Working men and women in economic free fall often have no choice \nexcept bankruptcy. Yet, under pressure from the credit card industry, \nthis Republican Congress is bent on denying all these innocent victims \nof financial hardship the safety net that the bankruptcy laws have \nprovided for a century.\n  This legislation unfairly targets middle class and poor families, and \nit leaves flagrant abuses in place.\n  Time and time again, President Clinton has told the Republican \nleadership that the final bankruptcy bill must include two important \nadditions--a homestead provision without loopholes for the wealthy, and \na provision that requires accountability and responsibility from those \nwho unlawfully--and often violently--bar access to legal health \nservices for women. The current bill includes neither of these \nprovisions.\n  The bill does include a half-hearted, loop-hole filled homestead \nprovision. It will do virtually nothing to eliminate fraud. With a \nlittle planning--or in some cases, no planning at all--wealthy debtors \nwill still be able to hide millions of dollars in assets from their \ncreditors. For example, Allen Smith of Delaware--a state with no \nhomestead exemption--and James Villa of Florida--a state with an \nunlimited homestead exemption--are treated differently by the \nbankruptcy system today. One man eventually lost his home. The other \nwas able to hide $1.4 million from his creditors by purchasing a luxury \nmansion in Florida.\n  The Senate passed a worthwhile amendment to eliminate this inequity--\nbut that provision was stripped from the conference report. Surely, a \nbill designed to end bankruptcy fraud and abuse should include a loop-\nhole-free homestead provision. The President thinks so. As an October \n12 letter from White House Chief of Staff John Podesta says:\n\n       The inclusion of a provision limiting to some degree a \n     wealthy debtor's capacity to shift assets before bankruptcy \n     into a home in a state with an unlimited homestead exemption \n     does not ameliorate the glaring omission of a real homestead \n     cap.\n\n  Yet there is no outcry from our Republican colleagues about the \ninjustice, fraud, and abuse in these cases. In fact, Governor Bush led \nthe fight in Texas to see that rich cheats trying to escape their \ncreditors can hide their assets under Texas' unlimited homestead law.\n  In 1999, the Texas legislature adopted a measure to opt-out of any \nhomestead restrictions passed by Congress. The legislature also \nexpanded the urban homestead protection to 10 acres. It allowed the \nhomestead to be rented out and still qualify as a homestead. It even \nsaid that a homestead could be a place of business. This provision \ngives the phrase ``home, sweet home'' new meaning.\n  The homestead loop-hole should be closed permanently. It should not \nbe left open just for the wealthy. I wish this misguided bill's \nsupporters would fight for that provision with the same intensity they \nare fighting for the credit card industry's wish list, and fighting \nagainst women, against the sick, against laid-off workers, and against \nother average individuals and families who will have no safety net if \nthis unjust bill passes.\n  The hypocrisy of this bill is obvious. We hear a lot of pious \nRepublican talk about the need for responsibility when average families \nare in financial trouble--but we hear no such talk of responsibility \nwhen the wealthy and their lobbyists are the focus of attention.\n  The facts are clear. The bankruptcy bill before us is designed to \nincrease the profits of the credit card industry at the expense of \nworking families. If it becomes law, its effective will be devastating. \nIt eminently deserves the veto it will receive if it ever reaches the \nWhite House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/29/senate-section/article/S11342-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11342-S11343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, another issue in which this Republican \nCongress is ignoring working families is immigration.\n  Action on the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act is long overdue. The \nissues in this legislation are not new to Congress. The immigrant \ncommunity--particularly the Latino community--has waited far too long \nfor the fundamental fairness this legislation will provide.\n  The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act keeps families together. It \nrewards immigrants who work hard and pay taxes, and it makes our \nimmigration policies simpler and fairer.\n  Our proposal is based on the fundamental principle that immigrants in \nsimilar situations should be treated equally. The Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act includes parity for all Central Americans, and for \nHaitians and Liberians. In 1997, Congress enacted legislation granting \npermanent residence to Nicaraguans and Cubans who had fled their \nrepressive governments. But Congress did not grant the same protection \nto other Central Americans and Haitians. The Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act will eliminate these disparities and create fair, uniform \nprocedures for all of these immigrants.\n  The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will also change the registry \ncut-off date, so that long-time immigrants who have been residing in \nthis country since before 1986 will qualify to remain in the United \nStates permanently, and it will restore a provision to the immigration \nlaws that was unfairly allowed to expire in 1997.\n  These proposals are pro-family, pro-business, fiscally prudent, and a \nmatter of common sense. But that hasn't stopped the Republican \nleadership from opposing them and offering a blatantly inadequate \nsubstitute that pays lip service to fairness for Latinos and immigrants \nin our communities but denies them real help.\n  Under even the most generous interpretation, the Republican proposal \nignores the vast majority of immigrants and families. It will \nperpetuate the current patchwork of contradictory and discriminatory \nprovisions enacted by the Republican Congress in recent years.\n  Republicans propose two things. First, a new temporary ``V'' visa \nwould be created that allows certain spouses and minor children of \nlawful permanent residents to enter or stay in the U.S. and be granted \nwork authorization while waiting for their green card. To qualify for \nthe visa, applicants must have had applications for entry pending for \nover three years.\n  On the surface, this may sound like a good idea. But it unfairly \npicks and chooses among family members, granting relief to some, but \nnot to others. The GOP proposal perpetuates the piecemeal and \ndiscriminatory immigration policies we are seeking to end.\n  Second, the Republican plan would provide an opportunity for \nindividuals to apply for green cards--but only if they were part of two \nparticular class action lawsuits against the INS for improper handling \nof the 1986 amnesty program. This selective proposal is grossly \ninadequate. It provides relief only for individuals who sought counsel \nfrom a specific lawyer and joined a specific lawsuit, even though \ncountless\n\n[[Page S11343]]\n\nother individuals affected by the INS ruling are left out. Also, of \nthose people who are actually covered by this plan, less than 40 \npercent are expected to prevail.\n  Republicans acknowledge that the 1986 law was implemented unfairly. \nIt is wrong and inconsistent to deny a remedy to all who were affected. \nIt is wrong to help only those who were able to hire the right \nattorney, and who filled out the right forms. All eligible individuals \nshould receive relief.\n  Governor Bush praises his trillion dollar tax break for the wealthy, \nand criticizes Democrats for supporting targeted tax relief that helps \nsome individuals, but not others. It's obvious that Republicans don't \ncare about uniformity when the issue is immigration. It's unfair and \nunjust to pick and choose among immigrants who will receive this well-\ndeserved and long-overdue relief.\n  We have welcomed these individuals to the United States. They are \npart of our communities. We have come to know them as neighbors, \nfriends, and colleagues. We should support those who have come here in \ntheir search for freedom, equality, and a better life. These are the \nsame dreams our ancestors came here to find in the past.\n  It is essential to pass the real Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act \nand treat immigrants fairly. Hard-working immigrant families deserve \nthis long-overdue relief, and they deserve it now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority controls the remainder of the \ntime.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am not going to talk about Texas. There \nhas been plenty of discussion about that tonight. I am going to talk \nabout this country. I saw this morning an interview in which Governor \nBush said: ``They had their chance,'' talking about Vice President \nGore, of course. ``They had their chance.'' I want to talk about what \nhas happened in the last 8 years.\n  It is important to remember exactly what the Clinton-Gore \nadministration inherited and where we are. They had their chance. Let's \ntalk about President Clinton and Vice President Gore.\n  In 1993, when they took office, we had a $290 billion deficit that \nyear, and it was rising. That deficit was exploding. Our economy was in \ntrouble. Economists predicted slow anemic growth for an entire decade \nahead. That is what the Clinton-Gore administration inherited.\n  Now, instead of the largest deficit in history, we have the largest \nsurplus in history. Is that an accident? I don't think so. We had a \nvote in this Senate and they had a vote in the House on a new plan to \ntake this country to a new direction, and it passed by one vote--one \nvote in the House and one vote in the Senate. Not one member of the \nmajority party voted for that in either the House or the Senate. We \nmoved this country to a new direction. Now instead of the largest \ndeficits in history, we have the largest surpluses in history.\n  This is a chart which shows what these deficits and surpluses were \nwhen Governor Bush said: They had their chance. This is what we \ninherited from President George Bush in 1992 and 1993: red ink that was \ngrowing every year. This country was choking on deficits, and every \nyear, when we changed direction and created a new economic plan to give \npeople hope that we would make the tough decisions to turn this country \naround, we have seen lower and lower deficits and finally surpluses. \nThat is not an accident.\n  They had their chance, Governor Bush said. They turned the biggest \ndeficits into the biggest surpluses. How about economic growth? In the \n12 years prior to the Clinton-Gore administration taking office, \naverage economic growth was 2.8 percent. Since then, economic growth \nhas been on average 3.9 percent.\n  Jobs: 1988 to 1992 was one of the worst 4-year periods in history for \nthe creation of jobs. In fact, I have a chart that I think will be \nuseful to show in terms of the creation of jobs: In the Bush \nadministration, 1988 to 1992, 2.5 million new jobs in 4 years. In 8 \nyears, the Clinton-Gore administration had an economy that rebounded, \nand we had 22 million new jobs created in this country. They had their \nchance.\n  How about the unemployment rate? In 1981-1982, Reagan-Bush averaged \n7.1-percent unemployment. Currently, there is 4.1-percent unemployment, \nthe lowest level in 30 years.\n  Home ownership: From 1982 to 1992, home ownership fell in this \ncountry. Now it is the highest in history.\n  Welfare rolls increased 22 percent from 1981 to 1992. Now they have \ndecreased by 53 percent.\n  The Dow Jones was 3,300. Now it is over 10,000.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I think the Senator is making an important point, but \nI would like him to supplement it because I, too, have been startled in \nhearing Governor Bush explain they had their chance to enact a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. Indeed, it is my memory that on more \noccasions than I can remember the Clinton-Gore administration, with \nsupport of Democrats in this House, attempted to have a Patients' Bill \nof Rights.\n  I heard Governor Bush say on prescription drugs that we promised it \nand had not delivered it; we had our chance. Indeed, the Clinton-Gore \nadministration supported prescription drugs and Democrats supported it \nin the Congress but failed.\n  Is my recollection of this correct, that we had our chance, we have \nattempted to do it but, ironically, the people who have stopped it are \nnow the same people who constitute the Bush campaign?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is absolutely correct. They had their chance. \nWhat about the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights? We were blocked \nby the majority party.\n  What about campaign finance reform? We have tried, tried, and tried \nand were blocked by the majority party.\n  What about a prescription drug benefit for the Medicare program? We \nhave tried and tried and were blocked by the majority party.\n  How about the issue of education and providing some help to \nreconstruct and renovate and provide for better schools and better \nclassrooms?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. If the Senator will yield, can we focus on that one \nas well because I heard in debates Governor Bush said on education \nClinton-Gore had their chance. Indeed, the President proposed 100,000 \nnew teachers repeatedly and has been fighting for it every year--got it \nenacted at one point--including right up to tonight on school \nreconstruction, which has not been supported, to my knowledge, by \nGovernor Bush, certainly not supported by his party in Congress. So \nindeed they had their chance on education, and the Clinton-Gore \nadministration led on education as they led on health care.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is absolutely correct. We have had the \nlongest economic expansion in American history. That did not happen by \naccident. Governor Bush says: Well, gosh, that's due to the American \npeople. The American people worked hard in 1981, 1982, 1983, and 1984. \nThe American people had as much ingenuity, as much tenacity to work \nhard then. But you need public policies in place that help them as \nwell.\n  The public policies that the Clinton-Gore administration and the \nDemocrats in Congress put in place in 1993 said we were going to stop \nthese Federal deficits. We had a new fiscal policy. We turned this \ncountry around.\n  The American people understand that when they have hope for the \nfuture, they do things that reflect that hope. They buy cars; they buy \nhomes; and they take vacations. They do the things that represent their \nhope for the future.\n  There was not much hope for a long while because every year the \ndeficit was getting worse and no one wanted to do much about it, but \nthe Clinton-Gore administration came in and said: We have a new plan \nand it will be a little tough. It was hard to vote for--in fact, so \nhard that not one member of the majority party voted for it.\n\n  I see on the floor my friend from Texas, Mr. Gramm, whom we have \nquoted many times. He said: If you\n\n[[Page S11344]]\n\npass this plan, this country is going to go into a tailspin. Those are \nnot his exact words, but it is exactly what he meant.\n  Of course, he was wrong. This country passed a new economic plan and \ngave the American people confidence about the future. Guess what \nhappened. The largest deficits in history turned into the largest \nsurpluses in history. We have had the longest economic expansion on \nrecord--welfare rolls are down, home ownership is up, inflation is \ndown. Almost every basic index in this country is better.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. When the Senator from Texas--Governor Bush's home State--\nvoted against the Clinton-Gore plan in 1993, he said: ``This program is \ngoing to make the economy weaker, hundreds of thousands of people are \ngoing to lose their jobs as a result of this program.''\n  Was the Senator from Texas correct as a result of the Clinton-Gore \nplan? Did hundreds of thousands of people lose their jobs?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois asked a question \nabout job creation. This administration, during these 8 years, has seen \n22 million new jobs created in this country. In the 4 years prior under \nPresident George Bush, 2.5 million new jobs were created. You will see \nthis is one of the most robust periods of economic expansion in this \ncountry's history. Is it an accident? No. This administration had a new \neconomic plan that said let's move away from growing and choking \ndeficits and give the American people some confidence about the future. \nThe result of it was that confidence manifested a growing economy that \ncreated new jobs and new opportunities. Every single feature of this \neconomy has become better in the last 8 years, every single one. \nUnemployment, inflation, welfare, home ownership--in every single \ninstance, things are better in this country.\n  This morning, when I heard the Governor say, ``Well, you have had \nyour chance,'' I would say, yes, this administration had its chance and \nit inherited a weak and troubled economy and turned it into a strong, \nvibrant, growing economy, and good for them.\n  It did not happen because they took the easy road. This was not the \neasy thing to do. In 1993, when they had the vote on the new plan, it \npassed by only one vote in the House and the Senate. We did not get \neven one vote on the majority side.

Mr. President, on October 10, 2000, the Center for \nStrategic & International Studies (CSIS) hosted an important luncheon \ndiscussion on the European Union's evolving European Security and \nDefense Policy (ESDP). The guest speakers at that luncheon were \nAmbassador Christopher Meyer of Great Britain, Ambassador Juergen \nChrobog of Germany, and Ambassador Francois Bujon de l'Estang of \nFrance. Senator Levin and I were privileged to sponsor this luncheon on \nCapitol Hill, in the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing room. \nAttendees at this luncheon included a prestigious group of former \nambassadors and administration officials, representatives from \nindustry, policy and research organizations, and senior congressional \nstaff from both the House and Senate.\n  Since December 1999, when the European Union (EU) Heads of State \nannounced at a summit meeting in Helsinki their ``determination to \ndevelop an autonomous capacity to take decisions and, where NATO as a \nwhole is not engaged, to launch and conduct EU-led military operations \nin response to international crises,'' there has been a great deal of \ndiscussion and debate about the development of a common European \ndefense identity. While I commend our European allies for their\n\n[[Page S11345]]\n\nwillingness to do more militarily, I have been concerned about the \nimpact of an ESDP on the NATO Alliance.\n  My views on the development of the European Security and Defense \nPolicy start with the basic premise that NATO has been the most \nsuccessful military alliance in history. NATO won the cold war; it is \nnow plying an instrumental role in keeping the peace in Europe. \nWhatever is done in the context of an ESDP, it must not weaken NATO.\n  There are a number of questions concerning the content of an ESDP--\nquestions I, Senator Levin, and others raised at the October 10 \nluncheon. For example, Europeans are discussing increasing their \nmilitary capabilities at a time of declining defense budgets, in a \nnumber of NATO partners. How is an added military capability possible \nwith less money? Will ESDP developments--particularly the establishment \nof EU military structures--take valuable and scarce resources away from \nNATO military capabilities? How will the EU military force interact \nwith NATO? Will NATO have the right of first refusal--or veto power--\nover an EU-led military operation?\n  These are important questions that should be answered. During the \nmeeting on October 10, the Ambassadors provided valuable insight into \nthe development of an ESDP. I commend their participation in today's \nforum. I ask unanimous consent that the opening statements of the three \nAmbassadors be printed in the Record.\n  I will continue to monitor these developments and keep the Senate \ninformed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Speech by Ambassador Christopher Meyer\n\n\n european security and defense policy (esdp) and its implications for \n                       the United States and nato\n\n       In October 1998 Tony Blair launched an initiative on \n     European defense in a speech at Portschach.\n       He had been dismayed by the inadequacy of European \n     diplomatic and military performance in the Balkans. It \n     undermined the credibility of the EU's common foreign and \n     security policy. It corroded the Atlantic alliance by giving \n     comfort to those in the U.S. who argue that the Europeans \n     refuse to assume their share of the burden.\n       He saw that the Europeans lack military transportation over \n     long distances; logistical support to sustain fighting forces \n     for long periods away from home; and enough capabilities such \n     as airborne surveillance, precision-guided munitions and \n     command, control and communications. The Kosovo campaign in \n     particular showed up these deficiencies.\n       Blair's aim was, and remains, three-fold: To strengthen the \n     AEU's capacity to act internationally in a more effective \n     manner; to deliver a step-change in Europe's ability to \n     manage crises; and to strengthen the European Contribution to \n     the Atlantic alliance, in particular through more robust \n     European military capabilities.\n       In the British view this is overwhelmingly in the interests \n     of the U.S., the alliance and of Europe.\n       Since Blair's speech, he and president Chirac have been the \n     main drivers of this initiative. The British-French St. Malo \n     declaration was the first land-mark. But, of course, over the \n     last two years, the full memberships of the EU and NATO have \n     become increasingly involved, notably Germany.\n       My colleagues will speak to you about the implications of \n     this initiative for the U.S. and NATO; about the current \n     state of play; and about next steps.\n       I want to make only two observations.\n       The first is that the initiative has made extraordinary \n     progress in less than 2 years:\n       Last December, at Helsinki, the EU set itself a headline \n     goal: to be able by 2003 to deploy 60,000 troops at 60 days' \n     notice for operations lasting at least a year. By the end of \n     this year we should have identified who will need to do what \n     to make this goal reality; and we ought to have in place key \n     element of EU/NATO arrangements, as well as necessary \n     internal EU structures. My colleagues will say more about \n     this.\n       My second observation is that behind the official \n     statements of welcome for this initiative, there has been \n     chronic suspicion and skepticism on this side of the \n     Atlantic, especially on Capitol Hill. Why?\n       First, there is a long-standing schizophrenia at work. For \n     decades you have been telling the Europeans to get their act \n     together: one emergency phone number, please. But whenever we \n     show signs of doing what you ask, you become suspicious and \n     anxious that we are doing things behind your back. European \n     defense initiative has been much afflicted by this \n     schizophrenia. Damned if we do, damned if we don't.\n       Second, some of you don't actually believe we will ever put \n     our money where our mouth is and increase European military \n     effectiveness. But, Britain and, I'm sure, France and Germany \n     are determined to make a reality of this initiative. Britain \n     has just increased its military budget accordingly. The \n     capabilities commitment conference will be held precisely to \n     pin member-states down to concrete commitments. The UK has \n     already made clear that it will offer a pool of land forces \n     adding up to about 20,000, of whom a maximum of 12,000 would \n     be deployed in any one scenario. The pool would allow \n     deployment of one a group of armored, mechanized or air \n     assault brigades, with probably two additional brigades in \n     support (e.g. Artillery, air defense, attack helicopters, HA \n     and signals).\n       The UK defense budget is rising in real terms. Procurement \n     plans announced this year include four C-17 strategic lift \n     aircraft with more to follow; maverick precision guided \n     munitions and new air-to-air missiles for the Eurofighter; \n     two new aircraft carriers and six new type-45 destroyers; new \n     command, control and intelligence systems.\n       Third, you sometimes exaggerate the share of the burden the \n     U.S. have to assume. Its true you flew most of the sorties in \n     the Kosovo campaign. That is something we Europeans have to \n     rectify. But don't forget that today in Kosovo, 85% of the \n     NATO-led force comes from Europe. So does most of the civil \n     aid. That's how it should be.\n       Fourth, the question is asked why it is necessary to \n     introduce the EU into the equation, when there is already a \n     security body called NATO, of which 13 out of 15 members are \n     European. Isn't, the skeptics ask, the European defense \n     initiative really about replacing NATO as the basis for \n     collective European defense and cutting transatlantic \n     security ties? This is perhaps the most deep-seated of U.S. \n     concerns.\n       The answer to this last question is an emphatic ``no'', as \n     my colleagues will confirm. NATO will remain the bedrock of \n     our defense and that of European allies. This initiative is \n     not about replacing NATO or undermining its role in \n     collective defence and other demanding crisis management \n     missions. No-one in Europe is suggesting an EU role in \n     collective defence. European allies have made perfectly \n     clear, in actions as well as in declarations, our \n     preference to act alongside the U.S. wherever possible, \n     particularly in high intensity operations.\n       Instead, this initiative is about other cases, where the \n     U.S. does not want to be involved, ``putting out fires in our \n     backyard'', as French defence minister Alain Richard has put \n     it. With the U.S. where you want to be present, otherwise on \n     our own. ``Separable, but not separate''.\n       Bear in mind that we are not writing on a blank piece of \n     paper. Rather than creating a new security body, we are \n     replacing an existing body that has not proven effective \n     enough--the western European union--by one with far greater \n     political, financial and organizational muscle--the European \n     union. We are trading up for a more useful instrument. But \n     our aims have not changed: a more effective European defence, \n     organically linked to NATO and its structures.\n       Submerging Western European Union (WEU) functions into the \n     European Union (EU), we simplify not multiply European \n     security structures. We end an artificial separation between \n     hard defence in NATO and WEU, from foreign and security \n     policy in the EU. EU policies should become less declaratory, \n     more hard-headed. That will be good for us all.\n       Finally, let me underline one point that Tony Blair has \n     made clear, repeatedly, right back to his first speech in \n     October 1998: this initiative should be judged, and we \n     ourselves will measure its success, by whether there is a \n     real improvement in military capabilities. We are under no \n     illusions about the difficulty. But it has been and remains \n     the central aim of the initiative.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  Speech by Ambassador Jurgen Chrobog\n\n\n European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) and its implications for \n                       the United States and NATO\n\n       Now that Sir Christopher has outlined how ESDP came into \n     being and what it is all about, I would like to concentrate \n     on the controbution ESDP will make to NATO and the \n     transatlantic partnership. In doing so, I'll try to address \n     some of the questions that have been raised in this country \n     about ESDP. I'll certainly be happy to discuss them in more \n     detail later on. Christopher Meyer's remarks have pointed out \n     why EDSP is vital to further European integration. With ESDP, \n     the European Union has committed itself to making essential \n     progress towards a political union which is underpinned by \n     credible political and military action. But ESDP is of equal \n     importance to NATO, the U.S., and the transatlantic \n     relationship--and not just because a strong Europe is very \n     much in the interest of the United States.\n       To underpin this, I would like to make four brief points:\n       First: ESDP will enable Europeans to engage in crisis \n     management, principally on the European continent. ESDP is an \n     historic step towards strengthening the military capabilities \n     of the Europe NATO partners. In this respect, it is a product \n     of the lessons learned from Bosina and Kosovo. ESDP enhances \n     the ability of the EU to make decisions in crisis management. \n     With ESDP, Europe will be able to perform a broad spectrum of \n     missions ranging from civilian conflict prevention to \n     military crisis management. These include humanitarian \n     assistance, evacuation measures during crisis situations in \n     third countries, and military peacekeeping and peace-\n     enforcing--all of which we refer to as the ``Petersberg \n     Task.'' I would\n\n[[Page S11346]]\n\n     like to mention here the efforts to enhance European \n     capabilities predates the St. Malo agreement of 1998 by a few \n     years. In June 1992, on German initiative, a WEU Ministerial \n     meeting near Bonn first outlined the ``Petersberg tasks'' \n     which later became the basis for ESDP objectives. Within the \n     framework of ESDP, the EU will develop tools for civilian \n     crisis management, including a task force of police officers \n     ready to deploy on short notice. This will make the EU the \n     only multilateral organization that can offer the full \n     range of conflict management measures.\n       Second: By developing European capabilities in key military \n     areas, ESDP will make a substantial contribution to \n     transatlantic burden-sharing. These new capabilities include \n     command and control, strategic intelligence, and strategic \n     airlift--just to name the most important ones. These \n     priorities will also play an important role in the reform of \n     the German armed forces which has recently begun. This reform \n     will triple the number of troops that Germany will be able to \n     rapidly deploy from 50,000 to 150,000. This increase in the \n     readiness forces will enable the Bundeswehr to participate in \n     one major operation with up to 50,000 soldiers for a period \n     of up to one year or two medium sized operations, each with \n     up to 10,000 soldiers for several years, a significant \n     improvement over current capabilities as demonstrated by the \n     7,500 men presently deployed in the Balkans. Germany will \n     thus be in a better position to meets its responsibilities \n     within NATO and the European framework. Germany's defense \n     budget will increase by 3.2% in 2001. As you know, a German-\n     French initiative is already underway on establishing a \n     European air transport command--a way to combine financial \n     resources to achieve the required capability quality and \n     quantity. The modernization of European forces will be \n     harmonized with NATO's Defense Capabilities Initiative and \n     thus simultaneously contribute to both the European and NATO \n     force goals. Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska said it very \n     plainly in his recent article for ``Defense News'' \n     (3.7.2000), and I quote ``Greater European military \n     capabilities will make the alliance stronger, lift some of \n     the burden the United States now carries in having to act in \n     every crisis, and make the U.S.-European relationship a more \n     equal one.'' End of quote. I could not agree more. A strong \n     Europe is good for the United States. For this very good \n     reason, not only Senator Hagel but also a whole generation of \n     American politicians before him have been calling for exactly \n     the same steps which we are now taking with ESDP.\n       Third: Within NATO, ESDP will strengthen the transatlantic \n     link. The European Union will use its crisis management \n     capability to complement and reinforce NATO. There may be \n     occasions when the U.S. is not inclined or, for other \n     reasons, is unable to dispatch American troops to deal with a \n     conflict in Europe which needs to be addressed. This is \n     precisely the type of scenario in which ESDP can play a role. \n     Let me be clear: The EU is not competing with NATO. The \n     Europeans will take care of business ``where NATO as a whole \n     is not engaged'' (European Council Helsinki, Dec. 1998). \n     There will be no separate European army. There will be no \n     unnecessary duplication of assets or capabilities between \n     NATO and the European Union. In fact, the EU might require \n     NATO assets to conduct EU-led military operations. ESDP \n     reflects the EU's willingness to shoulder more of the burden \n     of safeguarding peace and democracy. As the New Strategic \n     Concept of the Alliance, which was endorsed at NATO's \n     Washington summit in April 1999, states: ``The increase in \n     the responsibilities and capacities of the European allies \n     with respect to security and defense enhances the security \n     environment of the alliance.''\n       And finally, my forth point. The EU will include other \n     European countries in ESDP. Procedures are being put in place \n     to allow the six European NATO members which are not EU \n     member states and possibly other contributing states to fully \n     participate in European-led operations. That includes the \n     Eastern and Southeastern countries that are candidates for EU \n     membership. ESDP thus reinforces and broadens the security \n     umbrella of NATO.\n       To sum up: EU and NATO have very different backgrounds, \n     histories and structures. They will not detract from each \n     other, but grow closer in values, convictions, and actions. \n     For the European Union, and Germany in particular, the \n     transatlantic partnership and the U.S. political and military \n     presence in Europe remain the key to peace and security on \n     the European continent. And one thing is absolutely certain: \n     NATO remains responsible for the collective defense of \n     Europe. NATO will not lose any of its importance, and ESDP \n     will strengthen the European Union and NATO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            Speech by Ambassador Francois Bujon de l'Estang\n\n\n european security and defense policy (esdp) and its implications for \n                       the united states and nato\n\n       I would like to thank Dr. Hamre and Simon Serfaty for this \n     excellent initiative taken by the CSIS.\n       From St. Malo to today, some apprehension has been \n     expressed on Capitol Hill regarding European security and \n     defense policy. This apprehension has been largely due, I \n     believe, to misconceptions and lack of understanding of our \n     intentions and our objectives. Perhaps terminology has not \n     helped either, with the European predilection for ominous \n     acronyms\n       After the excellent presentations of my British and German \n     colleagues, there is little left to add. However, there is \n     only one thing worse than a European conspiracy: a French-\n     inspired European conspiracy. According to a rather popular \n     theory in Washington, ESDP is a dark and dangerous plot \n     organized by France to finally break up the Atlantic Alliance \n     with the unknowing complicity of its blind European partners. \n     Therefore, people are undoubtedly paying close attention to \n     the current French Presidency of the EU. Let me spend a few \n     minutes to shed some light on our plans until December 31, \n     and briefly go over the goals--and achievements--of our \n     current presidency in order to dispel and doubt that might \n     still be lingering in your minds.\n       1. To quote Lord Robertson, ESDP is about three things: \n     capabilities, capabilities and capabilities. I wholeheardly \n     subscribe to this assertion, for at least two reasons: first \n     of all, France has always prided itself, on a national level, \n     with a strong commitment to robust defense capabilities, and \n     our present forces are there to show it--it is only natural \n     that we attempt to pursue our European endeavor with the same \n     priority. Second, because capabilities are the key to the \n     success of ESDP, in terms of political credibility of course \n     but also in terms of our military objectives.\n       Let me tell you what our projects are in terms of \n     capabilities:\n       As you all know by now, at Helsinki, last December, the \n     fifteen heads of State or Government set themselves two \n     series of targets in terms of military capabilities.\n       On the one hand, the quantitative so called ``head-line \n     goals'' (60,000 troops rapidly deployable, self-sufficient \n     for a whole year with the necessary air and naval support);\n       On the other hand, qualitative targets regarding collective \n     capabilities in areas such as command and control, \n     intelligence and strategic transport. What we are doing today \n     is to transform these political objectives into concrete \n     goals, in a very detailed manner. In political objectives \n     into concrete goals, in a very detailed manner. In other \n     words, the dozen or so lines in the Helsinki conclusions on \n     capabilities have, thanks to an alchemy performed by EU \n     military planners with input from their NATO colleagues, \n     turned into some 50 pages of specific requirements.\n       This allows us to match up what we need to what we \n     currently have, and of course measure the gaps, which we will \n     aim to close at the Capabilities Commitment Conference, to be \n     held in Brussels next November 20 by Defense Ministers of the \n     15. This event will allow each member State to make pledges \n     toward meeting these requirements. We also aim to decide, \n     before the end of our Presidency, on a European review \n     mechanism that will allow us to continue narrowing the gap \n     until 2003, and more generally to review the nature and \n     composition of European military forces.\n       Just to give you a flavor of this work, which suddenly \n     makes all of these debates very real: the Defense Ministers \n     of the 15 agreed, two weeks ago, that in order to fulfill the \n     Helsinki objectives the EU needed: 80,000 troops in order to \n     allow for a simultaneous contingency and still be able to \n     project 60,000 as agreed (allowing for rotations, this means \n     of course 200,000 to 230,000 troops); 300 to 350 fighter \n     planes; some 80 combat ships . . . these are just some of the \n     elements in this catalogue of forces that have been agreed. I \n     could also mention strategic lift, UAVs, amphibious landing\n     ships . . .\n       I would like to mention in passing that, as you can see, we \n     are not just aiming at operations on the low end of the \n     peace-keeping spectrum as I have sometimes heard. Does this \n     mean that we would be able, in 2003, to carry out an \n     operation such as ``Allied Force'' entirely by ourselves? Of \n     course not--and it would be dangerous to create such \n     expectations. But the imbalance between U.S. and European \n     forces which we witnessed last year would be substantially \n     reduced--and 2003 will be an important stepping stone on the \n     path to such a capability, which we need to keep as a longer-\n     term goal in order to be prepared for all non-article 5 \n     contingencies.\n       3. I often hear people complaining about the fact that the \n     EU is not working to improve its capabilities, but just \n     creating new institutions. This is inaccurate on both counts: \n     as I have just pointed out, we are actively working on \n     reinforcing our capabilities. As for institutions, I would \n     agree with Sir Christopher that we are re-organizing, not \n     multiplying European institutions. As we have reiterated at \n     the last European Councils, our goal is to develop an \n     autonomous capacity to take decisions and, where NATO as a \n     whole is not engaged, to launch and conduct EU-led military \n     operations in response to international crises''. The \n     capacity to take decisions and to conduct EU-led military \n     operations requires the adequate political-military decision-\n     making structures, procedures and expertise. During our \n     Presidency, we are working hard in order to allow these new \n     EU structures (the Political and Security Committee, the \n     Military Committee and the Military Staff) to get up and \n     running in their permanent configuration, taking over from \n     their interim one. These bodies are analogous to those that \n     existed in the past in the WEU, and which will be disbanded.\n       I might add that those new institutions that are being \n     created are those which fulfill the objective of allowing \n     consultation and cooperation with NATO and with non-EU\n\n[[Page S11347]]\n\n     countries, two goals that I know are very dear to many of \n     those here today, as they are indeed to us. Under our \n     Presidency, we have already held a joint meeting between the \n     North Atlantic Council and the Interim Political and Security \n     Committee (and there will be more to come), as well as \n     several meetings of the newly set up joint working groups \n     between the EU and NATO. These are needed to address, in a \n     pragmatic and solution-oriented way, the issues that the two \n     organizations need to work out together (access to NATO \n     assets, information security, etc.) and to work out the \n     elements of the long-term EU-NATO relationship. We have also \n     set up an inclusive forum for the 15 European non-EU partners \n     and, within this forum, for the 6 non-EU NATO allies. Several \n     meetings have also already been held in the two months that \n     have gone by since we took up our presidency. These countries \n     will, of course, be closely associated to the November \n     Capabilities Commitment Conference.\n       One final word: after having gone into such detail into our \n     current projects, just to give you a taste of how complex \n     this whole endeavor is and how seriously we are taking our \n     task, I wouldn't want the trees to hide the forest.\n       The crucial element to bear in mind is that we are at a \n     turning point in the history of the European Union, of the \n     Atlantic Alliance and of transatlantic relations. There is \n     much at stake, both for the future of the EU's foreign and \n     security policy, and therefore for our ability as Europeans \n     to play our role on the world stage, and for the \n     transatlantic link as well. We have taken the full measure of \n     what is at stake and are pleased to see that quarreling and \n     suspicion have given largely given way, on this side of the \n     Atlantic, to a better understanding of our common interests \n     and our shared objective.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/29/senate-section/article/S11347-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BRIAN BENCZKOWSKI\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, at the end of this session of the 106th \nCongress Brian Benczkowski will be leaving my staff. Brian has worked \non the Hill since his third year in law school. He stared as an intern \nwhile still in law school, served as the senior analyst for judiciary \nissues for the Senate Budget Committee, and worked closely with my \ngeneral counsel to develop, and enact, over the President's veto, the \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n  Brian was my counsel for the second round of Whitewater hearings and \nwas part of the team for the historic impeachment trial of President \nClinton. Brian worked on Juvenile Justice legislation, and helped me \ntake on the Mexican drug lords.\n  He learned the highway, airport and other infrastructure needs of New \nMexico as well as any Highway and Transportation Secretary in any \nGovernor's cabinet. He was knowledgeable on immigration issues and \nhelped my caseworkers with the really tough, but worthy immigration \nproblems that are a daily fact of life in a border state. Just to prove \nthat Brian had a soft side, he was my staff person for Character Counts \nduring the 106th Congress.\n  Brian was instrumental in drafting the claims process legislation for \nthe victims of the Cerro Grande fire. From the date that the fire first \nstarted to the day that the President signed the bill, complete with \nthe $640 million to pay the claims, was fifty days. It is a good \nlegislative product, and it proved that the delegation and the Congress \ncould be bipartisan and act expeditiously in an emergency.\n  Brian is a talented lawyer, a caring and hard working member of my \nstaff.\n  For a young man raised in Virginia, taught the law in Missouri with \nparents now living in Connecticut, he has made many New Mexico friends, \ndeveloped a taste for green chile and amassed an understanding of the \nborder. At one point I remarked that his Spanish was as good as any \nother staff member in my office.\n  So what is it that such a talented young man would choose to do when \nleaving Capitol Hill?\n  Banking legislative assistants and counsels with backgrounds in \nsecurities often end up at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission or at one of the Wall Street \nfirms. However, the typical career path wouldn't do for this \nuntypically talented young lawyer. He is going to New York to work for \nthe first, real sports stock market.\n  This new sports stock market will list the baseball and other trading \ncards of today's marquee athletes and major league sports rising stars. \nJust like any major stock exchange, the exchange is a market maker. \nJust like E-trade or Ameritrade people will have sports brokerage \naccounts.\n  Brian is a baseball fan, former baseball player and a font of \nknowledge when it comes to sports. As a former minor league baseball \nplayer myself, I know baseball and am a fan of most other sports. ESPN \nwas a great invention that adds to most men's enjoyment of life, sports \nand the pursuit of happiness. Hopefully, this new sports stock exchange \nwill add another dimension to the way we all follow sports.\n  Many of us share a passion for sports, but very few of us get to take \nthat passion, and merge it with the law, get an impressive title like \nassistant general counsel, receive a pay check and stock options. \nHowever, Brian is going to do just that at thePit.com. I wish him and \nhis new company every success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/29/senate-section/article/S11347-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 7:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Kellaher, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas passed the following joint resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.
