Then I ask unanimous consent that the votes occur with \nrespect to the pending amendments in stacked sequence beginning at 2:15 \np.m. today and that there be 5 minutes for debate to be equally divided \nfor closing remarks prior to the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to table both amendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to move to table \neach amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we are talking about tabling the \namendments this afternoon; is that right--not now?\n  Mr. HATCH. No. When they occur, they will be tabled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 2537 and 2538\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I remind my colleagues of \nwhat I said last week about this legislation which I think, with all \ndue respect to my colleague--I do have a lot of admiration for Senator \nHatch--is still fundamentally flawed legislation. It contains numerous \nprovisions which are unbelievably harsh toward those citizens who are \nmost vulnerable in our society, and that troubles this Senator.\n  I think the entire concept of the bill is wrong. It addresses a \ncrisis that appears to be self-directed. It rewards predatory and \nreckless lending by banks and credit card companies which fed the \ncrisis in the first place, and it does nothing to actually prevent \nbankruptcy by closing economic security to working families. I reject \nthe notion the Senate should assume that there are problems with the \nbankruptcy code because more people are going bankrupt.\n  Real bankruptcy reform would address the root causes of bankruptcy. \nIt would address the concentration of financial markets which are \nincreasing the clout and power of big banks and credit card companies \nto unprecedented levels. It would make working families more \nfinancially secure. It would address skyrocketing medical expenses. It \nwould confront the economic balkanization in this country, the \nincreasing schism between the wealthy and the rest of America.\n  This bill does none of these things. It imposes harsh penalties on \nfamilies who, by and large, file for bankruptcy in good faith because \nit is the only option they have.\n  The two amendments I have offered to this bill--the payday loan \namendment, which would curb a form of predatory lending which targets \nlow- and moderate-income working families, and also the low-cost basic \nbanking amendment, which would require big banks with more than $200 \nmillion in assets to offer low-cost banking services to their customers \nif they wish to be able to make claims against debtors in bankruptcy \nproceedings--would go a long way toward making this bill more fair and \nmore balanced.\n  When I spoke last week, I said the bankruptcy crisis is over and it \nended without Congress passing legislation. I cited the fact that \nbankruptcy proceedings actually fell last year--fell last year, I \nrepeat--by 112,000 cases.\n  My good friend from Alabama came to the floor and said something \nthat, actually, I think is true: This bill doesn't have anything to do \nwith the number of bankruptcies. I think he was more right than \nprobably any of us want to seem to admit. But the decrease in \nbankruptcy filings is significant, and let me explain why.\n  Ironically, the bankruptcy crisis probably ended because Congress has \nnot passed a bill. The bean counters in the consumer credit industry \nrealized that all of these bankruptcies were not good for profits, so \nthey started lending less money. They were more careful about to whom \nthey lent the money. In fact, overall consumer debt actually declined \nin 1998. And guess what. There were fewer bankruptcies. But if S. 625 \nbecomes law, bankruptcy protection will be harshly rolled back. It will \neven be more profitable to overburden folks with debt, and the banks \nand credit card companies will fall over themselves trying to do it. \nBut this time, America's working families are going to pay even more of \na price.\n  This argument isn't purely historical or theoretical. Empirical data \nbacks it up. I want to take my colleagues through a little bit of \nhistory. I want to read from an article published in the August 13, \n1984, issue of Business Week. The article was entitled: ``Consumer \nLenders Love the New Bankruptcy Laws.'' It was written in the aftermath \nof Congress' last tightening of the bankruptcy code in 1984. Here is \nhow the article goes:\n\n       It doesn't take much to get a laugh out of Finn Casperson \n     these days. Just ask him the outlook for Beneficial Corp. now \n     that the U.S. has a tough new bankruptcy law. ``It looks a \n     lot rosier,'' says the chairman of the consumer finance \n     company, punctuating the assessment with a hearty chuckle.\n\n  The article then explains what the banks and credit card industries \ngot back in 1984:\n\n       But when someone seems to be abusing the revised law, a \n     judge can, on his or her own, throw a case out of Chapter 7, \n     leaving the debtor to file under Chapter 13. And in Chapter \n     13, where an individual works out a repayment plan under \n     court supervision, lenders now can get a court order \n     assigning all of a borrower's income for three years to \n     repaying debts . . .\n\n  Anyway, it goes on to say that the lender does not have to worry any \nlonger and they can have these predatory practices and they can target \npeople and they do not have to worry if there is no protection for \npeople. But there is protection for them.\n  Does this sound familiar to my colleagues? These ``reforms\" --and I \nput ``reforms'' in quotes--are substantially similar to what the \nindustry says are desperately needed now--that means to curb abusive \nfilings. That is exactly what the Congress gave the credit card \nindustry in 1984. But the question is, After we passed that bill in \n1984, how did lenders behave after the ``strengthening'' of the \nbankruptcy code? That story will help us answer the question: If we \ngive them this new, stricter, lopsided law in 2000, what will they do \nwith it?\n  From the same 1984 Business Week article:\n\n       Lenders say they will make more unsecured loans from now \n     on, trying to lure back the generally younger and lower-\n     income borrowers recently turned away.\n\n  Why not? We are giving them all the protection in the world. They can \ngo about with all kinds of unscrupulous practices that I am going to \ntalk about: Target poor people, target single parents, target young \npeople, and not have to worry.\n\n  But that is exactly the problem. The consumer finance industry went \nafter these folks with a vengeance post 1984. Lenders felt so protected \nby the new bankruptcy law that they eventually threw caution to the \nwind and began using the same aggressive, borderline deceptive and \nabusive tactics that are now common in the industry. That is exactly \nwhat we are going to do with this law--give them a blank check to \ncontinue with this deception.\n  In a 1999 Harvard Business School study entitled, ``The Rise of \nConsumer Bankruptcy: Evolution, Revolution, or Both?'' David Moss of \nthe Harvard Business School and Gibbs Johnson, an attorney, lay out the \ncase. They say--colleagues and staff listening to this debate, I think \nthis is an important piece:\n\n       It is conceivable, therefore, that the pro-creditor reforms \n     of 1984 actually contributed to the growth of consumer \n     (bankruptcy) filings. This could have occurred if the reforms \n     exerted a larger impact in encouraging lenders to lend--and \n     to lend more deeply into the income distribution--than they \n     did in deterring borrowers from borrowing and filing.\n\n  Mark Zandi, in the January 1997 edition of the Regional Financial \nReview, writes:\n\n       While forcing more households into a Chapter 13 filing, \n     though an income test would raise the amount that lenders \n     would ultimately recover from bankrupt borrowers, it would \n     not significantly lower the net cost of bankruptcies.\n\n  I emphasize:\n\n       Tougher bankruptcy laws will simply induce lenders to ease \n     their standards further.\n\n  That is exactly what we are doing with this bill.\n  Again, we know this is exactly what happened. Credit card companies \nsent out over 3.5 billion solicitations last year. They use aggressive \ntactics to sign up borrowers. Is there anything in this ``reform'' \nlegislation that holds them accountable? No. Once again, the big givers \nand heavy hitters and well-connected dominate. But when it\n\n[[Page S169]]\n\ncomes to the poor, when it comes to single-parent families, when it \ncomes to senior citizens, when it comes to the people who are most \nvulnerable, we have unbelievable harshness in this legislation.\n  These credit card companies use aggressive tactics to sign up \nborrowers--and to keep you in debt once they get you. They also go \nafter low-income individuals, even though they might not be good credit \nrisks. Why? Because they are desperate for credit. They have a captive \naudience. Poor people can be charged exorbitant interest rates and \nfees. Despite the fact that there are hundreds of credit card firms \ntargeting low-income borrowers, interest rates and terms on these cards \nhave not been driven down by the supposed ``competition.''\n  For these borrowers, for low-income people, the market is failing.\n  In a June 3, 1999, interview in USA Today, Joe Lee, a respected \nbankruptcy judge for over 37 years in the Eastern District of Kentucky, \nplaced the blame for the current high number of bankruptcies squarely \non the backs of the banks and the credit card companies. There is not a \nword in this legislation holding them at all accountable for their \nunscrupulous practices; they all target people who are desperate for \ncredit and have no other choice but to receive loans on horrible terms, \nthe poor and the vulnerable.\n  When asked if he had seen many people file for bankruptcy who could \nafford to pay most of their debts, he said--because that is the premise \nof this legislation, that you have all this abuse--\n\n       No. It's simply not true. Most of them are very poor, \n     drowning in debt. The target (of bankruptcy reform) should be \n     the consumer credit [card] industry and the laws governing \n     extension of consumer credit. Instead they're robbing the \n     poor to enrich the rich.\n\n  That is exactly what this legislation does. But these poor people are \ninvisible. They have no clout. They have no power. They have no \nlobbyists. They are not the heavy hitters. They are not the big givers. \nThey are left out.\n  USA Today also asked Judge Lee if he thought there was less stigma \nattached to bankruptcy than there used to be. He said:\n\n       I've been on the bench now for 37 years, working on 38. I \n     never have seen this business about debtors being cavalier \n     about bankruptcy.\n       Look at it from the point of view of the debtor. They have \n     mothers and fathers. They go to church. They have neighbors. \n     They have to walk into the office after filing for bankruptcy \n     and explain it to other employees, and this is not easy to \n     do. There's the additional stigma that bankruptcy remains on \n     your credit report for 10 years. You have trouble getting \n     credit other than at high interest rates. You have difficulty \n     buying a home. You have lots of problems.\n\n  What Judge Lee is saying is borne out by the facts. Remember, as I \nstated last year, the vast majority of families who file for bankruptcy \nare not trying to beat the system. They file for a fresh start. That is \nwhat bankruptcy provides for them. It is the only way they can get out \nfrom crushing medical bills or other debts brought on by unforeseen \ncircumstances. Only a very small percentage--perhaps 3 percent--of \nthose who file for bankruptcy file abusively, according to the American \nBankruptcy Institute. The American Bankruptcy Institute says about 3 \npercent of the people abuse this system. The Justice Department goes \nhigher. For that, we have this wide, broad net that punishes the poor \nand the most vulnerable.\n  A constituent from Crystal, MN, wrote to my office in July to tell me \nabout her experience with bankruptcy:\n\n       What I want you to know specifically is that this one \n     credit card company would not offer any reductions in the \n     interest rate, demanded over one quarter of my entire monthly \n     income, did not care if I could not meet my payments for the \n     most basic requirements of human existence, suggested that I \n     use a food shelf, and they refused to acknowledge that my \n     child was suicidal and that their harassing phone calls to my \n     house nearly caused her to overdose on the only \n     nonprescription pain relievers that I could have for myself.\n\n  What was the reason for that? Her life was like ours. Actually, we \nmake a lot more money than she made. She was a worker. She had a \nfactory job. An injury forced her to leave the job. For all I know, it \ncould have been a ruptured disk. I know what a ruptured disk is like. \nShe worked multiple minimum-wage jobs for several years. Her marriage \nfell apart, and her daughter fell into deep clinical depression. No \nfault of hers; no fault of her daughter's. In the meantime, she \nenrolled in computer school so she could pursue a career that would \ngive her some income and would also help her help her daughter. She \npurchased a computer on credit so she could spend more time working at \nhome. In time the payments on the computer, her mortgage, and her \ndaughter's medical bills became too much, and she fell behind on debt \npayments. When the creditors approached her, she tried to work out a \nrepayment schedule she could meet, and then the quote I read is what \nhappened to her. So she filed for bankruptcy.\n\n  She has begun to rebuild her life. She ended her letter by saying \nthis:\n\n       Please do not vote for Senate Bill 625 or any other bill \n     that makes bankruptcy harder for people who find themselves \n     caught in the unforeseen predicaments of life for which they \n     have no control. It is not fair to pass a bill that helps the \n     credit card companies by hurting people like me without \n     forcing them to look at what they are doing and how they \n     respond. They have many options that could be used without \n     creating the emotional trauma that forces hard working people \n     to choose the relief of bankruptcy.\n\n  I ask my colleagues, is there one thing in this piece of legislation \nthat could have helped this woman head off bankruptcy, a Minnesotan? \nAbsolutely not. This bill would simply have made it harder for her to \nget the relief necessary for her to take care of herself and her \ndaughter. Why aren't we talking about what could have kept this woman \nout of bankruptcy? What does this bill have to do with helping a woman \nor a man educate themselves so they can do better for their family? The \nanswer: Nothing. What does this bill do to help ordinary people who are \noverwhelmed by medical expenses? The answer is: Absolutely nothing. \nWhat does this bill do to promote economic stability for working \nfamilies? Absolutely nothing.\n  I believe if my colleagues wanted to reduce the number of \nbankruptcies, they would focus more on providing a helping hand rather \nthan removing a safety net. If my colleagues wanted to tackle \nbankruptcy, they would take on the credit card companies and their \nabusive tactics. No, we don't want to take on those interests. \nUnfortunately, my constituent's story, a woman from Minnesota, single \nparent, is becoming increasingly typical. All too often overburdened \nfamilies, the vast majority of them single-wage-earner families headed \nby a woman, have to deal with these circumstances all the time.\n  This year more than a half million women-headed households filed for \nbankruptcy. Women-headed households are the poorest group of families \nin America. They are the largest group who have to file for bankruptcy. \nIronically, the credit card industry has run advertisements--I cannot \nbelieve this--during debate on this bill talking about how friendly \nthis piece of legislation is toward women and children. They have no \nshame. This is ridiculous.\n  I will read from a letter signed by approximately 70 scholars at our \nNation's law schools who are opposed to this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter, along with a list of a \nvariety of consumer, women, and union organizations be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 November 2, 1999.\n     Re: The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999 (S. 625)\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: In a letter to you dated September 7, 82 \n     professors of bankruptcy law from across the country \n     expressed their grave concerns about some of the provisions \n     of S. 625. In a public letter dated September 16, two \n     professors took the opposing view. One of the principal \n     concerns of the 82 professors was that S. 625 ``may adversely \n     affect women and children.''\n       Proponents of the bill--namely, the consumer credit \n     industry--have responded to the concerns raised about the \n     effects of the bill on women and children with a media blitz \n     trumpeting the view that ``Bankruptcy reform helps women and \n     children.'' A September 14 letter from consumer credit \n     issuers proclaims that ``S. 625 vastly improves the position \n     of women and children who depend on family support payments \n     from an absent parent who has filed for bankruptcy.'' A full-\n     page advertisement also\n\n[[Page S170]]\n\n     dated September 14 asserts, ``The truth is that bankruptcy \n     reform gives much-needed help to single parents and their \n     children who are dependent on family support payments.'' The \n     advertisement cautions in large type: ``Distorting the facts \n     about reform helps no one.''\n       The undersigned professors agree that ``distorting the \n     facts about reform helps no one.'' The real distortion is the \n     assertion that S. 625 would benefit women and children. The \n     truth is that, notwithstanding the pleas of the bill's \n     proponents, S. 625 does not help women and children. Thirty-\n     one organizations devoted exclusively to promoting the best \n     interests of women and children continue to oppose the \n     pending bankruptcy bill. The concerns expressed in the \n     professors' letter of September 7 regarding how S. 625 would \n     hurt women and children have not been resolved--they have not \n     even been addressed.\n       First, one of the biggest problems the bill presents for \n     women and children was stated in the September 7 letter:\n       ``Women and children as creditors will have to compete with \n     powerful creditors to collect their claims after \n     bankruptcy.''\n       This increased competition for women and children will come \n     from many quarters: from powerful credit card issuers, whose \n     credit card claims increasingly will be excepted from \n     discharge and remain legal obligations of the debtor after \n     bankruptcy; from large retailers, who will have an easier \n     time obtaining reaffirmations of debt that legally could be \n     discharged; and from creditors claiming they hold security, \n     even when the alleged collateral is virtually worthless. None \n     of the changes made to S. 625 and none being proposed \n     addresses these problems. The truth remains: if S. 625 is \n     enacted in its current form, women and children will face \n     increased competition in collecting their alimony and support \n     claims after the bankruptcy case is over.\n       Second, it is a red herring to argue, as do advocates of \n     the bill in touting how the bill will ``help'' women and \n     children, that it will ``Make child support and alimony \n     payments the top priority--no exceptions.'' True enough--\n     but, as the law professors pointed out in the September 7 \n     letter: ``Giving `first priority' to domestic support \n     obligations does not address the problem.''\n       Granting ``first priority'' to alimony and support claims \n     is not the magic solution the consumer credit industry claims \n     because ``priority'' is relevant only for distributions made \n     to creditors in the bankruptcy case itself. Such \n     distributions are made in only a negligible percentage of \n     cases. More than 95% of bankruptcy cases make NO \n     distributions to any creditors because there are no assets to \n     distribute. Granting women and children a first priority for \n     bankruptcy distributions permits them to stand first in line \n     to collect nothing.\n       The hard-fought battle is over reaching the ex-husband's \n     income after bankruptcy. Under current law, child support and \n     alimony share a protected post-bankruptcy position with only \n     two other collectors of debt--taxes and student loans. The \n     credit industry asks that credit card debt and other consumer \n     credit share that position, thereby elbowing aside the women \n     trying to collect on their own behalf. The credit industry \n     carefully avoids discussing the increased post-bankruptcy \n     competition facing women if S. 625 becomes law. As a matter \n     of public policy, does this country want to elevate credit \n     card debt to the preferred position of taxes and child \n     support?\n       In addition to the concerns raised on behalf of the \n     thousands of women who are struggling now to collect alimony \n     and child support after their ex-husband's bankruptcies, we \n     also express our concerns on behalf of the more than half a \n     million women heads of household who will file for bankruptcy \n     this year alone. As the heads of the economically most \n     vulnerable families, they have a special stake in the pending \n     legislation. Women heads of households are now the largest \n     demographic group in bankruptcy, and according to the credit \n     industry's own data, they are the poorest. The provisions in \n     this bill, particularly the provisions that apply without \n     regard to income, will fall hardest on them. A single mother \n     with dependent children who is hopelessly insolvent and whose \n     income is far below the national median income still would \n     have her bankruptcy case dismissed if she does not present \n     copies of income tax returns for the past three years--even \n     if those returns are in the possession of her ex-husband. A \n     single mother who hoped to work through a chapter 13 payment \n     plan would be forced to pay every penny of the entire debt \n     owed on almost worthless items of collateral, such as used \n     furniture or children's clothes, even if it meant that \n     successful completion of a repayment plan was impossible.\n       These two facts are unassailable: S. 625 forces women to \n     compete with sophisticated creditors to collect alimony and \n     child support after bankruptcy. S. 625 makes it harder for \n     women to declare bankruptcy when they are in financial \n     trouble. We implore you to look beyond the distorted \n     ``facts'' peddled by the credit industry. Do not pass a bill \n     to hurt women and children.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                        Sixty-nine (69) Professors\n       Charles J.

The letter begins:\n\n       In a letter to you, dated September 7, 82 professors of \n     bankruptcy law from across this country expressed their grave \n     concerns about some of the provisions of S. 625. In a public \n     letter dated September 16, two professors took the opposing \n     view. One of the principal concerns of the 82 law professors \n     was that S. 625 may adversely affect women and children.\n       Proponents of the bill--namely, the consumer credit \n     industry--have responded to the concerns raised about the \n     effects of the bill on women and children with a media blitz. \n     . . .\n\n  They have the money for a media blitz. These women and children don't \nhave the money for that.\n\n       . . . trumpeting the view that ``Bankruptcy reform helps \n     women and children.'' A September 14 letter from the consumer \n     credit issuers proclaims that ``S. 625 vastly improves the \n     position of women and children who depend on family support \n     payments from an absent parent who has filed for \n     bankruptcy.'' A full-page advertisement also dated September \n     14 asserts, ``The truth is that bankruptcy reform gives much-\n     needed help to single parents and their children who are \n     dependent on family support payments.'' The advertisement \n     cautions in large type: ``Distorting the facts about reform \n     helps no one.'' The undersigned professors agree that \n     ``distorting the facts about reform helps no one.'' The real \n     distortion is the assertion that S. 625 would benefit women \n     and children.\n\n  You can pass this legislation but I am not going to let you get by \nwith that claim.\n\n       The truth is that notwithstanding the pleas of the bill's \n     proponents, this legislation does not help women and \n     children. Thirty-one organizations devoted exclusively to \n     promoting the best interests of women and children continue \n     to oppose this pending bankruptcy bill. The concerns \n     expressed in the professors' letter of September 7 regarding \n     how S. 625 would hurt women and children have not been \n     resolved--they have not even been addressed.\n\n  Reading from one other section of the letter:\n\n       We also express our concerns on behalf of the more than \n     half a million women heads of household who will file for \n     bankruptcy this year alone. As the heads of the economically \n     most vulnerable families, they have a special stake in the \n     pending legislation. Women heads of households are now the \n     largest demographic group in bankruptcy and according to the \n     credit industry's own data, they are the poorest. The \n     provisions in this bill, particularly the provisions that \n     apply without regard to income, will fall hardest on them. A \n     single mother with dependent children who is hopelessly \n     insolvent and whose income is far below the national median \n     income still would have her bankruptcy case dismissed if she \n     does not present copies of income tax returns for the past \n     three years--even if those returns are in the possession of \n     her ex-husband. A single mother who hoped to work through a \n     chapter 13 payment plan would be forced to pay every penny of \n     the entire debt owed on almost worthless items of collateral, \n     such as used furniture or children's clothes, even if it \n     meant that successful completion of the repayment plan was \n     impossible.\n\n  I don't think the choice could be framed any more starkly. Here is \nthe core question:\n  Will Senators be on the side of these women who are struggling to \nraise their families or do they see these women as the banks and the \ncredit card companies do--as an economic opportunity, ripe for \nexploitation?\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will recognize as they take a \nsecond look at this legislation that a vote for this bill is a vote \nagainst consumers; it is against women, it is against children, and it \nis against working families.\n  I believe our country and our society and this Senate should be \njudged by how we treat our society's most vulnerable members. By this \nstandard, this is an exceptionally harsh piece of legislation. All the \nconsumer groups oppose this bill; 31 organizations that are devoted to \nwomen and children's issues oppose this bill.\n  The two amendments I will speak to after I have given them context \nare my payday loan amendment, which would curb a form of predatory \nlending that targets low- and moderate-income and working families, and \nthe low-cost, basic banking amendment, which would require big banks \nwith more than $200 million in assets to offer low-cost, basic banking \nservices to customers if they wish to be able to make claims against \nthe debtors in bankruptcy proceedings. I think that would make the \nlegislation at least a little bit more fair and balanced.\n  First, let me speak to my payday loan amendment. This is one that \nshould have the vote of 100 Senators. This amendment would prevent \nclaims in bankruptcy on high-cost transactions in which the annual rate \nexceeds 100 percent. That is what I am going to ask Senators to vote \non. We would prevent claims in bankruptcy on transactions in which the \nannual rate exceeds 100 percent--such as payday loans and car title \npawns. Now, these loans are marketed as giving the borrower a ``little \nextra until payday.''\n  Do you know what happens with these loans? It is incredible. You have \nhard-pressed people, poor people, senior citizens, women, people of \ncolor, people who live in our rural and urban areas, and they can't get \nthe credit any other way, so they get a loan for $100, which will hold \nthem over until they get their paycheck. They get charged these huge \nfees--15 percent or more. These credit companies, unscrupulous \ncompanies, can put a lien on their car and even require that they give \nthem the key to the car, and then when they can't pay it back--which is \noften the case--they just keep rolling the loan over and over and over \nagain. For example, a $15 fee on a 2-week loan of $100 ends up being an \nannual rate of about 391 percent because people ask for the loans over \nand over again. Rates can be actually as high as 2,000 percent per \nyear, or they take title to the car.\n  This is absolutely incredible. Someone can take out a $100 loan, and \nthe car might be worth $2,000, and these companies that we don't do a \ndarn thing about--I know some of the national media has had some \nexposure, thank God. I just hope the Senate is sensitive to this \nquestion. They are hard-pressed people with nowhere to go for a $100 \nloan. Maybe there has been an illness in the family or the car broke \ndown, or whatever the case is. They end up getting charged 300, 400, \n500, 600 percent. Then they get harassed and they say: We have the \ncheck you made out to us. We are going to cash the check and you will \nbe charged with writing a bad check and you can go to prison. These are \nunscrupulous practices. If the car is worth $2,000, they can basically \nrepossess the car, sell the car, and in a lot of States they don't even \nhave to give back to the owner anything that they make over what the \nowner owed them. Can you imagine that that goes on in this country? Why \nin this ``bankruptcy reform'' legislation have we not at least paid a \nlittle bit more attention to how we can protect some of our consumers?\n\n  Now, nobody needs to charge this type of interest rate for a loan. \nIndeed, this industry is grossly profitable as a result. Stephens \nIncorporated, one of our investors, says they can expect a return of 48 \npercent in 9 months to a year and can expect profit margins in excess \nof 30 percent. Stevens Incorporated reported that there were 6,000\n\n[[Page S172]]\n\nstorefronts making payday loans in 1999 across the country but \nestimates the potential ``mature'' market as being 24,000 stores \nnationwide generating $6 billion in fees. With these kinds of profits, \nonly your conscience will keep you out of this business.\n  With these kinds of profits, only your conscience will keep you out \nof this business. It is amazing. You make these loans, you say you are \ngoing to help people, you charge them high fees, and you roll it over \nand over again. You end up charging way above 100 percent per year. You \nrepossess their car. You sell the car. You don't even give them back \nthe additional money you make beyond what they owed you. You do all \nthis with impunity, and these are the poorest people, most vulnerable \npeople who are targeted, and we don't have anything in this legislation \nto protect them. Let me tell you, Senators, if you want to protect \nthem, you will and you should vote for this amendment.\n  I say to my colleagues that these sleazy debt merchants, expanding \ntheir tentacles into our cities and towns, are the mirror image of the \nretreat of our Main Street and mainstream financial institutions from \nthe same communities. Some of my colleagues on the floor know this. \nWhen we had our community banks and smaller banks, they cared. They \nhelped small businesses out and helped out hard-pressed people. They \nwere willing to help out. But now that we have moved to these branch \nbanks and all of this consolidation, they don't. So people have to rely \non these kinds of loans.\n  According to an analysis by the brokerage firm Piper Jaffrey, as \nreported in the Washington Post, ``established customers'' of one \npayday lender engaged in 11 transactions a year and could end up paying \n$165 to $330 for a $100 loan.\n  This vote is going to be watched. This is one I think national media \nwill pay attention to because we have had some horror stories. We know \nabout what has happened to people. The question is, Whose side are we \non? Are we on the side of vulnerable people or on the side of single-\nparent households headed by women, on the side of children, or are we \non the side of these unscrupulous credit card companies?\n  The following June 18 New York Times piece is typical of the horror \nstories associated with payday lending:\n\n       Shari Harris, who earns around $25,000 a year as an \n     information security analyst, was managing money well enough \n     until the father of her two children, 10 and 4, stopped \n     paying $1,200 in child support. ``And then,'' Ms. Harris \n     said, ``I learned about the payday loan places.'' She \n     qualified immediately for a two-week $150 loan at Check Into \n     Cash, handing it a check for $183 to include the $33 fee. ``I \n     started maneuvering my way around until I was with seven of \n     them,'' she said. In six months, she owed $1,900 and was \n     paying fees at a rate of $6,000 a year. ``That's the sickness \n     of it,'' Ms. Harris said. ``I was in a hole worse than when I \n     started. I had to figure out a way to get out of it.''\n\n  Mr. President, here is where we are. If you have desperate \ncustomers--the most vulnerable--and these are the kinds of loans they \nare dependent upon, where the terms are outrageous--only somebody with \nno alternative would seek to borrow money at such scandalous rates.\n  The Consumer Federation of America noted in a September 1999 report \nentitled ``Safe harbor for Usury'' that, quote:\n\n       Consumers who are desperate enough for credit to pay triple \n     digit interest rates for two week loans have very little \n     market power to bring rates down. The real costs of payday \n     loans made in small sums for very short periods of time may \n     not be clear to unsophisticated consumers. When lenders deny \n     that their cash advances are `loans' and fail to comply with \n     Truth and Lending Act disclosures of Annual Percentage Rates, \n     consumers do not have the key price tag needed to comparison \n     shop for credit. If, as the industry claims, payday loan \n     customers have nowhere else to go for small loans, rate \n     regulation is necessary to prevent abuse of a captive market.\n\n  That is what is going on. The industry is saying to Senators: Oh, no, \nyou can't do anything about this because these people are desperate and \nthey come to us for loans and we perform a vital service. But does that \njustify scandalous fees? On the contrary, it justifies stringent \nregulation to protect the most vulnerable citizens. What are we about \nif we cannot at least extend this kind of protection?\n  If it is poor credit which drives a borrower to a payday lender, the \nborrower is likely to find himself in still deeper water after taking \none of these high interest loans. For example, in Tennessee--the state \nwith the highest bankruptcy rate in the country--payday lending is \nbecoming an increasing problem for the bankruptcy system. As one \nChapter 13 bankruptcy trustee, as quoted in the March 18th edition of \nThe Tennessean put it, quote:\n\n       I see them (payday lenders) as the last straw. I would \n     certainly say they are compounding the problem. We are \n     dealing with a bankruptcy filing rate that's through the \n     roof. You are looking at one of the basic causes: lending to \n     people who are not credit worthy and extracting exorbitant \n     interest rates from them.\n\n  Why aren't we doing something about this? This amendment says if you \nhave a 100-percent interest charge over a year, you are not at the \ntable when it comes to bankruptcy, and the collections of these payday \nloans can be coercive.\n  For example, in September, the Cook County, Illinois State's Attorney \nfiled suit against Nationwide Budget Finance, a St. Louis based payday \nlender, alleging multiple violations of Illinois Consumer Installment \nLoan Act and Consumer Fraud Act, charging that Nationwide threatened \nconsumers with criminal charges and lawsuits when it had no intention \nof taking such action. The State's attorney stated, quote: \n``Apparently, pay day loan businesses are so lucrative that it is more \ncost-effective to write off bad debts rather than to try and collect \nthem, even though they harass and intimidate their customers.'' \nAdditionally, the company required borrowers to list four references on \nthe loan application. But the references weren't used for the loan \napproval, instead Nationwide would place harassing to the people listed \nif the borrower defaulted.\n  That is why this amendment amends the Fair Debt Collection Practices \nAct to prohibit coercive collecting tactics in lending transactions \nwhere deferred cashing of a check is involved.\n  I should also point out that, at the very minimum, if we are going to \nbe talking about accountability and responsibility, why don't we make \nit a little more lenient with this piece of legislation? It takes two \nto tango. These unscrupulous credit card companies have something to do \nwith bankruptcy.\n  Such loans are patently abusive. They should not be protected by the \nbankruptcy system. And because they are so expensive, they should be \ncompletely dischargeable in bankruptcy so that debtors can get a true \nfresh start, and so that more responsible lenders' claims are not \n``crowded out'' by these shifty operators.\n  Consider that. Why should we penalize some of our good companies that \nare responsible lenders by letting these unscrupulous loan sharks be at \nthe table? Why should unscrupulous lenders have equal standing in \nbankruptcy court with a community banker or a credit union that tries \nto do right by their customers? And lenders should not be able to take \nadvantage of their customers' vulnerability through harassment and \ncoercion.\n  That is what this amendment is about.\n  Mr. President, my amendment simply says: if you charge over 100% \nannual interest on a loan, and the borrower goes bankrupt, you cannot \nmake a claim on that loan or the fees from the loan.\n  Colleagues, you have such a clear choice. There is no reason in the \nworld that you should not vote for this amendment.\n  I grant you that I come to the floor today to speak for some people \nwho haven't been included in the system. They are just poor and they \nare vulnerable, and therefore they are fair game for these companies.\n  I have just said to you that my amendment says if you charge over 100 \npercent as an interest rate and the borrower goes bankrupt, you cannot \nmake a claim on that loan or on the fees on the loan.\n  Why don't we make the legislation just a teeny bit fairer? Why don't \nwe have just a little bit more balance? Why don't we go after these \nunscrupulous operators?\n  The second amendment I've offered on this bill is my low cost, basic \nbanking amendment. This important consumer amendment would require big \nbanks with more that $200 million in assets to offer low-cost basic \nbanking services to their customers if they wish\n\n[[Page S173]]\n\nto be able to make claims against debtors in bankruptcy proceedings.\n  We have been talking about responsibility. What about the \nresponsibility of the banks and the lending institutions to offer \ninexpensive means to conduct financial transactions and to save money \nfor low-income people?\n  Right now, the minimum balance that people are supposed to have in \ntheir accounts and the high fees mean that for about 12 million \nAmericans, they can't afford to open up an account; they can't afford \nto have a checking account. What happens when people can't afford to \nopen up a checking account? They are forced to complete their financial \ntransactions either through costly check-cashing operations or they \ncarry around whatever sums of money they have when they go out to \npurchase groceries or to pay their rent. These are risks that people \nshould not have to take.\n  For example, ACE Cash Express, a national check-cashing company, \ncharges between 3 and 6 percent of a check's value to convert the check \ninto cash. That is what poor people are forced to do. There would be a \ncharge of between $15 and $30 on a paycheck of $500. While that may not \nseem to be much money to many of my colleagues, to many low- and \nmoderate-income families who live paycheck to paycheck, that $30 could \nbe a meal; that $30 could be a piece of clothing they could buy for \ntheir child; that $30 could mean they could go visit a doctor.\n  We have been passing legislation that has driven these small banks \nout, that has led to all of these mergers and acquisitions, with these \nhuge branch banks making billions and billions of dollars. All I am \nsaying is, why can't we at least say to them: You have some community \nresponsibility; you ought to at least give people low-cost basic bank \nservices. If you do not, then you are not at the table in bankruptcy \nproceedings against such a bank.\n  This amendment focuses on banks with more than $200 million. I want \nto be crystal clear that I am not talking about the smaller banks \nbecause the smaller banks have done a good job. Much of my work is in \nrural America. The smaller banks and the community banks have done a \ngood job. They go out of their way to help. But the problem is that \nthese small community banks that have been connected to Main Street \nhave been connected by these huge financial conglomerates that are much \nmore connected to Wall Street. They don't really know the people. They \ndon't know them at all. They sure as heck don't go out of their way to \nhelp them.\n  Would this amendment present an unfair burden to these larger banks, \nas some of my colleagues may argue? Not according to a survey of the \nConsumer Bankers Association. According to the CBA, 70 percent of the \ninstitutions found that offering a basic bank account did not result in \na financial loss for their bank or impose a burden on their operation.\n  What in the world is going to happen to seniors? What is going to \nhappen to low-income elderly people? As the U.S. Government begins to \nmake the shift to electronic distribution of benefits, pensions, and \nwages, consumers must have access to banking services. Now more than \never, the 6.5 million recipients of Social Security and SSI, the \nSupplemental Security Income program, who do not have a checking \naccount, will face even a steeper uphill battle in their attempts to \naccess these funds. They currently cannot afford the monthly fees, nor \ndo they have the money to keep the minimum balance in their checking \naccounts necessary to complete these financial transactions.\n  What are we saying to senior citizens who in the future will need a \nbank simply to get their electronically transferred Social Security \ncheck? Let's not forget that it is not just the financial giants that \nare affected by this process of modernization. It is everyone. We \nshould not try to close the door to low-income consumers who \ndesperately need access to basic banking services. If we provide wider \naccess to bank accounts, we will reduce bankruptcy, we will promote \nfinancial literacy, and we will reduce low- and moderate-income \nfamilies' reliance on high-cost check cashers and payday lenders.\n  Why should bankers who are unwilling to promote the general good be \ngiven the same standing in bankruptcy court as those who do? I am tired \nof seeing the folks in the private sector who do the right thing being \nput at a competitive disadvantage because their competitors will not.\n  I will conclude by characterizing the debate this way: Over the past \nseveral decades, our economy has become more and more balkanized. We \nhave, indeed, seen an economy that is booming. But I come from a State \nwhere we have had an economic convulsion in agriculture and our family \nfarmers and our rural citizens are falling behind. The U.S. economy is \nbecoming more and more balkanized. More wealth and more economic power \nis concentrated among a few. What we have been doing in the Senate over \nthe past several years is passing legislation which provides the lion's \nshare of benefits for those at the top of the heap, those with the big \nbucks. The two amendments I have introduced give us an opportunity, in \na small way, to reverse this trend.\n  This bill is already an enormous giveaway to the financial services \nindustry. It basically rewards lenders for their aggressive, \nirresponsible lending habits. I went over that already. So I say to \ncolleagues, since we seem to be on our way to changing the rules for \nAmerica's working families with this legislation, since we seem to be \nabout to ratify the scandalous lending practices of the banking \nindustry, let the Senate adopt several amendments that balances this \nlegislation. Both of these amendments test whether we are serious about \ncurbing bankruptcy. These two amendments, the payday loan amendment and \nthe lifeline banking amendment, are antibankruptcy amendments. A vote \nfor either of these amendments is a vote to promote responsible \nfinancial habits among consumers and responsible lending from the \ncredit card companies--responsible lending from the credit card \ncompanies. A vote against these amendments sanctions the abandonment by \nbig banks of poor people and, increasingly, the middle class, and \nratifies the stranglehold that unscrupulous lenders have on low-income \nand moderate-income and working families. There is no doubt in my mind \nthis is a flawed piece of legislation. It punishes the vulnerable and \nrewards the big banks and credit card companies for their own poor \npractices.\n\n  Earlier I used the word ``injustice'' to describe this legislation. \nThat is exactly right. It will be a bitter irony if the creditors are \nable to use a crisis, largely of their own making, to convince Congress \nto reduce borrowers' access to bankruptcy relief. That is exactly what \nis going on.\n  I said at the beginning of my statement that real bankruptcy reform \nwould address the concentration of financial markets, which are \nincreasing the power and clout of the big banks and credit card \ncompanies to unprecedented levels. It would make working families more \nsecure. It would deal with the crisis in agriculture and what is \nhappening in rural America. It would address skyrocketing medical \nexpenses. It would confront the economic balkanization of the country. \nIt would confront the increasing chasm between the wealthy and the rest \nof America.\n  But instead of lifting up low-income and moderate-income and working-\nincome families, this bill punishes them. I hope my colleagues reject \nthis legislation. I strongly urge the Senate to at least provide some \nbalance to this legislation and to accept my amendments.\n  I have also a document from the Department of Labor, written by an \nofficer, Capt. Robert W. ``Andy'' Andersen, and I believe this was \nwritten to Senator Lieberman. In this letter, he is talking about these \npayday loans. What he is saying is we have this problem in the \nmilitary. We have our military people who are underpaid--we know all \nabout this--so they end up having to rely on these payday loans, and \nthe same thing happens to them, to men and women in the Armed Forces. \nWe do not pay them enough, we don't reward their work, we don't provide \nthem the salaries they and their families deserve--just like other low- \nand moderate-income people--and then they rely on these payday loans. \nThey are desperate. They take out a loan for $100 which then gets \nrolled over and over and over again or have liens put on their car, \nthey lose that car, they get charged interest rates of 300, 400, 500 or \n600 percent a year, and it is a living hell for their families, because \nof the same practices by unscrupulous\n\n[[Page S174]]\n\nlenders who are making billions of dollars. I think we ought to be on \nthe side of these men and women in our military who are confronted with \nthis.\n  But you know what, I am not going to use this as the big emotional \nargument in this debate. It is not just the military. It is low- and \nmoderate-income people. It is men and women in the Armed Forces. It is \na lot of single-parent families, I am sorry to say most of them headed \nby women. It is some of our senior citizens. Contrary to the \nstereotype, the income profile of elderly Minnesotans and elderly \npeople in Utah and around the country is not very high. It is basically \nthe most vulnerable citizens in our country.\n  I will speak to this payday loan. I would like to know why in the \nworld there would be opposition to this amendment. We are saying if you \nare charging over 100 percent interest a year, you are not going to be \nat the table. I thought we were on the side of consumers when it comes \nto people being charged exorbitant fees and interest rates. It says you \ncannot use these coercive practices that the State of Illinois is going \nafter these consumers on wherein they threaten people and tell them \nthey are going to cash their checks and then they are going to end up \ngoing to prison.\n\n  I believe the vote on these amendments--and I am going to focus on \nthe payday amendment--is a test case. This is a test case vote. \nWhatever you think about the overall bill--I have laid out my case \nagainst it--on this amendment this is a test case as to whether or not \nwe can at least provide some protection to the most vulnerable \ncitizens, whether or not we are on the side of the most vulnerable \npeople, women and children, whether we are on the side of low- and \nmoderate-income, working-income families, whether we are on the side of \nhard-pressed people, whether we are on the side of regular people, \nwhether we are on the side of ordinary citizens, or whether we are on \nthe side of unscrupulous loan shark companies that have no conscience \nand no soul and exploit people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hatch). Who seeks recognition? The Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is always a pleasure to listen to the \nSenator from Minnesota because whether he is right or wrong, he always \nspeaks with a great deal of passion. I want people who have ideas to \nhave passion for those ideas. Senator Wellstone is a person who speaks \nwith a great deal of passion and conviction.\n  I disagree with a lot of the points he has made; otherwise, we would \nnot have this legislation before us. On the other hand, on the subject \nof concentration, which he brought up, I have some sympathy for what he \nhas said. The solution to the concentration problem is we should get \nthis administration to vigorously enforce the antitrust laws both \nwithin the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. There \nis a general feeling among people about whether the marketplace is \nworking adequately and, consequently, support the antitrust laws. The \nantitrust laws are well written and have withstood a period of time, \nbut enforcement is very much an issue.\n  We are not talking about concentration, and we are not talking about \nenforcement of the antitrust laws when we deal with bankruptcy. We have \na very real problem. We have seen a dramatic increase in bankruptcies \nover the last 6 or 7 years. In 1993, we had 875,202 bankruptcies, and \nin 1998, it shot up to 1,442,549.\n  We have seen this dramatic increase in the number of bankruptcies \nduring one of the most prosperous times in the history of our country. \nIt has been the most prosperous for several reasons: One, information \ntechnology is helping to expand our economy and make it more efficient \nthan ever before.\n  The globalization of our economy has also reduced consumer costs, \ngiving consumers more money to expend on other things. We have seen \nCongress balance the budget in the last 3 years, and it worked toward \nthat for the last 6 years and made considerable progress. Now we are \npaying down the national debt for the third year in a row. All that has \ncontributed to it.\n  We are in the 18th year of economic expansion, which started in the \nsecond year of Ronald Reagan's administration. We had a turnaround in \nthe economy after the stagflation of the seventies, and except for a 6-\nmonth period of time in 1992, we have had 18 years of economic \nexpansion. During that period of economic expansion, we have had this \nvery dramatic increase in bankruptcies.\n  Why? I wish I could say there is just one reason, as the Senator from \nMinnesota seems to imply; that it is credit being extended too easily, \ntoo many credit cards. I agree that is a reason, but that is only one \nof the reasons.\n  Another reason is we have a bankruptcy bar that has, quite frankly, \nencouraged bankruptcies. We have shown during previous debates on this \nbill where bankruptcy lawyers in California advertise in the media how \nto get out of paying alimony and child support by going into \nbankruptcy. These types of practices, obviously, are not ethical but \nare still being used.\n  We also have the bad example set by the Federal Government of 30 \nyears of deficit spending. If Uncle Sam can borrow money into the \ntrillions of dollars over a period of 30 years, isn't it all right for \nMary Smith and Tom Jones or the people who are working in Anywhere USA \nto go into debt as well? Uncle Sam did not set a very good example. \nCongress, doing the fiscal policy for Uncle Sam, did not set a very \ngood example. It says to others: Yes, it's OK for you to go in debt.\n  The Federal Government has turned that around in 3 years by balancing \nthe budget and paying down some of the national debt and is on the road \nto paying down the national debt very dramatically over the next 10 to \n15 years.\n  We also have a situation where somehow financial responsibility is \nnot considered a personal responsibility anymore. In other words, it is \nOK to go into debt and not pay your bills. There used to be a certain \namount of shame connected with bankruptcy that does not seem to be \nthere now.\n  I gave four reasons--and there may be a lot more--of why we are \nprobably in this situation where we have had 18 years of economic \nexpansion since the second year of the Reagan administration and yet \nhave a historically high number of bankruptcies, and during the best \nyears of our economy, we have seen bankruptcies almost double in a \nperiod of 6 or 7 years.\n  Consequently, we have this legislation before us. I do not disregard \nthe words of the Senator from Minnesota that there are some people who \nare vulnerable and for whom we need to be concerned, but I say to the \nSenator from Minnesota, we are not extinguishing the principle that has \nbeen a part of the bankruptcy law for the last 102 years, permanent \nbankruptcy legislation. There are segments of our population in bad \nfinancial trouble, through no fault of their own, who need the help of \nbankruptcy. That could be death, divorce, a lot of medical expenses, a \nnatural disaster, for instance, if you are a farmer or some other small \nbusinessperson, or maybe even a homeowner who had a natural disaster \nthat was not properly insured.\n  Our code says there are select groups of people who are in a bad \nfinancial situation, through no fault of their own, who should have a \nfresh start. I say to the Senator from Minnesota and all the other \nSenators who question this legislation, we keep that principle, but we \nalso say this Congress has to send a clear signal to the 270 million \npeople in this country that if you have the ability to repay some or \nall of your debt, you are not going to get off scot-free. There are \nlarge numbers of people who are getting off scot-free, albeit they may \nbe a minority, but they are a significant minority, and it does not set \na very good example for some people to be able to use the bankruptcy \ncode as part of financial planning.\n  We are saying to those who can repay that they have to repay, but we \nare also sending a signal through this legislation to credit card \ncompanies that are willy-nilly sending out credit cards that encourage \nbankruptcy or even a lack of personal responsibility.\n  We are saying it has to be a new day. We want to discourage those \npeople who maybe are low income, who should not have gotten, through \ntheir own fault, into debt, and are not in the classification of people \nwho I say are entitled to a fresh start--that somehow they should think \nagain about going into bankruptcy and only use bankruptcy as a last \nresort.\n\n[[Page S175]]\n\n  We find that the 1978 law, obviously, has contributed some to the big \nincrease in bankruptcies. This legislation passed by a very wide \nmargin. So I do not think it was intended that the 1978 law ought to \nmake it easier to go into bankruptcy. But, obviously, it sent that \nsignal to a lot of people in America, as we have seen that the number \nof bankruptcies in 1980 was only 331,000 and now 18 years later, in \n1998, the figures are 1,442,000.\n  Something has happened recently. Again, I do not pretend to stand \nbefore the American people, or my colleagues in the Senate, and say \npassing a law is going to solve all these problems. I wish it would. It \nis going to be a combination of several things: the credit card \ncompanies or credit-granting companies to be more careful in who they \ngrant credit to; a Congress to be financially responsible and, hence, \nset a good example for every taxpayer and citizen in this country that \ndebt isn't OK; the bankruptcy bar to be a little more careful about \nencouraging people to go into bankruptcy and not to advertise that \nbankruptcy is OK as a way out; and then the law itself, by discouraging \npeople who can repay to use the bankruptcy code for financial planning.\n  In this whole process, I hope we then enhance personal \nresponsibility. By enhancing personal responsibility, then we can \nreduce these numbers of bankruptcies and then reduce the economic \nproblem we have--because we are not talking about something that does \nnot make an impact upon everybody.\n  Some people have put this at a $40 billion problem--$40 billion owed \nby those who go into bankruptcy and do not pay. Then every other \nconsumer in America picks up part of that tab. We have no doubt about \nit, if you are shoplifting, the honest consumer, who does not shoplift, \nis going to pay the cost of shoplifting. This is somewhat the same. If \nyou are a businessperson, and somebody does not pay their bills by \ndeclaring bankruptcy, the honest person buying goods from that same \nbusiness is going to pick up the tab. And $400, on average, for a \nfamily of four, is what we pay for other people who do not pay.\n  We hope to enhance personal responsibility. We hope to help the \neconomy in the process. But most importantly, this is something that \nmust be dealt with, and I think this legislation deals with it.\n  That is the background for this legislation. I think it is necessary \nto give some of that background, as I respond to some of the specific \nissues that the Senator from Minnesota brought up.\n  First of all, he mentioned the point that there has been some decline \nin the rate of growth of bankruptcies in recent years. We think that is \ntrue. It is a little bit too early to make that judgment. I hope it is \ntrue. I think it is a direct result of Congress talking about this \nhorrible economic problem we have of $40 billion and the lack of \npersonal responsibility which goes with that economic problem. Perhaps \nit is sending signals to some of the consumers to think twice about \nwhether bankruptcy is the right direction to go in. Maybe it sent a \nsignal to some of the bankruptcy lawyers in America to counsel people \nnot to go into bankruptcy.\n  I hope the leadership of this Congress over the last 3 years, in \ndiscussing this legislation--actually having passed it in the last \nCongress in both Houses, but not getting the final product to the \nPresident in time before adjournment--has done some good.\n  So we have had a very modest decline in bankruptcies in 1999 as \ncompared to 1998. But if you take the historical look--and I have \nreferred to some of those figures since 1980--Senator Wellstone's point \nthat the bankruptcy crisis is going away turns out to be false. I have \nreferred to the 330,000 bankruptcies we had in 1980, the year the new \ncode went into effect. But that has gone up to just under 1.4 million \nin 1999. Unlike the Senator from Minnesota, I think 1.4 million \nbankruptcies per year is a real crisis.\n  In the past, in the middle 1980s, and even once during the 1990s, we \nhave had some minor dips in the bankruptcy filings; but since then, as \nI have referred to, we have had this dramatic increase, almost \ndoubling, in the last 6 or 7 years.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a table of the \ntotal filings, business filings, nonbusiness filings, and the \npercentage of consumer filings of total filings.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    U.S. BANKRUPTCY FILINGS 1980-1998\n                     [Business, Non-Business, Total]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Consumer\n                                                              filings as\n                           Totals     Business      Non-          a\n          Year             filings     filings    business    percentage\n                                                   filings     of total\n                                                               filings\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1980                        331,264      43,694     287,570        86.81\n1981                        363,943      48,125     315,818        86.78\n1982                        380,251      69,300     310,951        81.78\n1983                        348,880      62,436     286,444        82.10\n1984                        348,521      64,004     284,517        81.64\n1985                        412,510      71,277     341,233        82.72\n1986                        530,438      81,235     449,203        84.69\n1987                        577,999      82,446     495,553        85.74\n1988                        613,465      63,853     549,612        89.59\n1989                        679,461      63,235     616,226        90.69\n1990                        782,960      64,853     718,107        91.72\n1991                        943,987      71,549     872,438        92.42\n1992                        971,517      70,643     900,874        92.73\n1993                        875,202      62,304     812,898        92.88\n1994                        832,829      52,374     780,455        93.71\n1995                        926,601      51,959     874,642        94.39\n1996                      1,178,555      53,549   1,125,006        95.46\n1997                      1,404,145      54,027   1,350,118        96.15\n1998                      1,442,549      44,367   1,398,182        96.92\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from Minnesota also made reference to some \nchanges in the bankruptcy code that were made by Senator Dole in 1984 \nwhich allowed judges to dismiss chapter 7 cases in cases of--these are \nthe words from the statute--``substantial abuse'' of the bankruptcy \ncode.\n  I spoke to this point a week ago. Obviously, the Senator from \nMinnesota did not have an opportunity to hear my remarks. But he would \nhave heard me state, in detail, how the 1984 legislation has not worked \nat all, regardless of its good intentions. Because under the 1984 \nlegislation, creditors are banned by law from bringing evidence of \nabuse to the attention of the judge.\n  Here we have a law that says if there is substantial abuse of the \nbankruptcy code, then the judge can determine that that certain \nbankrupt does not have a right to be in bankruptcy court. But then we \nhave another section that says creditors who might know about this \nabuse cannot bring evidence of that abuse to bankruptcy court.\n  So it seems that the 1984 legislation was designed not to work. We \ncorrect that in this legislation by making it possible for people to \nbring evidence of such substantial abuse to the bankruptcy judge, for \nit to be considered, and if the judge agrees, then that person cannot \ncontinue to abuse the public at large by making misuse of the \nbankruptcy courts to get out of paying debt.\n  I also remember the Senator saying that tightening bankruptcy law \nwill not reduce the costs of bankruptcy. All I can say is, the Clinton \nadministration's own Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers, said in one of \nour hearings that reducing bankruptcies could help reduce interest \nrates. And what helps lower-income people more in America than reducing \ninterest rates?\n  It really helps the very people the Senator from Minnesota speaks of \nas being vulnerable and as a class of citizens about whom we should all \nhave concern, and I believe all do have concern.\n  I have an example of a vulnerable person at the other end, a person \nwho has been substantially harmed by somebody who went into bankruptcy. \nIt isn't just people who go into debt who are vulnerable and can be \nhurt by bankruptcy; there are a lot of other hard-working people who \nare hurt by other people who go into bankruptcy. I hope this body will \nremember that every abusive bankruptcy hurts scores of Americans.\n  I will read, without using names, from a constituent in Keokuk, IA, \nwriting to me about the need for the passage of this legislation. She \nhad read a headline in the local paper that said: The Senate may \ntoughen bankruptcy laws.\n  ``My son''--I will not use the name--``works for a local electric \ncompany as a meter reader full time during the day and then goes right \nto work nearly every evening and on Saturdays with his own growing \nwashing, vacuuming business. He works so hard to do a good job for his \ncustomers. He takes his responsibilities as a father of five very \nseriously. During the last 3 to 4 months, he has been doing a job for \nan out-of-town gentleman.'' Then the last name is given. ``I believe he \nis in the Des Moines area. I have learned that he has several \nbusinesses and is known to be a crook.'' That is why I don't want to \nuse the names; I don't know whether\n\n[[Page S176]]\n\nhe is a crook or not, but that is the writer's judgment.\n  ``Of course--then she uses the name of her son--'' had no idea about \nthis person's background, but he eagerly wanted the work and took the \nwork. He felt especially good about it because one of his men is very \npoor, one of the workers he hires for his moonlighting business, and so \nhe turned the job over to him so he could make extra money.\n  ``The sorry ending of this story is, as you might have guessed, just \nlast week Kenny called the original hiring company where Kenny works \ndirectly doing cleanup jobs. And before he could talk to the manager \nabout not being paid by this gentleman from Des Moines, Mike told Kenny \nthat he had just called to inform him that he had declared bankruptcy. \nHe owed Kenny over $3,600. To him, this might as well have been $36,000 \nbecause of some new, very expensive equipment purchased to be able to \nhandle the additional work.\n  ``Something must be done to keep crooks from sticking hard-working \npeople like my son, who associate with him in good faith, from dropping \nthe hatchet--you know the numbers when it comes to poor management--and \nthen take the easy way out at everyone else's expense.'' Then in \ncapital letters: ``It is wrong and it should not be allowed.''\n  So there are hard-working mothers and fathers in America, I say to \nthe Senator from Minnesota, who are vulnerable and hurt by other people \nwho take advantage of them and go into bankruptcy.\n  On another point the Senator from Minnesota made, perhaps he isn't \naware that the organization of prosecutors who enforce child support \nsays this bill, S. 625, will help women and children who are owed child \nsupport. On this point, in fact, there is no point. Both parties have \nworked hard on this legislation in the compromises that have taken \nplace over the last 2 or 3 years. We are not going to let people use \nthe bankruptcy code to get out of paying child support. Yet we \nare still hearing, this very day, that old argument that may have had \nsome credibility 2 or 3 years ago but that we had taken care of almost \nthat long ago because it was a very important point raised. But those \npoints are still being made.\n\n  So I ask my colleagues, as they consider that point made by the \nSenator from Minnesota, to whom are you going to listen: The people who \nactually collect child support--that is, the organization of \nprosecutors who enforce child support who say this is a good bill and \nwill help women and children--or are you going to listen to Washington \nspecial interest think tanks that are using smoke and mirrors to say \nthis bill will make it more difficult to collect child support? I think \nthose who prosecute know the difficulty of collecting that. I hope my \ncolleagues will listen to the prosecutors who get child support who say \nthis bill will help women and children.\n  Finally, I wish the Senator from Minnesota had at least mentioned \ntitle II, subtitle A, which is entitled: Abusive Creditor Practices. We \nknow creditors can be abusive, and we address that problem to make sure \nthere is a level playing field between creditors and debtors when it \ncomes to the bankruptcy courts. We have numerous new consumer \nprotections. Understand, there are some customers who don't want to go \ninto bankruptcy, and they try to negotiate with their creditor to avoid \ngoing to court. That is a good step we want to preserve and encourage. \nBut if that customer then has to declare bankruptcy because of not \nbeing able to negotiate, then the creditor is severely limited in his \nability to collect that debt. To me, this is real consumer protection \nthat should not be forgotten as we vote on this legislation.\n  I will now turn to a specific amendment the Senator from Minnesota is \noffering as well and to oppose his amendment that is referred to as the \npayday loan. For those who don't know, this type of loan happens when a \nborrower gives a personal check to someone else and that person gives \nthe borrower cash in an amount less than the amount of the personal \ncheck. The check isn't cashed if the borrower redeems the check for its \nfull value within 2 weeks. The fact is that payday loans are completely \nlegal transactions in many States. If a financial transaction is \nexplicitly legal under State law, to me, it isn't wise that we use the \nbankruptcy code to try to undo that transaction.\n  First of all, using the bankruptcy code for this purpose leads to \nperverse results because the only people who will receive any benefit \nor relief will be those who file for bankruptcy. Then you have all \nthose other people who are using payday loans who never file for \nbankruptcy. These people who have taken out loans but don't take the \neasy way out in bankruptcy court will still have to pay back their \nloan. So if this is a problem, it seems to me the Senator from \nMinnesota ought to work to help everybody, not only those who go into \nbankruptcy court. Then you also have the perverse result of people who \ndon't have the money to file for bankruptcy who will have to pay the \nloan as agreed. Even if you share Senator Wellstone's distaste for \npayday loans, this amendment won't benefit the poorest of the poor \nbecause most of the poorest of the poor don't seek bankruptcy relief.\n\n  Earlier during the course of the debate, my colleague from Utah, \nSenator Hatch, sought to include language in an amendment that would \nhave changed the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. This act is in the \njurisdiction of the Banking Committee. At that very time, the ranking \nDemocrat on the Banking Committee, the Senator from Maryland, indicated \nthat he would not consent to allowing changes to the Fair Debt \nCollection Practices Act on a bankruptcy bill. So to be fair, then, the \nportion of Senator Wellstone's amendment changing the Fair Debt \nCollection Practices Act should be stricken out in deference to the \njurisdictional objections that have been lodged by the ranking Democrat \non the Banking Committee. So I am asking Senator Wellstone to listen to \nthe arguments of his fellow Democrat about jurisdiction and respect the \njurisdiction of the particular committees.\n  If the Senator from Minnesota doesn't want to honor this objection, I \nthink his proposed changes to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act \nrepresent poor policy at least. His amendment would not say that \nlenders can't offer payday loans. His amendment would say that you \naren't allowed to use State courts to collect the debt, even if the \ndebt is completely legal under that same State law. In fact, the State \nof Minnesota specifically allows payday loans, as does my home State of \nIowa. I don't think the Federal Government has any business telling \nState judges they can't enforce debts that are fully legal under the \nlaws of that particular State. I would have confidence in my State \nlegislature correcting this economic and social problem, if it is one \nin our State. I haven't studied it enough to know whether it is, but I \nhave confidence that my State legislators would correct that. I hope \nthe Senator from Minnesota has the same confidence that his State \nlegislators know what is best for Minnesota, not those of us in the \nCongress of the United States.\n  I also think this amendment would have the effect of making it harder \nfor the poor and those with bad credit histories to gain access to \ncash--the very people the Senator from Minnesota is so concerned about \nbecause, in his words, ``they are so vulnerable.'' People who use \npayday loans simply can't get loans through traditional sources because \nthey are too risky, so a payday loan may be the only way they can get \nquick cash to pay for family emergencies or essential home and auto \nrepairs.\n  I know the intentions of my good friend from Minnesota are honorable, \nbut the effect of this amendment would be to make it harder for poor \npeople to get help when they need that help the most. I hope this \namendment by the Senator from Minnesota will be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \namendments offered by the distinguished Senator from Minnesota. His \namendment is, in fact, two amendments--one to the bankruptcy laws and \none to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.\n  The debt collection amendment would prohibit anyone, such as a \ngrocery store or a hotel, who cashes\n\n[[Page S177]]\n\nchecks for a fee and defers depositing the check from notifying the \nwriter of a check which is later bounced that they will seek civil or \ncriminal penalties for that bounced check. It is important to keep in \nmind that under most State laws writing bad checks is a crime and many \nStates allow for civil and/or criminal penalties against those who \nwrite fraudulent checks.\n  The other part of this amendment would disallow in bankruptcy claims \narising from a deferred deposit loan--a so-called payday loan--if the \nannual percentage rate of the loan exceeds 100 percent.\n  Although well intentioned, this amendment is misplaced. So-called \npayday loans are made when a borrower writes a check for the loan \namount plus a fee. The lender typically gives the borrower the loan \namount and holds the check until a future date. In making payday loans, \nthese lenders provide a vital service to the poorest borrowers. Because \nsometimes it is more convenient to go to a hotel, grocery store, gas \nstation, or other similar businesses that may keep longer hours than \nbanks, many consumers choose to cash a check at these types of places \nwhen they need small amounts of money to overcome an emergency.\n  With this check cashing service, borrowers can get the emergency cash \nthey need without telling the boss they need a cash advance or giving \nup their televisions and furniture. This is a legitimate service that \nmany honest consumers use and in which established businesses engage.\n  If adopted, this amendment may operate to the detriment of the very \npeople it is intended to help. So I urge colleagues to vote against \nthat amendment.\n  The lifeline account amendment would disallow the bankruptcy claims \nof certain banks and credit unions. In particular, it would disallow \nclaims by larger institutions, such as banks with more than $200 \nmillion in aggregate assets that offer retail depository services to \nthe public, unless they offer the specific services required by this \namendment. First, these institutions would be required to offer both \nchecking and savings accounts with ``low fees'' or no fees at all. \nSecond, they would have to offer ``low'' or no minimum balance \nrequirements for checking and savings accounts--and to any consumer, \nregardless of income level. Further, the ``penalty'' for not providing \nthese particular services is the disallowance of the bank's claim in \nbankruptcy. That is a harsh penalty, indeed, and a windfall for \nbankrupts.\n  Let me explain what this means. It means someone with the resources \nof, let's say, Steve Forbes can walk into one of these banks, and if he \nis denied a ``low fee'' or no fee account, then any claim that bank has \nin any bankruptcy proceeding--not just Steve's bankruptcy--then the \nbank's claims are disallowed. I emphasize that any claim in any \nbankruptcy will be disallowed because the bank did not offer Steve \nForbes a ``low'' or no fee checking account. Let me substitute Bill \nGates' name for Steve Forbes here.\n  I should also note that this amendment does not describe what a ``low \nfee'' account is. Whose standard of low are we to base this dictated \nfee on? This is bad policy that would effectively dictate to banks the \nspecific services they must offer, whether or not consumers need or \nwant them. This is Government interference with free markets at its \nworse. Whenever such rules are forced on businesses, the offsetting \ncosts inevitably occur. In other words, consumers will end up paying \nfor mandated low fee or free checking in the form of higher prices for \nother services. Alternatively, other services by banks may be \ndiscontinued to offset the costs of these new requirements, not to \nmention the costs of the penalties. I don't believe this kind of \nregulatory interference with the markets is either warranted or wise. I \nurge colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nraising this important consumer issue. Seven weeks ago, I held a forum \non payday lending to help educate myself and the public on this \ntroubling consumer credit practice. At the forum, we heard from \nrepresentatives of the payday industry, consumer advocates, state \nregulators, and a credit union representative. We also were fortunate \nto hear from two Navy servicemen, one a payday borrower and one a \ncommander who provides financial counseling to his sailors. Their \nstories of military personnel caught in cycles of debt to payday \nlenders helped me realize the impact this issue can have on \nindividuals' lives. For example, Captain Robert W. Andersen, commanding \nofficer of Patrol Squadron 30 in Jacksonville, FL, testified that \nsailors who take payday loans are often victims of a ``snowball effect \nor financial death spiral they cannot recover from.''\n  For those who aren't familiar with payday lending, let me explain how \nit works. Someone who is short of cash can borrow money using his or \nher future paycheck as security. The borrower usually writes a check \nfor the loan amount plus a fee, and then the lender agrees not to cash \nthe check until after the borrower's next paycheck comes in.\n  Payday lenders commonly promote their product as quick and easy cash. \nBut what they don't usually advertise is that this is one of the most \nexpensive consumer credit products in existence. Interest rates on \npayday loans average about 500 percent annually, with some loans going \nwell over 1000 percent APR. Among the frequent borrowers who pay these \nhigh fees are those with particularly limited ability to repay the \nloan, including enlisted military personnel, college students, and \nsenior citizens on fixed incomes.\n  Despite the fact that payday loans are marketed as short-term credit, \nintended to help people get through one rough pay period, a \ndisturbingly high number of payday borrowers apparently soon discover \nthat they can't pay their loan off immediately, and so they end up \nrolling their loan over for another--and another, and another--term. \nAccording to a study by the Indiana Department of Financial \nInstitutions, 77 percent of all payday loan transactions are rollover \ntransactions, and the average annual number of renewals per borrower is \nover ten. As a result, consumers can end up paying amounts in interest \nand fees that dwarf their initial loans--and make it very difficult for \nthem to repay the principal. One borrower in Kentucky, for example, \nended up paying $1,000 in fees for a loan of only $150 over a period of \nsix months--and the borrower still owed the $150. It is cases like \nthese that has led the Consumer Federation of America to call payday \nlending ``legal loan sharking.'' As the American Association of Retired \nPersons (AARP) stated in written testimony provided for the forum:\n\n       It is not difficult to see how a borrower could become \n     mired in debt. A person so desperate for money that he or she \n     is willing to pay a three-digit APR is not likely to have the \n     cash--plus the fee--two weeks after taking out a loan. . . . \n     Taking out a loan at 391% APR, with the obligation to repay \n     the principal and interest charge in two weeks, is not going \n     to help consumers who do not have the cash to cover the \n     checks they write. (emphasis in original)\n\n  And that's not the worst of it: state efforts to control rollovers \nappear to be failing; lenders and customers find any number of ways to \nroll over a loan, even if rollovers are limited or prohibited. The \nIllinois Department of Financial Institutions has concluded that \nrollover rules have ``been ineffective in stopping people from \nconverting a short term loan into a long term headache.'' At the forum, \nMark Tarpey, Consumer Credit Division Supervisor with the Indiana \nDepartment of Financial Institutions, testified:\n\n       The problem with renewals is that you have an incentive for \n     the lender to continue to collect fees as long as the \n     customer pays them. There is no incentive to limit renewals/\n     rollovers. Even if you statutorily prohibit or limit \n     renewals/rollovers, you have the problem of a customer coming \n     in and paying cash and the lender then giving them the same \n     funds back and calling it a new loan. There are other \n     practices to conceal transactions from being deemed a \n     renewal/rollover.\n\n  The industry acknowledges that loan renewal is a problem, although \nthere is dispute over just how big a problem it is. Both of the trade \nassociations represented at the forum I held in December have adopted \n``best practices'' guidelines that attempt to address this issue, but \nbecause the borrower drives the decision to renew a loan, it would be \ndifficult for the industry guidelines to succeed.\n  Equally disturbing are the practices that some in the payday industry \nhave used to collect on delinquent loans--and I recognize and \nappreciate that the\n\n[[Page S178]]\n\namendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota addresses this problem. \nAt the forum in December, Leslie Pettijohn, the Consumer Credit \nCommissioner in Texas, testified:\n\n       From a regulator's perspective, one of the most \n     objectionable practices of these transactions is the threat \n     of criminal prosecution against the consumer. When a check \n     bounces, lenders frequently file charges against consumers \n     with law enforcement officials and attempt to collect this \n     debt by means of criminal prosecution. In a single precinct \n     in Dallas County, more than 13,000 of these charges were \n     filed by these kind of companies in one year.\n\n  As I mentioned, payday lending uses as security a live check that \nboth the borrower and the lender know is no good at the time it is \nwritten. Just as we don't imprison people for failure to pay their \ncredit card bills or meet their mortgage payments, I do not believe \nthat a borrower--unless he committed fraud--should be subject to threat \nof such severe measures for failure to make good on a payday loan, \nparticularly because the very premise of the loan was the borrower's \nwillingness to write a bad check. The amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Minnesota would prevent the misuse of these ``bad check'' laws, \nbut it would still permit a fraud prosecution where appropriate. That \nis an important step.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for raising this important \nissue, and I look forward to working with him to address it further in \nthe future.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next amendment \nhas 2 hours equally divided.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2658\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the nondischargeability of debts arising from \n            firearm-related debts, and for other purposes.)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2658.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan (Mr. Levin) for himself, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, and Mr. Schumer proposes an amendment numbered \n     2658.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 124, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. CHAPTER 11 NONDISCHARGEABILITY OF DEBTS ARISING FROM \n                   FIREARM-RELATED DEBTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1141(d) of title 11, United States \n     Code, as amended by section 708 of this Act, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(6) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the confirmation of a \n     plan does not discharge a debtor that is a corporation from \n     any debt that is--\n       ``(A) related to the use or transfer of a firearm (as \n     defined in section 921(3) of title 18 or section 5845(a) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986); and\n       ``(B) based in whole or in part on fraud, recklessness, \n     misrepresentation, nuisance, negligence, or product \n     liability.''.\n       (b) Automatic Stay.--Section 362(b) of title 11, United \n     States Code, as amended by section 901(d) of this Act, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (27), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (28), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; or''; and\n       (3) by inserting after paragraph (28) the following:\n       ``(29) under subsection (a) of this section, of--\n       ``(A) the commencement or continuation, and conclusion to \n     the entry of final judgment or order, of a judicial, \n     administrative, or other action or proceeding for debts that \n     are nondischargeable under section 1141(d)(6); or\n       ``(B) the perfection or enforcement of a judgment or order \n     referred to in subparagraph (A) against property of the \n     estate or property of the debtor.''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Our amendment would change the bankruptcy code so that a firearm \nmanufacturer or distributor who is found liable or may be found liable \nfor negligence or reckless action cannot escape accountability by \nfiling for reorganization in bankruptcy.\n  Our amendment has the endorsement of the National League of Cities, \nthe U.S. Conference of Mayors, Handgun Control, Inc., which is Sarah \nBrady's organization, and the Violence Policy Center. The amendment is \ncosponsored by Senators Durbin, Wyden, Kennedy, Feinstein, Lautenberg, \nand Schumer, and I thank them for their persistence and their hard work \non this important issue.\n  Under the current bankruptcy code, firearm manufacturers are able to \n``take advantage of the system.'' Those are not my words. Those are the \nwords of Lorcin Engineering Company, a manufacturer of cheap, \nsemiautomatic handguns. Lorcin told Firearms Business, an industry \npublication, that it was ``taking advantage of the system'' by filing \nfor chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1996. At the time, Lorcin was \none of the chief producers of Saturday night specials or junk guns. \nTheir semiautomatic pistol was number two on the Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms list of guns traced to crimes. Some of their cheaply \nconstructed guns were made so poorly they did not meet basic safety \nrequirements to be eligible even for importation.\n  Lorcin sought to evade responsibility for the damages caused by their \nnegligence by filing for chapter 11. Other manufacturers are following \ntheir lead, seeking to evade accountability for their wrongdoing by \nfiling in bankruptcy court. For instance, Davis Industries, another \nproducer of poorly constructed semiautomatic firearms, has also sought \nrefuge in bankruptcy court. The New York Times reported on June 24, \n1999, that a spokesman for Davis Industries said, ``I'm sure other \ncompanies will do the same thing.''\n  On July 19, 1999, at a creditors meeting for Davis Industries, the \nowner was asked a few questions by the bankruptcy trustee about his \nchapter 11 bankruptcy petition.\n\n       Question: Now, the reasons for filing sounded to me like \n     you're getting sued by all the municipalities in the United \n     States. Is that pretty close to correct?\n       Answer: I think you hit the button on the nose.\n\n  Lorcin Engineering and Davis Industries found a loophole in our \nFederal bankruptcy law and the list of these companies grew and is \nstill growing.\n  When the bankruptcy code was enacted, its primary goal was debtor \nrehabilitation, to provide a fresh start to ``honest but unfortunate \ndebtors'' through the discharge of debts. The code gives debtors the \nopportunity to shed indebtedness, but there are exceptions. These \nexceptions to the discharge of a debtor's liability were based on \npublic policy or wrongful conduct of the debtor. Currently, the \nbankruptcy code defines 18 specific categories of debt that are \nnondischargeable. These exceptions have been created because of an \noverriding public purpose.\n  A report issued by the National Bankruptcy Review Commission, an \nindependent commission established by Congress to investigate and study \nissues relating to the bankruptcy code, says this about \nnondischargeability:\n\n       Debts excepted from the discharge obtain distinctive \n     treatment for public policy reasons. Many nondischargeable \n     debts involve ``moral turpitude'' or intentional wrongdoing. \n     Other debts are excepted from discharge because of the \n     inherent nature of the obligation, without regard to any \n     culpability of the debtor. Regardless of the debtor's good \n     faith, for example, support obligations and many tax claims \n     remain nondischargeable. Society's interest in excepting \n     those debts from discharge outweighs the debtor's need for a \n     fresh economic start.\n\n  Among the debts that we exempt from discharge for public policy \nreasons are debts which arise from death or personal injury caused by \nthe debtor's operation of a motor vehicle while intoxicated, debts \nincurred by fraud or falsehood, debts incurred by willful and malicious \ninjury, family support obligations, taxes, educational loans, fines, \nand penalties payable to a governmental entity, et cetera. These \nexceptions reflect Congress' intent to carve out exceptions to \ndischargeability for important public interest policy considerations.\n\n  One category of debt that was added not too long ago to the code \nensures that debtors cannot escape debts incurred by a debtor's \noperation of a\n\n[[Page S179]]\n\nmotor vehicle while intoxicated. This change, which was first \nintroduced by Senators Danforth and Pell in the early 1980s, was \nconsidered part of an ``all-out attack on drunk driving.'' Congress was \npersuaded to amend the Federal bankruptcy code with respect to this \nimportant policy initiative. At the time, drunk driving accidents \nkilled tens of thousands of Americans and disabled hundreds of \nthousands of people annually. Senator Danforth argued that drunk \ndriving has caused insurmountable human suffering and economic loss, \nand in his words:\n\n       We must assure victims and their families that if they win \n     a civil damage award against the drunk driver, they need not \n     fear that the offender will use Federal law to escape his \n     debt.\n\n  We should do no less for victims of negligence and recklessness and \nwrongdoing of gun manufacturers and distributors.\n  Senator Danforth told us:\n\n       It is a national scandal that 50,000 Americans are smashed \n     and slashed to death on our highways and that 2 million \n     people suffer disabling injuries in car accidents every year.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The greatest tragedy is that we have become desensitized to \n     the meaning of these statistics. We have almost come to \n     accept this carnage as the unfortunate price we must pay for \n     the mobility we enjoy. However, if we look behind the mind-\n     numbing statistics--if we ask why so many people are \n     suffering--we will see over half of this bloodshed results \n     from our unwillingness to put a halt to the most frequently \n     committed violent crime in America: drunk driving.\n\n  The reduction of alcohol-related driving fatalities was an important \npublic policy issue, and by making those debts nondischargeable, \nCongress acted wisely to protect victims of drunk driving and to deter \ndrunk driving.\n  Congress acted against those endless tragedies and senseless deaths \nand human suffering by amending the bankruptcy code so a drunk driver \ncould not escape his debt by going bankrupt. Like debts incurred by \ndrunk driving, debts for death or personal injury and costs to \ncommunities resulting from the unsafe manufacture or distribution of \nunsafe firearms and their negligent distribution should also not be \ndismissed in bankruptcy. The public policy involved here is an \noverriding one, given the damage caused by the unsafe manufacture and \ndistribution of guns.\n  Senator Danforth's plea to curb drunk driving is very similar to our \npeople's plea to reduce gun violence. Week after week, Americans are \nlost to the senselessness of gun violence. Year after year, some 30,000 \nof us are lost to murder or suicide or unintentional shootings and tens \nof thousands of Americans are treated for firearm injuries. Many of \nthese deaths and injuries are to children. When the carnage results \nfrom the unsafe manufacture or distribution of a firearm, we should not \nallow the manufacturer or distributor to evade the responsibility for \nits wrongdoing by reorganizing in bankruptcy.\n  Cities around the country and their residents are taking on this \nproblem on their own. Thirty cities and counties have filed lawsuits \nalleging negligence, wrongdoing, unsafe practices on the part of gun \nmanufacturers or distributors. New Orleans started in October of 1998, \nfollowed by Chicago; Miami; Dade County; Bridgeport, CT; Atlanta, GA; \nCleveland, OH; Cincinnati, OH; Wayne County, MI; and Detroit, MI; St. \nLouis, MO; San Francisco, and others.\n  Citizens want the firearm industry to be accountable for unsafe \nactions on their part. They want firearm manufacturers to be held \nresponsible for poorly constructed and unsafe products. Citizens want \nfirearm manufacturers and distributors to be accountable for wrongful \ninjuries resulting in public outlays for medical care, emergency \nrescue, and police investigative costs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and yield myself an additional 3 \nminutes.\n  One way to deter such misconduct is to say that you cannot avoid that \naccountability by filing for reorganization in bankruptcy any more than \nyou can evade a judgment for damages resulting from drunk driving.\n  Sound public policy also dictates that the debt incurred by a \ncompany's action should not be ducked by a company reorganizing under \nchapter 11 while the company goes on its merry way and the victims are \nvictimized twice.\n  This amendment does not judge the merits of any lawsuit or the \nliability of any parties involved in these lawsuits. The amendment \nsimply gives our citizens the assurance that if they win a civil damage \naward against a firearm manufacturer or distributor, the damages caused \nby the perpetrator cannot be evaded by being dismissed in bankruptcy \ncourt.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters from the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, the Violence \nPolicy Center, and Handgun Control, which is chaired by Sarah Brady, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                The U.S. Conference of Mayors,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: On behalf of the United States \n     Conference of Mayors, I am writing to express our strong \n     support for your amendment, No. 2658, to the Bankruptcy \n     Reform Act of 1999 (S. 625).\n       For over 30 years, The U.S. Conference of Mayors has \n     supported comprehensive efforts to promote gun safety and \n     help keep guns away from kids and criminals. At our Annual \n     Conference of Mayor in New Orleans this past June, we adopted \n     a strong policy in support of broad gun safety legislation, \n     and on September 9, over 50 mayors, 30 police chiefs and \n     leaders from the interfaith community took our call for \n     action to Washington on ``Gun Safety Day.''\n       During our New Orleans Annual Meeting we adopted an equally \n     strong policy opposing any state or federal promotion of \n     local government access to the court system on behalf of \n     local citizens. To that end, gun manufacturers, distributors \n     and dealers should not be allowed to use federal statute to \n     evade legal claims for damages by filing for bankruptcy--\n     which would amount to a de factor preemption of local rights \n     to protect public safety and to recoup public revenues. The \n     threat of this action is real with Lorcin Engineering Co., \n     one of the chief manufacturers of ``Saturday Night Specials'' \n     or ``junk guns,'' having filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in \n     1996, and several other gun manufacturers recently following \n     the same course of action.\n       Currently, 18 categories of debt are nondischargeable under \n     the Bankruptcy Code. The Code makes certain debts \n     nondischargeable when there is an overriding public purpose. \n     We believe that there is no higher public purpose than \n     protecting public safety, and that your amendment will allow \n     these judicial proceedings to continue without the improper \n     use of federal law to preempt this important process.\n       Therefore, The U.S. Conference of Mayors strongly supports \n     adoption of amendment No. 2658.\n           Yours truly,\n\n                                           Wellington E. Webb,\n\n                                                        President,\n     Mayor of Denver.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    National League of Cities,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 1999.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: On behalf of our 135,000 municipal \n     elected officials, the National League of Cities strongly \n     supports your amendment, S. AMT. No. 2658, to the Bankruptcy \n     Reform Act of 1999 (S. 625). In prohibiting manufacturers, \n     distributors and dealers of firearms from discharging debts \n     which are firearm-related, incurred as a result of judgments \n     against them based on fraud, recklessness, misrepresentation, \n     nuisance, negligence, or product liability, this amendment \n     effectively stops an abuse of the bankruptcy system. More \n     importantly, the measure helps insure that municipal lawsuits \n     against the gun industry, are not undermined by firearms \n     companies seeking to potentially avoid their culpability \n     through the use of the bankruptcy code.\n       While NLC does not support some amendments to the \n     Bankruptcy Reform Act (particularly the Ross-Moynihan \n     Amendment, S. AMT. No. 2758) that would preempt state and \n     local government interest rates that apply to Chapter 11 \n     corporate repayments, we believe that this particular \n     amendment helps cities and towns recover monies expended for \n     numerous criminal investigations, litigation fees, health \n     costs, and other resources needed to address incidents of gun \n     violence. The National League of Cities has a long history of \n     supporting legislation to reduce gun violence and gun-related \n     criminal activity. Like debts incurred by drunk driving, \n     Congress must send a clear and convincing message that it \n     will not permit debtors to escape debts incurred by improper \n     conduct. It is crucial that the federal government do all \n     that it can to help local law enforcement effectively address \n     gun violence with common sense legislation that curtails \n     access to firearms including altering the bankruptcy code.\n       An unfortunate example of such abuse occurred in 1996 when \n     Lorcin Engineering Co.,\n\n[[Page S180]]\n\n     a manufacturer of cheap handguns, filed for Chapter 11 \n     bankruptcy protection. Lorcin was one of the nation's chief \n     manufacturers of ``Saturday Night Specials'' or ``junk \n     guns,'' and in 1998, their inexpensive semiautomatic pistol \n     was number two on the list of guns traced to crime scenes by \n     the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Lorcin's low \n     quality and unsafe firearms caused innumerable deaths in our \n     nation's cities and towns because of their cheap construction \n     and easy availability in urban areas.\n       Moreover, Lorcin's weapons were the basis of more than two \n     dozen product liability lawsuits. Once Lorcin decided they \n     could not defend their practices against the multiple \n     liability claims filed against them, they decided to protect \n     themselves by using the bankruptcy system to settle these \n     lawsuits for pennies on the dollar and be exempted from an \n     additional lawsuit filed by the city of New Orleans.\n       Senator Levin, we support this amendment, and strongly \n     advocate its inclusion in any final bankruptcy reform measure \n     enacted that does not undermine municipal finances. \n     Additionally, you will find an enclosed resolution passed by \n     the National League of Cities' Public Safety and Crime \n     Prevention Steering Committee that supports your proposed \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Clarence E. Anthony,\n                             President, Mayor, South Bay, Florida.\n       Enclosure.\n\n   Proposed Resolution--PSCP #9--Cities Lawsuits Against the Firearm \n                                Industry\n\n       Whereas, gun violence results in great costs to cities and \n     towns, including the costs of law enforcement, medical care, \n     lost productivity, and loss of life; and\n       Whereas, it is an essential and appropriate role of the \n     federal government, under the Constitution of the United \n     States, to remove burdens and barriers to interstate commerce \n     and protect local governments from the adverse effects of \n     interstate commerce in firearms; and\n       Whereas, firearm manufacturers, distributors, and \n     retailers, and importers have a special responsibility to \n     take into account the health and safety of the public in \n     marketing firearms; and\n       Whereas, to the extent possible, the costs of gun violence \n     should be borne by those liable for them, including negligent \n     firearm manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, and \n     importers; and\n       Whereas, the firearm industry has generally not included \n     numerous safety devices with their products, including \n     devices to prevent the unauthorized use of a firearm, \n     indicators that a firearm is loaded, and child safety locks, \n     and the absence of such safety devices has rendered these \n     products unreasonably dangerous; and\n       Whereas, the firearm industry has potentially engaged in \n     questionable distribution practices in which the industry \n     oversupplies certain legal markets with firearms with the \n     knowledge that the excess firearms will be potentially \n     distributed not nearby illegal markets; and\n       Whereas, it is fundamentally the right of local elected \n     officials to determine whether to bring suits against firearm \n     manufacturers on behalf of their constituents to best serve \n     the needs of their city or town; and\n       Whereas, across the nation, cities are bringing rightful \n     legal claims against the gun industry to seek changes in the \n     manner in which the industry conducts business in the \n     civilian market in their communities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That cities and towns be able to bring suits \n     against manufacturers, dealers, and importers to determine \n     their possible culpability for firearm violence; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the National League of Cities opposes any \n     federal preemption that would undermine the authority of \n     state and local officials to bring suits against firearm \n     manufacturers on behalf of their citizens; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the National League of Cities urges better \n     cooperation between firearm manufacturers and local elected \n     officials to prevent firearm violence and ensure less firearm \n     injuries and costs to cities and towns.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Violence Policy Center,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\n      Don't Let Gun Manufacturers ``Take Advantage of the System''\n\n\n support the levin amendment to the bankruptcy bill to hold gunmakers \n                     responsible for defective guns\n\n       The Levin amendment to S. 625 will ensure that gun \n     manufacturers cannot discharge debts incurred as a result of \n     consumer lawsuits for defectively designed and manufactured \n     firearms.\n       The Levin amendment is necessary to ensure that firearm \n     manufacturers--which are exempt from federal health and \n     safety regulation--remain accountable for civil liability to \n     consumers injured by negligent or reckless industry behavior. \n     Lack of health and safety regulation means that the civil \n     justice system is the only mechanism available to regulate \n     the conduct of gun manufacturers.\n       At least three major gun manufacturers have sought \n     bankruptcy protection specifically to protect themselves from \n     product liability claims.\n       Lorcin Engineering arrogantly stated in 1996 that it was \n     filing for bankruptcy to protect the company from at least 18 \n     pending liability suits. Lorcin officials stated to Firearms \n     Business--a gun industry trade publication--that the company \n     chose to ``take advantage of the system'' when it decided \n     that it could not defend against liability claims. \n     Furthermore, at a 1996 meeting of creditors, the U.S. \n     Bankruptcy Trustee posed the following question to Lorcin's \n     attorney, ``The triggering factor [of the bankruptcy] was the \n     Texas lawsuit, but there were three or four others that could \n     also be a problem?'' Lorcin's lawyer responded, ``Yep.''\n       In 1993, Lorcin was the number one pistol manufacturer in \n     America, churning out 341,243 guns. Many of Lorcin's handguns \n     are of such poor quality they are ineligible for importation \n     under the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) \n     ``sporting purpose'' test. Lorcin's .380 pistol regularly \n     tops the list of all guns traced to crime by ATF.\n       Davis Industries, also motivated by pending product \n     liability claims as well as lawsuits filed by U.S. cities \n     including Chicago, New Orleans, Miami, Atlanta, Cleveland, \n     Los Angeles, and Detroit filed for bankruptcy protection in \n     May 1999. Davis manufactured nearly 40,000 guns in 1997, the \n     last year for which figures are available.\n       Sundance Industries also sought bankruptcy protection in \n     August 1999. As a result, the Superior Court of California \n     enjoined the City of Los Angeles from pursuing Sundance in \n     the city's lawsuit to recover costs inflicted on the city as \n     a result of gun violence.\n       Many more gun manufacturers may soon choose to follow in \n     the footsteps of Lorcin, Davis, and Sundance to escape \n     responsibility for suits filed recently by U.S. cities.\n       More than 25 cities and counties have filed lawsuits \n     against the gun industry. These lawsuits allege that firearm \n     manufacturers have produced and sold defectively designed \n     firearms, and engaged in negligent marketing and distribution \n     practices resulting in countless deaths and injuries in \n     America's cities. The NAACP has filed a similar lawsuit. \n     Lawyers for the cities are very concerned that bankruptcy \n     will become a common gun industry defense tool.\n       Many other consumer lawsuits are pending against gun \n     manufacturers.\n       For example, Glock is the defendant in a case recently \n     certified as a nation-wide class action. The class includes \n     individuals and police officers injured by unintentional \n     discharges of Glock handguns. The suit alleges that Glock \n     handguns, including those used by many police departments, \n     contain design defects long known to the manufacturer.\n       Gun manufacturers must not be allowed to use bankruptcy to \n     escape accountability when their reckless or negligent \n     conduct causes death and injury. Vote to protect victims of \n     gun violence. Support the Levin amendment to S. 625.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Handgun Control,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 9, 1999.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I am writing in support of the \n     amendment to S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999 \n     sponsored by Senators Levin, Durbin, Wyden, Kennedy, \n     Feinstein, Lautenberg, and Schumer. This amendment would \n     prevent firearm manufacturers, distributors and dealers from \n     filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to evade wrongful \n     death and personal injury lawsuits caused by their dangerous \n     products.\n       As you know, several cities and their residents have filed \n     suits against the gun industry to recover some of the costs \n     of gun violence and to attempt to encourage more responsible \n     conduct by the industry in the future. These suits attack two \n     basic problems caused by irresponsible practices of the gun \n     industry. One is the failure to make guns as safe as possible \n     and failing to include many simple, live-saving safety \n     devices in their guns. The other is the irresponsible \n     distribution of guns which enables and fosters the criminal \n     use of guns.\n       Gun manufacturers, distributors, and dealers should not be \n     able to evade these legitimate claims for damages by filing \n     for bankruptcy. In 1996, Lorcin Engineering Company, one of \n     the chief manufacturers of ``Saturday Night Specials'' or \n     ``junk guns'' filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to protect \n     itself from multiple product liability lawsuits. Other gun \n     manufacturers, like Davis industries and Sundance Industries, \n     have followed Lorcin's lead and have filed for bankruptcy to \n     avoid liability. We must not allow other firearms companies \n     to take advantage of the bankruptcy system.\n       I urge you to support this important amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Sarah Brady,\n                                                            Chair.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. My friend from Illinois is not here, so I simply yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Michigan. This amendment makes \ndebts owed by a corporation on account of firearms non-dischargeable in \na chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy proceeding if the debt arose out \nof an action for fraud, misrepresentation, negligence, nuisance, or \nproduct liability. In addition, this amendment excepts such\n\n[[Page S181]]\n\ndebts from the automatic stay protection provided in a bankruptcy \nproceeding.\n  This amendment effectively singles out both gun manufacturers and \nthose who legally transfer guns, including major retailers who sells \nguns in compliance with all laws, and prevents them from successfully \nreorganizing under the bankruptcy laws, if they should need such \nreorganization. If a large product liability suit succeeds against a \ngun manufacturer, this amendment virtually ensures that the companies \naffected will be driven out of business and its workers will lose their \njobs.\n  In addition to being just bad policy, the amendment is also self-\ndefeating. Here is why: it effectively assures that only a fraction of \nthe judgment against the affected company will be paid, if at all. That \nis because those manufacturers that could pay off the judgment over \ntime will not be able to do so, and will be forced into liquidation. \nThis is neither good for the lawful business, nor for those other \ninvestors or creditors with legitimate claims against the company.\n  I also want to point out to my colleagues that as a matter of \nlongstanding bankruptcy policy in the United States, it has been \nuniversally recognized that if a company with manufacturing expertise \nsuffers an unexpected financial setback--whether from a huge products \nliability judgment or business reverses--everyone is better off if it \ncan at least try and restructure the business to preserve its \nlegitimate business lines. Workers can save their jobs and creditors \ncan be paid off over time from the operating revenues of the \nrestructured company, receiving much more than they would from \nliquidation. It is not as if this amendment, much to the dismay of its \nsupporters, will wipe out the second amendment's protection to bear \narms. What this amendment will do is ensure that the manufacture of \nlegal arms, and the corresponding jobs it creates, will move overseas.\n  Longstanding bankruptcy policy in this country has been that \nbankruptcy laws should apply to all lawful products and industries in a \nsimilar fashion; not pick and choose between unpopular, but legal, \nindustries. This amendment unfairly singles out one industry for \nunfavorable treatment, and does so in an unprecedented fashion. In my \nview, Congress should be loathe to single out companies that legally \nmanufacture or sell lawful products for unfavorable treatment, simply \nbecause they are unpopular. Which industry will be targeted next?\n  We should not be setting the precedent that lines of business that \nare unpopular with some in the Congress, but legal, will be denied the \nability to reorganize in bankruptcy. If we do this to firearms \nmanufacturers, what about companies involved in other industries, such \nas medical devices, drug manufacturing, or automobile makers? The basic \nsocial policy that it is better to keep the company operating and \npaying off the judgment than liquidating it should not be narrowed \ncompany by company, industry by industry.\n  Plain and simple, this amendment is designed to encourage lawsuits by \ntrial lawyers against gun manufacturers and retailers who sell guns. \nAnd I think this amendment is part of an effort to put the firearms \nindustry out of business.\n  Let me emphasize that I am very concerned about the gun violence our \ncountry has experienced in recent years. However, I am a firm believer \nin second amendment rights. The amendment encourages the new wave of \nlawsuits we have all been hearing about, in which gun manufacturers are \nbeing sued for the conduct of third-party criminals. Liberals have been \nunable to eliminate the second amendment or the gun industry through \ndirect legislation, so they are attempting to eliminate it through this \nkind of backdoor ``policy through litigation'' approach.\n  This amendment promotes an issue that has nothing to do with real \nbankruptcy reform and sets an undesirable precedent. Accordingly, I \nurge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  It is time for us in the Congress to grow up with regard to firearms \nmatters in our country. There is no use kidding ourselves. We have \npassed some 20,000 rules, regulations, and laws in this country against \nthe use of firearms that have limited our second amendment rights and \nprivileges. There are some legitimate arguments against this type of \nlegislation. I believe it is far preferable for us to uphold second \namendment rights and privileges and get tougher on criminals.\n  Our problem in this country, and especially over the last 7 years, is \nthat this administration has not been serious about getting tough on \ncriminals. Under Project Triggerlock, the number of gun prosecutions \nunder that approach, which was working very well under President Bush, \nhas now dropped by 50 percent. No wonder the President in his State of \nthe Union Address said: We are going to start doing something about gun \ncrimes.\n  They caught 12,000 people illegally taking guns to school in the last \nfew years, and there have been only 13 prosecutions. Last year, up to \nJanuary 1, they caught 100,000 people under the instant check system. \nThey call that Brady, as if that were a victory by the administration. \nBrady was first a 7-day waiting period which devolved into 5 days. In \norder to not prevent decent, law-abiding citizens from purchasing their \nguns, we instituted the instant check system, and it has worked \nmagnificently.\n  Of the 100,000 people they caught last year trying to illegally \npurchase weapons, I do not recall one single prosecution. I understand \nthat 200 have been recommended for prosecution, one-fifth of 1 percent. \nI could go on and on.\n  This administration has not been serious about gun crimes, and we \nhave not had a lot of help from people who are opposed to the second \namendment in helping to resolve these problems. The juvenile justice \nbill is caught up in a conference that is impossible to resolve unless \nwe get rid of this issue and do what has to be done in the interest of \njuvenile justice.\n  The fact of the matter is, there is always going to be somebody \ntrying to--and sincerely so--make political points on the issue of guns \nand weapons. This is not the bill on which they should be making those \npolitical points. This would be a very disastrous approach towards \nbankruptcy law. It means that anytime you find enough popular business \na majority of Members of Congress can stick it to, they are going to be \nable to do it under the bankruptcy laws. That is ridiculous. When we \nstart showing preferences for certain political points of view in \nbankruptcies to the exclusion of common sense, then it seems to me we \nare all going to suffer. Sooner or later, it is going to affect \nsomething that each one of us treasures or thinks is particularly \nimportant.\n\n  I speak in opposition to this amendment. This amendment would do an \ninjustice to the bankruptcy laws. In the process, I think we will not \naccomplish what my friends on the other side, who are sincere about \nit--at least I believe most of them are sincere about it--really want \nto do. It is better for us to battle out these issues in Congress. I, \nfor one, will be opposed to any diminution in our second amendment \nrights and privileges. If you want to diminish the second amendment, \nthen you ought to do it by constitutional amendment. You shouldn't be \ndoing it by bits and tatters. It ought to be done straight up, and it \nought to be done in a way that is constitutionally justifiable, and not \nin these bits and pieces that literally make political points but do \nnot belong in something as important as this bankruptcy bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am more than happy to rise in support of what I \nconsider to be a very important and valuable amendment in this debate \non the bankruptcy bill.\n  I am not one who is in favor of abolishing the second amendment, nor, \nI am sure, is the Senator from Michigan. What we are attempting to do \nin this bill is address a very serious problem. For those who believe \nthe second amendment is somehow an absolute right to bear arms, I will \njust tell them, there are no absolute rights under the Constitution of \nthe United States. Each and every right that is guaranteed to us as \nindividual citizens can be limited. Whether it is the right\n\n[[Page S182]]\n\nof free expression limited by the libel laws or even the right to life \nlimited by death penalties that are imposed in many States, all of \nthese things suggest that no right is absolute, and certainly the right \nto bear arms is not either.\n  We have had regulations throughout our modern history that have \nlimited the rights of those who care to bear arms in the interest of \nthe public good. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  Why are we debating guns on a bankruptcy bill? It gets down to the \nvery basics. The bankruptcy law is designed so a person who has reached \nan economic position in life where they can't see a good future can go \nto the court and ask for relief from their debts, whether that is an \nindividual or a family or a business. We say, for almost two centuries \nin this country, that bankruptcy is a right of individuals under our \nFederal court system. Again, we make exceptions and say that some \npeople who come to court will be limited in the types of debts they can \ndischarge.\n  We make a list, a pretty lengthy list, of some 17 or 18 exceptions. \nThey include such things as debts incurred by fraud that can't be \ndischarged in bankruptcy court, alimony and child support, student \nloans, debts from death or personal injury resulting from driving while \nintoxicated, court fees. There are several others. It suggests that \nwhen the Congress wrote the bankruptcy laws and continued to amend \nthem, we said there are certain things in a bankruptcy court from which \nyou cannot escape. If you have been guilty of certain conduct, if you \nhave not met certain obligations, the bankruptcy court will not be your \nshield or your shelter.\n  What the Senator from Michigan is doing with his amendment is saying \nthat the gun industry, the gun manufacturers, if they have engaged--and \nI will quote directly from the amendment--if they have engaged in \nfraud, recklessness, misrepresentation, nuisance, or product liability, \nthey cannot race to the bankruptcy court and escape their \nresponsibility to the American people. It is just that straightforward.\n  Those who are arguing that we should carve out some special exception \nfor these gun manufacturers are the same people who are loath to \nregulate these businesses in the first place.\n  Several firearm manufacturers have recently been sued in cases that \nhave been brought by cities and municipalities and counties and other \nlocal governments that have, frankly, been victimized by gun crimes. \nThese people, in their lawsuits, are alleging that the gun \nmanufacturers have been guilty of misconduct beyond selling the gun, \nthat they have been involved in marketing practices, for example, that \nend up putting guns in the hands of those who commit crimes. Those \nlawsuits are still pending, but the interesting response from the gun \nmanufacturers is: So what, sue us if you want to. Ultimately, if you \nwin your verdict, we will go to bankruptcy court, and we are going to \nescape any liability to the citizens of these cities and counties and \nStates which are bringing these lawsuits.\n  Two companies have already sought bankruptcy protection: Lorcin \nEngineering and Davis Industries. The Lorcin .380 pistol tops the list \nof all guns traced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for \nits involvement in crime. By virtue of the bankruptcy law, these \nmanufacturers are able to make millions of dollars flooding the market \nwith low-quality firearms of little appeal to legitimate sportsmen and \nhunters but of great appeal to criminals and gang bangers.\n\n  Once these companies are sued, because they are flooding the market \nwith these cheap Saturday night specials, they simply declare \nbankruptcy and walk away free from any financial responsibility for \ntheir misconduct. The owners of these companies remain free to start up \na new company under a new name making the same weapons, wreaking havoc \nacross America because they are flooding us with these guns.\n  Lorcin officials stated to Firearms Business, a magazine that is \npublished by the gun industry, that the company chose to ``take \nadvantage of the system'' when it decided it couldn't defend against \nliability claims. What Senator Levin is doing--and I am happy to join \nhim--is to say to Lorcin and other companies: Not so fast. If you are \ngoing to flood the markets of America with these cheap Saturday night \nspecials, if you are going to be liable for increasing crime and \nincreasing violence in America, you cannot use the Federal law as your \nshield or shelter when it comes to our bankruptcy court. I think \nSenator Levin is on the right track.\n  For those who would argue, as I have already heard on the floor, we \nalready have too many laws when it comes to guns, they are just not \nenforced, let me be quick to add that when it comes to standards for \nthe manufacture of firearms in this country, we virtually have no laws \nwhatsoever. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has the \nresponsibility of regulating virtually every product for household or \nrecreational use. In fact, the toy guns sold for Christmas and birthday \ngifts are subject to regulation by the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission. But the real guns, the Saturday night specials and the \nfirearms that could be the subject of these lawsuits, are not subject \nto any Federal safety regulations at all. The gun industry, by its \npower in Washington, has successfully lobbied to keep a law in place \nthat protects them from any regulation on the safety of their product.\n  So for those who are supporting the gun industry, they want it both \nways. They don't want the Government to impose any standard on the \nproduct that is sold, and they don't want the companies held liable if \nthat product turns out to be dangerous, if that firearm leads to crime \nand violence and death across America.\n  Senator Levin has said if these manufacturers come to court and they \nare found guilty of recklessness, fraud, misrepresentation, nuisance, \nor product liability, they cannot escape that liability because of the \nbankruptcy law.\n  How important is it to America? It is important because the costs of \ngun violence in both human lives and health care continue to escalate. \nAll those who argue that the laws Congress has contemplated in the past \nare somehow restricting gun ownership in this country cannot answer the \nmost basic question: If gun ownership is so restrictive in this \ncountry, how do we happen to have over 200 million firearms already in \na nation of 275 million people?\n  The fact is, these guns are readily available, and on the average \nalmost 90 people are killed, including 12 children, every day because \nof the proliferation of firearms and the fact that they get into the \nwrong hands. Gun manufacturers understand that they are finally going \nto be held accountable. These lawsuits are going to accomplish what \nlegislatures across the Nation and this Congress have failed to face; \nthat is, the fact that American families are fed up with this gun \nviolence. They expect Members of the Senate and the House to come \nforward with reasonable suggestions to make their neighborhoods safe \nand take guns out of the hands of those who would misuse them and out \nof the hands of children.\n  Senator Levin has a valuable amendment here. He is saying to these \ncompanies: You will be held responsible. Even if this Congress cannot \nmuster the courage to regulate the safety of a firearm that is sold in \nthe United States, we will not let these manufacturers escape their \nliability in a court of law. Cities around the country--Chicago, New \nYork, New Orleans, Atlanta, Bridgeport--have initiated suits against \nthe industry to try to force changes to make guns safer and less likely \nto end up in the hands of criminals. Certainly, automobile \nmanufacturers have faced a spate of lawsuits that really challenge them \nto use the most modern technology to make our cars safe.\n  Why are we not holding this industry to the same standard of \nresponsibility? And why, if they are found guilty of fraud or \nrecklessness in the products they sell, should they be able to get off \nthe hook in a bankruptcy court? That is the gist of the Levin \namendment--to hold these companies accountable. To say there are no \nprivileged classes--if you engage in this conduct, you will be held as \nresponsible as any other company or person for their wrongdoing.\n  The gun industry has long placed profits above the safety of America. \nI think it is interesting that an industry that can cause politicians \nto cower before them are scared to death to face a\n\n[[Page S183]]\n\njury in a courtroom in our country. I strongly support Senator Levin's \namendment. By adopting it, we will further the goal of reducing abuses \nof the bankruptcy system. Remember, that is why this debate is \nunderway. We are considering bankruptcy reform because many came to us \nand said that folks are abusing the bankruptcy system. Don't let the \ngun manufacturers abuse the bankruptcy system. Make certain that they \nare held accountable for the wrongdoing and the violence and death that \nresults from their recklessness and fraud and the negligent use of \ntheir products. We should be on record as opposing bankruptcy abuse, \nwhether it is the result of individual misconduct or the misconduct of \ngun manufacturers.\n  I yield the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would be happy to alternate back and \nforth. If nobody is seeking recognition on that side, I will yield 6 \nminutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Levin for taking the \ninitiative to close a gaping loophole that allows gun manufacturers, \ndistributors, and dealers to use the Bankruptcy Code to avoid judgments \nagainst them based on fraud, recklessness, negligence or product \nliability. Firearms manufacturers and dealers should not be able to use \nbankruptcy to escape liability.\n  Under current law, many types of debt are dischargeable under the \nBankruptcy Code. However, the Code makes certain debts \nnondischargeable, due to public policy concerns, such as debts incurred \nby the operation of a motor vehicle while legally intoxicated.\n  Recently, private citizens and local governments have sued the gun \nindustry to hold it accountable for deaths and injuries caused by \nfirearms. The current litigation can be an effective way of assessing \nresponsibility and providing remedies for obvious harm, in accord with \nthe long-standing traditions of the law.\n  Many of these lawsuits have been brought by federal and state \ngovernments against firearms manufacturers. Opponents of these lawsuits \nargue that the industry cannot afford them, and that the suits may well \nforce some firms into bankruptcy.\n  The entire focus of the current lawsuits is the wrongdoing of the \ndefendant corporations. The authority of the court to award damages \nagainst these defendants requires a judicial finding that the company \nengaged in misconduct in the manufacturing or marketing of its product. \nIn the absence of such a finding, there is no liability.\n  At long last, the American people are getting their day in court \nagainst the gun industry, and the gun manufacturers and the NRA fear \nthat justice will be done.\n  Everyday, 13 more children across the country die from gunshot \nwounds. Yet, the national response to this death toll continues to be \ngrossly inadequate. The gun industry has fought against reasonable gun \ncontrol legislation. It has failed to use technology to make guns \nsafer. It has attempted to insulate itself from its distributors and \ndealers, once the guns leave the factory door.\n  Studies estimating the total public cost of firearm-related injuries \nput the cost at over one million dollars for each shooting victim. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, cities, counties and \nstates incur billions of dollars in costs each year as a result of gun \nviolence--including the costs of medical care, law enforcement, and \nother public services.\n  Communities across the country are attempting to deal with the \nepidemic of gun violence that claims the lives of so many people each \nyear. Law enforcement officials, community leaders, parents and youth \nare struggling to deal with this continuing epidemic of gun violence. \nBut the gun industry, and Congress, and most state legislatures have \npersistently ignored these concerns.\n  Now, when the courts are likely to hold them accountable, some gun \nmanufacturers are attempting to avoid their responsibility by filing \nfor bankruptcy. One example is Lorcin Industries. During its heyday, \nLorcin was one of the largest manufacturers of ``affordable'' guns. Law \nenforcement and gun-control advocates call them ``Saturday night \nspecials''--the inexpensive, easily concealed handguns often used in \ncrimes.\n  Lorcin is one of several companies that sprang up after a 1968 law \nbanned imports of ``Saturday night specials'' but permitted domestic \nmanufacturing. Studies have found that these products are characterized \nby short ``time to crime''--the brief period between sale and the time \nwhen the guns are used in criminal acts.\n  Lorcin Engineering Co. has been named as a defendant in 27 lawsuits. \nThe suits charge that Lorcin and other firearm manufacturers do not \nprovide adequate safety devices, and that they negligently market their \nproducts, so that their weapons are too easily accessible to criminals \nand juveniles. Lorcin was also the subject of at least 35 wrongful-\ndeath or injury claims involving people killed or wounded when their \nLorcin pistols accidentally discharged. Lorcin settled at least two \ndozen of the 35 claims, ranging from a few thousand dollars to \n$495,000.\n  Lorcin sought refuge from these product liability lawsuits by filing \nfor Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 1996. In bankruptcy, Lorcin was \nable to settle its lawsuits for pennies on the dollar, when tens of \nmillions of dollars in damages were at stake. One of the major issues \nraised by creditors in the Lorcin bankruptcy case was whether the \ncompany was using the ability to reorganize its operations under the \nbankruptcy code as a way to avoid paying large sums to plaintiffs if it \nlost the suits.\n  Last January, Lorcin was released from a lawsuit filed by the City of \nNew Orleans. It petitioned the court to be removed from another lawsuit \nfiled by the City of Chicago, because the company was reorganizing \nitself under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code when the cities filed \ntheir lawsuits.\n  The litigation has prompted two other gun manufacturers to seek \nrefuge in bankruptcy. Sundance Industries of Valencia, California filed \nfor Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The owner said he has been worn down by the \nlegal assault on the gun industry. In addition, Davis Industries of \nMira Loma, California sought Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. \nBankruptcy Court on May 27, 1999.\n  According to a lawyer who represented creditors in the 1996 \nbankruptcy of Lorcin, ``Bankruptcy is a very useful negotiating tool \nand predictably the more suits that are filed, the more these gun \ncompanies are going to file for bankruptcy.''\n  A lawyer for one of the cities suing the gun-makers said that \nbankruptcy ``is going to be a huge pain,'' because it will require much \nmore time and expense for the cities, limit the amount of damages they \ncan collect, and, perhaps most important, put the litigation in federal \nbankruptcy court.\n  Litigation may well be the only means to hold gun manufacturers \naccountable for the harm caused by their products. As we have seen with \nlitigation against the tobacco industry, manufacturing secrets and \nmarketing secrets often come to light in a courtroom. Public interest \nlawsuits have changed the balance of power between the public and the \nmammoth industries long thought to be invincible. The Levin amendment \nsupports the citizens harmed by these powerful industries. It deserves \nto be supported by the Senate, and I urge the Senate to approve it.\n  Mr. President, in summation, I congratulate my friend, the Senator \nfrom Michigan, Mr. Levin, for the development of this particular \namendment, and I join with others to recommend it strongly to the \nSenate. I am hopeful that it will be successful.\n  The Levin amendment, as has been pointed out, takes the initiative to \nclose a gaping loophole that allows the gun manufacturers and \ndistributors and dealers to use the bankruptcy code to avoid judgments \nagainst them based on fraud, recklessness, and negligence, or product \nliability. Firearm manufacturers and dealers should not be able to \nabuse the bankruptcy laws to escape liability.\n  We can ask ourselves, is this a problem? The answer is yes. Do the \ngun manufacturers intend to utilize bankruptcy to basically avoid \nresponsibility to families across the country and because of the basis \nof negligence, recklessness, or fraud? The answer is yes to that, too, \nwhich undermines the importance of this particular amendment.\n\n[[Page S184]]\n\n  America has a gun problem and it is massive. The crisis is especially \nserious for children. Every day, 13 more children across the country \ndie from gunshot wounds. For every child killed with a gun, four are \nwounded. Yet the national response to this death toll continues to be \ngrossly inadequate.\n  The gun industry has fought against reasonable gun \ncontrol legislation. It has failed to use the technology to make guns \nsafer. All we have to do is remember the debates we had on the violence \nagainst youth legislation at the end of last year. We saw the efforts \nto try to provide common sense solutions to those who make these \nweapons available to individuals in our society who should not have \nthese weapons, and how that was frustrated in important ways by the gun \nmanufacturers. They were able to keep that piece of legislation that \nwas passed with regard to gun show loopholes tied up in conference. How \nmany weeks and how many months have passed when we have been unable to \naddress this issue either in conference or back on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate? Those efforts continue to go on even today.\n\n  Here we find in the bankruptcy legislation another attempt by the gun \nmanufacturers to exercise their muscle by giving them a special \nconsideration at a time when the problems they foist on the American \nfamilies are so significant.\n  The gun industry has attempted to insulate itself from its \ndistributors and dealers once the guns leave the factory door. Guns are \nthe only consumer product exempt from safety regulations.\n  Cities, counties, and States incur billions of dollars in costs each \nyear as a result of gun violence, including the costs of medical care, \nlaw enforcement, and other public services. Studies estimating the \ntotal public cost of firearm-related injuries put the cost at over $1 \nmillion for each shooting victim.\n  Communities across the country are attempting to deal with the \nepidemic of gun violence that claims the lives of so many people each \nyear. Law enforcement officials, community leaders, parents, and youth \nare struggling to deal with this continuing epidemic of gun violence. \nBut the gun industry, Congress, and most State legislatures have \npersistently ignored these concerns.\n  At long last, the American people are getting their day in court \nagainst the gun industry. Individuals, organizations, and \nmunicipalities are making progress in their effort to hold the industry \nliable for its failure to incorporate reasonable safety designs in the \nguns they sell, including features that would prevent gun use by \nchildren and other unauthorized users. Personalizing or childproofing \nguns would dramatically reduce the number of unintentional shootings, \nteenage suicides, and criminal offenses using stolen weapons.\n  One such lawsuit was filed in Massachusetts on behalf of the parents \nof Ross Mathieu, a 12-year-old boy who was killed in 1996 when a friend \nthe same age unintentionally shot him with a Beretta pistol, believing \nthat the gun was unloaded. In 1997, a suit was filed against Beretta in \nFederal court in Boston alleging that Beretta caused the death by \nfailing to include with the pistol either a magazine disconnect safety \ndevice, a chamber-loaded indicator, or a locking device that would have \n``personalized'' the gun.\n  Last summer, the city of Boston filed a suit against gun \nmanufacturers, distributors, and trade associations whose manufacturing \ndecisions, marketing schemes, and distribution patterns have injured \nthe city and its citizens. Boston is one of 30 cities and counties to \nhave filed groundbreaking lawsuits to reform the gun industry.\n  When the courts seem likely to hold the industry accountable, some \ngun manufacturers are attempting to avoid their responsibility by \nfiling for bankruptcy. We have heard the example that the Senator from \nIllinois pointed out, Lorcin Industries, one of the largest \nmanufacturers of the Saturday night specials. We heard how they have \nattempted to use the bankruptcy laws to their financial advantage and \nto the disadvantage of the families who have legitimate interests in \npursuing their rights in a court of law.\n\n  As a result, Lorcin was able to settle its lawsuit for pennies on the \ndollar when tens of millions of dollars in damages were at stake. One \nof the major issues raised by creditors in the bankruptcy case was \nwhether the company was using the ability to reorganize its operations \nunder the bankruptcy code as a way of avoiding paying large sums to \nplaintiffs if it lost the suits.\n  That has been replicated by Sundance Industries of Valencia, CA, who \nfiled for chapter 7 bankruptcy. The owner said he had been worn down by \nthe legal assault on the gun industry. In addition, last May, Davis \nIndustries of Mira Loma, CA, sought protection in the U.S. bankruptcy \ncourt.\n  According to a lawyer who represented creditors in the 1996 \nbankruptcy of Lorcin, ``Bankruptcy is a very useful negotiating tool, \nand predictably the more suits that are filed, the more these gun \ncompanies are going to file for bankruptcy.''\n  A lawyer for one of the cities suing the gun manufacturers said that \nbankruptcy ``is going to be a huge pain'' because it will require much \nmore time and expense for the cities.\n  Litigation may well be the only means to hold the gun manufacturers \naccountable for the harm caused by their products. Public interest \nlawsuits have changed the balance of power between the public and the \nmammoth industries long thought to be invincible.\n  At long last, the American people are getting their day in court \nagainst the gun industry. The gun manufacturers and the NRA should not \nbe allowed to hide behind the bankruptcy laws to prevent liability. The \nLevin amendment supports the citizens and cities harmed by this \npowerful industry. It deserves to be supported by the Senate, and I \nurge the Senate to approve it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I commend our colleague from Michigan for a \nvery important amendment which I think has one central point. Pass the \nLevin amendment and we will end the legal gymnastics that gun \nmanufacturers have used to dodge their responsibilities. Pass the Levin \namendment and the U.S. Senate sends a clear and simple message to these \ngun manufacturers that have played games with bankruptcy. Our message \nis the game is over. There is absolutely no reason to allow fraudulent \nactivity by gun manufacturers to go without sanction. I am very \ntroubled as I read through the history of what my colleagues have \ntalked about--the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from \nMassachusetts-- what it says about the nature of this debate. There are \ngun manufacturers who are actually bragging that they are taking \nadvantage of the system when they know they cannot win on the merits.\n\n  We have a situation where as we debate the bankruptcy law and talk \nabout making sure it is fair to all sides--good people may have fallen \non hard times--and at the same time sensitive to the needs of business \nand others who otherwise wouldn't be able to get the funds they need \nthat are so central in a marketplace kind of system, all of those \npeople, it seems to me, end up without the treatment they deserve. They \nare, in effect, put in an unfavorable light when, in fact, the gun \nmanufacturers are given a free ride.\n  Let us make sure that everybody is treated fairly--small businesses \nthat have these claims, and many people we are seeing who have fallen \non hard times and need a fresh start. But let us not send the worst \npossible message, which is that if you engage in the kind of \nreprehensible conduct my colleagues have documented, in effect, you \nwill get a free ride if you are a gun manufacturer.\n  It is important to vote for this bankruptcy legislation. I voted for \nit last year, as did 96 of my colleagues. It is important to ensure \nthat we have fairness for all parties.\n  Unless the Levin amendment is adopted, it seems to me that we allow a \ncontinuation of these legal gymnastics that are being practiced by gun \nmanufacturers. That is wrong.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Levin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I had a chance to listen very closely to \nwhat\n\n[[Page S185]]\n\nthe Senator from Michigan said. As the sponsor of the amendment, he \nought to have the attention of those of us who oppose his amendment.\n  I say that this amendment detracts some from the purpose of the \nlegislation. Maybe it is meant to. To the extent it is, I hope people \nwill vote against it. To the extent that people see this as a \nlegitimate part of what we are debating, then I would offer this point. \nI am going to offer more than one point very central to the amendment, \nand then I will stick to my remarks. But the fact is there is a way to \nhandle this problem to make sure that these companies don't get off \nscot-free.\n  I am going to refer to a product that Senator Heflin from Alabama--\nbefore he retired from the Senate--and I worked very closely on, which \nwas bankruptcy legislation. During the years he and I served together--\nI think 14 or 16 years--during that period of time when we were in the \nmajority on this side, I chaired the committee and he was the ranking \nminority member. When his party was in control, he was chairman and I \nwas the ranking minority member. I am going to refer to some \nlegislation we were able to get passed in 1994 when he was chairman of \nthe committee. I think it is a thoughtful and bipartisan way to deal \nwith this.\n  First of all, I believe this amendment proposed by the Senator from \nMichigan is unsound as a matter of policy. Congress has previously \ndealt with difficult questions of what to do about companies facing \nmassive tort liability and then filing for bankruptcy. We dealt with \nthis, as I indicated, in a bipartisan way, and I think in a way that \nhad a great deal of thought behind it.\n  In 1994, I worked with Chairman Heflin to create a very specific \nprocess for asbestos companies that were filing for bankruptcy as a \nresult of a massive number of lawsuits against asbestos manufacturers \nby those people who had asbestosis. Senator Heflin and I wanted to help \nthese companies continue as an ongoing business concern, but we also \nwanted to ensure that the victims of asbestos-related illnesses \nwouldn't be left out in the cold.\n  In the 1994 bankruptcy bill, we created a process where asbestos \ncompanies could be discharged of their tort liabilities but only if \nthey created a trust fund, under the control of a bankruptcy judge, to \npay victims. This process has worked well and has received favorable \ncomment by the National Bankruptcy Review Commission.\n  This amendment from Senator Levin, however, doesn't use a similar \napproach. This amendment merely provides that gunmakers and sellers \ncan't discharge their tort liabilities. As a result, the amendment has \nno concern for the employees of the makers or retailers of guns. Under \nthis amendment, retailers from giants such as Wal-Mart and Kmart all \nthe way down to the small family-owned stores could face massive \nliabilities and be forced to lay off workers.\n  In the case of the Heflin-Grassley legislation of 1994, as I \nindicated, we allowed the companies to continue to operate and to \ncontinue to have their employment, and in the process victims were not \nharmed in any way because of the trust fund. It seems to me, unless \nthere is some ulterior motive other than helping victims with this \nlegislation, that we should think about that approach--an approach that \nprotects victims, an approach that makes the person who is guilty of \nwrongdoing have tort apply to pay that tort. Consequently, if that is \nnot the approach, I think it reveals the real purpose of the amendment. \nI question that the amendment might be about making sure that tort \nplaintiffs receive compensation if any of the questionable antigun \nlawsuits were to succeed because that is not what is going to happen. \nThis amendment is merely an effort to drive all segments of American \nindustry involved with guns out of business, even if thousands of \ninnocent, hard-working American employees have to pay the price.\n  Consequently, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  One other thing about the amendment is the presumption is so stated \nby the Senator from Michigan that this is just one addition--I think he \nwould say that this is the 19th addition --to a long list of exceptions \nthat are nondischargeable through the bankruptcy court.\n  I think he is mistaken about how bankruptcy works for corporations \nand chapter 11 because his amendment applies just to corporations.\n  Section 1141 of chapter 11 has two separate discharge provisions. It \nhas one section for corporations and it has one for individuals. The \ndischarge provision for corporate debtors discharges all debts. The \ndischarge provision for individuals lists nondischargeable debts.\n\n  So the idea this exception to discharge is just one more of a long \nlist of 18 is flatout wrong.\n  From this standpoint, then, the amendment by the Senator from \nMichigan is unprecedented, and I will be glad to share the code \nsections with my colleagues, if they desire. But subsection (a) \ndischarges a debtor from any debt that arose and that applies to the \ncorporations. But subsection (2) says the confirmation of a plan does \nnot discharge an individual debtor. From that standpoint, this is not \none of a long list of things that are nondischargeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah yield time to \nthe Senator from Idaho?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield time to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah, and let me \nalso thank the Senator from Iowa for bringing what I think is necessary \nto bring to this debate as it applies to the Levin amendment, and that \nis common sense. Is, in fact, this amendment the kind of legislation we \nwant to see? If you support the bedrock policy of bankruptcy law, I do \nnot know how you can support the Levin amendment because it undermines \nbasically all of those policies.\n  The bankruptcy code establishes a structure that ensures everyone who \nis owed money by the debtor will be treated fairly when the debtor is \ngiven, in essence, a fresh start under the law. The main purpose of the \nbankruptcy reform measures we are working on is to get more debtors to \npay back more of the debts they owe to more of their creditors. That is \na rather simple principle before this Senate. This issue has been with \nus. The Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Utah and others have \nstruggled with it mightily for the last good number of years, to bring \nfairness and equity in it, but also to say to debtors there is a \ncredibility here and a responsibility you owe to your creditors. There \nneeds to be a greater sense of fairness and balance brought. I think \nthe fundamental underlying bill offers that.\n  The Levin amendment is a carve-out, and I think it flies in the face \nof those general policies. The supporters of the Levin amendment say \nthey are trying to prevent firearm manufacturers from escaping \naccountability for bad acts that result in a civil judgment against \nthem. That is rather straightforward.\n  It is not only manufacturers; it is retailers and it is corporations. \nSo it is a broad brush. While they would like, I am sure, to create the \nimage that there is a manufacturer out there who produces a firearm and \nsomehow it is evil, are Wal-Mart and Kmart and hardware stores that \nsell legitimately as federally licensed firearms dealers evil? In the \neyes of some, they probably are. That is not the debate, nor is that \nthe issue. Let's look at what the amendment does. It is unfair because \nit picks out a specific industry and it restricts the bankruptcy relief \navailable to that industry.\n  In other words, if we in the Senate have now decided we are going to \npick winners and losers who are politically correct or politically \nincorrect based on your particular philosophy or point of view, that is \nwhat the Levin amendment, the Levin carve-out does. Is this Senate \ngoing to start picking winners and losers amongst businesses in our \ncountry? We never have. We created certain conditions or certain things \nthat are special within the law but never politically have we said: You \nare a winner, you are safe under the law; you are a loser, you lose. \nThat is not what we do. We let the marketplace generally do that, and \nwe let consumers generally do that.\n  Today it is the firearm manufacturers and tomorrow is it an industry \nthat produces alcohol; or a fatty product, and we have decided in our \nsociety that\n\n[[Page S186]]\n\nfat consumption is no longer good for the American consumer, even \nthough as free citizens they ought to have a right to choose.\n  ``That sounds silly, Senator Craig. You ought not be saying things \nlike that.''\n  When I watched the trial lawyers organize and convince the attorneys \ngeneral that going after the tobacco companies was good because the \ntobacco companies had fallen out of favor and it was a politically \ncorrect thing to do, I said, ``And next will be firearms.'' There were \nsome who chuckled. Of course, guess what. Next were the firearm \nmanufacturers. That is what is going on out there today. Municipalities \nthat do not enforce the law but, most important, municipalities that \narrest people who illegally use firearms do not have a Justice \nDepartment that backs them up.\n\n  The Clinton administration ran from enforcement for 7 years. Of \ncourse, just this year they got a new religion out there because they \nhave seen the polls and they have seen what the American people have \nsaid: Enforce the laws, Mr. President.\n  I wonder how my friends across the aisle would react if I proposed a \nsimilar amendment making bankruptcy relief unavailable to former \nPresidents of the United States? ``That would be foolish, Larry. You \nshould not do something such as that.''\n  That spells the intent of this amendment. I think the Senator from \nIowa was a little kinder than I am, suggesting maybe there was an \nulterior motive and it was probably more political than it was legally \nsubstantive. I think he is right.\n  It is also unfair because it would have the effect of putting the \ninterests of some creditors ahead of others. The lawsuits we are \ntalking about are not claims for real injuries resulting from \nsomebody's bad acts. Instead, they are treasure hunts. We saw the \nhundreds of millions of dollars the trial attorneys made, and now \nStates are getting, from the settlements from the tobacco industry. The \ntreasure hunt resulted; the treasures were found. They are looking for \nmultimillion-dollar verdicts or settlements to go to the trial lawyers \nand municipal governments they represent.\n  If there are legitimate creditors out there in a bankruptcy \nsettlement, they are no longer protected because we have taken those \ncompanies out and they simply fall away. The effect of the Levin \namendment would be that lawyers and government bureaucrats get paid \nfirst. Remember that: Lawyers and government bureaucrats get paid \nfirst. If there is anything left in this kind of bankruptcy of these \nmultimillion-dollar verdicts, then and only then will a creditor get a \ndime.\n  The Levin amendment would also hurt the very people it claims to help \nbecause it would make it unlikely that more than a fraction of the \njudgments, if that much, would ever get paid off. This is because it \nwould prevent more companies from taking a reorganization bankruptcy. \nInstead, it would simply, in all reality, force them into liquidation, \nwhere the creditors get nothing. Is that the intent of the Levin \namendment? My guess is, if it is not the intent, it clearly is the \nresult.\n  What is the practical effect of all of this? It means instead of a \ncompany continuing to exist, a company being allowed to stay in \nbusiness, to reorganize, to keep its employees intact, they close their \ndoors, they lay off their employees, and their creditors go wanting. \nNot only are the creditors not going to be there to get the benefit of \nit, the jobs are lost.\n  It means there will be no business-generating income to continue to \npay the debts it created. Whatever you can squeeze out of a business \ntoday is all you are going to get. That is the result of this \namendment. Maybe that is the intent of the amendment. If it is, why \ndon't we be honest with ourselves? This amendment is not substantively \ncharged, it is politically charged. I think all of us understand that. \nMy guess is that is how the vote breaks out on an issue such as this. \nIn short, the amendment turns bankruptcy policy on its head.\n  It is designed to destroy legitimate and law-abiding businesses. It \ninjures consumers, and it destroys jobs. The Levin amendment is clear \nand simply bad policy for this country, and I hope the Senate will \nchoose to defeat it. We should not mix that kind of politics with this \nkind of constructive policy change that these Senators have worked to \nbring to the floor. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from \nMichigan for yielding time and for his leadership on this outstanding \namendment.\n  Before I speak to the substance of the amendment, whenever we talk \nabout gun issues, it seems some who are opposed say that is making it \npolitical. I do not quite get that. People on this side have as firmly \nheld beliefs as the people on the other side. Most Americans seem to \nsupport what we are for, and if that is political, so be it. That is \ndemocracy.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask the Senator, since he is just starting his remarks, \nif he will yield to the distinguished Senator from Alaska who has a \nvery short statement.\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, I am here because I am deeply saddened to \nreport to the Senate a very serious loss, as far as the country is \nconcerned and a real sad loss for myself personally. I was saddened \nlast night when my wife and I received a call about the loss of Alaska \nAirlines Flight 261 on a flight from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San \nFrancisco.\n  Eighty-eight people were on board that plane, many of them apparently \nemployees or relatives or friends of employees of that airline. While \nthe search continues, we have been told now that no survivors have been \nfound. My thoughts and prayers and I hope all of our thoughts and \nprayers are with the families of these people who have perished.\n  Among those on the plane were at least five Alaskans. We think there \nwere more. One was one of my very close and dear friends, Morris \nThompson--we called him Morrie--his wife Thelma and their daughter \nCheryl.\n  Morrie Thompson has been a respected leader of the Native community \nof our State and a businessman. Just last fall, he retired as the chief \nexecutive officer of Doyon Limited, which is one of 12 regional \ncorporations for our Alaska Native people. Because of Senate business, \nI was unable to attend that retirement dinner in Fairbanks, but my \ngranddaughter Sara went as my representative.\n  Morrie had a tremendous background. He was not only a great leader \nfor the Native people of Alaska, but he was a leader in his own right \nnationally. He was a member of the University of Alaska's Board of \nRegents. He served as president of the Alaska Federation of Natives. \nDuring the Nixon administration, he was the Commissioner of the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs for our Nation in Washington, DC, and a special \nassistant to the Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs in the \nDepartment of the Interior. He was president of the Fairbanks Chamber \nof Commerce and in 1997 was named Business Leader of the Year by the \nUniversity of Alaska.\n\n  He is going to be remembered for his work on the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act, landmark legislation in 1971, which was a tremendous \neconomic boost for our Native people. His greatest legacy will be among \nthe young people of our State who have benefited from Morris Thompson's \nfellowship program and the Doyon Foundation, which he created to \nsubsidize tuition for Native students in Alaska.\n  My heart goes out to the Thompsons' surviving daughters, Nicole and \nAllison, and to all the members of their family. Morrie has not just \nbeen a political friend or a business friend. We have joined one \nanother in each other's homes for dinner and raised our children \ntogether in a way.\n\n[[Page S187]]\n\n  There are many families, I am sure, mourning over this terrible \ntragedy. Also on that plane was the son of a former State legislator, \nMargaret Branson. Her son Malcolm and his fiancee Janice Stokes, both \nof Ketchikan, were returning from a vacation in Mexico.\n  I have this report for the Senate. I have been in touch with Jim Hall \nof the National Transportation Safety Board and the Secretary of \nTransportation, Secretary Slater. It is my intention to go to \nCalifornia on Thursday to meet with NTSB officials in Oxnard and the \nCoast Guard officials in Port Hueneme, CA, concerning the crash.\n  I say to the Senate that Alaska Airlines has an exemplary safety \nrecord. In my State, their pilots and planes fly in the most \nchallenging terrain and weather of our whole Nation, if not the world. \nThis is a great tragedy for that small airline and for our State.\n  My thoughts are with those people who are involved in trying to make \ncertain the airline continues and their personal families of that \nairline who are affected by this tragedy are cared for as well as the \nrelatives of people who have lost their lives.\n  I thank my colleagues very much for their courtesy in allowing me to \nmake this report to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nNew York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for his \nremarks and say to him that--and I am sure I speak for all the people \nof my State--we share the grief of the families who have lost loved \nones and all those who have been affected by this terrible tragedy. To \nhear of an outstanding citizen and his wife and daughter losing their \nlives on that flight reminds us all that there but for the grace of God \ngo each of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/01/senate-section/article/S187-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S187-S188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1999--Continued\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before I get into the substance of my \nremarks, every time some of us on this floor bring up gun issues--not \nto eliminate them, but to make sure those who should not have them do \nnot get them--we hear from those who are opposed to us that we are \nbeing political.\n  I do not understand that remark other than it being a defensive \nremark. First, I believe my views as strongly, say, as the Senator from \nIdaho believes his. I do not think I am being any more or any less \npolitical than he is by defending that viewpoint. That is what the \nSenate is all about.\n  Second, if one wants to argue about politics, a vast majority of \nAmericans support the position I support. That is what democracy is all \nabout, and politics is a good thing if you are representing people's \nviews and trying to do good for your country, your State, and your \ncommunities. So I do not quite get the political nature of the comment.\n  Third, we are not saying that all gun manufacturers are subject to \nsuit or subject to successful suit. I heard the Senator from Idaho \nmention Wal-Mart. This is not a suit aimed at Wal-Mart. This is a suit \naimed at dealers, often a handful of dealers, who are reckless, or \nworse, in the way they distribute guns.\n  About 6 months ago, my office issued a report which showed that 1 \npercent of the dealers issued close to 50 percent of the guns traceable \nin crimes. These were not the 1 percent who had the greatest \nvolume. These were obviously the 1 percent who, for some reason, were \nnot living up to their responsibilities under the Brady law, which is \nthe law of the land. That kind of fact is what brought these suits \nabout.\n\n  The suit, for instance, brought forward by the City of Chicago claims \nthat some manufacturers and some dealers are completely reckless in how \nthey distribute guns. If each dealer were careful, if each dealer and \nmanufacturer did what the law says, the number of people killed with \nguns by criminals and the number of children who get guns would \ndecline. These lawsuits are a very legitimate part of American life.\n  I wish we didn't need lawsuits, but since this Senate has stymied \nevery single measure to bring rationality to our laws about guns, not \nto take people's guns away, as some of the opponents argue in terms of \nsetting up a straw man, but to say that the same responsibilities that \nsomeone who drives a car or practices free speech has, because none of \nthose rights is absolute, should be visited upon gun manufacturers, gun \ndealers and, yes, gun owners. If this Chamber had moved forward in \naccordance with the will of the American people, we wouldn't have these \nlawsuits. But that is not the case. One can speculate as to why.\n  We have a Senate totally deadlocked, a Congress unable to even pass \nsomething as minute as closing the gun show loophole. So we have these \nsuits. They are legitimate lawsuits. They are tried by a jury in \naccordance with American law.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Michigan to yield me 3 \nadditional minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield my friend from New York 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have approached the time for the recess.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair for his courtesy.\n  It is not the major gun dealers who are seeking the shield of \nbankruptcy; it is the companies, sometimes small, often nasty, that \nhave sought this. Look at the so-called ring of fire, gun manufacturers \naround the city of Los Angeles that manufacture cheap handguns, who \nknow darn well that those handguns are often ending up in the hands of \nyoung people who shouldn't have them. They are the people against whom \nthe Senator from Michigan so wisely is seeking to allow the court \nprocess to continue. It would be the height of special interest folly \nif we allowed dealers to escape the punishment meted out by a civil \ncourt through a bankruptcy loophole that was never intended to allow \npeople to evade justice.\n  This amendment is about justice, pure and simple. It doesn't \npreordain what the courts will decide, but it clearly states that if \nthe court should decide a gun manufacturer or a gun dealer was \nreckless, was negligent, then they can be held accountable. If we don't \npass it, it is another in a long line of sops to the gun lobby in which \nthis Chamber has unfortunately participated over the last several \nyears. I hope this body has the courage to stand tall and pass an \namendment that we all know is right.\n  I thank the Chair for his courtesy.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to \nSenator Levin's amendment, which would deny bankruptcy protection to \ngun companies, and to explain the reasons for my position. I intend to \nvote against Senator Levin's amendment despite the fact that I have \nconsistently supported gun control legislation.\n  I know my colleague's intentions are good, but this amendment is not \nthe right way to address the serious problem of gun violence in our \nnation. It would establish a dangerous new precedent in our Bankruptcy \nCode, and it would unfairly discriminate against an entire category of \ncompanies, regardless of whether a given company is behaving \nresponsibly. In Connecticut, for example, Colt's Manufacturing, which \nhas been at the forefront of developing new technologies to make guns \nsafer, teeters at the edge of bankruptcy because it has been caught up \nin the tide of lawsuits against gun companies. Would it be fair to deny \nColt the normal protections afforded to any company trying to \nreorganize? My colleague from Michigan refers to the irresponsible \npractices of a few gun companies, but his amendment could cripple \nreputable companies such as Colt's.\n  Senator Levin seeks to amend the Bankruptcy Code so that firearm \nmanufacturers filing for reorganization would not be entitled to the \nordinary protections from product liability lawsuits. He argues that a \nloophole in the bankruptcy system allows gun companies to stay lawsuits \nand discharge their debts. In fact, the stay of lawsuits and discharge \nof debts to which Senator Levin refers is no loophole, but is essential \nto the proper operation of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On more \nthan one occasion, otherwise healthy companies have been hit with huge \nnumbers of product liability cases simultaneously, and had to file for \nprotection under Chapter 11. One recent example is Dow Corning, which \nfiled for reorganization in response to the thousands of lawsuits over \nsilicone breast implants, and which is now paying out claims in an \norderly and expeditious process. If the lawsuits are not stayed by the \nbankruptcy court, then\n\n[[Page S188]]\n\nresolved in one tribunal, the company would be more likely to fail \nbefore all claimants can litigate their cases. Chapter 11 does not \nallow a company to evade lawsuits, but rather to pay out claims \nproportionately and fairly to all claimants, hopefully in a way that \nkeeps the company afloat.\n  This rationale for Chapter 11 bankruptcy applies to the gun industry \nas well. I understand why my colleague criticizes the practices of \ncompanies such as Lorcin, which churn out the ``Saturday Night \nSpecials'' favored by criminals. But his amendment to the Bankruptcy \nCode is not narrowly drafted to target those companies. Many \nmunicipalities and gun control groups have adopted a strategy of filing \nmultiple, simultaneous product liability lawsuits, in which all gun \ncompanies are named as defendants irrespective of their particular \npractices. The lawsuits have not succeeded on the merits thus far, but \nthe costs of litigation are threatening the financial viability of many \nof the smaller companies.\n  Colt's Manufacturing, which is among the most progressive firearms \nmanufacturers in the country, has been drawn into the same lawsuits. \nSeventy percent of Colt's sales are to law enforcement and defense \nagencies, and the company does not produce ``Saturday Night Specials.'' \nAlthough Colt's has limited assets, it has been working to develop \n``smart gun'' technology and other innovations that will reduce handgun \nviolence. Nevertheless, Colt's has been named as a defendant in all 29 \nlawsuits filed so far. Despite the fact that Colt's has won four \ndecisions and lost no final judgments, insurance companies are pulling \ntheir coverage and investors have been reluctant to provide new \ncapital. In one year, the company has gone from 1200 to 400 employees. \nColt's reports that it is in financial jeopardy as a result of the \nlawsuits, and may soon have to file for reorganization under Chapter \n11, as it did several years ago. The amendment we are considering today \nwould be devastating to Colt's. Rather then being given a chance to \nreorganize, the company would slowly be bled dry. Along with lost jobs \nin my state, the nation would lose a responsible company with a history \nof great craftsmanship which has been looking for solutions to the \nepidemic of handgun violence.\n  No industry has ever been singled out in the Bankruptcy Code for this \nsort of discriminatory treatment. The case has not been made for why \nChapter 11 should not apply equally to all sectors of the economy. \nThere are many possible legislative approaches for addressing the \nappalling rates of gun violence in the United States, but this is not \none of them. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

LOUIS RAMS\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to make a \ncomment on an event which is very important to the State of Missouri, \nvery important to the city of St. Louis, very important to this \nSenator.\n  It happens that over the weekend, the St. Louis Rams encountered a \nvery energetic and talented team, the Tennessee Titans, in Atlanta to \nsettle the issue of who would be the Super Bowl NFL champions this \nyear. In a very hard fought game that represented the highest of effort \nby both teams, the Rams prevailed. There are those who from time to \ntime ask me if I was nervous at any time. I think they were hoping I \nwould say I was never nervous. Well, I got pretty nervous toward the \nend of the game. But I was very pleased with the result because there \nis no team more worthy of having won this game than the St. Louis Rams.\n  I will just say a few things about the St. Louis Rams, about that \nmarvelous effort of a crew we call the ``go to work,'' ``gotta go to \nwork'' crew in St. Louis. Different football teams are understood and \nknown for different things. The St. Louis Rams have a slogan: Gotta go \nto work. I don't think there is a better slogan anywhere for a sports \nteam than a sports team that elevates the idea of work. It is work that \nbrings us to any goal, to the achievements we enjoy. It is work that \ngives us successful families. It is work that allows America to compete \nsuccessfully around the world. It is that work ethic, expressed by the \nSt. Louis Rams, that made them world champions.\n  For me to have the opportunity to stand today and say a few words \nabout the St. Louis Rams, the fact that they had the work ethic \nnecessary to prevail in the Super Bowl over an excellent team from \nTennessee, is something for which we are all grateful.\n  I will talk a little bit about the kind of statistical year the Rams \nhad. We had Kurt Warner, who is one of the great Horatio Alger stories \nof America. People talk about rags to riches. I don't know if he has \ngotten to riches yet. He was at the minimum wage in the National \nFootball League before they decided to give him a bonus this year, and \nI don't know that he was in rags, but 5 years ago he was bagging \ngroceries in Iowa because he hadn't quite gotten the opportunity to \ndemonstrate his skills in football. Maybe this would be called from \nbags to riches.\n  The truth is, it is a heroic story of an individual who has not only \ngreat football skills but whose inspirational life is the kind of \nleadership we need more of in this country. When asked about his own \ninspiration, he said he gets inspiration from his family and the \nhandicapped member of the family who every day, when falling down, gets \nback up. For the most valuable player in the Super Bowl, the most \nvaluable player in the National Football League, to understand that we \ncan all learn from each other and we can learn from even those in their \nheroic efforts who have not the talents that we do but have the courage \nto get back up, that is a tremendous thing.\n  It is with that in mind that I will talk a bit about the St. Louis \nRams today, the Ram team, including Kurt Warner, and then Marshall \nFaulk, who set the all-time record for combined yardage this year. I \nthrill to the fact that there are youngsters in my State and across \nAmerica who are saying: I want to be like Marshall Faulk; I want to be \nlike Kurt Warner and this team of individuals who are such outstanding \nindividuals; Isaac Bruce, who has been so productive as a football \nplayer and such an exemplary leader in our community.\n  There are statistics about this team. They won the West divisional \ntitle with a 13 and 3 record. They posted an undefeated record at home. \nThat is something special to me because that was in the TWA Dome. When \nI was Governor of the State of Missouri, it was my responsibility to be \ninvolved in the construction of that dome and to see to it that it came \nin under budget and on time and was a great facility. But no facility \never achieves greatness unless there are great things done there--to \nhave the team come and be undefeated there this year and, of course, \nhave other great things there. The Pope visited St. Louis and was at \nthe TWA Dome, and Billy Graham came to St. Louis this year and was at \nthe TWA Dome. There are some people who think it is important to invite \nthe Pope and Billy Graham back next year so we can go undefeated \nanother time. We would be pleased to have them come back because they \nbring the kind of presence to St. Louis that all of us cherish and \nwant.\n\n  To watch our quarterback, Kurt Warner, who enjoyed one of the best \nseasons ever by an NFL quarterback, becoming only the second player in \nhistory to throw more than 40 touchdown passes and to realize that he \nwasn't discovered as a starting quarterback until this year's \ncircumstances thrust him into the position, it was an amazing thing: \ncompleting 66 percent of his passes; 10 300-yard games in the season; \nsetting a new Super Bowl record for 414 yards in passing. The offense \nof the Rams team: 526 points, the third highest single-season record \never.\n  Of course, Kurt Warner was named the NFL player of the year. He took \nhis $30,000 award and gave it to Camp Barnabus, which is a camp for \nyoung people in southern Missouri. This\n\n[[Page S189]]\n\nwasn't a $30,000 donation by someone who is making the big salaries; \nthis was a $30,000 donation by someone who is earning the minimum wage \nin the NFL. I could go on. The resolution that I will propound not only \ntalks about Kurt Warner but extols the greatness of Marshall Faulk. \nThese individuals are as great, or greater, off the field than they are \non the field. That is what is so inspiring--their commitment to \ncommunity.\n\n  Isaac Bruce caught 77 passes for 1,165 yards and 12 touchdowns in the \nregular season and led the Rams to a Super Bowl victory with 6 \nreceptions for 162 yards, including a game-winning 73-yard touchdown \nreception that, frankly, required him to make a very big effort to come \nback and get the ball and go get the score. What a tremendous \ninspiration it was.\n  On defense, Todd Lyght led the Rams with a regular season career high \nof six interceptions, including a touchdown. He started in 97 straight \ngames. Now, there is durability. Talk about having to go to work. That \nis the longest current streak with the team.\n  Rams' linebacker Mike Jones ended the very spectacular and heroic \neffort of the Tennessee Titans on the 2-yard line with the game-winning \ntackle as the time ran out in the Super Bowl.\n  I could also talk about wide receiver Terry Holt and about Coach Dick \nVermeil, named NFL coach of the year, the oldest coach ever to win a \nSuper Bowl. He, of course, retired from coaching, but he came back \nbecause he still had a burning capacity within him to motivate and help \nyoung people, and the football team reached the maximum of its \npotential.\n  It is with that in mind I wanted to propound a resolution to \ncongratulate not only the team, the St. Louis Rams, but, frankly, the \nfans of St. Louis. No group of fans that I know of is more intelligent, \nunderstanding of the game, and more supportive of a team than the fans \nin St. Louis. The fans came together with the team over and over again. \nThey stuck with the team in previous years when we were the worst in \nthe league and helped carry the team when we were first in the league. \nThat is very important.\n  I was at a tremendous celebration in St. Louis, and the individual \nwho announces the team onto the field in each game, who is also a disc \njockey at KSD FM, Smash, Asher Benrubi, was leading this rally. It \nbecame very apparent to me that the biggest contribution of the St. \nLouis Rams is the contribution of community, because the community has \ncome together around this team in a special way that unites us all. \nUnity is the most important characteristic of any organization. When \nyou can be unified and work together, that is something to behold.\n  It struck me at the time that the last five letters of the word \n``community'' are the word ``unity.'' Those things, those challenges in \nour lives, and those opportunities in our lives, those victories and, \nyes, even defeats bring us together and are valuable to us. It is with \nthat in mind I thank Smash for his great leadership as the MC of that \nrally. I thank the fans of St. Louis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/01/senate-section/article/S189-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S189-S190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE ST.

The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the Wellstone amendment No. 2537 to S. 625. Under the previous \nagreement, there will be 5 minutes equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder whether I could ask unanimous \nconsent that the vote be first on the payday amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleagues. I thank Senator Grassley from \nIowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2538\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will yield for a moment, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. 2538 by \nSenator Wellstone.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, I was on the floor earlier talking \nabout this whole problem of payday amendments, payday loans, and car \ntitle pawns. To make a long story short, it is a very unscrupulous \npractice. You have targets of low-income, you have targets of women, \nyou have targets of seniors who basically get a loan because of \nsomething that happened in the family--medical emergency, you name it, \nfor $100, $200. It is rolled over and over again. They can end up being \ncharged 300, 400, or 500 percent a year--or a lien can be put on their \ncar. The car can be repossessed and sold. There isn't a requirement in \nmany States that these families at least get back what they no longer \nowe to these creditors. I don't know why, when it comes to bankruptcy, \nthose lenders who in good faith have provided loan money to people \nshould be crowded out.\n  This amendment simply says if you are charging over 100 percent in \nannual interest on a loan and the borrower goes bankrupt, you cannot \nmake a claim on that loan or the fees from that loan.\n  This is all about whether we are on the side of a lot of vulnerable \ncitizens--on the side of single parents, families, women, on the side \nof moderate-income citizens--or on the side of these loan sharks.\n  This amendment, I believe, should get a huge vote. Every consumer \norganization is for this amendment, and many other organizations \nrepresenting women and labor and low- and moderate-income people are \nfor this amendment. I certainly hope the Senate will vote for this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota is asking the \nSenate to put these provisions in law in the bankruptcy code for loans \nthat are legal under State law.\n  He would have this done in two ways: No. 1, he would say that the \nState judges could not enforce these debt collections; and, No. 2, he \nwould say that in bankruptcy it could not be recovered in bankruptcy.\n  First of all, these are legal contractual relations. They are legal \nunder State law. So it ought to be questioned whether or not the Senate \nof the United States or the legislatures of Minnesota and Iowa ought to \nbe making these determinations. It is my judgment that we should not \nuse the bankruptcy code to upset the legal bankruptcy laws of the \nrespective States.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote this amendment down.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to point out to my colleagues \nthat a lot of these unscrupulous credit companies get around State \nregulations and protections through Federal law. A lot of them are \nchartered by Federal law.\n  So it is certainly appropriate to take this action if we want to \nprotect consumers and not be on the side of these loan sharks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded. The vote will now occur \non the tabling motion.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n2538.

FINDINGS; PURPOSE; SENSE OF SENATE.\n\n       (a) Congressional Findings.--\n\n[[Page S191]]\n\n       (1) On August 30, 1999, in accordance with the May 5, 1999, \n     agreement between Indonesia and Portugal brokered by the \n     United Nations, and subsequent agreements between the United \n     Nations and the governments of Indonesia and Portugal, a \n     popular consultation took place, in which 78.5 percent of \n     East Timorese rejected integration with Indonesia, setting \n     the stage for a transition to independence pursuant to the \n     terms of the May 5, 1999, agreement.\n       (2) On October 19, 1999, the Indonesian People's \n     Consultative Assembly agreed to ratify the August 30, 1999, \n     vote results, leading the United Nations Security Council, on \n     October 25, 1999, to authorize a United Nations Transitional \n     Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), which was to include \n     deployment of an international police and military force with \n     up to 1,640 officers and 8,950 troops.\n       (3) The United Nations Commission on Human Rights, in a \n     special session meeting on September 27, 1999, called on the \n     United Nations Secretary General to establish an \n     international commission of inquiry to investigate violations \n     of human rights in East Timor, and urged the cooperation of \n     the Indonesian government and military.\n       (4) The Secretary General subsequently directed Mary \n     Robinson, the United Nations High Commissioner on Human \n     Rights, to appoint a United Nations commission on October 15, \n     1999, which is due to report its conclusion to the Secretary \n     General by December 31, 1999.\n       (5) The Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly on \n     October 20, 1999, chose Abdurrahman Wahid as President of the \n     Republic of Indonesia and the next day also chose as Vice \n     President, Megawati Soekarnoputri\n       (6) President Wahid has invited Xanana Gusmao to meet and \n     has written to the United Nations Secretary General \n     officially informing him of the decision to end Indonesia's \n     administration of East Timor, and of East Timor's \n     independence, and expressing his hope ``that East Timor will \n     become an independent state''.\n       (7) As of late October 1999, according to United Nations \n     officials and other independent observers, more than 200,000 \n     East Timorese remain displaced in camps in West Timor and \n     elsewhere in Indonesia, under constant threat by civilian \n     militia and in some cases denied access to assistance by the \n     United Nations humanitarian agencies.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States should congratulate the people of \n     Indonesia on its democratic transition and welcome the \n     efforts of the new Indonesian government to bring a peaceful \n     end to the crisis in East and West Timor;\n       (2) the results of the August 30, 1999, vote on East \n     Timor's political status, which expressed the will of a \n     majority of the Timorese people, should be fully implemented;\n       (3) economic recovery in Indonesia is essential to \n     political and economic stability in the region; and\n       (4) the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of \n     the Treasury, and Congress should work with the people of \n     Indonesia to restore Indonesia's economic vitality.\n       (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to encourage the \n     government of Indonesia and the armed forces of Indonesia to \n     take such additional steps as are necessary to create a \n     peaceful environment in which the United Nations Assistance \n     Mission to East Timor (UNAMET), the International Force for \n     East Timor (INTERFET), and the United Nations Transitional \n     Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) can fulfill their \n     mandates and implement the results of the August 30, 1999, \n     vote on East Timor's political status.\n\n     SEC. __03. SUSPENSION OF SECURITY ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Suspension and Support.--\n       (1) Assistance.--None of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available under the following provisions of \n     law (including unexpended balances of prior year \n     appropriations) may be available for Indonesia:\n       (A) The Foreign Military Financing Program under section 23 \n     of the Arms Export Control Act.\n       (B) Chapter 2 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (relating to military assistance).\n       (C) Chapter 5 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (relating to international military education and \n     training assistance).\n       (D) Section 2011 of title 10, United States Code.\n       (2) Licensing.--None of the funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available under any provision of law (including \n     unexpended balances of prior year appropriations) may be \n     available for licensing exports of defense articles or \n     defense services to Indonesia under section 38 of the Arms \n     Export Control Act.\n       (3) Exportation.--No defense article or defense service may \n     be exported or delivered to Indonesia or East Timor by any \n     United States person (as defined in section 16 of the Export \n     Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2415)) or any \n     other person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States \n     except as may be necessary to support the operations of an \n     international peacekeeping force in East Timor or in \n     connection with the provision of humanitarian assistance.\n       (4) Prohibition on participation in asia-pacific center for \n     security studies.--Programs of the Asia-Pacific Center for \n     Security Studies may not include participants who are members \n     of the armed forces of Indonesia or any representatives of \n     the armed forces of Indonesia.\n       (5) Prohibition on assistance through military-to-military \n     contacts.--The authority for military-to-military contacts \n     and comparable activities under section 168 of title 10, \n     United States Code, may not be exercised in a manner that \n     provides any assistance to the government or armed forces of \n     Indonesia.\n       (b) Inapplicability to Certain Items and Services on the \n     United States Munitions List.--Paragraphs (2) and (3) of \n     subsection (a) do not apply to the export, delivery, or \n     servicing of any item or service that, while on the Commerce \n     Control List of dual-use items in the Export Administration \n     Regulations, was licensed by the Department of Commerce for \n     export to Indonesia but is in a category of items or services \n     that, within two years before the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, was transferred by law to the United States \n     Munitions List for control under section 38 of the Arms \n     Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778).\n       (c) Conditions for Termination.--Subject to subsection (b), \n     the measures described in subsection (a) shall apply with \n     respect to the government and armed forces of Indonesia until \n     the President determines and certifies to the appropriate \n     congressional committees that the Indonesian government and \n     the Indonesian armed forces are--\n       (1) taking effective measures to bring to justice members \n     of the Indonesian armed forces and militia groups against \n     whom there is credible evidence of human rights violations;\n       (2) demonstrating a commitment to accountability by \n     cooperating with investigations and prosecutions of members \n     of the Indonesian armed forces and militia groups responsible \n     for human rights violations in Indonesia and East Timor;\n       (3) taking effective measures to bring to justice members \n     of the Indonesian armed forces against whom there is credible \n     evidence of aiding or abetting militia groups;\n       (4) allowing displaced persons and refugees to return home \n     to East Timor, including providing safe passage for refugees \n     returning from West Timor;\n       (5) not impeding the activities of the International Force \n     in East Timor (INTERFET) or its successor, the United Nations \n     Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET);\n       (6) ensuring freedom of movement in West Timor, including \n     by humanitarian organizations; and\n       (7) demonstrating a commitment to preventing incursions \n     into East Timor by members of militia groups in West Timor.\n\n     SEC. __04. MULTILATERAL EFFORTS.\n\n       The President should continue to coordinate with other \n     countries, particularly member states of the Asia-Pacific \n     Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum, to develop a \n     comprehensive, multilateral strategy to further the purposes \n     of this Act, including urging other countries to take \n     measures similar to those described in this title.\n\n     SEC. __05.

APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DEFINED.\n\n       In this title, the term ``appropriate congressional \n     committees'' means the Committee on Foreign Relations and the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee \n     on International Relations and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as I understand it, I have 30 minutes \nunder my control for purposes of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair. I intend to withdraw this amendment \nafter I and other Senators interested in the amendment have had a \nchance to talk within the 30-minute period.\n  As I said late last year, this amendment is considerably different \nfrom my original bill, S. 1568, the East Timor Self-Determination Act. \nI made significant alterations to it in order to respond to changing \nevents and the concerns of other Senators and the administration.\n  My amendment would have suspended all military and security \nassistance to Indonesia until clear steps had been taken to stop the \nharassment of East Timorese refugees, to end the collusion between \nviolent militia groups and the Indonesian military, and to hold those \nresponsible for recent atrocities accountable for their actions.\n  My amendment would have put this body on the record in recognition of \nthe need to use United States military and security assistance \nresponsibly in Indonesia.\n\n[[Page S192]]\n\n  My original bill, which passed the Foreign Relations Committee on \nSeptember 27 by an overwhelming vote of 17-1, was introduced in the \nwake of the violence that erupted after the results of East Timor's \nhistoric referendum were announced on September 4. It was cosponsored \nby the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the distinguished \nSenator from North Carolina, as well as many other Members of the \nSenate.\n  I took that action, in cooperation with my colleagues, because events \nin East and West Timor demanded it.\n  While I am very pleased to have the opportunity to finally call up my \nlegislation on the Senate floor, it is unfortunate that this is being \nsqueezed in to a debate on the bankruptcy bill rather than standing \nalone. It is unfortunate that we are here debating this amendment more \nthan 4 months after the events in East Timor that gave rise to it. It \nis unfortunate and it is inappropriate, because the events in East \nTimor that originally cried out for this legislation are deadly \nserious. And the encouraging events that justified changes in the \nlegislation are critically important. Both deserved thoughtful \nconsideration from the Senate.\n  On August 30, well over 99 percent of registered voters in East Timor \ncourageously came to the polls to express their will regarding the \npolitical status of that territory.\n  More than 78 percent of those voters marked their ballot in favor of \nindependence.\n  But weeks of violence dampened the jubilation that immediately \nfollowed the vote, as the Indonesian military--a military that the \nUnited States has long supported--colluded with militia groups in \nwaging a scorched earth campaign throughout the territory.\n  Thousands of people were forced to leave, and many were killed.\n  But for the East Timorese run out of their homes in the fray, the \nnightmare did not end there.\n  Just days ago, the Independent newspapers of London reported on the \nhorrible conditions in the remaining refugee camps in West Timor. In \none part of West Timor, UNICEF has found that 25 percent of refugee \nchildren are malnourished.\n  To this day, militia members harass and intimidate East Timorese in \nWest Timor's refugee camps. According to the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees, between 100,000 and 150,000 refugees remain, \nin many cases against their will, in the refugee camps.\n  But some will say that we should remain silent on these matters, and \ncontinue to let events in Timor and Indonesia unfold without comment. \nSome will say that the time for action has passed. They will point to \nthe recent democratic elections in Indonesia, and to the Indonesian \ngovernment's stated willingness to accept the results of the August 30 \nballot. They will note the many encouraging steps that President Wahid \nhas taken in the direction of reform. And they will point to President \nWahid's most recent, public commitment to holding military officers \naccountable for their actions--actions now described in both Indonesian \nand U.N. investigations.\n  They are right to emphasize the positive signals coming from the new \ngovernment, and they are right to point out that the situation in \nIndonesia has changed significantly in the past four months. I \nrecognize those changes, and I have tried to respond to them as my \nlegislation has wended its way through this body.\n  Make no mistake--the Indonesians were aware of the original \nlegislation. And over the last few months they have undoubtedly taken \nnote of the changes that were made in this amendment--changes that sent \na clear signal that the United States recognizes that the government of \nIndonesia is moving toward democracy and accountability, and we are \nvery interested in partnership with that kind of Indonesia.\n  While I support the notion that now is an important time to reach out \ntoward the new government in Jakarta, I reject the idea that we should \nno longer maintain intense pressure on the Indonesian military.\n  Whether or not the Indonesian military is committed to serving under \nthe new, promising, democratically-elected regime remains to be seen. \nRecently, rumors of coup plots and a possible military takeover of this \nfledgling democracy circulated in Jakarta and abroad. In recent months, \nethnic and religious violence erupted in Aceh, the Spice Islands, and \nelsewhere in Indonesia. Many reports indicate that elements of the \nIndonesian military continue to stand by and do nothing to help the \npeople they are supposed to protect.\n  So as we extend a welcome to Indonesia's new government, we must send \na strong message about the kind of behavior that we do not welcome, and \nabout the kinds of abuses that we will not ignore. It remains as \ncrucially important today as it ever was to pressure violent elements \nin Indonesia to do the right thing. And I serve notice to my colleagues \nand to the administration--I stand ready to do just that. If U.S. \npolicy fails to send a strong message in favor of reform and \naccountability, I will seize any legislative opportunity necessary to \nfight for a responsible policy--one that serves United States and \nIndonesian interests in stability and justice.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator has used 6 minutes \nand 40 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield such time as he wishes to the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island, who has truly been a great leader on this \nissue, making not only an effort on the Senate floor but a personal \neffort to visit and see exactly what is happening in East Timor itself. \nI yield the Senator from Rhode Island such time as he needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first, let me commend the Senator from \nWisconsin for his efforts. He has spoken out forcefully and clearly and \ncorrectly for so many months about our obligation to see that the \npeople of East Timor have a chance to chart their own course, to reach \ntheir own destiny, to rule themselves. I thank him for his efforts.\n  Today this amendment is being withdrawn, but this withdrawal should \nnot be a signal that we are turning away from East Timor. Indeed, it is \nonce again an opportunity to speak out and demand that we do, in fact, \nattend to the needs of this emerging country.\n  As the Senator from Wisconsin pointed out, I traveled to East Timor \ntwice last year. The first time was a week before the referendum. I \ntraveled with Senator Harkin and our colleague from the other body, \nCongressman Jim McGovern of Massachusetts. We were there a few days \nbefore the election. What struck us was the incredible courage of the \npeople of East Timor. It was an ominous and foreboding atmosphere. \nArmed militias were roaming the countryside threatening people and \nmaking it clear that their goal was to intimidate all of the East \nTimorese either not to vote or to vote for continued association with \nJakarta, with Indonesia. Despite this, we saw countless East Timorese \nwho were willing to risk their lives, declaring to us that they would \nvote, they would risk their lives.\n  I had occasion in Suai to be speaking at a church where there were \nthousands of displaced persons gathered around this church in the \nprotection of three priests. I told them that the vote is more powerful \nthan the army. Not only did they believe that, but they risked their \nlives to prove it. Sadly, with the conclusion of the referendum, the \nmilitias went wild, conducting a rampage throughout East Timor. In \nfact, the three priests in Suai who were leading their congregations \nwere slaughtered by the militias because they chose to talk about \ndemocracy and independence and self-determination.\n  I returned back to East Timor in the first week of December. Since \nthe election had taken place, the United Nations had authorized the \nintervention of international forces, and we owe a great deal to the \narmed forces and the Government and the people of Australia because \nthey launched thousands of Australian soldiers to enter that country, \nto stabilize that country, and literally to give a chance to the people \nof East Timor to build a democratic society.\n  The United States also contributed roughly 200 troops. The troops \nwere led by our U.S. Marine Corps. The bulk of the troops were U.S. \nArmy forces. These troops, once again, displayed magnificently the \nability of American\n\n[[Page S193]]\n\nforces to respond to a crisis and to bring to bear not only our \ntechnology, but our values, as they supported that struggling \ndemocracy, struggling to emerge in East Timor. Now, the Indonesian \nGovernment has formally renounced the claims of East Timor. It is being \nadministered in the interim by the United Nations.\n  We had the chance in our last visit at the end of November, beginning \nof December, to meet with the leadership of the United Nations. They \nare led by a very accomplished diplomat, Sergio DeMello. But I have to \nsay that their efforts to date are quite feeble when it comes to the \ndifficult challenges they face. So I think the whole international \ncommunity has to step up and assist this effort of reconstruction \nbecause one thing was painfully obvious to us as we traveled through \nEast Timor--the country was deliberately, cynically destroyed. Every \nbuilding that was worth habitation was burned. Ironically and \ninterestingly--because I think the Indonesian military was calling all \nthe shots--they didn't touch the churches because they knew that would \nprobably make CNN. But a few feet away from every church, rows and rows \nof buildings were destroyed. We met the people of East Timor, people \nwho are struggling for the basic subsistence now after all the mayhem \nand destruction. Once again, I commend the military forces--\nparticularly ours--that are there today helping out.\n\n  We have a great deal to do to ensure that our words about \nindependence, our words about the value of democracy, and our words \nabout self-determination are transferred into palpable progress for the \npeople of East Timor. We have an opportunity, I say an obligation, to \ngive them resources to get the job done. I believe we should start with \nan appropriation of $25 million for humanitarian assistance so they can \nreconstruct their schools and infrastructure. Literally, the militias \nand Indonesian Army destroyed all records--postal records, all \nidentification records, all land records. This country has been totally \ndevastated, deliberately and cynically destroyed. We have an obligation \nto help them rebuild. They are a people who want to rebuild, who want \nto make progress and go forward.\n  I also had the chance while I was in East Timor to travel to West \nTimor, which is still part of Indonesia. I went to these camps where \nthere are thousands of East Timorese, many of whom were taken against \ntheir will from their homes and brought into these camps. These camps \nare not a place where a person can stay indefinitely. It is a \ntransitory shelter. Many people are there because they are intimidated \nby the militias still lurking in the camps. Others are fearful and \nafraid of going home because they might run into retribution by those \nwho stayed behind, the proliberation democracy forces. But in any case, \nthey are creating a huge problem of assimilation and a huge drain on \nthe resources of the villages of West Timor.\n  I had a chance to meet with the Catholic Relief Service, which is \ndoing great work there, and representatives of the Catholic Church. We \nhave a real obligation, also, to see that these displaced people in \nWest Timor are allowed to go home safely and to reintegrate into their \nsociety, into the new country of East Timor. The work is substantial.\n  Today's effort by the Senator from Wisconsin, after many days to get \nthis measure to the floor, should, as I say, not be a signal that the \nproblem is solved and that we can withdraw--since no longer is East \nTimor capturing the front page headlines--it should be rather an \nopportunity for us to recommit ourselves to do the work of helping \nthese people build a just, decent, and viable society and country.\n  Let me say a final word because we are all here today talking about \nan issue that has been on the minds of the world for the last year \nbecause of the publicity. But long before East Timor was a well-known \nword in the United States and around the capitals of the world, there \nwas one Member of this Senate, Claiborne Pell, who strove mightily to \npoint out the injustice and the need for freedom. In 1992, Senator Pell \ntraveled to Indonesia, saw President Suharto, and asked him to hold a \nplebiscite on self-determination. That was a full 7 years, or more, \nbefore this referendum was held. He also wanted to visit East Timor but \nwas denied permission to meet with Xanana Gusmao, then in a Jakarta \nprison. He held hearings and he kept this issue on the forefront of the \nconsciences of many in the world. In a very particular way, the freedom \nof East Timor today is a tribute to his quiet, persistent efforts \nthrough many years. The fact that today Xanana Gusmao is back home in \nEast Timor, is a leader in that community, a community that will decide \nits own fate, a free country, emerging in the world, is a tribute again \nto Senator Pell.\n  Let me conclude by thanking, once again, Senator Feingold for his \ngreat effort, his clear voice, his dedication and commitment to \nprinciple. Let us all resolve today that we have just begun to help \nthese people to rebuild their country, their society, and to create a \nsociety that will have our values, but will also definitely have their \nown perspective as East Timorese.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island \nfor his extremely dedicated work on this issue. It has been a pleasure \nworking with him on it. I wish to reiterate what he said, which is that \nthis is another opportunity for us to tell our colleagues, as well as \nIndonesia and the rest of the world, that we are watching this on a \ndaily basis and we are prepared to act again. The legislation is very \nviable and we are prepared to offer it as an amendment to another bill \nif the situation becomes difficult.\n  At this point, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, at this time I am delighted to yield the \nremaining time we have on the amendment to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa who, along with the Senator from Rhode Island, has shown not \nonly a tremendous interest and dedication on the issue of East Timor \nbut took the time and risks associated with actually visiting East \nTimor at a very critical point and came back here to be key to the \nentire effort to lead the East Timorian independence. Senator Harkin, \nSenator Reed, I, and others are going to watch this every day to make \nsure this situation moves in the right direction and we don't go \nbackwards.\n  I yield whatever time is necessary to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague \nand friend from Wisconsin for yielding time to me but, more \nimportantly, for his strong and continued leadership on this issue of \nEast Timor.\n  As we all know, East Timor is a small, new nation in a faraway place. \nA lot of times we tend to forget about it and push it off to the side. \nBut we can't. We can't forget about what happened in East Timor. I \nthink it is incumbent upon us, as the leader of the world's democracies \nand as the nation that holds out to oppressed peoples all over the \nworld the ideals of self-determination and democratic institutions, \nbecause we are in that position, that we have to take a leadership \nposition among world communities, focusing and keeping our attention \nfocused on East Timor.\n  These brave people for almost 25 years have continued their \nstruggle--peacefully, I might add--for their own right to self-\ndetermination. When the Portuguese left in 1975, of course, Indonesia \nannexed East Timor. The East Timorese people had no say in that \nwhatsoever. Yet they continued a worldwide campaign for their right to \nself-determination.\n  What didn't they do? What didn't the East Timorese people do? They \ndidn't plant any bombs. They didn't sabotage anything. They didn't blow \nup airliners. They didn't commit acts of terrorism against the \nIndonesia Government or the Indonesia people, but forcefully, day after \nday and year after year, they went to the world community and pricked \nour conscience. They went to the U.N. They came here. They\n\n[[Page S194]]\n\nwent to Europe. There was no accident that Bishop Belo and Jose Ramos-\nHorta both won the Nobel Peace Prize for their activities because they \npursued their right to self-determination as Gandhi or Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., would have done, in a peaceful, nonterrorist way. \nWhen they finally had this vote late last summer, they voted \noverwhelmingly for separation, to have their own nation.\n  Senator Reed and I, along with Congressman McGovern from \nMassachusetts, were there right before the vote about a week before. We \ntraveled extensively around the country. You could already see the \nmilitias and what they were trying to do and the intimidation. It was \nafter that trip that the three of us had conversations with our \nSecretary of State, with Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the \nUnited Nations, Secretary Cohen, our Secretary of Defense, and people \nat the White House. We talked to everyone, saying: Look. We need to \nhave things in place there. There is going to be a blood bath. We hope \nthere isn't. But our sense is that everything we had ever seen before \nin our lives, in our history--you could almost smell it. You could \nalmost sense what was going to happen in East Timor. A powder keg was \nready to go.\n  We met with General Anwar. We went back to Indonesia, and we told \nPresident Habibie at the time: If your orders are right, there should \nbe a peaceful transition and a peaceful election. This General Anwar is \nnot carrying out your orders. He is either not carrying out your orders \nor you are not giving the right orders. But something is not adding up \nhere. The same with General Wiranto, the head of the armed services.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article and an editorial from the \nWashington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 1, 2000]\n\n               E. Timor Panel Blames Army for Atrocities\n\n                         (By Keith B. Richburg)\n\n       Jakarta, Indonesia, Jan. 31.--A government commission \n     charged today that the Indonesian military and its militia \n     surrogates carried out an orchestrated campaign of mass \n     killing, torture, forced deportation, rape and sexual slavery \n     in East Timor. It named six top generals--including Gen. \n     Wiranto, the former army chief--for possible criminal \n     prosecution.\n       The findings of the government commission of inquiry were \n     more sweeping and harder-hitting than had been expected, \n     coming on top of a recommendation from a U.N. inquiry that \n     the United Nations set up a special tribunal to try those \n     accused of atrocities in East Timor. They brought to a head a \n     confrontation between Indonesia's new democratic government, \n     which has made human rights and accountability a major \n     priority, and the powerful military establishment that has \n     seen its traditional role undercut and its past abusive \n     practices put under intense public scrutiny.\n       President Abdurrahman Wahid, who is in Davos, Switzerland, \n     for the World Economic Forum, said after the findings were \n     made known that he will fire Wiranto from the cabinet. ``I \n     will ask him, to use a polite word, ask him to resign,'' \n     Wahid told a television interviewer.\n       Wiranto stepped aside as armed forces commander in October, \n     after the violence against East Timorese that broke out last \n     September over their decision to secede from Indonesia. But \n     he still wields considerable influence in the military as \n     cabinet coordinating minister for political affairs and \n     security.\n       The East Timorese resistance leader and Nobel laureate, \n     Jose Ramos-Horta, said in Singapore that Wiranto should be \n     tried and not just removed from the cabinet. ``In this day \n     and age, you cannot kill hundreds of people, destroy a whole \n     country, and then just get fired,'' he said.\n       Among its findings, the commission also said the military \n     actively tried to cover up evidence of its ``crimes against \n     humanity,'' including moving victims' bodies to remote \n     locations.\n       ``The mass killings claimed the livers mostly of \n     civilians,'' said the commission chairman, Albert Hasibuan. \n     ``They were conducted in a systematic and cruel way. Many \n     were committed in churches and police headquarters.\n       Australian-led peacekeeping troops in East Timor have \n     unearthed hundreds of bodies in scattered grave sites, many \n     in the East Timorese exclave or Oe-Cussi near the border with \n     Indonesia. Villagers have said bodies were moved there before \n     foreign troops arrived, but today's report provided the first \n     confirmation of an effort to conceal the extent of the \n     killings.\n       The commission forwarded to Attorney General Marzuki \n     Darusman the names of 33 people, including Wiranto, who it \n     said should be investigated for prosecution, and Marzuki \n     promised to begin his own probe. Among those named are Maj. \n     Gen. Adam Damiri, the regional commander in charge of East \n     Timor in the months leading up to the Aug. 30 U.N.-backed \n     independence referendum; Zacky Anwar Makarim, the army \n     intelligence chief in East Timor; and Tono Suratman and Noer \n     Muis, the two commanders based in Dili, the East Timorese \n     capital.\n       Also named were the commanders of various militia groups, \n     including Joao Tavares, who called himself the commander in \n     chief of all the militias, and the flamboyant Eurico \n     Guterres, head of the feared Aitarak, or ``Thorn,'' militia, \n     who in the days before the referendum vowed to turn Dili into \n     a ``sea of fire'' if voters supported independence.\n       The bloodbath unleashed in East Timor sparked international \n     outrage and turned Indonesia into something of a pariah \n     state, criticized by friends and slapped with economic \n     sanctions. Hundreds of thousands were forcibly deported to \n     Indonesian-controlled western Timor, homes and buildings in \n     Dili were looted and set ablaze and the few foreigners left \n     in the capital huddled inside the U.N. compound, along with \n     frightened Timorese, with little food or water.\n       The killing and destruction continued until former \n     president B.J. Habibie bowed to international pressure and \n     allowed in foreign troops to restore order. At the time, \n     Wiranto conceded some Indonesian army troops, from two \n     indigenous East Timorese battalions, were involved in the \n     violence. But he repeatedly insisted the outbreak was \n     spontaneous, that there was no evidence of widespread \n     killings and that he was trying his best to bring the \n     situation under control.\n       The report today found Wiranto ``fully acknowledged and \n     realized'' the extent of the violence and destruction in East \n     Timor but failed to take action. ``Therefore, General \n     Wiranto, as the TNI [Indonesian army] commander, should be \n     the one to take responsibility,'' the report reads.\n       While the Indonesian attorney general deals with this \n     report, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan must decide whether \n     to accept the recommendation of the separate U.N. \n     investigation and ask for a human rights tribunal for East \n     Timor. Indonesia vehemently objects to any U.N. tribunal, \n     saying the country is capable of punishing those responsible. \n     Analysts have said a credible report from the Indonesian \n     commission was a crucial first step in dissuading the United \n     Nations from setting up a tribunal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 1, 2000]\n\n                           Justice for Timor\n\n       Not long ago, the armed forces pretty much ran the show in \n     Indonesia; now they are under investigation. A human rights \n     commission formed by that nation's new democratic government \n     yesterday issued a stinging indictment of the military, \n     including its former leader and five other generals, for \n     orchestrating, condoning and taking part in the destruction \n     of East Timor last summer. The report, with its call for \n     criminal prosecution, is an important step. Now comes the \n     hard part for President Abdurrahman Wahid; he deserves the \n     support and encouragement of other nations as he moves \n     forward.\n       East Timor, a small half-island at the remote eastern end \n     of Indonesia's archipelago, voted for independence from \n     Indonesia in a United Nations-sponsored referendum Aug. 30. \n     Indonesia's Gen. Wiranto promised security for the voters; \n     they instead were subjected to a spasm of murder, rape, \n     looting and other violence. At the time, Gen. Wiranto and \n     Indonesia's government blamed the violence on rogue anti-\n     independence militias. But the government's unflinching \n     report, based on many interviews and on-site investigation, \n     rejects that excuse and sees unquestioned official \n     complicity.\n       President Wahid is under pressure from the military not to \n     treat its generals too roughly. Ethnic violence is breaking \n     out in many places; without unified armed forces, some say, \n     Mr. Wahid cannot hold the country together. There have been \n     rumors of a coup. But as much as it needs a strong military, \n     Indonesia needs one subservient to new civilian powers; \n     without progress in that direction, many restive regions will \n     find it intolerable to remain inside the country. So Mr. \n     Wahid is right to dismiss Mr. Wiranto from his cabinet and \n     allow criminal prosecution of those named in the human rights \n     report.\n       A United Nations inquiry released yesterday came to many \n     similar conclusions about the violence in East Timor. Some \n     U.N. officials now favor an international tribunal. Since the \n     United Nations sponsored East Timor's referendum, the \n     organization has a continuing role to play in seeking justice \n     for the Timorese. Its investigation should continue.\n       But before a Bosnia-style tribunal is created, Indonesia \n     should be given a chance to judge its own. Its new democratic \n     government well understands the importance of that process.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I give the Indonesians credit.\n  The article says that this new government commission ``. . . named \nsix top generals--including Gen. Wiranto . . . and General Anwar for \npossible criminal prosecution'' and that the ``militia'' with their \n``surrogates carried out an orchestrated campaign of mass killing, \ntorture, forced deportation, rape and sexual slavery in East Timor.''\n\n\n[[Page S195]]\n\n\n       The East Timorese resistance leader and Nobel laureate, \n     Jose Ramos-Horta, said in Singapore that Wiranto should be \n     tried and not just removed from the cabinet. ``In this day \n     and age, you cannot kill hundreds of people, destroy a whole \n     country, and then just get fired.''\n\n  These are crimes against humanity.\n  I wholeheartedly commend the present Government of Indonesia and its \nhuman rights commission for their bravery in doing this investigation \nand coming up with this finding. I think it moves the democratic forces \nfar ahead in Indonesia because they were able to come out with this \nfinding.\n  I am very supportive of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that is \noffered by the Senator from Wisconsin. We have to make some statements \nabout East Timor. We have to be in the lead on this, and the fact that \nthe human rights commission of the present Government in Indonesia made \nthese findings ought to give us comfort that we are not undermining the \nGovernment of Indonesia in helping the East Timorese.\n  I was not privileged to go back with Senator Reed when he went there \nin December. I talked to him. Senator Reed said:\n\n       You would not believe the places we were, that we saw with \n     our own eyes. They were leveled. Buildings were burnt. Some \n     of the church houses were burned down and people just \n     disappeared, all driven across the border. We were up in this \n     one town on the border. He said it was like a ghost town. All \n     of these people were forcefully deported into West Timor, and \n     even yet today they are not letting these people come home.\n\n  I think the focus of world opinion and public opinion and attention \nhas to be again on East Timor. What the Indonesian military did there \nis unconscionable. I don't blame the Indonesian people. I talked to too \nmany Indonesians who were opposed to what their military was doing in \nEast Timor, who thought it was a right of the East Timorese, because of \ntheir history and their past, to have self-determination.\n  I in no way cast any blame upon the Indonesian people themselves. But \nI do single out General Wiranto, General Anwar, and the people at the \nhuman rights commission who were in charge of aiding, abetting, and \nfostering the militia that did these terrible things to East Timor--as \nSenator Reed said--vindictively burning down things, destroying \ntelephone lines, destroying bridges, just crazy things such as that, \njust to leave the country in total waste.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Rhode \nIsland for their strong support of the brave people of East Timor.\n  I hope we in the Senate, if not today, at some point shortly can \nexpress our support on this sense-of-the-Senate resolution so the brave \npeople of East Timor and the democratic forces in Indonesia know we \nwill support this and we will do everything we can to help them rebuild \nthis country again as a signal to the rest of the world that we will \nsupport peaceful self-determination and the right of people to have \ntheir own democratic governments. This is as good a place as any to \nstart.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for his strong, continued \nleadership on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager of the \nbill.\n  I rise today because I feel very strongly about what we are \nconsidering. Today we in the Congress are being asked to consider our \nfirst statement on Indonesia since the country's elections last fall. \nEveryone is familiar with it. Everyone has watched CNN and watched the \nbloodshed and horror that occurred in East Timor and other places in \nIndonesia. That was prior to the Indonesian elections, and it had taken \nplace under a severely weakened and ineffective leader.\n  Last fall, the Parliament completed the first election cycle that was \ntruly free in the country's history by electing a new President, \nPresident Abdurrahman Wahid. I just returned from Indonesia, where I \nnot only met with President Wahid but the Vice President, the Foreign \nMinister, the Speaker, and the Head of Parliament. I met with \nIndonesian citizens, Americans living over there, and most important of \nall, I met with our very astute and very able Ambassador, Bob Gelbard, \nand the staff we have in Indonesia to help us formulate policy with \nrespect to that country.\n  Unfortunately, our press, which gave us a lot of information about \nEast Timor, has not paid much attention to the free elections. It has \npaid little attention to the work of the new Government and its efforts \nto lead a transition to democracy. This is truly a time of rapid change \nin Indonesia, and it is a time of great challenge for Indonesian \nleadership and others in the world who support democracy, freedom, \nhuman rights, civilian control of the military, and religious tolerance \nfor all people.\n  Regretfully, some Members of this body seem determined to stay in the \npast. Things are moving in the right direction, and it is time, in my \nview, for the United States to support the new Government, to work to \nmake sure that this Government succeeds, and that the noble objectives \nwe support are carried out.\n  President Wahid's job in this situation could not be more difficult. \nHe has to bring democracy and a better standard of living to people who \nwere living under a totalitarian government in a situation that \nbordered on chaos. He has to bring under control the ethnic and \nreligious conflicts that are breaking out all over the country. Perhaps \nmost difficult of all, he has to overcome the well-entrenched and \npowerful interests that want him to fail, that would be delighted to \nbring the country straight back into chaos.\n  From everything I saw, and from what our distinguished Ambassador and \nhis staff tell us, President Wahid has not disappointed. He wakes up \nevery day and makes bold and courageous decisions and he doesn't bother \nto take polls on what people want. He is simply concerned about moving \nhis country in the right direction.\n  I hope we will have the opportunity to welcome President Wahid to \nWashington, DC, and to give him an opportunity to address the Congress \nto talk about the challenges he faces and his commitment to the \nAmerican ideals of democracy, freedom, human rights, and cleaning up \ncorruption in all areas of government and private sector activity.\n  In a very short time, the changes in Indonesia have been marked and \nprofound. On the issues the sponsors of this amendment are concerned \nabout, President Wahid has agreed to work with the U.N. Security \nCouncil to track down and bring to justice those who were responsible \nfor the bloodshed in East Timor. The Indonesian Government, as has been \nnoted already, has impaneled their own commission to investigate what \ntook place in East Timor and bring those to justice. The panel has \nidentified six high-ranking military officers. The President has \nindicated they will all be removed from the military and has given \nevery indication they will be brought to justice.\n  When the spokesman for the military said the military should not be \nsubject to the control of the civilian-elected Government, the \nPresident moved and cut him off. We in Congress cannot continue to put \nour heads in the sand with these monumental changes going forward. Even \nthe European Union recognizes the tremendous progress President Wahid \nand his Government are making. The E.U. has lifted the ban on certain \narms sales. They pledged to begin military training.\n\n  I regret to tell you the situation in Indonesia and East Timor is not \nas simple as some of my colleagues would have you believe. Secretary \nCohen traveled there and laid out what we expect of the new Government. \nThe Government has complied, but in the interim we have cut off our \nability to have any positive influence by ending military to military \ncontact. I say let's listen to our former colleague, now Defense \nSecretary Bill Cohen, who is well informed about what is going on in \nthat area. I suggest we listen to the people in our State Department--a \nState Department run by the party of my colleagues who have introduced \nthis resolution--and ask them what we can do to help move the \nGovernment, move the cause of democracy and freedom, in the right \ndirection. At a time such as this, we should be sending to the people \nof Indonesia a loud message,\n\n[[Page S196]]\n\nand a clear message, that we support their efforts to achieve democracy \nand we will support the new Government in its efforts to bring \ndemocracy to its 210 million people.\n  The resolution, as I have just seen it, as I quickly calculate, \ndedicates 14 lines to congratulating the people of Indonesia and \nencouraging the Government of this country to work with the struggling \ndemocracy and then dedicates several pages to those things we as a \ngovernment should be denying the Indonesian Government. Here is a \ncountry emerging from all the problems of the past. They need a hand \nup, not another bucket of water dumped on their heads.\n  Secretary Cohen delivered a clear message during his trip to the \ncountry that it was time for military reform. The Indonesian people \nresponded. Today, the Indonesian military is under civilian control. In \na clear move to curb the power of the army, the position of commander \nin chief has been given to an admiral in the Indonesian Navy, \nconsidered to be the most progressive and professional of the military \nbranches. Under pressure from Secretary Cohen, the military vacated \nEast Timor. There have been positive reports coming in that the \nmilitary has been cooperating with the international community. Some \nmembers are working actively to frustrate the efforts of pro-Jakarta \nmilitias to conduct any further raids on refugees or East Timor towns.\n  On the human rights front, a new attorney general has been selected. \nOur State Department has great confidence in his commitment to the rule \nof law and protection of human rights. The Indonesian Government has \nalso created a new position within the Government, the State Commission \non Human Rights, a position that has been filled by a former political \nprisoner from Aceh.\n  These are not insignificant steps. In fact, they are enormous steps \nthat show the tremendous effort on the part of the new Government and \nthe people of Indonesia.\n  The outcome of the election could have been very different. It was \nnot. There was no mass violence in the streets, and there was no \nmilitary coup. The result was democracy in action.\n  The bottom line is the Indonesians have been doing everything we \nasked them to do. Now, with this proposed resolution, we are being \nurged not to offer congratulations, not to extend a helping hand but, \nrather, to poke a sharp stick in their eye.\n  This resolution endorses a cutoff of military-to-military contact, \neducation, and military assistance. But the administration promptly cut \noff assistance and contact after the violence broke out. The Department \nof Defense and our Department of State can be a very positive force for \nreform, but this amendment would propose to limit their ability to do \nso. The violence happened under a different government with a weak \npresident.\n  Make no mistake about it, this resolution will be looked upon by the \nIndonesian people as a repudiation of the direction they have chosen \nand of the work of their democratically elected President and Vice \nPresident. It will be taken as a clear sign that the United States is \nnot interested in being a positive force for change.\n\n  I urge--I beg my colleagues to stay involved and to pay attention \nbecause this is a vitally important part of the world. When I was in \nSoutheast Asia 9 months ago, when I asked in one country or another how \nthings were going, everybody would say: We are doing well, but we are \nworried about Indonesia.\n  We ought to be worried about Indonesia because they are the fourth \nlargest country in the world. They have an opportunity to join the list \nof countries that are democracies, that are committed to human rights \nand freedom. They deserve to be part of the enlightened leadership of \nthe world.\n  It is time we provided support to that effort. It is vital the United \nStates continue to support the development of democracy and of civilian \ncontrol of the military. We need to begin the process of engagement, to \nprovide their military with the assistance and training they need to \nensure that the functions of security are carried out effectively and \nproperly. Our government has pressured the Indonesian government to \nrestrain the military and make reforms. Now the situation is getting \nout of control. The military has lost its ability to respond to \nregional outbreaks of violence. Rather than being an impediment to \nprogress, we ought to be in there helping them to reestablish the rule \nof law and order and peace and security for all people and all \nreligious groups in Indonesia.\n  We have a tough battle ahead. There have been atrocities that are \nmind boggling. I join with the sponsors of the resolution who \nunderstand how terrible these depredations were. But times are \nchanging. We need to be a positive force, to encourage those changes, \nto keep them on the right track, and not punish a government that is \ntrying to move in the direction we laid out for them.\n  Mr. President, I am sure we will visit this issue again. In the \nmeantime, I urge all my colleagues to seek counsel from our own State \nDepartment, our own Department of Defense. This Democratic \nadministration has excellent people who are well aware of what is going \non there. Let's find out from them what is happening and what we can do \nto be a positive force.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will listen to them \nso we can be positive in our efforts and in our results.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 5 minutes on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we would like an opportunity to briefly \nrespond to the comments of the Senator from Missouri. I could have \nsworn the Senator had not heard my remarks earlier because his remarks \nsuggest an analysis that has something to do with their original \nlegislation. I took great pains throughout my comments to indicate \nexactly what the Senator from Missouri was indicating, that there are \nsome very positive developments in Indonesia, and in particular that \nGovernment there, the democratically elected Government, is struggling \nto keep that nation strong, to keep that nation together, and to get \ncontrol over the military.\n  So I find it very ironic that the Senator would come down here and \nsay we need to be fair to that Government when you look at the comments \nin the last 48 hours. What has happened in the last 48 hours? President \nWahid of Indonesia said, I say to the Senator from Missouri, that it \nmay be necessary for Mr. Wiranto to resign. That is what the \ndemocratically elected President of Indonesia said when he heard about \nthe investigations and reports of the United Nations.\n  What did Mr. Wiranto say with regard to that suggestion of the \nPresident of Indonesia? He said he was going to brush aside calls to \nresign from government and stand trial for his alleged role in human \nrights abuses in East Timor last year. ``Like a good soldier, I am \ngoing to continue to fight for the truth.''\n  In other words, the Senator from Missouri asks us to support the \nPresident and the nation of Indonesia. But instead what he is really \ndoing is giving support and sanction to the attitude of Mr. Wiranto, \nthe person who many believe had a great deal to do with the atrocities \nin East Timor.\n  I did not come today to actually seek a vote on this amendment. I did \nindicate I would withdraw the amendment from this bankruptcy bill. We \nwanted to serve notice that we will continue to monitor this situation, \nand we are doing it in a balanced way that indicates our support for \nthe positive developments in Indonesia.\n  The Senator from Missouri complains that our resolution is mostly \nnegative with regard to things that happened in East Timor and with \nregard to Indonesia. This resolution is not about Indonesia in general. \nIf the Senator wants to promote a resolution praising Indonesia and the \npositive things that have happened in Indonesia in the last couple of \nmonths, I may well join him. But this is about what happened in East \nTimor.\n  The Senator apparently took a trip recently to Indonesia, but the \npeople who were on the floor to talk today--Senator Reed and Senator \nHarkin--\n\n[[Page S197]]\n\nhave actually been to East Timor. You can add to that a key person of \nthe Clinton administration he kept mentioning, our distinguished \nAmbassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, who also went to \nEast Timor in late November and came back and told me and others that \nthe conditions and circumstances with regard to the refugees in West \nTimor, many of whom want to get home to East Timor, are not good. He \nhas a long and distinguished record of seeing these kinds of situations \nthroughout the world in the over 30 or 40 years he has been in \ndiplomacy. He was deeply troubled by the fact the job was not done.\n  The people of East Timor and the people of East Timor who are in West \nTimor and want to come home have not had their rights fully protected. \nThat is why we are trying to put pressure on the military in Indonesia. \nThat is not an unfriendly act to the Government of Indonesia. That is a \nfriendly act because that is the toughest challenge the President of \nIndonesia has right now--making sure the military accepts democratic \nrule of that country. We are in an effort to support democracy in \nIndonesia, and it cannot go forward as the kind of democracy we support \nunless this situation in East Timor is properly resolved. That is the \nspirit of our amendment, and that is the spirit of our bill. I \nappreciate the additional time.\n  Let me add, Senator Leahy is another who has done an enormous amount \non this issue of East Timor and can certainly tell you the job is not \ndone with regard to using our leverage and our ability to persuade and \nmake sure the people of East Timor have full independence and that the \npeople who want to return to East Timor have the opportunity to do \nthat.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2667, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, I withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Feingold, Senator Reed of \nRhode Island, and Senator Harkin for the leadership they have shown on \nthe East Timor issue. They have all been to East Timor and have \nconsistently spoken out in support of independence for East Timor and \nhuman rights for its people.\n  Senator Feingold's resolution would end all U.S. military cooperation \nwith Indonesia on account of the Indonesian military's appalling abuses \nin East Timor. This would send an unequivocal message, not only there \nbut throughout the world, that the United States will not resume any \nrelationship with the Indonesian military until it is thoroughly \nreformed, and not only reformed, but the members who are responsible \nfor the abuses are punished.\n  Some of these abuses, well documented by independent news media and \neyewitness accounts, are so horrible they are reminiscent of the Dark \nAges.\n  I understand the resolution is going to be withdrawn on account of \nthe progress being made by the Indonesian Government in asserting \ncontrol of the military. However, Senator Feingold's determination to \nkeep the Senate's attention on this important issue is well worthwhile.\n  Last September we watched in horror as a systematic campaign of \nterror and destruction waged in East Timor: Hundreds of innocent people \nwere killed, hundreds of thousands more were forcibly uprooted from \ntheir homes, villages and towns were ransacked and family members were \nkilled in front of other family members. Even today, U.N. investigators \nare unearthing what we are seeing too often in modern times: bodies in \nmass graves.\n  In the past two days, an Indonesian Government commission and a \nUnited Nations commission independently concluded that the Indonesian \nmilitary bears ultimate responsibility for the bloodbath, and must be \nheld accountable for its abuses in East Timor. This is an extremely \nimportant and encouraging step.\n  Under tremendous pressure--tremendous pressure to turn a blind eye to \nwhat happened in East Timor--and at great personal risk, Indonesian \ninvestigators have done a commendable job in determining the extent of \nthe violence and identifying the individuals responsible, including not \nonly those who gave the orders but those who had the power to stop the \nmayhem and instead simply stood by and let it happen.\n  There are sins of comission and there are sins of omission. If you \nare a military officer with the power to stop something from \nhappening--an atrocity, a murder--and you stand by and allow it to go \non, in my mind you are as equally guilty as those who commit the act.\n  As the leader of Indonesia's new democratic government, President \nWahid has courageously voiced his willingness to confront the powerful \nIndonesian military establishment. He has called for the prosecutions \nof army leaders, including General Wiranto, former commander of the \nArmed Forces, who, until recently, was lauded by officials of our own \nPentagon.\n  The United Nations commission called for the establishment of an \nindependent national tribunal to bring those responsible for the \nviolence in East Timor to justice. It is a proposal which the \nIndonesian Government has rejected, insisting it is capable of \npunishing the perpetrators itself.\n  While it is too early to say whether an Indonesian tribunal would \nhave sufficient resources or authority to conduct what are likely to be \nlong and expensive trials of military leaders, one thing is clear: now \nis not the time for the United States to follow the European Union's \nrecent example of renewed military assistance or sales of military \nequipment to Indonesia. With all due respect to our European friends, \nsometimes I think they have a terribly short memory.\n\n  Indonesia is at a critical juncture in its transition to democracy. \nThe commission's findings will heighten the already tense relationship \nbetween the Indonesian Government and the Indonesian military. As \npressure on the military increases, it is likely that rumors of a coup \nwill become louder and more threatening. I believe the United States \nhas to continue to show strong support for President Wahid and for an \nend to the long history of impunity and immunity enjoyed by members of \nthe Indonesian military.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I don't pretend to know all the history or \nintricacies of the effort to bring about peace in Northern Ireland, \nnotwithstanding the number of visits I have made there, notwithstanding \nthe historic ties to that island that I have through my father's \nfamily, or even with the work I have done with our distinguished former \ncolleague, George Mitchell, a man who deserves the highest credit for \nhis tireless efforts towards peace in Northern Ireland. But I have met \nwith those who are key figures in Ireland: David Trimble from the \nloyalists side; Seamus Mallon, Gerry Adams, and another key figure, \nJohn Hume. Mr. Trimble and Mr. Hume shared the Nobel Peace Prize for \nthe work they did, and deservedly so.\n  I was one of those in the Senate who urged, near the beginning of \nPresident Clinton's term in office, to give a visa to Gerry Adams, the \nhead of Sinn Fein and the one most visibly connected in this country \nwith the IRA. I recall the State Department and the Justice Department \nbeing opposed to that visa, and the President courageously saying we \nare going to give him a visa. I think most people now accept the fact \nthat because the President overrode the qualms of his own State \nDepartment and Justice Department in giving that visa, that we moved \nforward on peace for the first time.\n\n[[Page S198]]\n\n  For people who have always looked at each other through distrust and \nhatred--many times because of killings on both sides, killings of \nCatholics by Protestants and Protestants by Catholics, apparently all \nin the name of the greater good--they have come far and put together a \ngovernment in Northern Ireland, which can start to govern itself. Men \nand women of good will on both sides of this issue--men and women who a \nfew years ago would never speak to each other--have come together.\n\n  This was recently disturbed by articles in the press indicated that \nthe IRA still refuses to turn over any of their weapons. Ironically \nenough, this is at a time when the Republic of Ireland and authorities \nin Northern Ireland continue to find and destroy caches of weapons \nbelonging to the IRA. I don't know what kind of stubborn humility or \nholding of ancient grudges would not allow the IRA to make this move. I \nbrook no favor for those on either side who have been involved in \natrocities because whether it is from the Ulster side or from the IRA \nside, there are atrocities aplenty--innocent people killed because of \ntheir religion, because of their allegiance.\n  In many ways, I want to say a pox on both your houses. But that only \nmeans that generations from now the fighting will continue over things \nthat gain nothing for anybody, feuds of hundreds of years, and memories \nsometimes of just a few years. It is time, in a new century, to stop \nthe killings, to finally allow Northern Ireland, this beautiful land, \nto move forward and join the rest of the island in the new economic \nprosperity--but in peace.\n  As a group of mothers, Catholic and Protestant, told me once--\ntogether--they agreed with my speech of the night before in which I had \nsaid in Belfast--or just outside of Belfast--that I condemn violence \nfrom either side. They said how much they agreed, and what they wanted \nwas for their children to be able to go to school and be educated, to \nlive in peace, to walk down the street without worrying about being \nshot. What mother would want otherwise?\n  Frankly, those in Sinn Fein who have called on their friends here in \nthe Congress to help them with visas, to help them move forward, best \nhelp themselves because it would be tragedy compounded on tragedy if \nafter all these years of seeking peace, after all the work of people \nsuch as John Hume and George Mitchell, David Trimble, and Gerry Adams--\npeople who might not want their names put in the same sentence--after \nall their work, what a tragedy it would be if one party, one piece of \nthis puzzle opted out by not at least doing the first necessary steps \nto build confidence; that is, give over their weapons.\n  (Mr. GORTON assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/01/senate-section/article/S198-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S198-S200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE GROWING CRISIS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to call attention to a growing \nnational crisis in the administration of capital punishment. People of \ngood conscience can and will disagree on the morality of the death \npenalty. But I am confident that we should all be able to agree that a \nsystem that may sentence one innocent person to death for every seven \nit executes has no place in a civilized society, much less in 21st \ncentury America. But that is what the American system of capital \npunishment has done for the last 24 years.\n  A total of 610 people have been executed since the reinstatement of \ncapital punishment in 1976. During the same time, according to the \nDeath Penalty Information Center, 85 people have been found innocent \nand were released from death row. These are not reversals of sentences, \nor even convictions on technical legal grounds; these are people whose \nconvictions have been overturned after years of confinement on death \nrow because it was discovered they were not guilty. Even though in some \ninstances they came within hours of being executed, it was eventually \ndetermined that, whoops, we made a mistake; we have the wrong person.\n  What does this mean? It means that for every seven executions, one \nperson has been wrongly convicted. It means that we could have more \nthan three innocent people sentenced to death each year. The phenomenon \nis not confined to just a few States; the many exonerations since 1976 \nspan more than 20 different States. And of those who are found \ninnocent--not released because of a technicality, but actually found \ninnocent--what is the average time they spent on death row, knowing \nthey could be executed at any time? What is the average time they spent \non death row before somebody said, we have the wrong person? Seven and \na half years.\n\n  This would be disturbing enough if the eventual exonerations of these \ndeath row inmates were the product of reliable and consistent checks in \nour legal system, if we could say as Americans, all right, you may \nspend 7\\1/2\\ years on death row, but at least you have the comfort of \nknowing that we are going to find out you are innocent before we \nexecute you. It might be comprehensible, though not acceptable, if we \nas a society lacked effective and relatively inexpensive means to make \ncapital punishment more reliable. But many of the exonerated owe their \nlives to fortuity and private heroism, having been denied commonsense \nprocedural rights and inexpensive modern scientific testing \nopportunities--leaving open the very real possibility that there have \nbeen a number of innocent people executed over the last few decades who \nwere not so fortunate.\n  Let me give you a case. Randall Dale Adams. Here is a man who might \nhave been routinely executed had his case not attracted the attention \nof a filmmaker, Earl Morris. His movie, ``The Thin Blue Line,'' \nshredded the prosecution's case and cast a national spotlight on Adams' \ninnocence.\n  Consider the case of Anthony Porter. Porter spent 16 years on death \nrow. That is more years than most Members of the Senate have served. He \nspent 16 years on death row. He came within 48 hours of being executed \nin 1998, but he was cleared the following year. Was he cleared by the \nState? No. He was cleared by a class of undergraduate journalism \nstudents at Northwestern University, who took on his case as a class \nproject. That got him out. Then the State acknowledged that it had the \nwrong person, that Porter had been innocent all along. He came within \n48 hours of being executed, and he would have been executed had not \nthis journalism class decided to investigate his case instead of doing \nsomething else. Now consider the cases of the unknown and the unlucky, \nabout whom we may never hear.\n  Last year, former Florida Supreme Court Justice Gerald Kogan said he \nhad ``no question'' that ``we certainly have, in the past, executed . . \n. people who either didn't fit the criteria for execution in the State \nof Florida, or who, in fact, were, factually, not guilty of the crime \nfor which they have been executed.'' This is not some pie-in-the-sky \ntheory. Justice Kogan was a homicide detective and a prosecutor before \neventually rising to Chief Justice.\n  This crisis has led the American Bar Association and a growing number \nof State legislators to call for a moratorium on executions until the \ndeath penalty can be administered with less risk to the innocent. This \nweek, the Republican Governor of Illinois, George Ryan, announced he \nplans to block executions in that State until an inquiry has been \nconducted into why more death row inmates have been exonerated than \nexecuted since 1977 when Illinois reinstated capital punishment. Think \nof that. More death row inmates exonerated than executed.\n  Governor Ryan is someone who supports the death penalty. But I agree \nwith him in bringing this halt. He said: ``There is a flaw in the \nsystem, without question, and it needs to be studied.'' The Governor is \nabsolutely right. I rise to bring to this body the debate over how we \nas a nation can begin to reduce the risk of killing the innocent.\n  I hope that nobody of good faith--whether they are for or against the \ndeath penalty--will deny the existence of a serious crisis. Sentencing \ninnocent women and men to death anywhere in our country shatters \nAmerica's image in the international community. At the very least, it \nundermines our leadership in the struggle for human rights. But, more \nimportantly, the individual and collective conscience of decent \nAmericans is deeply offended and the faith in the working of our \ncriminal justice system is severely damaged. So the question we should \ndebate is, What should be done?\n\n[[Page S199]]\n\n  Some will be tempted to rely on the States. The U.S. Supreme Court \noften defers to ``the laboratory of the States'' to figure out how to \nprotect criminal defendants. After 24 years, let's take a look at that \nlab report.\n  As I already mentioned, Illinois has now had more inmates released \nfrom death row than executed since the death penalty was reinstated. \nThere have been 12 executions, and 13 times they have said: Whoops, \nsorry. Don't pull the switch. We have the wrong person. This has \nhappened four times in the last year alone.\n  In Texas, the State that leads the Nation in executions, courts have \nupheld death sentences in at least three cases in which the defense \nlawyers slept through substantial portions of the trial. The Texas \ncourts said that the defendants in these cases had adequate counsel. \nAdequate counsel? Would any one of us if we were in a taxicab say we \nhad an adequate driver who was asleep at the wheel? What we are saying \nis with a person's life at stake the defense lawyer slept through the \ntrial, and the Texas courts say that is pretty adequate.\n  Meanwhile, in the past few years, the States have followed the \nFederal lead in expanding their defective capital punishment systems, \ncurtailing appeal and habeas corpus rights, and slashing funding for \nindigent defense services. The crisis can only get worse.\n  The States have had decades to fix their capital punishment systems, \nyet the best they have managed is a system fraught with arbitrariness \nand error--a system where innocent people are sentenced to death on a \nregular basis, and it is left not to the courts, not to the States, not \nto the Federal Government, but to filmmakers and college undergraduates \nto correct the mistakes. History shows that we cannot rely on local \npolitics to implement our national conscience on such fundamental \npoints as the execution of the innocent.\n  What about the Supreme Court? In a 1993 case, it could not even make \nup its mind whether the execution of an innocent person would be \nunconstitutional. Do a referendum on that one throughout the Nation. \nAsk people in this Nation of a quarter billion people whether they \nthink executing an innocent person should be considered constitutional \nor unconstitutional. Most in this country have no doubt that it would \nbe unconstitutional, but that really does not matter: executing an \ninnocent person is abhorrent--it is morally wrong. Whether you support \nthe death penalty or not, executing an innocent person is wrong, and we \nin this body have the moral duty to express and implement America's \nconscience. We should be the Nation's conscience. The buck should stop \nin this Chamber where it always stops in times of national crisis.\n  How do we begin to stem the crisis? I have been posing this question \nto experts across the country for nearly a year. There is a lot of \nconsensus over what must be done. In the next few weeks, I will \nintroduce legislation that will address some of the most urgent \nproblems in the administration of capital punishment.\n  Two problems in particular require our immediate attention. First, we \nneed to ensure that defendants in capital cases receive competent legal \nrepresentation at every stage in their case. Second, we have to \nguarantee an effective forum for death row inmates who may be able to \nprove their innocence.\n  In our adversarial system of justice, effective assistance of counsel \nis essential to the fair administration of justice. It is the principal \nbulwark against wrongful conviction.\n  I know this from my own experience as a prosecutor. It is the best \nway to reduce the risk that a trial will be infected by constitutional \nerror, resulting in reversal, retrial, cost, delay, and repeated \nordeals for the victim's family. Most prosecutors will tell you they \nwould much prefer to have good counsel on the other side because there \nis less apt to be mistakes, there is less apt to be reversible error, \nand there is far more of a chance that you end up with the right \ndecision.\n  Most defendants who face capital charges are represented by court-\nappointed lawyers. Unfortunately, the manner in which defense lawyers \nare selected and compensated in death penalty cases frequently fails to \nprotect the defendant's rights. Some States relegate these cases to \ngrossly unqualified lawyers willing to settle for meager fees. While \nthe Federal Government pays defense counsel $125 an hour for death \npenalty work, the hourly rate in many States is $50 or less, and some \nStates place an arbitrary and usually unrealistically low cap on the \ntotal amount a court-appointed attorney can bill.\n  New York recently slashed pay for counsel in capital cases by as much \nas 50 percent. They might say they are getting their money's worth if \nthey cut out all the money for defense counsel. The conviction rate is \nprobably going to shoot up. Let me tell you what else will go up--the \nnumber of innocent people who will be put to death.\n  Congress has done its part to make a bad situation worse. In 1996, \nCongress defunded the death penalty resource centers. This has sharply \nincreased the chances that innocent persons will be executed.\n  You get what you pay for. Those who are on death row have found their \nlives placed in the hands of lawyers who are drunk during the trial--in \nsome instances, lawyers who never bothered to meet their client before \nthe trial; lawyers who never bothered to read the State death penalty \nstatute; lawyers who were just out of law school and never handled a \ncriminal case; and lawyers who were literally asleep on the job.\n  Even some of our best lawyers, diligent, experienced litigators, can \ndo little when they lack funds for investigators, experts, or \nscientific testing that could establish their client's innocence. \nAttorneys appointed to represent capital defendants often cannot recoup \neven their out-of-pocket expenses. They are effectively required to \nwork at minimum wag or below while funding their client's defense out \nof their own pockets.\n  Although the States are required to provide criminal defendants with \nqualified legal counsel, those who have been saved from death row and \nfound innocent were often convicted because of attorney error. They \nmight not have had postconviction review because their lawyer failed to \nmeet a filing deadline. An attorney misses a deadline by even 1 day, \nand his death row client may pay the price with his life.\n  Let me be clear what I am talking about. I am not suggesting that \nthere is a universal right to Johnnie Cochran's services. The O.J. \nSimpson case has absolutely nothing to do with the typical capital \ncase, in which one or possibly two underfunded and underprepared \nlawyers try to cobble together a defense with little or no scientific \nor expert evidence and the whole process takes less than a week. These \nare two extremes. You go from the Simpson case, where the judge let the \nwhole thing get out of control and we had a year-long spectacle, to the \ntypical death penalty case which is rushed through without preparation \nin a matter of days. Somewhere there must be a middle ground.\n\n  Let me give three examples of some of the worst things that have \nhappened--but not untypical.\n  Ronald Keith Williamson. In 1997, a Federal appeals court overturned \nWilliamson's conviction on the basis of ineffectiveness of counsel. The \ncourt noted that the lawyer, who had been paid a total of $3,200 for \nthe defense, had failed to investigate and present a fact to the jury. \nWhat was that fact? Somebody else confessed to the crime. If I were the \ndefense attorney, I think one of the things that I would want to bring \nto the jury is the fact that somebody else confessed to the crime; \nWilliamson's lawyer did not bother. Then, two years after the appeals \ncourt decision, DNA testing ruled out Williamson as the killer and \nimplicated another man--a convicted kidnapper who had testified against \nWilliamson at trial. Of course, he did. He is the one who committed the \ncrime.\n  Let's next consider George McFarland. According to the Texas Court of \nCriminal Appeals, McFarland's lawyer slept through much of his 1992 \ntrial. He objected to hardly anything the prosecution did. Here is how \nthe Houston Chronicle described what happened as McFarland stood on \ntrial for his life. This is not for shoplifting. He is on trial for his \nlife.\n  Let me quote from the Houston Chronicle:\n\n       Seated beside his client . . . defense attorney John Benn \n     spent much of Thursday\n\n[[Page S200]]\n\n     afternoon's trial in apparent deep sleep. His mouth kept \n     falling open and his head lolled back on his shoulders, and \n     then he awakened just long enough to catch himself and sit \n     upright. Then it happened again. And again. And again.\n       Every time he opened his eyes, a different prosecution \n     witness was on the stand describing another aspect of the \n     Nov. 19, 1991, arrest of George McFarland in the robbery-\n     killing of grocer Kenneth Kwan.\n       When state District Judge Doug Shaver finally called a \n     recess, Benn was asked if he truly had fallen asleep during a \n     capital murder trial. ``It's boring,''' the 72-year-old \n     longtime Houston lawyer explained. . . . Court observers said \n     Benn seems to have slept his way through virtually the entire \n     trial.\n  Unfortunately for McFarland, Texas' highest criminal court, several \nof whose members were coming up for reelection, concluded that this \nconstituted effective criminal representation.\n  I guess they felt because the lawyer was in the courtroom, even \nthough sound asleep, that would be effective representation. If you \nread the decision they probably would have ruled the same way if he had \nbeen at home sound asleep, so long as he had been appointed at some \ntime.\n  McFarland is still on death row for a murder he insists he did not \ncommit, on the basis of evidence widely reported by independent \nobservers to be weak.\n  Then we have Reginald Powell, a borderline mentally retarded man who \nwas 18 at the time of the crime. Mr. Powell was eventually executed. \nWhy? Because he accepted his lawyer's advice to reject a plea bargain \nthat would have saved his life.\n  There were a number of attorney errors at the trial. The advice he \nreceived seems to be very bad advice. Some may feel this advice, the \nadvice given to this 18-year-old mentally retarded man, was affected by \nthe flagrantly unprofessional conduct of the attorney, a woman twice \nPowell's age, who conducted a secret jailhouse sexual relationship with \nhim during the trial. Despite this obvious attorney conflict of \ninterest, Powell's execution went ahead in Missouri a year ago.\n  I ask each Member of the Senate when you go home tonight, or when you \ntalk to your constituents, and when you consider the bill I will be \nintroducing, to remember these cases and consult your conscience to ask \nwhether these examples represent the best of 21st century American \njustice.\n  The judge who presided over McFarland's trial summed up the Texas \ncourt's view of the law quite accurately when he reasoned that, while \nthe Constitution requires a defendant to be represented by a lawyer, it \n``doesn't say the lawyer has to be awake.'' If your conscience says \notherwise, maybe we ought to do something.\n  My proposal rests on a simple premise: States that choose to impose \ncapital punishment must be prepared to foot the bill. They should not \nbe permitted to tip the scales of justice by denying capital defendants \ncompetent legal services. We have to do everything we can to ensure the \nStates are meeting their constitutional obligations with respect to \ncapital representation.\n  Can miscarriages of justice happen when defendants receive adequate \nrepresentation? Yes, they can still happen. So I think it is critical \nto ensure that death row inmates have a meaningful opportunity--not a \nfanciful opportunity but a meaningful opportunity--to raise claims of \ninnocence based on newly discovered evidence, especially if it is \nevidence that is derived from scientific tests not available at the \ntime of the trial.\n  Perhaps more than any other development, improvements in DNA testing \nhave exposed the fallibility of the legal system. In the last decades, \nscores of wrongfully convicted people have been released from prison--\nincluding many from death row--after DNA testing proved they could not \nhave committed the crimes for which they were convicted. In some cases \nthe same DNA testing that vindicated the innocent helped catch the \nguilty.\n  Most recently, DNA testing exonerated Ronald Jones. He spent close to \n8 years on death row for a 1985 rape and murder that he did not commit. \nIllinois prosecutors dropped the charges against Jones on May 18, 1999, \nafter DNA evidence from the crime scene excluded him as a possible \nsuspect.\n  It was also DNA testing that eventually saved Ronald Keith \nWilliamson's life, as I discussed earlier. He spent 12 years as an \ninnocent man on Oklahoma's death row.\n  Can you imagine how any one of us would feel, day after day for 12 \nyears, never knowing if we were just a few hours or a few days from \nexecution, locked up on death row for a crime we did not commit?\n  Some of the major hurdles to postconviction DNA testing are laws \nprohibiting introduction of new evidence--laws that have tightened as \ndeath penalty supporters have tried to speed executions by limiting \nappeals. Only two States, New York and Illinois, require the \nopportunity for inmates to require DNA testing where it could result in \nnew evidence of innocence. Elsewhere, inmates may try to get DNA \nevidence for years, only to be shut out by courts and prosecutors.\n\n  What possible reason could there be to deny inmates the opportunity \nto prove their innocence--and perhaps even help identify the real \nculprits--through new technologies? DNA testing is relatively \ninexpensive. But no matter what it costs, it is a tiny price to pay to \nmake sure you have the right person.\n  The National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence, a Federal \npanel established by the Justice Department and comprised of law \nenforcement, judicial, and scientific experts, issued a report last \nyear urging prosecutors to consent to postconviction DNA testing, or \nretesting, in appropriate cases, especially if the results could \nexonerate the defendant.\n  In 1994, we set up a funding program to improve the quality and \navailability of DNA analysis for law enforcement identification \npurposes. The Justice Department has handed out tens of millions of \ndollars to States under this program. Last year alone, we appropriated \nanother $30 million for DNA-related grants to States. That is an \nappropriate use of Federal funds. But we should not pass up the promise \nof truth and justice for both sides of our adversarial system that DNA \nevidence holds out. We at least ought to require that both sides have \nit available.\n  By reexamining capital punishment in light of recent exonerations, we \ncan reduce the risk that people will be executed for crimes they did \nnot commit and increase the probability that the guilty will be brought \nto justice. We can also help to make sure the death penalty is not \nimposed out of ignorance or prejudice.\n  I learned, first as a defense attorney and then as a prosecutor, that \nthe pursuit of justice obliges us not only to convict the guilty, but \nalso to exonerate the wrongly accused and convicted. That obligation is \nall the more urgent when the death penalty is involved.\n  Let's not have the situation where, today in America, it is better to \nbe rich and guilty than poor and innocent. That is not equal justice. \nThat is not what our country stands for.\n  I was proud to be a defense attorney. I was very proud to be a \nprosecutor. I have often said it was probably the best job I ever had. \nBut there was one thought I always had every day that I was a \nprosecutor. I would look at the evidence over and over again and I \nwould ask myself, not can I get a conviction on this charge, but will I \nbe convicting the right person. I had cases where I knew I could get a \nconviction, but I believed we had the wrong person, and I would not \nbring the charge. I think most prosecutors feel that way. But sometimes \nin the passion of a highly publicized, horrendous murder, we can move \ntoo fast.\n  I urge Senators on both sides of the aisle, both those who support \nthe death penalty and those who oppose it, to join in seeking ways to \nreduce the risk of mistaken executions.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/01/senate-section/article/S200-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S200-S202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1999--Continued\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would like to speak \nbriefly\n\n[[Page S201]]\n\nabout two amendments that are before the Senate--the Schumer amendment \non abortion and the Levin amendment dealing with the so-called gun \ncarve-out.\n  When I took my oath of office on the floor of the Senate, I swore to \nsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States. I am amazed \nsometimes at the type of things we face in the Senate with amendments \nand bills that I find to be unconstitutional, at least the way I read \nit.\n  These two amendments I am referring to essentially harass Americans \nwho are defending three of our most important constitutional rights--\nthe right to life, which is guaranteed by the 5th and the 14th \namendments, the right to free political speech, as guaranteed by the \n1st amendment, and the right to keep and bear arms, as guaranteed by \nthe 2nd amendment.\n  It is interesting, as one listens to the debate on these respective \namendments, some take the position that it is OK to support the 2nd but \nnot the 1st; it is OK to support the 1st but not the 2nd; some say it \nis OK to support the 1st and the 2nd but not the 5th and the 14th. But \nthey are all part of the Constitution. Unless you are going to remove \nan amendment, as we did once with the 21st amendment repealing the \n18th, then I do not think we have the right to stand here and say one \nthing is constitutional and something else is not.\n  The Schumer amendment tries to exempt abortion protesters from \nclaiming bankruptcy. This is an amendment that unfairly targets a \nlegitimate form of civil disobedience. I believe there are some acts \nfor which people should not be allowed to file for bankruptcy--such \nwillful acts that might lead to a personal injury or the destruction of \nproperty. That is not what we are talking about here. I believe most \nstudent loans, taxes, child support, and alimony payments also should \nnot be dischargeable.\n  This amendment adding abortion protesters to the nondischargeable \nlist under bankruptcy laws--let's call it what it is. It is nothing \nmore than another attempt to financially bankrupt and silence free \nspeech of those who peacefully--peacefully--want to speak out against \nsomething they believe in so strongly or oppose so strongly, and that \nis abortion, those who want to defend the constitutionally guaranteed \nright to life.\n  On a talk show yesterday, this issue came up, this supposedly Roe v. \nWade rule that abortion is legal under the Constitution. If someone can \nfind the word ``abortion'' in the Constitution, where it says abortion \nis legal, I will be happy to change my position. If somebody will come \ndown to the floor and point out to me where the word ``abortion'' and \nthe right to an abortion appears in the Constitution--of course, it \ndoes not, and if it is not in there, then any power not specifically \noutlined in the Constitution belong to the States and the people.\n  There is no right to an abortion under the Constitution. Roe v. Wade \nwas a bad decision; it is an unconstitutional decision. Judges are \nfallible, they make mistakes, and they made a mistake when they passed \nthat awful decision which has taken the lives of 40 million children--\n40 million children since Roe v. Wade passed in 1973, 40 million \nchildren who will never have the opportunity to live their dreams, \nnever have the opportunity to be a Senator, to be a President, to be a \ndoctor, to be a mom, a dad. Gone. We took them away, almost one-sixth \nof the entire U.S. population, under that decision, and it is an \nunconstitutional decision because a young child inside the womb or \noutside has a constitutional right to life.\n  Let's talk about what this amendment does.\n  Antiabortion protests, no matter how you feel about abortion, is \npolitical speech, I say to my colleagues. This is political speech. \nThey have a right to speak. I am not talking about protesters who \ncommit violent acts or commit bodily harm to others. I am not in favor \nof that, nor should we tolerate that. I am talking about people \nstanding outside a clinic holding a sign, praying, protesting \npeacefully. That is what this amendment is going after. People who do \nthat are now going to be subjected to this provision on bankruptcy, an \nunfair provision.\n\n  It is political speech for somebody to peacefully protest abortion \njust as much as it is political speech for union organizers or urging \nother workers not to cross a picket line. What is the difference? Why \ndon't we single them out? But we are not.\n  My colleague Senator Schumer singles out one type of protest, a \nprotest on an issue with which he disagrees. It is not constitutional, \nand it is not fair. It is political speech just as much as when the \nNAACP enforced its boycott of southern businesses. The Supreme Court in \nNAACP v. Claiborne Hardware said so. We already have enough laws on the \nbooks harassing abortion protesters, including the Freedom to Access \nClinic Entrances, so-called FACE, and the Racketeer-Influenced and \nCorrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO. The financial penalties under \nthese laws are harsh, unusually harsh for one specific type of protest \nor protester--a peaceful protester.\n  This amendment proposes to give these protesters absolutely no way to \ndeal with the treble damages against them under RICO. A recent RICO \ncase against protesters who carried posters of aborted children \nresulted in $109 million against the pro-lifers; $109 million for \npeacefully protesting without harming anyone's person or property. It \nis outrageous. That ought to be enough to chill anyone's free speech. \nWhat is next? Free speech under the Constitution is protected.\n  Another one of the RICO cases currently pending involves a Catholic \nbishop and religious brother praying the rosary in their car in the \ndriveway of an abortion clinic peacefully.\n  A pro-life gentleman in another case was standing on a walkway near \nan unused locked door of a clinic and was not blocking access to that \nclinic.\n  How much are they going to have to pay for standing up for what they \nbelieve in, such as the marchers did during the civil rights movement \nwhen they sat at the lunch counters and marched in the streets? $200 \nmillion? $1 billion? Where is it going to stop?\n  Can you imagine RICO, which was originally drafted to fight mobsters \nand organized crime, now being used against civil rights demonstrators \nor antiwar protesters, or abolitionists protesting slavery? What will \nwe say then? We know what we would say. We would say it is wrong, and \nit is wrong to protest those who respectfully, quietly, peacefully \nprotest what they believe in, which is the right to life.\n  It is a violation of the first amendment. This is a patently unfair \ndiscriminatory amendment, and it does not deserve even the dignity of \nbeing offered because it is so flagrantly unconstitutional.\n  I urge my colleagues, when the vote comes tomorrow, to vote no on the \nSchumer amendment. Get it off the floor of the Senate because it does \nnot belong here. We should not be talking about unconstitutional bills \non the floor of the Senate.\n  Another amendment which will be offered tomorrow is called the gun \ncarve-out amendment, again, a discriminatory amendment against one \ngroup. The Levin amendment proposes to exempt gun manufacturers from \nbankruptcy laws. In other words, if you are a gun manufacturer, you \ncannot claim bankruptcy, you cannot be treated like everybody else.\n  Why? Because the author of the amendment doesn't like gun \nmanufacturers. I guess he believes they shouldn't be allowed to \nmanufacture guns. Under current law, businesses and corporations can \ndischarge their debts through bankruptcy unless the debt is incurred \nthrough negligence or intentional misconduct. I agree businesses should \nbe held accountable if they are so irresponsible or malicious to \nknowingly sell harmful products, but are we really at the point in \nAmerica when we are going to say if we produce a gun, manufacture a \ngun, legitimately, as a manufacturer, and then if somebody gets ahold \nof that gun and commits a crime, that now the manufacturer is \nresponsible? Is this where we have come in our society now, no personal \naccountability, no personal responsibility?\n  Why don't we do it with automobiles? Why not? You drive your 1999 \nChevy down the road, you hit somebody and kill them, it must be the \nautomobile manufacturer's fault, not you. You are behind the wheel. You \ncan't have any accountability or responsibility. Name another product--\na hamburger. There are people who say meat is bad for you.\n\n[[Page S202]]\n\nMaybe we should hold all of the cattle growers responsible for \nproducing hamburger. Maybe we should hold the people who work in the \nmeat packing plants accountable. Where is the individual personal \nresponsibility and accountability?\n  This is a discriminatory piece of legislation. Again, I regret it is \nhere. The gun industry is selling a legitimate and lawful product. If \nit is banned, at least that is an honest amendment. I wouldn't agree \nwith it, but at least it would be more honest than it is to say what we \nare saying, that we are going to exempt you from bankruptcy laws. It \nis, in fact, a product that is constitutionally protected and \nspecifically mentioned in the second amendment. Everybody knows what it \nsays. There is no secret. It is No. 2 on the amendment list, the Bill \nof Rights. The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be \ninfringed, period. No qualifiers in there. It doesn't say what kind of \ngun; doesn't say how many guns; doesn't say manufacturer, no \nexceptions. It just simply says the right of the people--we are \npeople--to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. That is all it \nsays. And if you have that right under the Constitution to have that \nweapon to protect yourself, as many do, then you ought to have the \nright to manufacture it.\n  This amendment encourages litigation against gun manufacturers and \nshould be called the legislation through litigation amendment. This \namendment will have the effect, as follows: If someone sues a gun \nmanufacturer, the manufacturer's bankruptcy will not stop the lawsuit. \nOutrageous. Gunmakers are already being forced out of business by \nfrivolous, illegitimate, and unconstitutional government-sponsored \nlawsuits against them. How much more do they have to take? This is a \nconstitutional amendment that specifically says you have the right to \nkeep and bear arms and that right would not be infringed. There is no \ngray area. It is not as if there is something we have to interpret. \nThere is nothing to interpret. It is right there. When the founders put \nthe ten amendments, the Bill of Rights, onto the Constitution, they \nmade it No. 2.\n  This amendment singles out a legal industry for unfavorable treatment \nin bankruptcy proceedings. If successful, it is only going to hasten \nthe demise of the gun industry. That is the purpose of it. That is what \nis behind this. It is the Bill Clinton agenda. It is being carried out \nin the Senate. Shut down gun shows. Shut down gun manufacturers. Stop \nthe production of guns in America. Blame the gun manufacturers. Blame \neverybody except the person behind the gun who commits the crime. For \ngoodness' sake, we wouldn't want to punish that person. Somebody else \nhas to bear the blame. Maybe he had a bad childhood. It must be his \nfather's fault, his mother's fault, the gun manufacturer's fault, the \ngun seller's fault--everybody but the fault of the person who uses the \nweapon.\n  This is what we have come to in America. It is not going to stop \nhere. If legislation such as this slips through, it will be a whole lot \nof things--hamburger, cars, cigarettes. How about a desk, a chair? You \ncould hurt somebody with that chair if you hit them with it. Well, \nmaybe we ought to sue the manufacturer of the chair. That is what it is \ncoming to. That is how ridiculous it is. Right here in the Senate, we \nallow it to happen. We debate it day after day trying to stop this \nstuff as it comes at us in waves, unconstitutional laws. Somebody has \nto stand up--and some of us do--to stop it because it is outrageous.\n\n  Gun controllers cannot win legislatively so they litigate. That is \nthe way to do it. They can't get the American people on their side so \nthey get a few unelected judges on their side. There are many \nindustries that can be considered dangerous, as I said: Carmakers, \nalcohol, tobacco, fast food, whatever--legal businesses. Are they being \nsingled out in this bankruptcy bill? No, not this one, but maybe next \nyear or next week. Who knows? Just wait. It is going to happen sooner \nor later. These government-sponsored lawsuits against gun manufacturers \nand tobacco companies are just the beginning because we have now opened \nthe Pandora's box. We have said defendants should be held liable for \ndamage caused by others even if the damage was totally beyond the \ndefendant's control.\n  It goes against common sense, and that is what has served our Nation \nso well, common sense and individual responsibility. That is what \nAmerica is about. It is not about this kind of nonsensical legislation \nthat puts the blame and the burden on people who shouldn't have the \nblame and the burden.\n  I had a shotgun next to my bed as a young man, probably 7 or 8 years \nold. I used it. I shot it frequently. I didn't shoot at anybody. I \ndidn't take it to school and kill anybody, nor did any of my friends \nwho also had shotguns. Why is that? Why is it that suddenly now all \nthis is a big issue? Because we are trying to pass the burden of \nresponsibility on to somebody else other than ourselves.\n  We have a cultural problem in this country of the highest magnitude. \nIt isn't about exempting the gun industry from bankruptcy laws. That is \nnot going to get it right. Believe me, what is going to get it right is \nwhen we start exercising responsibility in this country again.\n  The Founding Fathers would turn over in their graves if they could \nhear this stuff. I can't imagine what Daniel Webster, who wasn't a \nfounder, but he was sitting at the desk that I sit at right over there \nabout 150 years ago, I can't imagine what he would think to be on this \nfloor and debating, blaming the gun manufacturer for somebody else's \ncrime, exempting them from bankruptcy laws. I can't imagine what he \nwould think or Washington or Jefferson or Adams or Madison or Hamilton \nor any of the great founders who wrote that Constitution, what they \nwould think. In many ways, I am glad they are not here to see it.\n  In October of 1999, an Ohio court dismissed a suit against the gun \nindustry stating that the suit ``is an improper attempt to have this \ncourt substitute its judgment for that of the legislature, something \nwhich this court is neither inclined nor empowered to do.'' That was \nthe City of Cincinnati versus Beretta USA Corporation.\n  In addition, court decisions in Connecticut and Florida this past \nDecember ruled that State lawsuits against gun manufacturers have no \nlegal basis whatsoever. Yet here we are on the floor of the Senate \ntrying to do it. The judges in those cases saw that the actions of \ncriminals cannot be controlled by any industry. They were right. So why \nare we here? Because people are trying to make something happen that \nthey know the American people don't support. So we try to do it this \nway.\n  I am heartened by recent polls which show that an overwhelming \nmajority of Americans believe that gun manufacturers should not be \nblamed for crimes committed with guns. Even if you think there are too \nmany guns, even if you believe that, you better think very carefully \nbefore you vote on this as to what might be next. Should we be \nresponsible for the actions of our adult children if they commit a \ncrime? Where is it going to stop?\n\n  If there is even one single successful judgment against the gun \nindustry, those who seek to destroy it, and along with it the second \namendment, will have a ready means to do so. That is what will happen. \nSo we have two amendments that propose to violate the constitutional \nrights of the American people, two politically motivated proposals that \ntarget politically incorrect targets for unfair treatment; dump on them \nwhile they are down. Let me again remind my colleagues of the oath we \nall took right there at the desk to defend and support the Constitution \nand abide by American standards of fairness and democracy that have \nserved our Nation so well. Vote no on these two amendments. No matter \nhow you feel about the two issues in question, vote no on these two \namendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/01/senate-section/article/S202-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S202-S204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ELIAN GONZALEZ\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, on the case of Elian \nGonzalez, the young Cuban boy who is now in Miami, I support Senator \nMack's private relief bill to give Elian Gonzalez U.S. citizenship. \nThis is something I believe should be done. It is not necessarily going \nto stop him from being sent back to Cuba, but it is the right thing to \ndo.\n  I met Elian Gonzalez personally and the great uncle in Little Havana \nin Miami on January 8. I took the time to go meet Elian. I wanted to \ntalk with him myself. I wanted to look him in\n\n[[Page S203]]\n\nthe eye and find out how he felt about the ordeal he went through. \nUnfortunately, the Attorney General didn't take the time to do that. \nElian wasn't important enough for the Attorney General or any of the \nAttorney General's representatives to meet with him.\n  On January 6, Attorney General Reno said:\n\n       If there is any information that we are not privy to--I \n     never say I won't reverse myself. I try to be as open minded \n     as I can. But based on all the information we have to date, I \n     see no basis for reversing it.\n\n  ``It'' being the decision to send Elian back to Cuba.\n  On January 8, after meeting with Elian Gonzalez, I wrote Attorney \nGeneral Reno to request a meeting to discuss new information I obtained \nregarding Elian Gonzalez.\n  In that meeting on January 8, at the request of the Gonzalez family, \nI sat with Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, in a relaxed, \ninformal, nonstressful setting. I spent 2 hours speaking with Elian and \nmembers of his family there at the home. Based on those discussions, I \nhave concluded that there are four areas that are critical to this case \nI would like to briefly share with my colleagues before this vote.\n  One, and most important, Elian does not want to go back to Cuba. He \ndoes not want to go back to Cuba. You might say he is 6 years old and \nhe doesn't know what he wants. If his mother had lived, we would not be \ntalking about this case. He would have his right to be here. She died. \nShe can't speak for him. But he spoke. He made it very clear to me. On \nseveral occasions, I looked Elian right in the eye and asked him \ndirectly, ``Do you want to go back to Cuba?'' He repeatedly and \nemotionally said, ``No, no, no.'' In Spanish, he said, ``Ayudame, por \nfavor,'' meaning: Help me, please; I don't want to go back to Cuba.\n  The second point is very important. Ms. Reno was not interested in \nhearing it because she never responded to my request. She totally \nignored a U.S. Senator's request for a phone conversation, even though \nI know for a fact she didn't have the information I had to share with \nher. Elian's father was aware of his son's planned departure from Cuba. \nListen carefully to what I am saying. Elian's father is being held in \nCuba today against his will. They are not reporting that frequently, \nbut he is. He was aware of his son's departure. Elian's paternal \ngrandfather, who lives in the same household with Elian's father, \nnotified relatives in America that Elian and his mother departed Cuba \nand to be on the lookout for them.\n  Third, there is reason to believe that Elian's father intended to \ndefect at a later date with his current wife and child. I was told by \nElian's great-uncle that two cousins of Elian's father, now in America, \nwere told directly by Elian's father 5 or 6 months ago that he intended \nto leave Cuba with his new wife and child.\n  Fourth, there is reason to believe that intimidation tactics are \nbeing used by the Castro government on Elian's father, Juan Gonzalez. \nReports from family members say Juan has been removed from his home and \nis not speaking of his own free will and may even be under psychiatric \ncare.\n  Let me just say that this is a close-knit family. I am not a family \nmember or a personal friend of the family, but I took the time to sit \ndown and talk with them. I didn't talk with the grandmothers. But the \ngrandmothers, Juan Gonzalez, the uncle, and family members are a \nfamily. People say, ``Why are you politicians getting into this?'' \nBecause the mistake was made by this administration by not insisting \nthat the family come here from Cuba and sit down and talk about this as \na family. They can't do it because Fidel Castro won't let Juan Gonzalez \nout. They won't let him out. Even the appointed nun, the go-between, \narbitrator, the impartial person who was sent to set up the meeting \nbetween the grandmothers and Elian--she is a friend of Janet Reno's--\nshe said the same thing: They are under pressure and Elian should not \ngo back.\n  So the integrity of American immigration policy rests on due process \nand fairness. I was shocked to learn that INS Commissioner Doris \nMeissner never requested a meeting with Elian and never heard his \nvoice.\n  Now, maybe some of you sitting out there who are going to vote on \nthis and maybe some of my friends out in America across the land can be \ncallous enough to say you don't care what that little boy thinks, he is \n6 years old, what does he know. Let me tell you what he knows and what \nhe has experienced. He sat in an inner tube. You know what that is; it \nis a small tube that is big enough to fit inside of a tire of an \nautomobile. That is an inner tube. He floated around in that inner tube \nfor 2 and a half days in the open sea--sometimes 30-foot seas--and \nbounced around out there, and he survived. He was picked up by a \nfisherman. He lived, but he watched his mother die. The last words his \nmother said to the two other survivors were, ``Get Elian to America.'' \nThat is what he went through.\n\n  As an adult, how would you like to go through that--to sit on a tube \nin 30- or 40-foot seas for 2 and a half days, floating from the north \nof Cuba to Fort Lauderdale, FL, and go through that when your mother \ntried to get you here for freedom, and you would send him back without \nso much as even giving him the opportunity to talk. If we do that, then \nwhat has this country come to?\n  The fisherman who picked him up out of the water gave an emotional \ncomment about it. He said, ``I am an American. I was born here. I \nplucked this kid out of the ocean. If you send him back, you are doing \nthe wrong thing and I don't know what happened to my country.'' The \nequivalent would be, during the Cold War a mother with a child in her \narms races to the Berlin Wall, shots are fired, and she tosses her \nchild over the Berlin Wall to freedom. Would we send him back? \nApparently so, under this administration.\n  This isn't about father and son separation; this is about bringing \nthe father and the grandparents and the rest of them here to America \nwhere they can decide without the pressure of Fidel Castro. Let's find \nout what they can say and do without Fidel Castro there. Had Elian's \nmother lived, right now Elian would be enjoying due process under the \nCuban Adjustment Act. Elian Gonzalez, my colleagues, is being punished \nbecause his mother died. I don't want to punish Elian Gonzalez for his \nmother's death. I can't believe any of my colleagues would want to do \nit either.\n  This case is about one thing: the best interest of a little boy who \nsought freedom from Communist Cuba with his family. Sending Elian back \nto Cuba without due process and allowing Castro to exploit this brave, \ncourageous kid who drifted helplessly at sea for 2 days on an inner \ntube in a desperate search for survival and freedom would not only be \nan outrage, it would be the grossest miscarriage of justice I can think \nof in my lifetime. Yet we have people in this very body who say we \nshould do just that.\n  I met with the other two survivors, a young married couple. When the \nboat sank, Nivaldo Fernandez and Arriane Horta were with Elizabet when \nshe was on the boat that made the trip to the Florida coast. She told \nthem, ``Please make sure that my son makes America. Save my son. Please \nsee that he gets to the United States.'' Nivaldo showed me his leg, \nwhich was scarred because he was bitten by fish while floating off the \ncoast of Florida. You can still see the effect this had on him, and he \nis an adult.\n  Yet this little boy who was so brave--can you imagine, after enduring \nall of that, when people would come to his house --when I came, and I \nam a pretty big guy, he wanted to know: ``Hombre malo'' or ``hombre \nbueno''? Good man or bad man. He wanted to know whether I was a good \nguy who was going to be nice to him or bad guy coming to take him away.\n  Can you imagine this poor little boy sitting in that home, when \nsomebody comes to the door, thinking the INS is going to take him out \nof his home in the dark of night and take him back to Cuba? That is \nwhat he is living through now after enduring 2 and a half days in the \nopen sea. This is a child, and he doesn't have any rights? Baloney. \nYes, he does have rights. We should be protecting them.\n  As I said, I met another brave individual, Donato Dalrymple, the \nfisherman. He was very touched. He asked me personally to help Elian \nbecause he told him the same thing: ``I don't want to go back to \nCuba.''\n  Based on this new information that Elian's father was planning to \ncome,\n\n[[Page S204]]\n\nand some other information, I asked the Attorney General to meet with \nme or take a phone call. She refused either. Not only did she refuse to \ndo that, she put on an artificial deadline that caused the family more \nconsternation and the Cuban American community more concern by having \nthis arbitrary deadline that says: OK, on January 14 you go back. Then \nthey rolled that back. That is fine. It is very nice to say, OK, we \nhave a deadline; but how would you like to be little Elian, knowing \nthat and wondering what happens on midnight of January 14? Where is the \nconcern for this brave little kid?\n\n  I support this private relief bill which grants Elian immediate U.S. \ncitizenship, and I further support allowing the courts to make this \ndecision with the family, without the pressure of Fidel Castro, and I \nhope the Senate will support me on that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon).

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a very dear \nfriend of mine who was in the Alaska Airlines plane that had the tragic \naccident yesterday afternoon off the coast of California near Los \nAngeles.\n  Morrie Thompson and I go back a long way, all the way to Fairbanks, \nAK, when I first became involved in banking activities in that \ncommunity. He was a young Native leader. The paths that we took after \nthat time in the early 1970s resulted in numerous meetings and \nconversations. His temperament and sensitivity to the advancement of \nthe Native people of Alaska are almost as though he came on the scene \nto be a man of his time. I speak about that in reference to the \nsignificant portion of our aboriginal community, our Alaskan Natives, \npeople who were in a transition from a subsistence, nomadic lifestyle \ninto contemporary competition for education, competition for jobs, \ncompetition for development.\n  Morrie and his companion, Thelma, not only were good friends, but the \ncontribution they made to the community of Alaska as a whole, Native \nand non-Native alike, was a powerful one. What they leave is a legacy \nthat we can all share with pride and a sense of a job well done by \nMorrie and Thelma, because what they have left in the formation of the \nAlaska Native community is a structure where our Native people have an \nownership, not only in the village corporations, but the regional \ncorporations from which their traditional geographic association \nsprings and their well being can be secured.\n  As a consequence of that, if you look at the Native American on the \nreservation systems throughout the United States and see the comparison \nwith the advancement of the settlement in Alaska, the results speak for \nthemselves--due, in no small measure, to the guidance of Morrie \nThompson.\n  He and I served together when I was running a financial institution \nin Alaska. We had a large number of branches in smaller communities: \nBarrow, Tok, Nenana, Koyukuk, Nome. As president of that organization, \nI found the advice and counsel of Morrie Thompson most valuable as we \naddressed our responsibility in meeting the needs of Alaska's \ndeveloping Native community.\n  A few months ago, Morrie Thompson announced he intended to step down \nas chairman and chief executive officer of the Doyon Corporation, the \nregional Native corporation. There was a retirement party for Morrie. \nThere was a great tribute paid to him by the men and women who knew \nhim, loved him, and worked with him. A very substantial fund was \nestablished in his name for the benefit of young Native Alaskans.\n  I think that area, young Native Alaskans, is where the real tribute \nto Morrie Thompson belongs because he encouraged involvement and \neducation to maintain the attributes of our Native people allowing them \nto be competitive in job markets and educational opportunities.\n  As a consequence of the terrible tragedy that took his life and that \nof his wife and daughter--he leaves two other daughters and he leaves \ngrandchildren--he leaves a legacy for all of us to reflect on: a legacy \nof leadership, a legacy of inspiration, a legacy of genuine trust.\n  He was probably one of the nicest and most decent men I have ever \nmet. As we note the passing of Morrie Thompson, I say to his family and \nfriends, he will be deeply missed, but his legacy and contribution will \nlive in Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/01/senate-section/article/S204-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S204-S207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE HIGH PRICE OF OIL\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to reflect a little bit on \nwhat is happening in our Nation. We got a little snow outside. Snow is \nnot unknown to me or the State I represent. It is part of our \nlivelihood. We live with the cold weather. We know how to handle it.\n\n  But there is suddenly a great concern among a number of my colleagues \nand their constituents about the high price of heating and \ntransportation fuels in the country, particularly in the northeastern \npart of the Nation. This morning in New Hampshire they said it was cold \nand clear. People were out to vote, but they were worried about the \nprice of heating oil. I would like to discuss for a moment why some of \nthese price increases are occurring, as well as appropriate and perhaps \ninappropriate ways we could respond.\n  In mid-January, spot prices for heating oil spiked by about 50 cents. \nAt one point, they closed at $1.36 per gallon. Gulf coast prices \nspiked, but they were pulled up, to a large degree, by the spike in New \nYork State. One of the first places where consumers felt the impact was \nin home heating oil prices where, on January 21, they were up anywhere \nfrom 35 cents to 60 cents per gallon in the Northeast over the prior \nweek. This was also felt in diesel prices, which have also risen \ndramatically. This is causing our trucking industry to seriously \nconsider steep price increases, or even parking some of their trucks \nfor a while.\n  If you have not bought an airplane ticket this month, you should try \nit because you will find there is a $20 surcharge added to your ticket. \nThis is to offset the increased costs of fuel oil. You cannot run these \naircraft on hot air. You run them on kerosene.\n  What is the cause of this price increase? For the most part, there \nare short-term causes that have so dramatically impacted the price in \nthe Northeast, but there are also long-term issues that have impacted \nand will continue to impact the Nation.\n  If we are looking at a quick fix, we can do that or we can look at \nthe long run and figure out how we are going to take care of this \nproblem.\n  The short term problems include the combination of relatively low \nstocks of inventory, forecasts for colder than normal weather through \nearly February, some barges being delayed because of storms, and some \nunexpected refinery problems.\n  Additionally, we have refineries that were in transition. We have not \nbuilt any new refineries in this country for a couple of decades for a \nvery good reason: Nobody wants to invest in them because of the concern \nover the environmental consequences, the Superfund exposure, and so \nforth.\n  Here we are, on the one hand, with an increasing demand for petroleum \nproducts, but because of the laws that were made by Congress which are \nso draconian, the investment community is reluctant to put in new, \nefficient refineries.\n  As a consequence of the low stocks, the existing refiners are \nscurrying to locate immediate supplies, a number of utilities are \nchasing the limited supply, and we have a peaking cold weather demand. \nAs you walk home tonight you will feel it. In short, it was a basic\n\n[[Page S205]]\n\nproblem of too much demand chasing too little supply.\n  There is some relief in that the New York spot distillate problem \nappears to be easing because the current refinery capacity currently is \nadequate to meet the needs, but there is going to be some delay in \ngetting the supply delivered. Additionally, The good news about the \nhigh prices is that it usually speeds the arrival of product from \nsomeplace else. Indeed, it has been reported that at least a dozen \ntankers full of heating oil are on their way from Europe heading to the \nEast Coast right now. There is an indication that as a result of this \nthe price has dropped in the last few days.\n  Unfortunately, even when this immediate problem is resolved, it is \npossible recurrences will happen as stocks are likely to stay low for \nthe remainder of the winter.\n  According to the Energy Information Agency, the EIA, ``the low-stock \nsituation is worldwide and is not necessarily limited to distillate. It \nstems directly from what is happening in the crude oil markets.'' That \nis what we have to look toward. A continuing crude oil supply shortage \nis driving crude prices up, causing refiners worldwide to draw down \nstocks as the higher crude price squeeze margins.\n  What is happening in those crude markets? If one looks at the \nworldwide crude market, it is evident there has been more petroleum \ndemand than supply, requiring the use of stocks to meet petroleum \ndemands.\n  Following the extremely low prices at the beginning of 1999, OPEC, \nthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, as well as Mexico, \nagreed to remove about 6 percent of the world's production from the \nmarket in order to work off excess inventories. And what else? To bring \nprices back. And they have been successful.\n  Remarkably, the producing countries have shown strong discipline in \nadhering to these quotas. This has caused worldwide stocks, including \nthose in the U.S., to be drawn down at very low levels. In particular, \nrefiners drew stocks down in the fall rather than build them up for the \nwinter.\n  We are now in the middle of that winter, the usual high point of \nworld demand, and we have low stocks. On top of this, OPEC members have \nbeen indicating that they will maintain their production cutbacks at \nleast through March and possibly June, so there is no panacea here. The \nnews, along with the cold weather, increased demand in Asia due to a \nfaster than expected recovery of the Asian economy is behind the \ncurrent crude surge which pushed west Texas intermediate crude past $30 \na barrel briefly in January.\n  There is a response to this. One I think is inappropriate and the \nother is appropriate. Let's look at the first one: How should we react.\n  A number of my colleagues and some senior members of the \nadministration have made suggestions about how we should react to this. \nThe first suggestion made by some of my colleagues is let's release the \noil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, to combat the high \nprice of crude. This is the reserve we have in the salt caverns in the \nsouthern part of Louisiana and other areas. That oil is there for the \nnational and energy security of the country in case there is an \nemergency.\n  I believe such a decision to sell that oil would be disastrous from \nthe standpoint of both national and security policy. Our Government has \nnever tapped SPR to manipulate crude prices, and I do not think they \nshould do so now. It is fair to say the administration tapped SPR to \nmeet some of their budget requirements, but to manipulate crude prices \nis totally inappropriate.\n  SPR was set up as a way to protect us from a severe supply \ndisruption. By tapping SPR to manipulate price, we make ourselves even \nmore vulnerable to the supply disruption. We need to recognize that \nprice volatility has been a fundamental feature of crude oil markets \nfor three decades and is common in the commodity markets.\n  We also need to recognize we have made some classic policy blunders \nin attempting to reduce this volatility. Invariably, these measures, \nsuch as price controls in the seventies, clearly aggravated and \nperpetuated what would otherwise have been a much shorter lived \nproblem.\n  The second problem with this approach is it would only represent a \npartial plan. We cannot move forward with an energy strategy of ``sell \noil when prices are high'' and not have a companion strategy of ``buy \noil when prices are low.'' We have to mix the price structure in SPR. \nAt one time, the administration proposed to buy and was buying at $40. \nThe next minute, they wanted to sell at $27. There is a mentality up \nthere that we somehow can make up the difference in volume. That does \nnot work. What would be the purpose of depleting a reserve if we do not \nhave a concrete plan to fill it?\n  The second suggestion is to encourage other countries to ramp up \ntheir production levels so the United States can import more of their \noil. Think about that. We are encouraging other nations to increase \ntheir production so we can get more of their oil so that we can be even \nmore vulnerable to that particular supply. Even some of my friends on \nPennsylvania Avenue have advocated this as a resolve.\n  The Secretary of Energy has been quoted as saying: I am going to meet \nwith the oil ministries of Venezuela, of Norway, Saudi Arabia, and \nothers. This is a strategy to encourage the Venezuelans and Saudis to \nproduce more oil and for the United States to become more dependent on \nthose sources.\n  Their strategy is to spend millions of dollars supporting development \nof oil fields in other nations. Here is the kicker: They have even \nsupported policies that have allowed the Iraqis to produce more oil. \nThat is our good friend, Saddam Hussein. Are the people of Iraq \nbenefiting or are his Republican Guards? I do not have to tell you, Mr. \nPresident, because you know as well as I do.\n  Their answers lead to nothing more than the export of American jobs \nand increased imports of foreign oil. Their answers make us more \nsusceptible to price volatility in the future, not less.\n  Finally, the third suggestion is that Congress appropriate more money \nnext year to subsidize the Low-Income Housing Energy Assistance \nProgram. I do not oppose this. However, throwing more money toward that \nprogram will not solve the underlying problem, and the underlying \nproblem is very simple: We are not producing enough oil and gas in the \nUnited States. This is not to imply nothing can be done to protect \nourselves from vulnerability to aggressive price policy by OPEC, there \nis a solution, and it begins at home.\n\n  The old adage, charity begins at home, is a far better approach to \nreducing our vulnerability to OPEC pricing, and that should begin by \naddressing the problems of our domestic U.S. oil and gas industry. We \ncan do that very easily. We do not have the luxury in the United States \nof manipulating stocks and influencing price. The reason we do not is \nbecause we are 56-percent dependent on imported oil. We are currently \nnot that big, in terms of oil production, to manipulate world prices. \nWe have to make our strategic decisions through drilling strategies, \nand when we look at what has happened to drilling in the United States, \nwe ought to be gravely concerned about the future volatility of heating \nand transportation fuel prices in the U.S.\n  In 1998, there was a decline of almost 60 percent in rigs drilling \nfor oil in the United States. This was followed by a decline in the \nnumber of new and producing oil wells which was followed by a drop in \nour reserves. In 1998, only 24 percent of our domestic oil production \nwas replaced by proven oil reserves.\n  The bare results of 1998 was that thousands of oil industry workers \nwere laid off, drilling contractors were cut to the bone, our stripper \nwells went dry, and marginal wells were shut in.\n  This did not just happen. The administration knew what was going on. \nWhat did it do? It continued to thwart access by our domestic oil and \ngas industry to Federal lands where there was a promising likelihood of \ndiscovery.\n  It continues to try to force an unfair rule change for calculating \noil royalties down the throats of our domestic producers. This is a \nnot-so-subtle message to our domestic producers--you are not wanted \nhere. The only effect these policies will have is to ensure that we \ncontinue to be susceptible to being taken hostage by aggressive OPEC \npricing strategies and that we continue to encourage an outflow of U.S. \ncapital, ingenuity, and investment to foreign shores to produce foreign \noil so we can become more dependent on those sources.\n\n[[Page S206]]\n\n  Common sense tells us that if we are to become less dependent on OPEC \npricing, if we want to be better able to respond to future price \nfluctuations, we must reinforce our domestic petroleum industry.\n  I understand my Northeast colleagues' concern about their \nconstituents paying too high a price for heating and transportation \noil. Frankly, we pay a higher price in Alaska. But I am not here to \ndebate that issue at this time. I am also puzzled that many of those \nsame Members of this body have continued to support efforts that would \nincrease our susceptibility to this price volatility. You can't have it \nboth ways. We are dependent on foreign stocks for 56 percent of our \nsupplies. The only way we are ever going to break this cycle of \ndependence on foreign oil and our vulnerability to price is by boosting \nour own production here at home.\n  I can suggest that a good place to start is on the west coast. A good \nplace to start is in my State of Alaska, where we have been supplying \nthis Nation with 20 percent of its domestic oil for the last 20 years. \nRecently the U.S. Geologic Survey estimated that an area set aside by \nCongress for an evaluation of its oil and gas potential could have up \nto 16 billion barrels of recoverable oil. The 1998 estimate is the \nhighest estimate ever published regarding the 1002 area. This body \nvoted in 1995 to support environmentally sound exploration in this \narea. The Senate voted on this bill, but the Clinton administration \nvetoed the bill. They vetoed the ANWR bill. It has become a cry for \nenvironmentalism all over the country. If you initiate oil exploration \nin ANWR, you are going to violate this area, this pristine area.\n  How many people have taken the time to understand the significance of \nANWR? There are 19 million acres in ANWR. It is an area about the size \nof the State of South Carolina. What have we done to try to maintain \nprotection in these areas? We have taken 8 million acres of the 19 \nmillion acres and put it in wilderness in perpetuity. We have taken \nanother 9.5 million acres and protected it as a refuge in perpetuity. \nBut we set aside 1.5 million acres in the coastal plain, the so-called \n1002 area, under the jurisdiction of the Congress to make a \ndetermination whether that portion and that portion only could be \nopened up for exploration.\n  Some of my colleagues talk about charity beginning at home, and \nsuggest we ought to open up SPR. These are temporary measures that are \nbasically impractical, that cut to the crux, if you will, of our \nnational security interests, and don't resolve a long-term solution. \nWhat we should do is continue to advance science and technology, and \ndevelop domestic petroleum reserves.\n  The conclusion is obvious: If you don't support the industry's \nexpertise and capability through advanced technology to continue to \nexplore whether it be onshore or offshore, then you better be prepared \nfor higher prices and the Northeast corridor better be prepared for \nprice hikes as a consequence of cold weather, because we are looking \nright down the double barrels of the guns of control. Those guns of \ncontrol come from the Mideast countries.\n  I think Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson has been quite correct in \nhis response. He has agreed that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is to \nbe used only for emergencies associated with our national energy \nsecurity interests and not for price manipulation. He has also \npostponed delivery on 5 million barrels of oil that the SPR would take \nat this time, an action which I think is responsible because it is \nintended to put more oil into the market and ease prices. It is going \nto help, but it is not going to help enough.\n\n  The President has released 44 million in emergency heating fuel \nfunds. While I support these efforts, they alone are not enough. These \nare stopgap measures. They don't address the real problem of our \ncontinuing reliance on foreign oil and the resulting fact that we are \ngoing to be dancing to the tune of OPEC for the foreseeable future \nuntil we have the intestinal fortitude to recognize that we can develop \ndomestic sources of oil and gas in the United States, and we can keep \nour jobs at home and lessen our dependence on imported oil.\n  Look at the facts. The fact is, during the tenure of this \nadministration, U.S. demand for oil has increased 14 percent, and our \ndomestic production, strangled by this administration's policies, has \ndecreased 17 percent. You can't have it both ways. I am sympathetic to \nthose Members who represent the Northeast corridor and are feeling the \nimpact of a cold winter and high fuel prices. I would propose the \nfollowing to address these concerns through the enhancement of a \ndomestic industry policy.\n  First, give the industry greater access to Federal lands in the \nUnited States, both on and offshore, limiting to those States that want \nOCS activity. Louisiana is a good example; Texas is another. They \nrecognize the contribution. They recognize the capability of the \nindustry to do it safely. For the most part, the industry has done a \npretty good job.\n  We should, second, develop incentive programs to make the U.S. oil \nand gas market more competitive in the world market. We should open up \nthat tiny area of the Arctic oil reserve to environmentally sound \nexploration. Let's face it. Alaska produces 20 percent of the crude oil \nthat this country enjoys today. That was authorized by the Senate on a \ntie vote where the Vice President had to break the tie to authorize the \ndevelopment of that.\n  There was great speculation that the 800-mile pipeline would somehow \nstop the caribou, would stop the moose. That has survived earthquakes, \ndynamite, shootings. It is one of the construction wonders of the \nworld. Where would we have been without it? You would have had higher \nprices today, Mr. President.\n  Third, strengthen the Department of Energy's research and development \nprogram. We are going to be using petroleum products for a long, long \ntime. You are not going to fly an airplane on solar or wind. You are \ngoing to fly it on fuel. Fourth, once and for all, throw out the MMS's \nattempts to change the rules on oil valuation.\n  Finally, let me refer to some who suggest that we don't need to look \nto the future of oil. We have a lot of gas in this country. It is just \na matter of time. Gas is cheap. Let me refer you to a recent report by \nthe National Petroleum and Gas Council. The demand for gas is going to \nbe increasing about one-third in the next 10 years. There are going to \nbe about 14 million new hookups for gas. The expenditure for that gas \nis going to be about $1.5 trillion. Hearings that we have had in the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee show us that we do not have the \ninfrastructure in place and we don't have access domestically to areas \nthat have the potential for producing gas because the administration \nwon't open them up for exploration.\n  I see my good friend from New York on the floor. I know of his \ninterest in this crisis that is hitting the Northeast corridor. I \nencourage him and others to look toward a long-term solution. A long-\nterm solution speaks for itself. It suggests through technology, with \nproper environmental safeguards, we can encourage more oil and gas \nexploration and development right here in this country, as opposed to \nincreasing our dependence on OPEC where we are going to continue to \nhave this problem, not just this February, but we are going to have it \nthis March. And we are going to have it next November and December and \nJanuary, only by that time we might be 60 to 65 percent dependent on \nimported oil, as the Department of Energy suggests. Then you are going \nto have prices that are going to be coming down around our ears, and \ninflation will be attributed to a large degree to the price of oil and \ngas as a consequence to our increased dependence on imports.\n\n  Bottom line: Charity begins at home.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator from Alaska yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  First, I thank him not only for his leadership on this issue but for \nhis very thoughtful remarks, which I will certainly chew over and look \nat. I saw them on the screen and wanted to do that. I certainly agree \nwith the Senator from Alaska, that what he is talking about deals with \nthe long-term problem which we have to deal with and what myself and \nthe Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, and some of us have been talking \nabout as a short-term problem, which is the oil. For instance, home \nheating oil is higher in my State than it has ever, ever been,\n\n[[Page S207]]\n\neven though the price of oil itself is not higher than it has ever, \never been.\n  I would like to ask the Senator a question. On the short-term issue, \nwhich I understand the Senator's point, which is you are not going to \nsolve the long-term issue. You will be back with short-term issues time \nand time again. But given the crisis that we have, the proposal that \nSenator Collins and I have made is to not deplete the oil reserve, the \nSPR, but rather to at this point sell a small amount of it, let's say \n500,000 barrels a day, from now until March 31, that the experts we \nhave talked to have told us that that is likely to crack OPEC's unity, \nand also not just OPEC, but Mexico and Norway, which in the past had \nnot always marched in lockstep with OPEC. I would be against depleting \nthe reserve. The first question I ask the Senator is: If he was assured \nthat the oil would be bought back at either a higher or lower price--\nand most experts think it would be considerably lower--would that \nassuage some of his concerns? I don't want to burden the Senator, but \nhe is an expert, and I would like to get the benefit of his wisdom.\n\n  If a program were developed of swaps and were put in automatically so \nthat oil was bought for the SPR when the price was rather low, oil was \nsold when the price was rather high, but there was a guaranteed \ncommitment that if the oil was sold during a high price, that it would \nbe bought back at a low price, and you could put a time limit on--one \nof the things mentioned was that you would have to do it in a year \nregardless--would that not deal with the long-term problem that the \nSenator is addressing in most of his remarks? But would that assuage \nsome of his concerns about the short-term issue that many of us in the \nNortheast have such problems with?\n  I yield to the Senator to answer that question.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will respond to that. I recognize the sensitivity of \nmy good friend, and the Senator from Maine, also. There are a couple of \nfactors I think are very important to understand, and that is the \nability of the strategic petroleum reserve to be moved out in a \nrelatively short period of time the crude it has accumulated, or any \nportion of it, and transport it to refineries that aren't already up to \nthe maximum capacity of their refining capability, and then move it to \nmarket because this winter isn't going to last forever. But right now, \nit is significant and very meaningful, as evidenced by the price \nassociated with heating oil.\n  As I indicated in my floor statement, we have evidence by the \nDepartment of Energy that there are a number of ships in transit from \nEurope bringing heating oil. So there will be price relief soon. As you \nand I know, the price goes up a lot faster than it comes down. The idea \nof swaps certainly has merit and has been done before. But, \ntraditionally, the manner in which the Federal Government in \nmanipulating the sales of SPR has resulted in a situation where we have \npurchased high and sold low, and there is a mentality that suggests \nthat we will make up the difference, with the taxpayers taking it in \nthe shorts, so to speak--I am not suggesting we would not go back and \nreplace SPR. Indeed, there are some logistic problems with the idea. \nOne, you don't move it out of SPR very fast because it is in the salt \ncaverns and there is only so much pumping capability and you have to \nmove it to the refinery and then you have to refine it. The realization \nis that the refineries, as I understand it, in proximity to the SPR are \npretty much up to their designed capacity. So what we need is an SPR of \nheating oil for you. That would be my best assessment of the current \nsituation. But I am sensitive to the Senator's concern.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I know the Senator is sensitive to that, and I very much \nappreciate that. The experts with whom I have checked at least have \nsaid it would take about 30 days from the time the President were to \norder selling of the SPR to the time it could be removed and refined \nappropriately. I think more to the point --or maybe not more to the \npoint but also to the point, many people, certainly the majority I have \ntalked to, believe that even if we were to announce we were going to \nsell some of the SPR on the open market, the odds are quite high that \nfrom that point, the OPEC nations, countries such as Mexico and \nNorway--that would crack their unity.\n  My main goal, at least, in offering this solution is not simply to \ntemporarily reduce the price of oil but rather to sort of break OPEC. \nIn the past, what our Government would do would be go to the \ngovernments of Mexico and Norway and say, hey, help us out. In the \npast, they would. When they pumped a little more oil, the unity of the \n11 OPEC nations would crack. Well, Mexico and Norway are not fulfilling \nthat role for a variety of reasons, some of which I am aware and some \nof which I am not. So we would be fulfilling the same role.\n\n  I guess my only question to the Senator from Alaska, chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, is--and maybe my information is \nwrong--if it would take 30 days, would that change his view? Secondly, \ndoes he think that it might have a good chance, if we did even announce \nthis and began to do it, to crack OPEC's unity and that would solve our \nproblem--short-term admittedly and not long-term--right away rather \nthan pumping small amounts of oil ourselves?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In response to my good friend from New York, I \nanticipate it would take at least 30-plus days to see any significant \nmovement from the SPR, which is crude oil transported to a refinery in \nenough time to relieve the crisis of the high price in the Northeast. \nThe problem is, the reserves of heating oil are down. I have discussed \nthe rationale of why the reserves are low, but the fact is they are \nlow. So as a consequence, we are left with a situation where price \nfollows supply and demand, and we are certainly feeling the price. I \nthink we should converse with our Secretary of Energy, who is \nattempting to interject with the Saudis, Venezuelans, Norwegians, and \nother oil-producing countries to try to encourage them to, if you will, \nincrease their OPEC volume, which they have been remarkably solid in \ntheir ability to hold together and not do that.\n  They operate under two theories. One is they would like to have the \nhighest possible price and produce the least amount of oil. But if that \ncartel cracks, then they still have to have the same volume of dollars \nto benefit their government, so they will produce more oil to get it. \nWhat we have seen as a consequence is the cartel coming together and \nholding tough. Subject to the ability of the Secretary of Energy to \nconvince them to do otherwise, I would not look for immediate relief \nfrom that area. I think there is relief coming, but your constituents \nare going to be exposed to some high prices. As sympathetic as I am, I \ndon't know the answer.\n  I just don't think SPR is going to be able to meet the demand in a \ntimely enough manner by the time you get past another 30 days and some \nof this production in to your constituents. I don't think that is going \nto do what the market is doing now, which is bringing more heating oil \nthat is already refined in Europe into the United States. I would much \nrather work ultimately for a long-term solution to our exposures \nbecause you have to look at the reality. We are going to be more and \nmore exposed to the whims of OPEC. We have allowed Saddam Hussein and \nIraq to come in with another 2 million barrels a day. That helps us and \nhurts us when you think about it. Who benefits from that? It is a \ncomplex problem. I have a hard time accepting that part of the role of \nSPR is to meet the domestic price manipulations as opposed to the \nphilosophy that went into SPR, which was its design to be a strategic \npetroleum reserve in the sense of a time when our supplies may be cut \noff. There has been a great deal of criticism in my committee of the \nability of SPR to be able to produce if a demand is there. There are a \nlot of shortcomings within SPR's makeup.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/01/senate-section/article/S207-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S207-S208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrevise the update factor used in making payments to PPS hospitals under \nthe Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 the American Hospital Preservation Act\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nmy distinguished colleague from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, the American \nHospital Preservation Act.\n  This legislation builds upon legislation we introduced last year to \npreserve the ability of American hospitals to continue to provide the \nhighest level of health care to be found anywhere in the world. The \nbill will fully restore scheduled cuts in annual inflation adjustments \nfor in-patient services given to hospitals under the Medicare program.\n  Mr. President, last year Congress passed legislation restoring almost \n$17 billion over five years in scheduled cuts and reductions in \nincreases in provider reimbursement payments for various Medicare \nservices. While some of these cuts were mandated by the 1997 Balanced \nBudget Act, or ``BBA,'' which laid the historic foundation for the \nbalanced federal budget we enjoy today, many more of the cuts and the \ndramatic impact of some of the cuts came as a direct result of policies \nand practices of the Health Care Financing Administration. All told, \nMedicare providers faced an estimated $200 billion in reduced payments \nover the next five years, far in excess of the 1997 estimate of $116 \nbillion in savings. On top of this, in 1999 the Clinton Administration \nproposed an additional $9 billion in cuts from the Medicare program, on \ntop of the BBA savings.\n  All of this began to spell disaster for American hospitals, the \nbackbone of our nation's health care delivery system and those health \ncare providers most heavily dependent on, and sensitive to, the \nMedicare system. Last year, I and many of my colleagues in Congress \nbegan to hear from hospital administrators, trustees, and health \nprofessionals that they were struggling to maintain their quality and \nvariety of health services in the face of mounting budgetary pressures. \nWith the HCFA-imposed cuts they were seeing, many well-reputed and \nefficiently run hospitals even began for the first time to run deficits \nand to project closure in the next few years.\n  For many of these hospitals, particularly those in the rural areas of \nour nation, to close would mean not only the loss of life-saving \nmedical services to the residents of the area, but also the loss of one \nof the core components of the local community. Jobs would be lost, \nbusinesses would wither, and the sense of community and stability that \na local hospital brings would suffer.\n  The Balanced Budget Refinement Act Congress passed last year made the \nsituation a little brighter for a number of these struggling hospitals. \nIt eases the transition from cost-based reimbursement to prospective \npayment for hospital outpatient services, it restores some of the cuts \nto disproportionate share (``DiSh'') payments, and it provides targeted \nrelief for teaching hospitals and cancer and rehabilitation hospitals.\n  I was particularly pleased that the bill contained a portion of the \nlegislation I introduced last year, an expanded version of which I am \nintroducing today. While my bill proposed restoring in-patient \ninflation adjustments for all hospitals, the final legislative package \nincluded such relief only for fiscal year 2000 and only for\n\n[[Page S214]]\n\ndesignated ``sole community provider'' hospitals. While this was a step \nin the right direction, more must be done not only to ensure survival \namong our nation's hospitals, but also to ensure that they continue to \nbe able to provide the highest level and quality of care that they can \nto their patients.\n  Hospitals continue to struggle to meet the continued rise in \npersonnel costs, prescription drugs, and blood supplies, just to name a \nfew areas. And this is coming at a time when hospitals are being doubly \nsqueezed by the pressures of flat or reduced government health care \nreimbursement rates and the rapid growth of cost-conscious managed care \nprivate insurance.\n  The bill we are introducing today will make sure that hospitals are \nable to adjust to these changes by ensuring that their Medicare \npayments for their in-patient services actually keep up with the rate \nof hospital inflation. It will restore the full 1.1 percent in \nscheduled reductions from the annual inflation updates for in-patient \nservices called for by the BBA. Moreover, rather than just applying to \na small group of hospitals, this legislation would benefit every \nhospital in America, providing an estimated $6.9 billion in additional \nMedicare payments over the next five years.\n  Mr. President, I realize that this bill will require some budgetary \noffset, and that the overall goal of maintaining a solvent and strong \nMedicare system for our nation's seniors is and will remain the \noverriding goal. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to ensure that this bill meets that objective and \nfits within our overall budget constraints.\n  But I believe that, as we enter a new millennium and a new era of \nmedical breakthroughs the likes of which we can only now dream about, \nwe simply must continue to invest in the core infrastructure of our \nnation's health delivery system--our hospitals. Doing so will ensure \nthe future health and longevity of all Americans. This bill will take a \nsignificant step in that direction, and I urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor and support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Helms, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Edwards, Mr. \n        Voinovich, Mr. McCain, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2021. A bill to prohibit high school and college sports gambling \nin all States including States where such gambling was permitted prior \nto 1991; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            high school and college gambling prohibition act\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill along with \nSenators Leahy, Cochran, Jeffords, Helms, Durbin, Lugar, Edwards, \nVoinovich, McCain, and Feinstein, which seeks to protect the integrity \nof high school and college sports and reduce the unseemly influences \nthat gambling has on our student athletes.\n  I think you can tell by the coalition of people putting in this bill \nwe are introducing today that this is a bipartisan issue that crosses \nvirtually all ideological lines but is deeply concerned about the \nintegrity of intercollegiate athletics and amateur sports. What we are \nseeking to do by this bill is to make it clear that it is illegal to \nwager on intercollegiate athletics, to wager on the Olympics.\n  The High School and College Gambling Prohibition Act is in direct \nresponse to recommendations made by the National Gambling Impact Study \nCommission (NGISC), which last year concluded a 2-year study on the \nimpact of legalized gambling on our country.\n  The recommendation called for a ban on all legalized gambling on \namateur sports and is supported by the National Collegiate Athletic \nAssociation (NCAA), which represents more than 1,000 colleges and \nuniversities nationwide. This bipartisan bill will prohibit all \nlegalized gambling on high school and college sports, as well as the \nSummer and Winter Olympic Games.\n  Gambling on college games and student athletes is not only \ninappropriate, it can be disastrous. There have been more point-shaving \nscandals on our colleges and universities in the 1990's than in every \nother decade before it combined.\n  There have been 10 such cases in the 1990s. Those are the ones who \nwere caught. How many went on that we don't know about? These scandals \nare a result of an increasing amount of gambling that is taking place \non amateur sports. We now have annually around $1 billion a year bet \nlegally on amateur athletic games. That may sound like a lot, and it \nis. It is a lot to influence those games, but for the overall gambling \nindustry it is a small percentage. It is less than a half of 1 percent. \nSo to the industry that is small. To amateur athletics it is big, and \nit is leading to a burgeoning problem that we are having of point \nshaving cases amongst college athletics.\n  The scandal also points to another problem, and this gambling \nincrease actually points to another problem.\n  A recent Gallup poll found that betting on college sports was twice \nas prevalent among teenagers (18%) as adults (9%). The American Academy \nof Pediatrics estimates that there are more than a million compulsive \nteenage gamblers, whose first experience with gambling is on sports. \nThe National Gambling Impact Study Commission warned that sports \ngambling ``can serve as gateway behavior for adolescent gamblers, and \ncan devastate individuals and careers.''\n  Critics have claimed this is a State issue, not a Federal one. \nCertainly, I am listening to that debate and am a person who is a \nstrong supporter of States rights and believe strongly in devolution of \nauthority from the Federal Government to the State government. But this \nargument just doesn't hold water.\n  Congress already determined that it is a federal issue with the \npassage of Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in \n1992. In addition, while Nevada is the only state where legal gambling \non collegiate and Olympic sporting events occurs, Nevada's gaming \nregulations prohibit gambling on any of Nevada's own teams because of \nthe potential to jeopardize the integrity of those sporting events.\n  Let me give you the truth of the situation. You can go to Nevada and \nyou cannot bet on UNLV in the basketball game. But you can bet on the \nUniversity of Kansas basketball team and game. The reason the Nevada \nLegislature, I understand, took issue with betting on Nevada teams is \nby saying, well, it creates an unseemly situation and the potential for \nabuse. If the potential is there in Nevada, it is there across the rest \nof the country. That is what the NCAA is citing, and that is why this \nis their top legislative issue. They are saying this is important \nbecause it is starting to influence more and more sporting events and \nthat we are afraid that may happen in the future.\n  The NCAA used to be headquartered in Kansas. Until recently, it was \nheadquartered in my State.\n  We all consider ourselves to be advocates of state's rights, but in \nour eyes that means a state's authority to determine how best to govern \nwithin that state's own boundaries--not the authority to set laws that \nallow a state to impose its policies on every other state while \nexempting itself. Gambling on college sports, both legal and illegal, \nthreatens the integrity of the game--and that threat extends beyond any \none state's border.\n  This legislation will have minimal economic impact on the Nevada \ncasino industry. The NCAA has reported that sports betting makes up \nless than 1% of the total revenue by casinos in Las Vegas. The National \nGambling Impact Study Commission Report recognized that sports wagering \ndoes not ``contribute to local economies or produce many jobs or create \nother economic sectors.''\n  This is not an economic issue. It is not even a gambling issue. This \nis about the integrity of amateur athletics. It is about the integrity \nof the Olympics and whether or not there are going to continue to be \nmore and more of these point-shaving cases involved because of the \namount of money involved in the gambling and the ability to impact some \nof the athletes who are involved.\n  I want to make one other point too; that is, we are not talking about \noffice pools or ``March Madness'' and people having an office pool that \nlooks at the NCAA Final Four. Those activities we are not talking about \nat all. They go on. But we are not addressing that issue in this bill. \nWhat we are talking about is the legalized sports betting that takes \nplace in casinos in Nevada\n\n[[Page S215]]\n\nand how those large-scale bets impact on intercollegiate athletics \nacross this country.\n  Senator Leahy was on the floor earlier. And I, along with Senator \nDurbin and Tim Roemer from the House of Representatives had a press \nconference earlier today with the NCAA. At that press conference, we \nhad the gentleman who orchestrated the northwest football point-shaving \nscheme problem that they had during the decade of the 1990s. He said if \nit wasn't for the ability to place the $20,000 legal bet in Nevada, he \nwouldn't have had the system in place to be able to organize and put \nthe money out there to organize this scheme. He had a powerful \nstatement of his personal contrition and how he feels about having been \na part of that. He blames only himself. But he said the system was \nthere--and the temptation clearly is. We are trying to move collegiate \nathletics into a legal area.\n  This nation's college and university system is one of our greatest \nassets. We offer the world the model for post-secondary education. \nGambling on the outcome of college sporting events tarnishes the \nintegrity of sports and diminishes respect and regard for our colleges \nand universities. This bill removes the ambiguity that surrounds \ngambling on college sports. It sends the clear and unmistakable message \nthat it is illegal. We should not gamble with the integrity of our \ncolleges, or the future of our college athletes. Our young athletes \ndeserve legal protection from the seedy influences of the gambling \nindustry, and fans deserve to know that athletic competitions are \nhonest and fair. This legislation ensures that it will be so. I welcome \nyour support.\n  I welcome anybody in this body and the House of Representatives to \nsupport us in this effort. It is important. I fear if we don't pass \nsomething like this, you are going to see more and more of these point-\nshaving scandals come about, as you see more and more athletes having \nthe pressure they are facing with the potential for dollars occurring.\n  In the decade of the 1990s--I want to repeat this one fact because I \nthink it is so important--there were 10 illegal point-shaving cases the \nNCAA caught and prosecuted. Those were the ones caught. During the \ndecade of the 1980s, there were two; in the 1970s, one; and in the \nprior fifties and forties, one each. So we had won, one, two in the \n1980s, and then 10 in the 1990s that we know about. How many more were \nthere? Or worse still, how many more will there be in this decade of \n2000 to 2010? Let's stop that. Let's send that clear message, that \nsignal. Let's help our student athletes. Let's protect the integrity of \nthe sport.\n  I introduce this bill, and I welcome any cosponsors.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the senior senator \nfrom Kansas today to introduce legislation to ban all betting on \ncollege and high school sporting events, the High School and College \nSports Gambling Prohibition Act. The recent report of the National \nGambling Impact Study Commission recommended this ban and the National \nCollegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) strongly supports it to protect \nthe integrity of college sports across the nation. I look forward to \nworking with the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to pass our \nbipartisan legislation this year.\n  Our bipartisan bill would close a loophole in the Professional and \nAmateur Sports Protection Act of 1992. That law prohibits most sports \nbetting on amateur events but continued to grandfather some sports \ngambling activity that our bill would now prohibit in light of the \nrecent recommendations of the National Gambling Impact Study \nCommission.\n  I believe our legislation is needed to ensure the integrity of \ncollege sports across the country. Sports betting puts student athletes \nin vulnerable positions and threatens their integrity and the integrity \nof college and Olympic sports. It can devastate individuals and \ncareers. In the past decade, college sports has suffered too many \ngambling scandals involving student athletes. For example, four \nfootball players at Northwestern University pled guilty to perjury \ncharges related to gambling on their own games and, one player admitted \nto intentionally fumbling near the goal line in a 1994 game against \nIowa. Just last year, a California State University at Fullerton \nstudent was charged with point shaving after allegedly offering $1,000 \nto a player on the school's basketball team to shave points in a game \nagainst the University of the Pacific. Other sports gambling scandals \nhave rocked the football programs at Boston College and the University \nof Maryland, and the basketball programs at Arizona State University \nand Bryant College, in the 1990s.\n  Legal college sports betting undermines college sports across the \ncountry and encourages gamblers to tempt college students into gambling \nproblems and point-shaving schemes. A national ban on college and high \nschool sports betting will send a strong message to students that \nsports gambling and point shaving schemes will not be tolerated in this \ncountry, and it will help prevent these ravages.\n  In addition, the National Gambling Impact Study Commission found in \nits June 1999 report that sports wagering has serious social costs. \nIndeed, the Commission reported: ``Sports wagering threatens the \nintegrity of sports, it puts student athletes in a vulnerable position, \nit can serve as gateway behavior for adolescent gamblers, and it can \ndevastate individuals and careers.'' A national ban on amateur and \ncollege sports betting may help prevent these ravages of sports \nwagering.\n  The Commission concluded that legal sports betting spurs illegal \ngambling, finding ``legal sports wagering--especially the publication \nin the media of Las Vegas and offshore-generated point spreads--fuels a \nmuch larger amount of illegal sports wagering.'' Many newspapers \npublish point spreads on college games because wagers can be legally \nplaced on college sporting events given the loophole in current law. \nPoint spreads do not contribute to the popularity of sport; they only \ncontribute to the popularity of sports gambling.\n  As a result of all of these findings, the Commission recommended that \n``the betting on collegiate and amateur athletic events that is \ncurrently legal be banned altogether.'' I wholeheartedly agree. Closing \nthis loophole is one of the Commission's clearest recommendations, and \nit is also a step that can find a clear consensus in Congress.\n  In addition, our legislation outlaws betting on competitive games at \nthe Summer or Winter Olympics. The Olympic tradition honors sport at \nits purest level. We, in turn, should honor that proud tradition by \ncherishing the integrity of the Olympics and prohibiting gambling \nschemes on the Summer or Winter Games. There have been enough stories \nabout corruption in connection with bidding on venues for Olympic \nGames. We do not need a scandal having to do with gamblers seeking to \ninfluence the outcome of Olympic events. If we act soon, we have the \nopportunity to put this into place before the next Olympic games.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have always tried to protect the \nrights of Vermont state and local legislators to craft their laws free \nfrom interference from Washington. As a defender of states' rights, I \ncarefully considered the imposition of a total Federal ban on high \nschool and college sports. After careful thought I have come to the \nconclusion that this ban is appropriate. Congress has already \nestablished a national policy against high school and college sports \nbetting with passage of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection \nAct of 1992. Our bill closes a loophole in that law.\n  I want to make it clear that gambling on professional sports is also \na serious matter, worthy of national attention. Congress recognized \nthis fact explicitly when it passed the Professional and Amateur Sports \nProtection Act of 1992 to arrest the growth of state sponsored sports \ngambling. By focusing our legislation today on amateur sports gambling, \nwe take a first step toward resolving a fundamental problem. In \nhearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am confident that the \ncompanion subject of gambling on professional sports will be addressed.\n  Mr. President, our bipartisan bill is supported by a broad coalition \nof organizations dedicated to excellence in education and athletics.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the High School and \nCollege Sports Gambling Prohibition Act and I urge its swift passage \ninto law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter endorsing our legislation from \nmore\n\n[[Page S216]]\n\nthan 25 of these organizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 February 1, 2000.\n     Hon.

We urge the U.S. \n     Senate to pass this bill that will send a clear, no-nonsense \n     message that it is wrong to gamble on college students.\n       The proposed legislation is especially important to our \n     community because it will:\n       Eliminate the use of Nevada sports books for gain in point \n     shaving scandals.\n       Eliminate the legitimacy of publishing point spreads and \n     advertising for sports tout services.\n       ``Re-sensitize'' young people and the general public to the \n     illegal nature of gambling on collegiate sports.\n       Reduce the numbers of people who are introduced to sports \n     gambling.\n       Eliminate conflicting messages as we combat illegal sports \n     wagering that say it is okay to wager on college some places \n     but not in others.\n       We stand ready to provide support as this bill progresses \n     through the legislative process.\n         The National Collegiate Athletic Association; The \n

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Elmer \nGates as he retires from the Fuller Company of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, \nwhere he served as Chairman, President, and CEO. Mr. Gates joined the \nFuller Company as President and Chief Operating Officer in 1982 after a \nthirty-one year career with General Electric. His mission was to \nrestore Fuller Company to sustained profitability, and under his \nleadership Fuller not only accomplished this goal but became a world \nleader in the cement industry. During his tenure at Fuller, Elmer Gates \ncombined his spirit of entrepreneurship with the discipline essential \nfor long term business success.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, Elmer Gates operated under a \nbusiness philosophy that put a strong emphasis on the customer while \nmaintaining a high level of quality. He firmly believes that community \ninvolvement is crucial for businesses, and that a business leader's \nfirst responsibility to the community is to run a profitable business \nso that good jobs are available, which in turn will improve the \ncommunity.\n  Mr. Gates' career has been a model for aspiring community servants to \nfollow. He currently serves as Director of PP Resources, chairs their \nFinance Committee, and serves on their Corporate Governance Committee. \nHe also chairs the Boards of the Lehigh Valley Economic Development \nCorporation and SI Handling Systems, Inc., and was the Founding \nDirector of Ambassador Bank of the Commonwealth. In addition, Mr. Gates \nwas a member of the U.S. Export-Import Bank Advisory Committee, and was \nappointed by the State legislature and the Governor to the IMPACT \nCommission and follow-up PRIME Council, to study and make \nrecommendations for ways to reduce the cost of government while \nimproving service levels. These are but a few of the countless \ncontributions Elmer Gates has made, which have served not only his \nimmediate community, but also his State and Country.\n  Over his remarkable career, Elmer Gates has received numerous awards \nfor his contributions, including the Distinguished Citizen Award from \nthe Minsi Trail Council of Boy Scouts of America, Americanism Awards \nfrom B'nai B'rith and the U.S. Marine Corps\n\n[[Page S219]]\n\nLeague, and the Distinguished Community Leadership Award from the \nBethlehem Chamber of Commerce. I would like to join these organizations \nin recognizing the tremendous contributions of Elmer Gates, and wish \nhim continued success in all of his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/01/senate-section/article/S219-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            IN CELEBRATION OF JACK McKEON DAY IN SOUTH AMBOY\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today behalf of Jack \nMcKeon, a South Amboy native, who led the Cincinnati Reds to within one \ngame of the 1999 National League Playoffs. It is a pleasure for me to \nbe able to recognize his accomplishments.\n  During his 50 years in Major League Baseball, Jack McKeon has been \nhonored as both ``National League Manager of the Year'' and as ``Major \nLeague Manager of the Year.'' In his 26 years of major league managing \nhe has won nearly 700 games with the Kansas City Royals, Oakland \nAthletics, San Diego Padres, and Cincinnati Reds. In addition, Jack \nMcKeon has also served as General Manager, receiving the ``General \nManager of the Year'' award.\n  Before Jack began his distinguished career, he had already made an \nimpact in New Jersey. As a member of the McKeon Boys Club, Jack played \nhis first organized baseball and went on to become an all-county \ncatcher as a student at St. Mary's High School.\n  Jack's playing career spanned 10 years in the minor leagues. During \nthat time he discovered his natural ability to lead. His first pro \ncoaching assignment came at the young age of 24, in which he led his \nclub to a 70-67 record. His later success as a rookie manager of the \nKansas City Royals in 1973 brought the foundering team new respect in \nthe American League with a 2nd place finish. His later managerial and \nexecutive positions led to greater renown as he approached the 1999 \nseason. The strong finish of the Cincinnati Reds earned Jack the \nrespect of his peers and the national press which named his Manager or \nthe Year.\n  So it gives me great pleasure to recognize a leader of great stature \nin New Jersey. His tremendous accomplishments in baseball, as a player, \nmanager, and executive have made a significant contribution to the \nnational pastime. I am pleased that one of New Jersey's native sons is \nnow being honored, and I hope my colleagues join me in congratulating \nJack on his success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/01/senate-section/article/S219-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S219-S220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ON PASSING OF GEORGE ORESTIS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a \nremarkable man and cherished member of the community of Lewiston-\nAuburn, Maine who sadly passed away in December at the age of 86.\n  When I learned of the passing of George Orestis, I was stricken by \nthe news. George was quite honestly one of the finest people I have \never had the privilege to know--a remarkable man and true gentleman who \ncared deeply about the community he loved, and was a devoted leader of \nmy church, Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church of Lewiston, Maine. He \nwas one of those rare individuals who could make you feel a better \nperson just for having met him. Indeed, by always seeing the best in \npeople, he helped others to see the best in themselves--and his \ncompassion for humankind has left an indelible mark on all those whose \nhearts he touched.\n  My memories of George go back to my earliest days, and they are fond \nones. He was a wonderful and dear friend, whose generous spirit I will \nfeel fortunate to carry with me throughout my days. His loss is \nespecially difficult for all of us in Maine's Greek-American \ncommunity--his kindness and spirituality formed the heart and soul of \nour Church, and his devotion was the bedrock upon which Holy Trinity \nChurch was quite literally built.\n  As the Church's chanter for over two decades, he expressed his faith \nwith soaring eloquence and brought us all closer to God. His words \nreached out to us in a warm embrace, comforting us in our darkest days. \nGeorge was always there for us, and today we know that he is now in the \ncompany of angels, dwelling forever in the glow of God's eternal love.\n  George Bernard Shaw once said, ``Life is no brief candle to me--it is \nlike a splendid torch which I have hold of for the moment, and I want \nit to burn as brightly as possible before handing it over to the next \ngeneration.'' For 86 years, George Orestis shined as brightly as any \nmortal being could, and his is a light that will never be diminished \nfor any of us who knew and loved him. In particular, I know what a \nspecial and loving relationship he and his wife Toni shared. My \nthoughts and prayers continue to be with Toni and her entire family--my \nlove is with them always.\n  With his values and beliefs--in the way he conducted his life--George \nwas as close to God as one could ever hope to be. We will miss you, \nGeorge, more than words have the power to convey. We were so very \ngrateful to have you in our lives--now, you belong to God.\n  Mr. President, I request that the following article from the Lewiston \nSun Journal regarding the life of George Orestis be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Lewiston Sun Journal, Dec. 14, 1999]\n\n   Leader of the Bank--Friends Recall George Orestis as `A Backbone'\n\n                          (By Michael Gordon)\n\n       Auburn--George Orestis had a politician's love for the \n     microphone--but he spoke much better.\n       William Hathaway acknowledges it. He remembers the night \n     three decades ago that Orestis outshined both him and Sen. \n     Edward ``Ted'' Kennedy at the dais.\n       Hathaway had recently been elected to the U.S. House, and \n     he brought the Democratic senator from Massachusetts to \n     Lewiston for a fund-raiser to pay off some campaign debts. \n     Orestis was Hathaway's campaign treasurer.\n       All three men addressed the audience, and ``George made a \n     better speech than both of us,'' Hathaway said Monday.\n       Orestis was a natural in front of an audience, smooth, \n     charming, a skill he'd honed in the 1930s as the leader of \n     Rudy Vallee's band, the Fenton Brothers Orchestra.\n       He loved to entertain. Just as much, Orestis loved to stand \n     up and tell people's stories, to celebrate their \n     accomplishments, to sing their praises.\n       ``He remembered everything about you,'' said George \n     Simones, a lifelong friend.\n       On Monday, it was Simones, Hathaway and others who were \n     doing the talking, the remembering, about a good man and a \n     good friend.\n       On Sunday, 10 days after his 86th birthday, Orestis died at \n     Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston. His funeral will be \n     at 11 a.m. Wednesday at the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy \n     Trinity on Hogan Road in Lewiston; The Most Rev. Metropolitan \n     Mothodies of Boston will preside.\n       A son of Greek immigrants, Orestis took great pride in his \n     heritage and was ``a backbone'' of the local church, said its \n     priest, Harry Politis. Orestis led the fund drive to build \n     the church, and was its chanter for 27 years.\n       ``He was a great singer, even when he was losing his \n     hearing. He never missed a note,'' said George Simones, Jr., \n     who sang in the choir Orestis directed.\n       His service to the Orthodox church had no bounds. He served \n     on the executive councils of both the National Archdiocese \n     and the New England Archdiocese. Twice he was awarded the \n     Cross of St. Andrew.\n       The poor and handicapped knew his kindness. Orestis \n     established the area's first Good Will store. As a Kiwanian, \n     he led the organization's effort to help the mentally \n     retarded.\n       ``George had a great respect for every human being,'' \n     Politis said. ``He was able to confront every situation. He \n     had a very realistic point of view.''\n       ``Whatever life dealt, he would say those are the \n     circumstances,'' said Orestis' nephew, George. He was named \n     for his uncle.\n       ``That's kind of a Greek expression,'' he said. ``When \n     things are not going so well, you sort of say, `Well, \n     circumstances.' and get on with it.''\n       ``He'd break into song, he'd tell jokes; he was very \n     personable. I think what was responsible for all the \n     affection others had for him was he was so approachable,'' \n     his nephew said.\n       Born in Nashua, N.H., Orestis grew up in Lewiston and went \n     to school there.\n       Simmons remembers him as a leader even then among the boys \n     of the Greek neighborhood.\n       Orestis attended Bates College, and studied composing, \n     conducting and arranging with Rupert Neily of Portland. In \n     1929, he landed the job leading the Fenton Brothers \n     Orchestra. It turned into a 12-year gig. At one point, \n     Simones said, the band made the top 10 in the ``Lucky Strike \n     Parade.''\n       When America went to war, Orestis joined the U.S. Army. \n     Commissioned as a second lieutenant, he was assigned to the \n     medical corps.\n       When the fighting was over, he came home, not to the sound \n     of waltzes but of washing machines. He ran the family's \n     laundry business, American Linen, from 1947 to 1961.\n       When I think of my uncle, I think of the four brothers in \n     the laundry, how a small immigrant family took a business and \n     made it a big success. That's the sort of thing Uncle George \n     would do,'' his nephew said. He said\n\n[[Page S220]]\n\n     the family sold the company in the mid-1960s.\n       In 1962, Orestis married Antoinette ``Toni'' Marois. They \n     later became the owners of her family's restaurant on Lisbon \n     Street.\n       On Monday night, Simmons held a Christmas party there for \n     his own employees. He wanted to reschedule, out of respect \n     for the Orestis family, but he said Toni Orestis insisted it \n     be held.\n       ``She said, `George would always say, the show must go on.' \n     And she's right,'' he said.\n       Now living in McLean, Va., Hathaway was a lawyer in \n     Lewiston when he met Orestis around 1953. Hathaway lived on \n     Webster Avenue and sent his laundry to American Linen. He and \n     Orestis would meet for lunch.\n       When the lawyer decided to run for Congress, Orestis \n     offered his help.\n       ``I don't think George was too much for politics,'' Simones \n     recalled. Hathaway agreed. But he capitalized on his friend's \n     skill as an orator. He said Orestis could give a five-minute \n     impromptu speech better than most people who prepared one. \n     Orestis later used that talent in helping his nephew, John, \n     get elected as the mayor of Lewiston.\n       In 1975, Gov. James Longley, also a Lewiston native, \n     appointed George Orestis as the first director of the Maine \n     State Lottery. He served for four years.\n       Orestis never liked gambling, Simones noted. Smiling, he \n     said his friend ``always wanted the sure thing.\n       To his many friends, Orestis was a sure thing.\n       ``Anything you wanted, he was there,'' Simones said. \n     ``There isn't enough you could do for George. He's one in a \n     million.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/01/senate-section/article/S220-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ON THE SERVICE OF RED WOOD TO SULLIVAN'S ISLAND\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize my \nfriend William J. ``Red'' Wood who, since 1948, has been making \nSullivan's Island, SC a better place to live and work. He came to the \nisland, married, bought a home and raised six children, all the while \ngiving back to a community that he deeply loves.\n  Red Wood's decades of service to Sullivan's Island make him one of \nthe town's most valuable resources. It is only fitting that the \nMoultrie News recently recognized his achievements. Red has never \nhesitated to get involved. He joined the volunteer fire department \nduring his early years on the island and helped to organize the Island \nClub, which sponsored the local Boy Scout troop. Red also helped start \nthe island's Little League program and served on the township's \nrecreation committee.\n  He has served on the town council for five terms and, during his \nfirst term, held the building inspector's post. In that capacity, he \nworked on several significant projects including East Cooper Hospital \nand the first hotel built in Mount Pleasant, SC. He believes his \ngreatest civic achievement, however, is having a hand in incorporating \nSullivan's Island.\n  Red worked for over 30 years in the engineering department of the \nCharleston Naval Shipyard and has devoted his time to numerous \ncommitments on Sullivan's Island, his wife Monica and their children.\n  My wife, Peatsy, and I salute all of Red's accomplishments and his \ncontinuing service to Sullivan's Island. We wish him many peaceful days \nof fishing and shrimping. He certainly deserves them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/01/senate-section/article/S220-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN RECOGNITION OF CULLMAN COUNTY\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the work \nof the Cullman County Commission in Cullman County, Alabama, for its \npositive work in the community. I specifically want to pay tribute to \nMr. George Spear, the Commission Chairman, as an individual who \nexemplifies the positive impact a public official can have on a \ncommunity. Through his direct efforts, Mr. Spear has established the \nCullman 2000 Committee, a year-long celebration bringing together both \nyoung and old in the area to honor the county's unique heritage and \nshared future.\n  Founded in 1873 by Col. John G. Cullmann, the county's roots are \nfirmly entrenched in Alabama history. Cullman County is well known for \nits industry, modern health care, and agriculture production, which \nranks at the top of the state. The many events planned throughout the \nyear are designed to celebrate the county's history and successes and \nto give residents a sense of pride in their community and the common \nbond they share as members of the county. It will give all residents of \nCullman County a sense of their place in county history.\n  I commend the Cullman County Commission and particularly Mr. Spear \nfor his hard work and sense of civic pride. Without the efforts of the \nCommission, the Cullman 2000 Committee would not have been possible. As \nCullman County looks toward the future, it is reassuring to know that \nthe leaders of the county are keeping in mind the importance of the \ncounty's colorful past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/01/senate-section/article/S220-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    APPOINTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL REPRESENTATIVES TO INDUSTRY SECTOR \n                          ADVISORY COMMITTEES\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \ndisappointment at the administration's decision to appeal the Federal \nDistrict Court decision that requires the appointment of environmental \nrepresentatives to the advisory committees, the ISACs, that advise the \nCommerce Department and USTR on trade policy with respect to forest \nproducts.\n  At the recent WTO meeting in Seattle, President Clinton reminded all \nof us of the importance of making the trade policy process more open \nand transparent. I share the view that incorporating environmental and \nlabor concerns into our trade policy is a necessary element in ensuring \nconfidence in the global trading system. The need for openness and \ntransparency is not only for international negotiations and dispute \nresolution, but also for the establishment of trade policy here at \nhome. Indeed, the Clinton administration has been the principal \nadvocate of this.\n  It is, therefore, surprising and disappointing that the \nadministration seems reluctant to bring more openness and transparency \ninto its own trade policy advisory committees. Specifically, in the \ncase of the administration's proposals to reduce or eliminate tariffs \non forest products (a goal that I share), environmental groups have \nraised legitimate issues about the impact on conservation. This should \nbe part of our domestic debate.\n  I understand that enhancing the role of environmental and other \ngroups in this advisory process raises some concerns at USTR and the \nCommerce Department. We don't want to make the process inefficient, and \nwe must continue to protect confidential information. But, to my mind, \nwe can increase openness and transparency without compromising \nefficiency or confidentiality.\n  I call on the administration to reconsider its policy and take the \nnecessary measures to incorporate fully those who are trying to express \nlegitimate environmental concerns.\n  Finally, let me be clear. If the decision by the Western District of \nWashington is overturned on appeal, I will introduce legislation \nmandating the appointment of representatives of the environmental \ncommunity to these two advisory committees.\n  At this critical time when concerns over globalization threaten the \nconsensus for expanding global trade, we must increase public \nconfidence in government. That means more openness and transparency, \nnot less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/01/senate-section/article/S220-4", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S220-S221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF JOHN S.

Mr. Brouse, President and \nCEO of Highmark, Inc. will be honored for his professional \naccomplishments, concern and commitment to his community.\n  As President and CEO of Highmark, Inc., John Brouse is responsible \nfor the day-to-day business operations of a health insurance \ncorporation that exceeds $7.5 billion in annual revenues and has more \nthat 18 million customers nationwide. Mr. Brouse was the architect of \nHighmark's national business strategy for dental and vision programs, \nand has had a tremendous impact on the success of the corporation. \nPrior to becoming President of Highmark, Mr. Brouse served as Senior \nVice President and Chief Operating Officer for Pennsylvania Blue \nShield, where he was responsible for the administration and overall \noperations of the organization.\n  In addition to his successful career achievements, John Brouse has \nalways\n\n[[Page S221]]\n\nmaintained a commitment to serving his community.

Mr. Brouse serves on numerous other \nbusiness, civic and cultural boards including the Greater Pittsburgh \nChamber of Commerce, the Western Pennsylvania Caring Foundation for \nChildren, and the Advisory Committee for the Caring Place.\n  Over his remarkable career, John Brouse has shown in countless ways \nthat he is deserving of the Anti-defamation League's American Heritage \nAward.

LOUIS RAMS\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the two \nIowans who led the St. Louis Rams to victory in Sunday's Super Bowl. \nQuarterback Kurt Warner, a native of Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Offensive \nLineman Adam Timmerman, a native of Cherokee, Iowa. It is a bittersweet \nirony that a third Iowa native, injured Quarterback Trent Green, \ncouldn't play this season and so Kurt Warner stepped in to the \nposition.\n  Nobody--I mean nobody--could have predicted that Kurt Warner would be \nholding the Super Bowl trophy under the Georgia Dome last Sunday. Not \nKurt Warner who was stocking the shelves of the Hy-Vee Market in Cedar \nFalls, Iowa a few years ago. Not Kurt Warner who was bypassed by the \nNFL draft out of college and went straight to the Iowa Barnstormers and \nthen the Amsterdam Admirals. And certainly not the Kurt Warner who \nwarmed the bench at the University of Northern Iowa.\n  This is a true American success story. An Iowa boy comes from the \nbench to Super Bowl 2000 where he sets a Super Bowl record for passing \nyards--414 yards in all, topping Joe Montana's 1989 Super Bowl record \nof 357 yards. It doesn't get much better than that!\n  And Kurt Warner had help from another Iowa boy, Adam Timmerman, the \nRams offensive lineman, a native of Cherokee, Iowa. Timmerman and the \nRams offensive line held the Titans to one sack in the entire game, \nallowing Warner time to complete the passes that won him his Super Bowl \nrecord.\n  You know, I am sure many of you have heard me talk about the ladder \nof opportunity, about leaving the ladder down so others can climb up. \nWell, Kurt Warner built his own ladder of opportunity, sticking with it \nat every turn, persevering against odds that would sink a weaker man. \nIt is great to see him at the top.\n  Iowa is proud of its native sons and daughters. For the past several \nmonths, Iowa has been in the public eye because of the caucuses. And \nnow that the Iowa caucuses are behind us, Iowans are proud to share the \nspotlight with homegrown heroes Kurt Warner and Adam Timmerman. I know \nwe all wish Kurt and Adam good luck in this Sunday's Pro Bowl in \nHonolulu.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/01/senate-section/article/S221-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ELIAN GONZALEZ\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there are few, if any, who haven't \nbeen moved by the triumphant story of Elian Gonzalez, a brave young boy \nfound clinging to a raft on Thanksgiving Day. Elian endured a harrowing \njourney from Cuba to Florida, after his mother was lost at sea.\n  Now, Elian finds himself in the center of an international tug-of-\nwar. Both sides are entrenched in an emotional debate, that centers \nmore around the Castro regime than it does around the young boy.\n  No matter how hard it may be, for Elian's sake, politics must be \ntaken out of the equation. The Immigration and Naturalization Service \nhas made its ruling, that Elian father's has the authority to speak for \nhis son. His father, Juan Gonzalez, has asked that applications for \nadmission and asylum for Elian be withdrawn.\n  Congress should not ignore the bond between father and child, and the \nresponsibility a father has for his son, regardless of where they \nreside.\n  People with a legal interest in the matter may test the INS order in \nCourt. Congress should not undermine the Court proceedings, and in the \nprocess, possibly trample on the family values we so often claim to \nhonor.\n  Elian's extended relatives in Miami filed their lawsuit in federal \ncourt to block the child's return, and any action by Congress to bypass \nthe Court on this matter is inappropriate. The Court will hopefully \nanalyze the facts and decide Elian's future based on his interests, not \nheated debate or political rigidity. This is an issue that deserves an \nappropriate forum, one away from politics, where Elian's future can be \nbased on the rules of law that this country has held out to the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/01/senate-section/article/S221-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S221-S222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

This report meets the requirements for \nSenate scorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First \nConcurrent Resolution on the Budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough January 27, 2000. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, \nand revenues are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions \nof the 2000 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 68). The \nbudget resolution figures incorporate revisions submitted to the Senate \nto reflect funding for emergency requirements, disability reviews, \nadoption assistance, the earned income tax credit initiative, and \narrearages for international organizations, peacekeeping, and \nmultilateral banks.\n  The estimates show that current level spending is above the budget \nresolution by $10.3 billion in budget authority and below the budget \nresolution by $2.3 billion in outlays. Current level is $17.8 billion \nabove the revenue floor in 2000. The current estimate of the deficit \nfor purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $20.6 \nbillion, which is $5.7 billion below the maximum deficit amount for \n2000 of $26.3 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated September 28, 1999, the Congress has \npassed and the President has signed the following acts: Veterans, HUD \nand Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000 (P.L. 106-74), \nAgriculture and Rural Development Appropriations Act, 2000 (P.L. 106-\n78), Defense Appropriations Act, 2000 (P.L. 106-79), Gramm-Leach-Bliley \nAct (P.L. 106-102), an Act Making Consolidated Appropriations for FY \n2000 (P.L. 106-113), Veterans' Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act \n(P.L. 106-117), an act to convey property in Sisters, Oregon (P.L. 106-\n144), an act to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint various \ncommemorative coins (P.L. 106-126), Foster Care Independence Act of \n1999 (P.L. 106-169), and Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement \nAct of 1999 (P.L. 106-170).

In addition, full-year funding estimates\n  under current law are included for entitlement and mandatory programs\n  requiring annual appropriations even if the appropriations have not\n  been made. The current level of debt subject to limit reflects the\n  latest information from the U.S. Treasury.\n\\2\\ Section 314 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended,\n  requires the deficit in the budget resolution to be changed to reflect\n  increases in outlays as the result of funding for specific actions\n  (emergency requirements, disability reviews, adoption assistance, the\n  earned income tax credit initiative, and arrearages for international\n  organizations, peacekeeping, and multilateral banks). Sec. 211 of the\n  Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2000 (H. Con. Res.\n  68) allows for a decrease in revenues by an amount equal to the on-\n  budget surplus on July 1, 1999, as estimated by CBO, but does not\n  allow an equal adjustment to the deficit. Therefore, the deficit\n  number for the budget resolution shown above reflects only the outlay\n  increases made to the budget resolution between May 19, 1999, and\n  November 1, 1999.\n\\3\\ Less than $50 million.\n \nSource: Congressional Budget Office.\n\n\n   TABLE 2.--SUPPORTING DETAIL FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2000 ON-BUDGET SENATE CURRENT LEVEL REPORT, AS OF CLOSE OF\n
